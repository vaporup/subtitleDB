1
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721
The guys we meet...

2
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,193
are ruthless

3
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,195
They know our dot. com is going
to be a big hit

4
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,761
They want to get it

5
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,296
Remember to keep a high profile

6
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,367
What do you mean?

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,268
Be cool

8
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,369
We don't need answer what they ask?

9
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,209
I won't sign any deal
less than $10 billion

10
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,439
No kidding

11
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,509
Sooner or later
we'll have that much of money

12
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,676
But we don't have it now. Brother

13
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,221
Any new plan in mind? Tell me

14
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,655
Did you feel my punch down there

15
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,523
- I was about to beat this level
- Really?

16
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,199
Hey!... Pass the bridge...
tidy up yourself...

17
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,674
We want to go...

18
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,800
to a restaurant "Green Leaf"
in China Town

19
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,235
Which restaurant?

20
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,507
My son works there,
he makes a lot of money

21
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,345
Do you have the address?
On what street?

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,545
I don't have the address with me.
No address

23
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,347
English...

24
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,354
We are Taiwanese, we don't know English

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,554
China Town,

26
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,198
a restaurant named, Green Leaf

27
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,557
They're Taiwanese and

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,726
want to go to Green Leaf Restaurant
in China Town

29
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,365
Green Leaf Restaurant?

30
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,268
I heard of it...

31
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,807
China Town, well... Yeah...

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,244
Okay, let's go

33
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,320
Thanks ...

34
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:46,816
Sorry

35
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,826
Bob, you're happy too early.
It's not firm yet

36
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,013
Why did you turn down the deal?

37
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,688
To do business is just like
chasing after girls

38
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,293
When she says no, that means maybe

39
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,759
When she says maybe, that means okay

40
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,658
Okay means to take off your clothes fast.
Come on

41
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,323
You knew how it plays, right?

42
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,368
You've so many women around you

43
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,366
I never bring women home

44
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,471
Why?

45
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,969
Just like acquisition of a company

46
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,744
Women will bring
in their cooking utensils, clothes...

47
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,707
What can I do?

48
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,870
Too much pressure

49
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,415
That's right. Once they come,
they'll bother you all the time

50
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,711
Invade your privacy and ruin your life

51
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,013
No more sexual fantasy. Impossible!

52
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,850
No way! No...

53
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,651
Finished

54
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,559
Don't worry!

55
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,982
Yes, take it easy

56
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,394
Why?

57
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,479
Pay the fare

58
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,732
That's so easy

59
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,736
Isn't it normal?
Genius like you must win the game

60
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,402
It's lucky that
you didn't break the computer

61
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,241
Come on... Stop playing

62
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,915
Come on... Drink some

63
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,884
Be a good boy.
Give me some great ideas...

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,352
...to be proposed at next meeting

65
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,314
Wow, once it's signed,
we can easily get the $10 billion

66
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,519
Give me some more time

67
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,823
Cool, man. Look

68
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,330
See anything?
This place is filled with inspirations

69
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,797
Smell it?

70
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,406
Don't worry.
If you're hungry, I'll get you some food

71
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,032
If you want woman, I'll get you one

72
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,377
If you want man, I'll be at your service

73
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,502
Okay, I'm going to buy some food

74
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,009
Will be back. Don't go out

75
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,514
Mike, do you know why I brought you here

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,028
You completed your first...

77
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,891
search engine at this place

78
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,762
Give me another mind-boggling idea!

79
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,509
Please don't go

80
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,875
I'll get you some shark fin soups
and abalone

81
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,609
I'll be back soon

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ellen

83
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,696
Your son Scott is really something

84
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,355
He's a genius

85
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,725
What are you doing?

86
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,863
I want to marry your son

87
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,495
Don't be silly!
My son is only ten years old

88
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,701
Mom

89
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,001
Yeah?

90
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,736
I found something
inside uncle Wong's car

91
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,012
Scott

92
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,776
Listen up. Scott...

93
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,460
Mike, I can't find
any shark fin or abalone

94
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,628
How about having a hot dog and Sandra Ng

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,092
Mike...

96
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,996
Mike

97
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,180
Dance one more time

98
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,777
Your son is really something.
Amazing. Look at him!

99
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:47,747
What did you found in the car?

100
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,819
Quick, come here, watch him

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Sunny Boy

102
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,623
Aunt Chiu

103
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,268
Mel G

104
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,240
What are they playing?

105
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,646
Tell me! What is it?

106
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,748
He found this

107
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,247
Scott

108
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,677
Look like it?

109
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,116
You'd better stop. Let's go!

110
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,025
Come! Stop...

111
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Aunt Chiu, check the engine for me

112
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,097
It's slower than the cable car...

113
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,293
driving on California Street

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,800
Mel G. One more time

115
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,176
See, this is the best size-big

116
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,748
You're big! You're bigger

117
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,720
You're bad! It's sick!

118
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,356
Hey, stop! Don't take it...

119
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,065
Mom, you hate to see me
playing the vibrator?

120
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,199
Of course!

121
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,173
Mothers don't like their children
playing this kind of game

122
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,208
Also, don't copy whatever they teach you

123
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,314
Understand?

124
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,707
Mom, I taught them

125
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,183
Oh! Really?

126
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,915
Mouster is here too!

127
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,853
Tina said it's normal to have a vibrator

128
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,155
Every woman has one in her drawer

129
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,687
Don't you dare look at my drawer?

130
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:40,929
Okay

131
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,803
Take your meal, I'm just kidding

132
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,211
Scott, no...

133
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,238
You chicky monster!

134
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,184
Hey, Baby, come meet me

135
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,149
Where are you?

136
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,185
Friday Night, come and have a drink

137
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,381
I met...

138
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,123
a Hugh Grant here

139
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,158
I'm not going

140
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,124
I've saved...

141
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,127
you a Richard Gere, salt and pepper hair

142
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,962
You keep him for yourself

143
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,097
- Mom, you aren't going out?
- No

144
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,905
Remember to brush your teeth
before sleep

145
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,078
Hello?

146
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,184
Ellen

147
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:35,851
What's going on?

148
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,257
Hugh Grant left...

149
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,155
with a Spanish girl!

150
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:42,857
How about your Richard Gere?

151
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,360
I want a friend now, not a man

152
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,390
No way

153
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,397
Yes

154
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,058
How come?

155
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,227
Come and keep me company

156
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,932
It's too late. I'm not going

157
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,072
Ellen, I want you!

158
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,273
Can you just enjoy yourself?

159
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,879
I threw up 3 times, Ellen

160
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,379
Uh?

161
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,212
Ellen, I'm feeling bad

162
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,422
Come, please

163
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,362
Alright...

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Richard Gere?

165
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:56,963
Thank you

166
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,881
Me too. Come...

167
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,184
I don't want to play

168
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:21,918
Come on

169
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,925
Okay

170
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,330
What? What is it?

171
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,943
Can I quit?

172
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,504
One second...

173
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,327
Okay...

174
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,075
Okay, what's your name?

175
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,442
Ellen

176
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,972
I'm Mike

177
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,442
We create a fantastic San Francisco.
Okay?

178
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,203
I've told you, you did it!

179
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,432
Help me out

180
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,155
I get off work

181
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,057
What do you want to do with my car?

182
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,628
What you want?

183
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:16,824
Wait

184
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,005
Alright. Pretty!

185
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,270
Why'd you piss on it if it's pretty?

186
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,481
It's a beautiful painting.
Come closer to have a better look

187
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,579
Really?

188
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,121
What is it?

189
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,718
Sausalito

190
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,519
Sausalito?

191
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,328
How do you know?

192
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,254
It's Sausalito

193
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,228
Really?

194
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,562
I don't think so

195
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,438
I paint it. I say it is

196
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,302
- You paint it?
- Yes!

197
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,767
A great scenery,
like Sai Kung in Hong Kong?

198
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,137
You live there?

199
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,476
I can't afford it

200
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,546
Just kidding. Don't get too serious

201
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,522
Right?

202
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,048
I don't really know you

203
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,799
My home is not a good place

204
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,273
So is mine

205
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:48,620
Please, don't stare at me

206
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,423
No... the other side

207
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,624
A little bit more...

208
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,979
Keep still!

209
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:22,820
Good morning!

210
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,855
Morning!

211
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,854
Have you seen my shoe?

212
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,860
No

213
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,756
No? Impossible

214
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,461
Where is it?

215
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,333
Just buy another pair

216
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,197
No! This one...

217
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,204
Forget it! Go...

218
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,505
Back...

219
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,579
Alright

220
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,345
Where are you going?

221
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,443
303 Central Street

222
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,771
Mike, your favorite curry chicken

223
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,714
It can go with bread or corns

224
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,445
Enough for several days

225
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,889
If you've time to have a nice dinner
at our restaurant

226
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,591
You pan is badly burnt

227
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,562
You ignore me!

228
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,902
I'm trying to be nice to you,
to cook for you!

229
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,012
You don't care at all!
Can you say a word?

230
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,421
I am only your landlord

231
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,488
You're very sick!

232
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,588
Your muscle is really tight

233
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,566
Bob called the restaurant
to look for you

234
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,711
Did he make trouble at your restaurant?

235
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,577
He dares not,
but he scared my honey though

236
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,647
He's insane

237
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,786
But when he goes nuts,
he scares us stiff

238
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,759
Actually, why you're hiding from him?

239
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,353
I'm not

240
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:50,661
I just want to take a break, can't I?

241
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,063
Scrape for a few more times

242
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,839
San Francisco is humid

243
00:22:54,973 --> 00:23:00,434
If you don't scrape your back well,
you'll have rheumatism

244
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,905
You nag all day long!

245
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,346
Last month it's on the 5th
it should be on the 8th this month

246
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,648
Should be okay

247
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,988
Mom, where did you go last night?

248
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,596
I came to this place

249
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,093
Don't lie to me!

250
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,993
It's bad for mommy to lie

251
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,470
Mom, I am not coming home next Saturday

252
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,697
Try to scare me

253
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,733
I'll go to Foster...

254
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,742
with Charles' family. Okay?

255
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,305
You go with Charles

256
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,845
or his sister?

257
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,916
Let's go to work

258
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,814
Wow, you've many scratches on your back

259
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,686
Did it last night?

260
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes

261
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,619
Where?

262
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,499
Sausalito

263
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,398
Mom

264
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,536
When will we move to Sausalito?

265
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,404
Soon. Very soon

266
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,805
Scott, do you want to have a dog?

267
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,979
But you can't take it home

268
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,956
For couple times?

269
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,519
Yes

270
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:27,760
With a woman?

271
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,399
Of course!

272
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,094
It eases my worry

273
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,596
Mike, it's about time

274
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,636
So, what's her name?

275
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,576
Mom, what should I call it?

276
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,785
Call it Mike

277
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,920
Let's go home

278
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,092
Did you fight with Charles?

279
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:29,825
Really?

280
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,860
Don't stay up too late

281
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,958
I'd know

282
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:38,694
I'm home

283
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,220
Hello

284
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,062
Tina, you still at home?

285
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,598
Not feeling well. Not going anywhere

286
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,566
Really?

287
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,099
Sick on Saturday night of all nights

288
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,763
Get some rest, don't go out

289
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,049
That's fast

290
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,249
What do you mean?

291
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,877
With that guy

292
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,350
Why not?

293
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,062
Except banning indoors smoking,

294
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,323
San Francisco is a great place

295
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,126
If you follow the rules of the game,

296
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,202
you'll have fun

297
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,671
What's the rules of the game?

298
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,965
Take it easy

299
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,304
Relax! Don't make other people
and yourself unhappy

300
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,473
Want to be serious, then go ahead.
Get it?

301
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,842
You came all the way...

302
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,453
to tell me to take it easy?

303
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:51,987
We're friends

304
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,192
If that guy was tough and

305
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,021
took three hours,

306
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,820
you would be here waiting for me

307
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,126
Waiting for a woman
who had a one-night-stand with you

308
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,335
Tell her to take it easy

309
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,863
What a caring man!

310
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,834
Does it mean take it easy?

311
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,142
Forget about last time.
Let's start all over again, okay?

312
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,514
Not in the car this time

313
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,144
Wait

314
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,848
Why you keep looking at me?

315
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,080
Can't I?

316
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,220
I've pressure

317
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,961
Mike? You can't fool me.
I've been looking for you

318
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:08,996
Please return my call

319
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,397
I know you're at home.
I'll come to get you!

320
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,834
Come see me at once. Mike...

321
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,017
I was in college at that time

322
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,286
Except chatting up with women at bar,
I know nothing

323
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:38,418
When I came here,
I completed a search engine programme

324
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,163
And bankers started to visit me. They
supported me in launching my own startup

325
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,438
The first miracle in my life began

326
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,240
At that time, I found earning money easy

327
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:01,612
I devoted myself to my work

328
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,356
But then...

329
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,362
I thought I'm a step ahead

330
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,155
Others are 3 steps ahead of me

331
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,332
I got a lot of pressure

332
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,936
It doesn't matter, Mike

333
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,004
Just quit!
You don't need to fabricate story, okay?

334
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,592
Is it really your home?

335
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,386
Does it make a difference?

336
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,360
You just sounded like a rich man
impossible to live at this kind of place

337
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,332
I came here at the age of 14

338
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,067
I hung out in Chinatown...

339
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,036
...and followed the orders
of the triad boss here

340
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,545
Do you remember the case
of Golden Dragon Restaurant?

341
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,512
Yes. Many people got killed

342
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,514
I was there

343
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,640
Really?

344
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,153
Yes

345
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:14,090
That's why the FBI is tracking me down

346
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,586
No wonder you don't want me
to took at you

347
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,099
That's right

348
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,092
You're better off not to know too much

349
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,770
Hi, are you looking for Mike?

350
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,543
I want to give him something

351
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,778
But he hasn't got up this early

352
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,112
Can I pass it to him?

353
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,455
Alright. Thanks

354
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,395
Sorry, you're his friend?

355
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,133
Come in to have a seat?
Just get him out of the bed

356
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,797
That's okay. I've to go to work. Bye

357
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,368
Sorry, what's your name?

358
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,101
Ellen

359
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,644
Ellen

360
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,411
Goodbye

361
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,308
No bad!

362
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,188
Good morning

363
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:03,725
Morning

364
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,419
My dear. How are you?

365
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,858
Your car has been fixed. I drove it back

366
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:07,824
Thanks

367
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,764
Mike

368
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,658
I know it's none of my business,

369
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,793
but are you serious with her?

370
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,771
The millennium has passed,
why did you buy so many stuffs?

371
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,638
To stock up for the new year?

372
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,544
Two frying pans?

373
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,282
I only bought one
Another was from Ellen

374
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,383
Which one you want me to use?

375
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,820
This girl is very caring

376
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,463
Toothbrush, toothpaste, and towel!

377
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,824
I forget to buy them

378
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,165
Wow... there're more

379
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,735
Whose bag is this? Yours?

380
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,497
This is mine. And that bag is hers

381
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,275
What are you doing? Mike!

382
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,897
Can you give me a minute?

383
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,404
Sorry, please wait for a second?

384
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:27,609
What's up?

385
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,677
You forgot your stuffs

386
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,472
I bought them on my way. It's for you

387
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,251
Don't eat too much can food.
It's bad for your health

388
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,320
I don't like people leaving
their stuffs at my house

389
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,820
It's nothing. After you eat it,

390
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:40,651
nothing is left at your house

391
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,850
How can I eat up the towel,
toothpaste, and pan?

392
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,488
You told me to take it easy, right?

393
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:48,958
Okay, I pay you the money

394
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,759
Pay me back?

395
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,601
You pay me for the small things
I bought for you!

396
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,705
Then...

397
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,104
...should I pay you
for what you did last night?

398
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,538
Okay...

399
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,573
How can you do this to me?

400
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,678
Alright, I'll pay you next time, okay?

401
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:02,836
It's my purchase, okay?

402
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,644
Forget it. Give me back!

403
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,242
Stop...

404
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,885
- Who are they?
- Triad gangsters

405
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,348
Stop! Mike...

406
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,858
Ellen, Sunny Boy's on his way
with Scott to meet you for lunch

407
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:23,857
Copy

408
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:24,729
Where are you?

409
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,961
Tina, call our guys to come and help!

410
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:27,894
Help!

411
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,495
Hurry up!

412
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,504
You give me the $10 billion?

413
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,741
$10 billion...

414
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,543
Are you able to pay me the money?

415
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,548
You bastard!

416
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,718
Why you're hitting him? Stop...

417
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,859
Stop!

418
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,292
Hey... stop...

419
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,834
Stop!

420
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,636
How dare you hit my mom? Want to die?

421
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,333
Kid, you don't move! Stop!

422
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,578
Ellen, what happened?

423
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,340
Triad gangsters!

424
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,405
What gangsters? Bullshit!

425
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,846
Who are the triads? You? Triad!

426
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,009
Come here if you've gut...

427
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,484
Mike, come over here!

428
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,756
Show her my card

429
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,561
This is my name card

430
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,973
I'm not in the triad, he isn't too

431
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,776
He's my cousin

432
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,648
I'm just kidding last night

433
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,446
- Didn't imagine you would be...
- Serious, right?

434
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,077
This is me

435
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,718
Let's go!

436
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,459
It's fine. Get back to work

437
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,104
Mike, I've an appointment with C&G...

438
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,433
I don't want to sell!

439
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,883
Why don't you call me
to go out to have fun?

440
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:02,657
You look just like the time

441
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,956
when your husband divorced you

442
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,030
Sorry

443
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,031
Something in your mind?

444
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,966
You did it better in high school

445
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,579
Dessert?

446
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,547
I don't want to nag you

447
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,190
But you can't be unrestrained
all your life

448
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,894
When you realize

449
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,054
you can't put it down...

450
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,831
Then hold on to it

451
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,695
I experienced that in the past

452
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,165
Not too bad though.
At least I've someone with me now

453
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,608
It makes your life easier...

454
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,746
...if you can pull out every time

455
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,075
You'll enjoy yourself more
the next time

456
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,479
When you find that hon can't put it down
you gotta face it

457
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,953
Seriously, every woman needs...

458
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,492
...a warmer

459
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,763
It's true! It's not a bad idea to use
men warming up our feet in winter

460
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,201
You haven't tried it?

461
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,238
Mike

462
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,979
If you can't put it down,
don't force yourself,

463
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:30,977
you know

464
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,244
My boy!

465
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,647
Ellen...

466
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,052
Copy

467
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,949
Some one has called for you

468
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:16,784
Where?

469
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,791
Castro

470
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,860
Copy that

471
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,878
Hi, my landlord wants to invite you
for dinner. Would you come?

472
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,046
I'm sorry. I've to work

473
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,785
What are you doing?

474
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,688
I'm not for delivery

475
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,625
You care only about yourself.
I can't do that!

476
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,165
Sorry

477
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,006
Sorry

478
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:13,813
You're the first woman in my life

479
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,782
I said the most "sorry"

480
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,715
It's a simple dinner

481
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,320
And you can leave anytime

482
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,290
Let me introduce you...

483
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,258
to my landlord, Robert

484
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,760
- Hi
- Hello

485
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:32,799
Ellen, right?

486
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,561
Yes

487
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:34,863
We met before

488
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,703
My dear, Ellen is here

489
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,366
Come to say hello

490
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,672
My honey is a good chef

491
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,379
I'm sorry to bother your wife

492
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,109
I don't have a wife

493
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,313
Don is my husband. I'm his wife

494
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,917
Hello, nice to meet you

495
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:56,923
Hello

496
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,957
Mike, go to help Don

497
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,090
I'll keep Ellen company

498
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:10,068
When Mike was 14,
he moved here with his parents

499
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,774
They rented their first house from me

500
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,774
But his parents died not long after

501
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,707
Then, Mike stayed with me.
I bought him up

502
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,981
He's quite a good boy.
When he has time, he comes to see me

503
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,780
He earned his way to college

504
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,188
Don't worry.
I never make advances to him

505
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,295
I've treated him like my own son

506
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,193
You know we're gay

507
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,200
How can we teach him to be a real man?

508
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,938
That's why he's not
too serious about life

509
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,364
I don't know how to teach my son, either

510
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,041
Sometimes, I feel he's stronger than me

511
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,201
Really?

512
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,246
Okay

513
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:56,112
Let's cheers for two unqualified mothers

514
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,351
Sometimes Mike is wrong

515
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,355
But he's no bad intention

516
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,361
Sometimes,

517
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,824
he hurts people without knowing it

518
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,462
I'm fine. Don't worry

519
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,197
But he isn't fine

520
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,365
You're the first woman

521
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,807
he's willing to bring home

522
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,180
Never mind,

523
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,680
who knows what will happen next

524
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,010
Cheers!

525
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,990
Ellen, try Mike's cooking

526
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,857
Mike is good at two things

527
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,292
One is barbecue chicken

528
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,163
The other is burned the pan

529
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,234
You've talked too much. I know I'm bad

530
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,202
Give me a piece of pork!

531
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,040
Good

532
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:58,379
A toast to mike's chicken
and self-criticism

533
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,085
I don't mean to keep quiet,
but I've nothing to say

534
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,218
No way! You must say something

535
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,930
Or, drink up

536
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,990
Don't force her. She has nothing to say

537
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,457
What?

538
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,538
Ellen doesn't look like a taxi driver

539
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:24,966
Why you chose this job?

540
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,364
Alright

541
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,745
First, my old classmate Tina...

542
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,472
operates a taxi rental business

543
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:33,471
Second...

544
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,917
I can't think of any other job

545
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,180
that can earn money
with your back facing customers

546
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,088
Third,

547
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,425
I can look at handsome guys
from my mirror

548
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,050
Is that good enough?

549
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,054
Yeah!

550
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,323
Let me share with you my new plan

551
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,397
Great!

552
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,393
I plan to design a global community,
a nation-state on the Internet

553
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,765
I'm the president there

554
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,371
People of different nationalities...

555
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,498
can be naturalized to be the citizens

556
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,471
It's just like

557
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,345
the real life...

558
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:04,913
...with everything available

559
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,180
It has a bar,
and you two can be the bosses

560
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,152
You can install a view camera...

561
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,018
...to see the faces of each other

562
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,921
Everyone can see what you're doing

563
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,791
You can listen to music together

564
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:20,952
This jazz music is created

565
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,964
by some friends on Internet

566
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,193
If you don't like music,
you can watch a movie

567
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,000
There're a lot more
what a meaningful idea!

568
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,535
Nonsense!

569
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,137
For you...

570
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,073
I'm sorry,

571
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,613
there's no taxi on the Internet

572
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,441
But it doesn't matter. You love drawing

573
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,486
You can post your drawing
of Sausalito...

574
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,885
...on the Internet

575
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,922
And to share your inspirations...

576
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,323
...your affection for Sausalito...

577
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,361
with them

578
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,596
Well, I wish this dream can become true

579
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:03,561
Let's cheers!

580
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,372
Okay!

581
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,238
Cheers for our gay bar!

582
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,134
In fact,
I don't really like San Francisco

583
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,377
I'm tired of all the hustle...

584
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,081
in my life

585
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,021
Can you read palm?

586
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,596
Not this. That one

587
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,202
It represents San Francisco

588
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,149
No love line, no life line,

589
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,284
no career line

590
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,454
It's doomed to have...

591
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,283
...no accomplishment,
and it won't live long

592
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,558
But it has its own charm

593
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,284
Like earthquake,

594
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,621
every thing will be destroyed
with seconds

595
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,491
What can they do?

596
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,663
We should treasure...

597
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,637
...our time together

598
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,374
You gave these sweet-talks
to your other women?

599
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,509
Honestly

600
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,563
I start to like it...

601
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,267
Nirvana

602
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:22,407
Nirvana?

603
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,477
What did you say earlier?
Empire? Emperor?

604
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,049
A global community on the Internet

605
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,079
Called it Nirvana

606
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,352
Do you like it?

607
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,787
It's suitable

608
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,227
Good morning!

609
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,366
Morning!

610
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,397
Breakfast'll be ready in a second

611
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,863
I don't know where you live

612
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,230
That's why I drove you here

613
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,441
It's your house?

614
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,341
Yes. Like it?

615
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,440
It's burning

616
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,654
That is my style

617
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,654
When I work on something,
I become very focused

618
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,224
I will forget what I did in the past

619
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,766
Even at home,
I've burnt so many pans each year

620
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,176
Is it really your house?

621
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:35,610
I mean...

622
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,178
...your own home

623
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,382
I've most of my underwear here

624
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,686
Yours want to join in?

625
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,854
How can I afford it?

626
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,928
I mean... we both live here

627
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:58,826
Okay?

628
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,333
You're kidding me

629
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,310
No, I'm serious

630
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,345
Where is my car?

631
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,516
At the door

632
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,493
I go to work now

633
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,890
Can you think about it?

634
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,320
Mom, where were you last night?

635
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,551
I went to my friend's place

636
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,662
Oh! Wo Wo?

637
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,889
Mom, do you know that?
I have a holiday in every year

638
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,930
But you don't, you must have a holiday!

639
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,405
I hang out with you
whenever you've a holiday

640
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,770
Then, I won't have any vacation?

641
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,941
Sick of me?

642
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,676
I'm afraid that you are sick of me

643
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,409
I'm ten, but I can already
take care of myself

644
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,819
Do whatever you like!

645
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,555
Aunt Tina taught you to speak
to me like this?

646
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,291
I think she's right

647
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,619
Go ahead, mom!

648
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,826
Let's see

649
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,864
Wow! Handsome!

650
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,330
Go wash your head

651
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,437
Thank you, mom

652
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,836
I love you. Go

653
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,587
Hi

654
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,887
Hi, come in, please

655
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,798
I want to tell you,
the kid who hit your cousin...

656
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,900
...was my son Scott

657
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,401
I know. He called you mom

658
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:49,632
How old is he?

659
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:50,773
Ten

660
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,802
I got a divorce when he's two

661
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,838
Good

662
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,845
The only thing I'm grateful
for is my ex-husband

663
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,643
let me have Scott

664
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,981
I don't know why I slept with you
the first time we met?

665
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,091
And slept with you again
at the second time we met?

666
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:11,483
I wonder if we'll have the third time...

667
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,653
At the third time you slept here, we...

668
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,630
I feel sorry for Scott

669
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,508
Come in and talk. Okay?

670
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,144
How old are you?

671
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,140
33! And you?

672
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:31,877
Me, too

673
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,113
A 30 something woman is no fun in a game

674
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,518
Right. What's the fun?

675
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,917
A man has dealing...

676
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,457
with a woman of 30 something

677
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,520
You think
I want to see with your choices,

678
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,426
not being able to turn back

679
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,723
Why me?

680
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,033
I love you

681
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,538
I don't want to give Scott
too high an expectation

682
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:09,040
Let's try first?

683
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,549
I want to tell you one thing

684
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,756
In fact I'm 35 years old

685
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:00,900
Why you like Sausalito so much?

686
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,132
Don't you think it's like Sai Kung?

687
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,699
You lived in Sai Kung before?

688
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,143
I bought a house there
when I got married

689
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,776
Why divorce?

690
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,683
Because I was married

691
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,592
Do you miss your ex-husband?

692
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,568
If you don't remind me of him,

693
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,863
I've already forgotten about him

694
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,273
Hey, you can't make a mess. No!

695
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,298
Virginia, just wait for one moment...

696
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,974
See! He has come. Mr. Mike!

697
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:18,873
Let me introduce, Ms. Virginia Chow,
the CEO of C&G

698
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,617
Where did you go?

699
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,284
To watch Scott play baseball

700
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,086
Play baseball?

701
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,087
Mr. Lau, What did you say?

702
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,064
I just said bullshit!

703
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,830
I usually like to be on top
when l'm with a woman

704
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,177
This time, we have big trouble!

705
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,048
What was this being on top

706
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,390
Couldn't you change a position
once a while

707
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,022
What can we do?...

708
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,857
The only way out is to secure a loan
from a bank!

709
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,022
Bank?... Bullshit!

710
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,633
The bank is not your ATM

711
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:19,860
Everybody is doing...

712
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:20,968
IT now

713
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,297
We gotta come up
with some new gimmick...

714
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,803
to fool those suits

715
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:27,340
Hey, friend, my new proposal

716
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,102
Don't trick me!

717
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,645
A suicide manual? Check?

718
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,941
We can go public
completely redeemable...

719
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,243
for cash at the bank

720
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,821
You look nervous

721
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,797
I just want these!

722
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,833
You should have given me
this much earlier

723
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,834
Problems solved

724
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,374
I also hate the women being on top,
no taste

725
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,373
By the way, why you call it Nirvana?

726
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,042
A peaceful and tranquil city

727
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,323
A peaceful and tranquil city?

728
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,984
A wonderful name!

729
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:19,020
It works. Great!...

730
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,829
Ellen will invite you to join her party

731
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,330
Good name! Wonderful...

732
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,299
Nirvana

733
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,399
Nirvana Kingdom...

734
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:34,198
I'm 2nd in line

735
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:35,310
What?

736
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:37,243
I'm talking about Mike

737
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,003
Go to hell! Have some biscuits!

738
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,848
You don't like him, but I do

739
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:41,779
Don't eat too much candies

740
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,249
I know

741
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:52,349
Mike, Ellen is really nice

742
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,962
Don't let her go

743
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,296
Robert, this is for you

744
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,232
- Easter present
- Thank you

745
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,266
You are welcome

746
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:01,569
How about me?

747
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,503
No, I forgot

748
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,299
How about it?

749
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,505
I just said it

750
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:16,409
Happy Easter!

751
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,486
Come over here
Mike, I want to talk to you

752
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,380
About what? Sit down first

753
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:21,521
Over here

754
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,322
I've a good news and a bad news for you

755
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,192
The good news is
I read through your proposal

756
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,357
And realized that you're a genius!

757
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,059
But the bad news is...

758
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,498
I'm the only person recognizes

759
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:40,340
The bankers rejected the proposal

760
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,241
We can't get the loan

761
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,447
We can find other banks

762
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,142
I talked to...

763
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,581
over 20 banks,

764
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,445
but they all rejected your proposal

765
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,114
I heard...

766
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,219
...that Virginia has been...

767
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,452
bad-mouthing us

768
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,093
So...

769
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,930
If we can't get a loan,
we've to pay back our debt

770
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,065
I talked to Virginia on the phone

771
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,171
Next month she'll come
to San Francisco and stay one day

772
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,405
We must meet her

773
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,075
This time you let her ride
you just for once

774
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,873
Okay?

775
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,412
Mom

776
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,813
When can I move in with you?

777
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,007
Soon

778
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:23,583
Also,

779
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,476
Wo Wo said he would take us
to Sausalito to see new houses

780
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:26,622
Really?

781
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,151
I don't want it! Go!

782
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,383
Come on... listen to me

783
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,253
Just see her once again... Shut up

784
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,084
Why didn't tell me earlier?

785
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,491
I wanted to, but I couldn't find you

786
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,995
You didn't try at all.
You keep me in the dark

787
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,360
How I can find you? My master!

788
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,363
Call me!

789
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,559
I called you,
but the line was alway busy

790
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:41,369
Get out!

791
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,231
Mike, what happen?

792
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,235
Shut up! It's none of your business

793
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,465
Mike, there're guests here

794
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,078
Okay, I'm leaving

795
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,506
Goodbye, everybody

796
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,399
Let's get something to eat over there

797
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,257
Okay

798
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,306
Mike

799
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,139
Mike

800
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,178
What happened?

801
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,422
What's up?

802
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,423
Nothing

803
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,191
Didn't you take precaution?

804
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,464
Yes! I do! But it's not yet come.
I just check it for safe!

805
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:54,364
Safe?

806
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,697
Yes

807
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,428
That good

808
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,733
Yes, nothing

809
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,131
Be careful next time

810
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,435
No problem

811
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,084
Anything?

812
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,316
I'm going to pick up Scott

813
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,720
It's okay. I'll go by myself

814
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,588
No. Let's go together

815
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,270
Mike, let's play baseball?

816
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,672
You go ahead

817
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,799
Come on. Just play few games

818
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,311
Scott, I'm working

819
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,777
Ask your mom to play with you

820
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,211
Scott, mom plays with you, okay?

821
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,318
Mike, listen

822
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,297
I can't implement your proposal...

823
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,594
at this stage

824
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,193
Hire someone to help us

825
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,566
I'm in debt

826
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:07,197
How can I find money for a new hire?

827
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:11,672
Okay, I'm a programmer,
I'll write it myself

828
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,749
You're happy now?

829
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,344
Whatever!

830
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,520
Mike, how long you want to hide?

831
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,164
I need some more time

832
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,266
We have no money

833
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,061
I know,
I should get a mortgage on my house

834
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,797
My business also start from zero, okay,

835
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:36,801
I would come to talk to you

836
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,182
Mike

837
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,715
- I want to talk to you
- Go ahead

838
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,648
Tina has a taxi available.
I want to work

839
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,292
It's up to you!

840
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,571
Mike, why are you here?

841
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,313
You're not inside

842
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:57,884
Ellen!

843
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,736
Where should I go that you like? Tell me

844
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,699
Sorry. I'm in deep trouble recently

845
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,705
My company runs into debt

846
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,370
The bankers no longer support us

847
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,645
I've great financial difficulties

848
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,712
Didn't Bod say someone wanted
to buy your company?

849
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,986
Don't follow them to talk
about the god damne buy

850
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,890
I won't sell my company

851
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,556
Anyway, you won't understand

852
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,530
Leave me alone!

853
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,774
I know

854
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:57,507
I'm ignorant and can't help you

855
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,277
I just want to take care
of your house and

856
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,813
cook you a nice dinner

857
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,348
I didn't ask for too much

858
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,917
Do whatever you like, it's up to you

859
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,409
Satisfied

860
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:07,717
Tell me,

861
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,551
have I done too much or too little?

862
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,758
You've given me too much

863
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:20,562
It's my fault. You are very kind to me

864
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,813
I think, it's better for Scott
not to move in

865
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:40,922
No. Let him move in

866
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,794
I didn't expect to meet you here

867
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,021
I thought we would meet at the office

868
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,996
Your company's style is too free.
Not suitable for me

869
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,104
You've something to say?

870
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,542
You never say sorry to a woman?

871
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,412
If it's too hard on you, it's okay

872
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,550
In fact,
I should be the one to apologize

873
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,830
I did tell the bankers
not to loan you the money

874
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:02,769
I make it happened
because I appreciate your talent

875
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:04,971
Bob showed me

876
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:05,869
your Nirvana City proposal

877
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,641
It's very impressive

878
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,982
We didn't have
enough communication before

879
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,642
So we had some misunderstandings

880
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,116
Then...

881
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,825
can we be frank to each other today?

882
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,900
How about we go back to the office...

883
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,467
Contract? Don't worry

884
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,133
The contract is up to my decision

885
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:16,974
- Mom
- Copy

886
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,572
When will you come to pick me up?

887
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,944
I'll get off work soon

888
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,684
Tina will take you home first, okay?

889
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,548
Alright!

890
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:24,743
See you soon

891
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:29,722
Good afternoon

892
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,755
I would like to go to the Majestic Hotel

893
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:32,723
Sure

894
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,102
Don't worry

895
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:45,801
Tomorrow I'll send my assistants
to discuss the details with you

896
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:46,804
Okay

897
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,846
You come to my place, tonight

898
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,019
No

899
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,790
Alright, whatever

900
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,197
Shit!

901
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:03,741
Ellen

902
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,854
Tina, Mom will take me to Wo Wo's house

903
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:50,630
Hi

904
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,922
Mom is home

905
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,421
Are you slept with Virginia?

906
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,457
Ellen will be sad if she finds out

907
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,755
She left!

908
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,902
It maybe a good thing

909
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,740
I sold all my shares to C&G

910
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,308
They'll hire me as financial controller

911
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,849
They want to kick you out
from the board of directors

912
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,816
Don't sell!

913
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:02,829
I've no choice

914
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:08,166
The take-over announcement demands
for your withdrawal from the board

915
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,903
That means
they want to own the company 100%

916
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,506
But kick you out

917
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:21,037
Obviously, she just playing you

918
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,789
What's your plan?

919
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,027
No! Under this circumstances...

920
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,531
...it's better to sell it

921
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,464
Did you hear me. I don't sell them

922
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,200
Don't you know our situation?

923
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,865
We've no choice

924
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,442
If we don't sell it, we should both dead

925
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,207
Banks will liquidate us

926
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,368
What do you mean?

927
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,242
We're on the same boat

928
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:03,018
Do you understand? We've no choice!

929
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,366
You betrayed me

930
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,432
You sold our company to her!

931
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,376
Why did you sell it to her
as she kick me out?

932
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,409
You're out but I'm still in

933
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,246
We're on the same boat

934
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,411
We create this project together

935
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:35,479
This is betrayal!

936
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:37,981
How can I possibly betray you?

937
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,286
If I betray you,
I won't wait until today

938
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,887
Am I insane?

939
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:48,298
I've been taking care of you and
acting like your dog

940
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,598
Why would I betray you?
Where is your mind?

941
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,072
Had I betrayed you,
I would have done so much earlier

942
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,370
I've been standing by you

943
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,970
all these years...

944
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:06,086
...only because I like you. For what?

945
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,983
I must be crazy. It isn't easy at all
to serve a boss like you

946
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,586
Well, it's normal

947
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:23,035
We cannot get marry!
Because you are my cousin?

948
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,304
Don't be too stubborn

949
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:30,268
Sell it when you can

950
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:34,013
Otherwise, carrying a debt all your life

951
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,948
I got paid, at least you won't have
to scramble to make a living

952
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,280
Alright

953
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,188
Am I being kept by you?

954
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:50,187
It's no big deal. Right?

955
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:53,198
You'll be used to it

956
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,930
It's okay

957
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,142
What's up?

958
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,206
We'll come back. Then, sell it

959
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,279
Absolutely

960
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,547
To rebuild our own world,

961
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:10,446
a fantastic new world

962
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,349
No one dares to bully us

963
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,518
How's Ellen?

964
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,521
Will see

965
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:23,997
Then, I've chances

966
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,463
No!

967
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,261
Why not? Crazy!

968
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:28,900
Yes

969
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:29,561
Why you tell me now

970
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,137
you are gay?

971
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,069
Where's your mind?

972
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:34,105
Take out your hand!

973
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:35,568
I'll pay you

974
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,302
You've to give me some advantages...

975
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:41,210
Are you crazy?

976
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,484
Any questions?

977
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,080
Hello

978
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,252
Okay

979
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,531
Whose call?

980
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,376
Bill Gate!

981
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,459
Thank you. Excuse me!

982
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,396
See you later. Thank you...

983
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:40,446
Ellen...

984
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,570
Robert, why you have it too?
What happened?

985
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:01,299
Ellen

986
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:02,841
What happened? Who are they?

987
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,638
Forgive Mike, please

988
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,407
All of them are Nirvana citizens

989
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,914
Yesterday, Mike chatted with them
on the Internet about you

990
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,381
He told them the story about you

991
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,614
He feels guilty

992
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,481
Mike told you to do that?

993
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:19,991
No... we ourselves want to do it

994
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,006
Many people told me that you're here

995
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:44,709
How are you?

996
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,378
Alright. Just the same

997
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:48,716
A big shock to you?

998
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:50,716
A little bit

999
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,728
They said it all for you

1000
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,761
Would you forgive me?

1001
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,330
Don't mention it

1002
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:04,471
Congratulations, your dream comes true

1003
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,566
You're part of it

1004
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,813
You chose the name of Nirvana

1005
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:18,885
People in Nirvana enjoy their lives

1006
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,592
Sorry

1007
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:27,888
Don't be silly

1008
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:30,991
Don't be kidding

1009
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:32,965
I'm not kidding

1010
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:35,966
I'm serious

1011
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,905
Would it work this time?

1012
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:44,468
If I were you, I'd already said yes!

1013
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,082
Come with me again?

1014
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:53,811
No

1015
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:54,944
Why?

1016
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,522
No

1017
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,026
Tell your friends not to be crazy

1018
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,696
I can't take too much surprises

1019
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:14,533
Bye

1020
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:41,830
You said no to him?

1021
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,095
If I were you,
I would have dashed to hug

1022
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,463
and kiss him say yes

1023
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,803
Ellen, why?

1024
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,637
I rejected him down already.
I can't take back my words

1025
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,508
Why not?

1026
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:56,014
If you still love him,
you can change your minds for 100 times

1027
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,845
Taking back my words it simple

1028
01:30:57,985 --> 01:30:59,919
The problem is...

1029
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,453
do I want to start all over again?

1030
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:03,685
what's wrong with it?

1031
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,355
He may play the tricks again!

1032
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:08,786
Who knows what will happed next?

1033
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,555
Right?

1034
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,095
Okay

1035
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,834
I forgot to buy some butter

1036
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,436
Let's get it for you

1037
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,037
Let's kiss first

1038
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:23,871
Be careful your mom, she's so angry!

1039
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,572
Eat faster!

1040
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:32,677
It's no big deal,
you can post it on the Internet

1041
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,846
Perhaps Miss World will come
for interviews, right?

1042
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,957
Why you're running so fast?

1043
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,561
Do I have any chances?

1044
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,800
Fine! I won't ask you anymore

1045
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,164
I shut up and leave you alone
for a while

1046
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:51,527
Just only give you a second

1047
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,828
Oh, my god. Scott, come with me.
This way

1048
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:54,029
Stay here

1049
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,174
Ellen

1050
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:33,036
Are you both allright?

1051
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,832
We are allright, Tina,
come to take care of Scott

1052
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:41,937
Mike?

1053
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,981
Your shoe I found you!

1054
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:53,892
Are you allright? Scott is safe?

1055
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:13,006
Do you get any hurt?
I was worried about you

1056
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:00,927
We'll ask the house owner,
if he'd sell it or not?

1057
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:02,825
If he won't?
We build a new house next to his!
