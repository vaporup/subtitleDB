1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to
begin our descent into Los Angeles.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,560
The sound you have just heard
is the landing gear locking into place.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,120
Los Angeles weather is clear,
temperature 72.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,880
We expect to make our four hour
and eighteen minute flight on schedule.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,680
We enjoyed having you on board and look
forward to seeing you again in the near future.

6
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Attention, please! Passengers in this
area is limited to 3 minutes on leave.

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,000
Please do not leave your cart unattended.

8
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
Hey, what's the matter?

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,600
The guests are all downstairs, Ben.
Waiting to see you.

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
Look, Dad, could you explain to them
that I have to be alone for a while?

11
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
These are all our good friends, Ben.

12
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,020
Most of them have known you since...
well... practically since you were born.

13
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
What is it, Ben?

14
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm just...

15
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,060
...worried?

16
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,520
Well...

17
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,720
About what?

18
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,400
I guess about my future.

19
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
What about it?

20
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
I don't know.

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,540
I want it to be...

22
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,500
To be what?

23
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
Different.

24
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,300
- Is anything wrong?
- No, no, we're just on our way downstairs!

25
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,060
The Carlsons' are here.

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,500
They are?
Well... come on.

27
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
They came all the way from Tarzana.

28
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,020
Come on, let's get cracking.

29
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,020
It's a wonderful thing to have
so many devoted friends.

30
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,780
Hey... there's our award winning scholar.

31
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,500
We're all very proud of you, Ben.

32
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,620
Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

33
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,380
Is that the new car out there?
The little red Wop job?

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,900
That's Ben's graduation present.

35
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,540
Won't have much trouble picking
them up in that, will you?

36
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,000
So?

37
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,220
The girls, the chicks, the teeny boppers.

38
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,200
I think Ben has gotten beyond the
teeny bopper stage. Haven't you, Ben?

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,140
Yes, madam.

40
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,340
Excuse me. I think I'd just like to
check something on the car for a minute.

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,100
Here's the track star.
How are you, track star?

42
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,340
Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

43
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,000
I want to get a drink and then I want
hear all about that thing you won.

44
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,520
- That Hoppermanaward.
- Helpingham.

45
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,220
Helpingham! Right!
You wait right here.

46
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:53,180
- Ben... we're all so proud of you.
- Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.

47
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,340
What are you going to do now?

48
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,020
I was going to go upstairs for a minute.

49
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,220
- I meant with your future
- Your life.

50
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,540
Well... that's a little hard to say.

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,500
Ben!

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Excuse me.

53
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
Mr. McQuire

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,000
Ben.

55
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,840
Mr. McQuire.

56
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,700
Come on with me for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

57
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,300
Excuse us, Joan.

58
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,260
I just want to say on word to you,
just one word.

59
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,540
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,640
- Are you listening?
- Yes I am.

61
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,380
Plastics.

62
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,940
Exactly how do you mean?

63
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,540
There is a great future in plastics.
Think about it. Will you think about it?

64
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,380
Yes, I will.

65
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,180
Enough said. That's a deal.

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,920
- Here he is now. Here's Ben.
- Excuse me just a minute.

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,020
Listen everybody,
I want you all to be quite.

68
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
I got Ben's college yearbook here

69
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,700
and I just want to read you
some of the wonderful things about Ben.

70
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,620
Be quiet, Please!

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Captain of the cross country team.
Head of the bating court.

72
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,120
Associate editor of the college news paper
"News Junior" here, managing editor in a "Senior"

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,640
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?

74
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,320
It's... down the hall.

75
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
How are you, Benjamin?

76
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,600
Fine, thank you, Mrs. Robinson.
The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

77
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,920
Such a pleasant room.

78
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,280
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean
to be rude, but I'm...

79
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
- I'm o...
- Is there an ashtray in here?

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,000
No.

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Oh yes I forgot.
The track star doesn't smoke.

82
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,660
Is it a girl?

83
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Is what a girl?

84
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,140
Whatever it is upsetting you.

85
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,500
- Oh... no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
- In general.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,860
That's right.

87
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,740
- Well, congratulations!
- Thank you!

88
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,340
- Oh, Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
- What?

89
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,140
- Will you take me home?
- What?

90
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,060
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,720
Here, you take it.
Do you know how to work a foreign shift?

92
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,040
- You don't?
- No.

93
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,980
Let's go.

94
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,260
- Thank you.
- Right.

95
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,940
- Will you come in, please?
- What?

96
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
I like you to come in till
I get the lights on.

97
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,180
What for?

98
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,620
Because I don't feel safe
till I get the lights on.

99
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,940
Would you mind walking ahead of
me to the sun porch.

100
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,020
I feel funny about
coming into a dark house.

101
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,700
- But it's light in there.
- Please.

102
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,420
What do you drink? Bourbon?

103
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,140
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I drove you home.
I was glad to do it.

104
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,420
But I have some things on my mind.
Can you understand that?

105
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,220
- Yes.
- All right.

106
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
What do you drink?

107
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,980
Benjamin... I'm sorry to be this way, but
I don't want to be left alone in this house.

108
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,660
- Why not?
- Please wait till my husband gets home.

109
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,820
- When is he coming back?
- I don't know.

110
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,780
- Drink?
- No.

111
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,860
- Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
- Yes.

112
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,940
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

113
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,940
I'm very neurotic.

114
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,340
May I ask you a question?

115
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
What do you think of me?

116
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
What do you mean?

117
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,780
You've known me nearly all of your life.
You must have formed some opinion of me.

118
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,020
Well... I've always thought
that you were a very... nice... person.

119
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

120
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,900
- What?
- Did you know that?

121
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,540
Look... I think I should be going.

122
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,340
Sit down, Benjamin.

123
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,500
Mrs. Robinson,
if you don't mind my saying so,

124
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,420
this conversation is getting a little strange.

125
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,100
Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will
be here any minute now and...

126
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,140
- No.
- What?

127
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,220
My husband will be back quite late.
He should be gone for several hours.

128
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,140
Oh my God.

129
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,220
- Pardon?
- Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

130
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,660
What's wrong?

131
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,820
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't...
I mean you didn't expect...

132
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,740
What?

133
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,260
I mean... you didn't really think that
I would do something like that.

134
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,980
Like what?

135
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,380
- What do you think?
- Well, I don't know.

136
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,660
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson.

137
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,060
Here we are, you've got me into your house.
You give me a drink. You put on music.

138
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,460
Now you start opening up
your personal life to me

139
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,260
and tell me your husband
won't be home for hours.

140
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,460
- So?
- Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me.

141
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,740
Aren't you?

142
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Well, no. I hadn't thought of it.
I feel very flattered...

143
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,220
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
me for what I just said?

144
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,620
It's all right.

145
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,540
It's not all right, it's the worst
thing I've ever said to anyone.

146
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,500
Sit down.

147
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,860
Please forgive me.
Because I like you.

148
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,260
I don't think of you that way.
But I'm mixed up.

149
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,860
It's all right. Finish your drink.

150
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,780
Mrs. Robinson,
it makes me sick that I said that to you.

151
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,820
Forget it right now. Finish your drink.

152
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,900
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

153
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,220
- Her portrait?
- Yes.

154
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,800
No.

155
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,010
 We had it done last Christmas.

156
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,660
- Would you like to see it?
- Very much.

157
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,500
Here in Elaine's room.

158
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,100
Elaine certainly is an
attractive girl, isn't she?

159
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,300
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

160
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,740
- Benjamin?
- Yes?

161
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,620
- Will you come here a minute?
- Over there? Sure

162
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,500
- Will you unzip my dress? I think I'll go to bed.
- Oh. Well, goodnight.

163
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,660
- Won't you unzip my dress?
- I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

164
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,220
- If you still think I'm trying to seduce you...
- No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.

165
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,060
- Benjamin... you've known me all your life.
- I know that. But I'm...

166
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,540
Come on. It's hard for me to reach.

167
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,980
- Thank you.
- Right.

168
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,780
- What are you so scared of?
- I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

169
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,000
Then why do you keep running away?

170
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,460
Because you're going to bed.

171
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,780
I don't think I should be up here.

172
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,780
- Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
- Yes, I have. But I just...

173
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,820
- Look... what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
- What if he did?

174
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,540
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

175
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,060
Don't you think he trusts us together?

176
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,980
Of course he does.

177
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,600
But he might get the wrong idea.
Anyone might.

178
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,620
I don't see why.

179
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,820
I'm twice as old as you are.
How could anyone think......

180
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,660
But they would! Don't you see?

181
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,500
Benjamin... I'm not trying to seduce you.

182
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,340
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson.

183
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,000
This is difficult for me.

184
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,100
- Would you like me to seduce you?
- What?

185
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,340
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

186
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,940
I'm going home now.

187
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,900
I apologize for what I said.
I hope you can forget it.

188
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,420
But I'm going home right now.

189
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,500
- Benjamin?
- Yes.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,820
- Will you bring up my purse before you go?
- I have to go now. I'm sorry.

191
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,260
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

192
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,740
- Where is it?
- On the table in the hall.

193
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,020
- Mrs. Robinson?
- I'm in the bathroom.

194
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,380
Well here's the purse.

195
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
Could you bring it up?

196
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,540
Well I'll hand it to you. Come to
the railing and I'll hand it up.

197
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,940
Benjamin... I am getting pretty
tired of all this suspicion.

198
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,580
Now if you won't do me a simple favor,

199
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,940
I don't know what.

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,580
I'm putting it on the top step.

201
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,220
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop
acting this way and bring me the purse?

202
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,660
I'm putting it here by the door.

203
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,260
- Will you bring it in to me?
- I'd rather not.

204
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,860
- All right. Put it in Elaine's room where we were.
- Right.

205
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,220
Oh, God!
Let me out!

206
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,420
- Don't be nervous.
- Get away from that door.

207
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,220
- Let me say something first.
- Jesus Christ!

208
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,100
Benjamin, I want you to know
that I'm available to you.

209
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,700
If you want sleep with me this time.

210
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh my Christ!

211
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,580
If you want sleep with me this time

212
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,900
I want you to know that you can call me up any time
you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.

213
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,260
- Do you understand what I said?
- Let me out!

214
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,020
- Benjamin, do you understand what I said?
- Yes. Yes. Let me out!

215
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,980
Because I find you very attractive
and any time you want...

216
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,940
Oh, Jesus that's him!

217
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,300
- Is that Ben's car in front?
- Yes, Sir!

218
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,770
I drove... I drove Mrs. Robinson home.

219
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,820
She wanted me to drive her home so I...
drove her home.

220
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,260
Well. I appreciate it.

221
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,500
She's upstairs. She wanted me to
wait down here till you got home.

222
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,100
- Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,940
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

224
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,020
- It looks like you need a refill.
- Oh no. I got to go.

225
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,820
Is anything wrong?
You look a little shaken up.

226
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,900
Oh no. No... I'm just... I'm just a little worried about
my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

227
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,660
Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.

228
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,340
- Scotch?
- Bourbon.

229
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,020
Ben... how old are you now?

230
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,260
20. I'll be 21 next week.

231
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,180
That's a hell of a good age to be.

232
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,040
Thank you.

233
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760
Thank you very much, sir!

234
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,060
- I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben...
- Sir?

235
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,140
- You'll never be young again.
- I know.

236
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,380
- Ben, can I say something to you?
- What?

237
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,020
How long have we known each other now?

238
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,530
How long have you and I known each other?

239
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,620
- How long have your Dad and I been partners?
- Quite a while.

240
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,420
- I've watched you grow up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,540
In many ways I feel
as you were my own son.

242
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,020
Thank you.

243
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,060
So I hope you won't mind my giving
you a friendly piece of advice.

244
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,420
I'd like to hear it.

245
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:50,100
Ben... I think... I think you ought to be taking it
a little easier right now than you seem to be.

246
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:58,140
Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come.
Have a good time with the girls and so forth.

247
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,740
Don't get up.

248
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,000
- I... I was just telling...
- Ben

249
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,430
... Ben here
that he ought to sow a few wild oats.

250
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,780
Have a good time while he can.
You think that's sound advice?

251
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,740
Yes, I do.

252
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,700
I've got to go.

253
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:25,380
You have yourself a few fillings this summer.
I bet you're quite a ladies' man.

254
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,140
Oh no.

255
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,650
What? You look to me like the kind of guy
who, who has to fight them off.

256
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,220
Doesn't he look to you
like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?

257
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,420
Yes, he does.

258
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,030
Oh say... Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.

259
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,100
Oh yes.

260
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,340
- I wish you give her a call.
- I will.

261
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,780
- Benjamin? Benjamin?
- Yes.

262
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,300
Thank you for taking me home.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

263
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please
for this afternoon's feature attraction.

264
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,660
Hey, over there! Yes, I mean you!
Your attention please!

265
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,620
- Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
- Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

266
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Listen, now I'm gonna ask for a big round of
applause to bring this boy out here, all right?

267
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,230
Wait a minute, oh let me amend that,

268
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,780
to bring this young man out here,
because today he is 21 years old.

269
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,820
Come on, let's get on with the show!

270
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,740
Hang on a minute, I got a few words to say...

271
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,220
- You always do.
- Look who's talking

272
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,540
Dad, could we just talk about this for a second?

273
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,140
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

274
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,940
I'd like to discuss this.

275
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,740
This boy... I'm sorry... this young man...
is soon to continue his education

276
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,000
as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar

277
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,460
But before he does... before he does...

278
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,740
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them.

279
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,940
Dad... can you listen...

280
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll give you ten seconds

281
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,220
He is going to give us a practical
demonstration of what I feel safe

282
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,980
in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present

283
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,580
And it better work or I'm out
over two hundred bucks.

284
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,260
OK then, let's herald now for... Benjamin Braddock!

285
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,580
Come on, let's herald now!

286
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,620
Folks, this remarkable young man

287
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,020
is going to perform for you some spectacular

288
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,660
and amazing feats of daring in water
that is over 6 feet deep

289
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,900
Hello.

290
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,340
- I don't quite know how to put this...
- Benjamin?

291
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Look,
I was thinking about that time after the party...

292
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,300
Where are you?

293
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,980
I was wondering if I could
buy you a drink or something.

294
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,860
Where are you?

295
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,580
- Uh... The Taft Hotel.
- Did you get a room?

296
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,500
No. Now I know it's pretty late
and if you'd rather...

297
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,100
Give me an hour.

298
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,420
- What?
- I'll be there in an hour.

299
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,380
Can I help you, sir!

300
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,660
- What? Oh... no... I'm just...
- Are you here for an affair, sir?

301
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,060
- What?
- The Singleman party, sir?

302
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,340
- Oh... yes. The Singleman party.
- It's in the main ballroom.

303
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,180
Ahh... thank you.

304
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,340
- You must be one of the Poets.
- No... actually I'm not...

306
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,860
I'd like you to meet my sister,
Miss DeWitte...

307
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,140
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

308
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,500
- and my husband, Mr. Singleman...

309
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,420
Oh, sorry.
Fine, thank you.

310
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,260
- That's Jeffrey, of course.
- Of course.

311
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,820
- I didn't get your name, sir.
- Benjamin Braddock, sir.

312
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,700
- Braddock... Braddock?
- Yes, but I'm afraid...

313
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,620
I'll find your table in just a moment.
Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.

314
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,220
No... actually
I'm just looking for a friend.

315
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,580
- Oh, but I don't understand.
- I'm not with your party... I'm sorry.

316
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,180
- Hey... I don't get it.
- I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

317
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,880
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Oh. Hello.

318
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,800
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

319
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

320
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,240
- How are you?
- Very well. Thank you.

321
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,680
- May I have a drink?
- A drink? Of course.

322
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
He didn't see me.

323
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,320
- Waiter! I will have a martini.
- Yes, madam.

324
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,400
You don't have to be
so nervous, you know.

325
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,960
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous.

326
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,840
I mean it's... it's pretty hard
to be suave when you're...

327
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,240
- Did you get us a room?
- What?

328
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,840
- Have you gotten us a room yet?
- I haven't. No.

329
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,680
- Do you want to?
- Well, I don't. I mean I could or we could just talk.

330
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,000
- Do you want me to get it?
- You? Oh no. No, I'll get it.

331
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,080
Do you want to get it now?

332
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
- Now?
- Yes.

333
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,440
- Well... I don't know.
- Why don't you get it.

334
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,800
Why don't I get it? Well, I will then.
If you'll excuse me.

335
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,580
Yes sir?

336
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,940
A room. I'd like a room, please.

337
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,740
Single room or double room?

338
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,700
A single. Just for myself, please.

339
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
Will you sign the register, please?

340
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,560
- Is anything wrong, sir?
- What? No, Nothing.

341
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?

342
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,760
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.

343
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
- Where is it?
- What?

344
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,240
Where is your luggage?

345
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,600
- Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
- Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.

346
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,000
- Oh no. I mean I'd rather not go
to the trouble of bringing it all in.

347
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,440
I just have a toothbrush.
I can get it myself. If that's all right.

348
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,360
Of course.
I'll have a porter show you the room.

349
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself.

350
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
I just have the toothbrush to carry up
and I think I can handle it myself.

351
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,280
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Thank you!

352
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
- Mrs. Robinson.
- Yes?

353
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,320
- For you.
- Thank you.

354
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,400
Hello?

355
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,120
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yes?

356
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,200
- It's Benjamin.
- Yes?

357
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Benjamin Braddock.

358
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
Benjamin, where are you?

359
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,800
Can you look through the glass.

360
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
- Can you see me now?
- Yes, I can.

361
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,640
- I got a single room.
- That's fine.

362
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

363
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,760
I don't know what their policy is.

364
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,200
Well... do you want to go up first?

365
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
Yes... I think that would be good.

366
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
I'll be up in five minutes.

367
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,240
Well... goodbye then...

368
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,120
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

369
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Isn't there something
you want to tell me?

370
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,280
- To tell you?
- Yes.

371
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Well, I want you to know how
much I appreciate this, really.

372
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,920
- The number.
- What?

373
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,320
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

374
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,880
Oh? You're absolutely right.

375
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,120
- It's 568.
- Thank you.

376
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,840
You're welcome. Well... I'll see
you later, Mrs. Robinson.

377
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,600
Check, please.

378
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I've got it.

379
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,640
- I say I've got it.
- Sir?

380
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,040
- The toothbrush. I got it all right.
- Very good, sir.

381
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
- Yes. Well... goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

382
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,200
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

383
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

384
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,400
- I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
- Sure.

385
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,240
Shall I... I mean shall I just stand here?
I mean... I don't know what you want me to do.

386
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,520
- Why don't you watch?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

387
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,640
- Will you bring me a hanger?
- What?

388
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,920
- A hanger.
- Oh, yes.

389
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
- Wood?
- What?

390
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,400
Wood or wire? They have both.

391
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,960
- Either one will be fine.
- Okay.

392
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,600
Thank you!

393
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,520
- Will you help me with this, please?
- Certainly.

394
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,080
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

395
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,440
Benjamin, Would this be
easier for you in the dark?

396
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,840
- Mrs. Robinson... I can't do this.
- You what?

397
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
This is all terribly wrong.

398
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,080
- Do you find me undesirable?
- Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.

399
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,480
I think... I think you're the most
attractive of all my parents' friends.

400
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,960
I mean that. I found you desirable, but I...

401
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
For god's sake, can you
imange my parents?

402
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Can you imange what they will say if
they just saw we are in this room like now?

403
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
- What will they say?
- I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson.

404
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
But for god's sake.

405
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
They brought me up, they
made a good life for me.

406
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,720
And I think they deserve better than this.

407
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,600
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with their partner's wife.

408
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,600
- Are you afraid of me?
- Oh, no, you are missing the point.

409
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,480
Look, maybe we could do something else together.
Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie.

410
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,080
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Ask me anything you want.

411
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,400
- Is this your first time?
- Is this... what?

412
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,680
It is, isn't it?
It is your first time.

413
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,400
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh. Ha ha.

414
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,080
- You can admit that, can't you?
- Are you kidding?

415
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,240
- It's nothing to be ashamed of...
- Wait a minute!

416
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,960
- On your first time...
- Who said it was my first time.

417
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,920
- that you're afraid...
- Wait a minute.

418
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,040
- of bring... inadequate... I mean just because
you happen to be inadequate in one way...

419
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,000
INADEQUATE!

420
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't move.

421
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,840
Ben... what are you doing?

422
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,200
Well... I would say that I'm just
drifting.... here... in the pool.

423
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,000
Why?

424
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,800
Well... it's very comfortable...
just to drift here.

425
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,000
- Have you thought about graduate school?
- No.

426
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Would you mind telling me then...

427
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,190
what those four years
of college were for?

428
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,240
What was the point
of all that hard work?

429
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,800
You got me.

430
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,600
Now listen, Ben.

431
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,680
Look...

432
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,280
I think it's a very good thing that a young
man... after he's done some very good work...

433
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,880
should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself,

434
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,880
and lie around, and drink beer and so on.

435
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,640
But after a few weeks

436
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,520
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

437
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,920
and start to think about
getting off his ass.

438
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,320
The Robinson's are here.

439
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,600
Hi, Ben. What are you doing
with yourself these days?

440
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,120
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

441
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,240
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

442
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,960
Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming
down from Berkeley soon.

443
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,840
- I want you to call her up this time.
- I will.

444
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,720
Because I just think you two would
hit it off real well together.

445
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

446
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,440
- Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
- Hello, Benjamin.

447
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
- Oh my...
- Hi

448
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,920
- Hi, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

449
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,720
Benji, Darling.
I'm going to ask you something

450
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,800
but you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

451
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,320
What?

452
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,720
Well I'm going to ask you what
you do when you go off at night.

453
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,480
When I go off?

454
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You don't have to tell me if
you don't want to.

455
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
No, I do. I want to tell you.

456
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,400
I drive around.

457
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,360
- What else?
- Nothing else.

458
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,000
Well you don't drive around from midnight
until noon the next day, Benjamin.

459
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,960
Oh, no.

460
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,400
Then what do you do?
Do you meet someone?

461
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,360
Meet someone?
Why did you say that?

462
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,880
Well this is your business,
I won't play games.

463
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,200
No wait. Wait, I don't meet anyone, Mother.
But why did you say that?

464
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,720
Benjamin, I don't want to pry
into your affairs,

465
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,920
but I'd rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

466
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,000
- Goodnight.
- Well, wait.

467
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,080
Wait a minute.

468
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,080
Will you wait a minute, please?

469
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,720
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

470
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,800
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

471
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,000
Look, for a month, all we've done
is come up here and leap into bed together.

472
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,920
Are you tired of it?

473
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,520
I'm not. No. But do you think

474
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,000
we could liven it up with a little
conversation for a change?

475
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
Well what do you want to talk about?

476
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,560
Anything. Anything at all.

477
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Do you want to tell me about
some of your college experiences?

478
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh my God.

479
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Think of another topic.

480
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,720
How about art.

481
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,000
Art. That's a good subject.

482
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,040
You start it off.

483
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,840
You start it off. I don't know
anything about it.

484
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,700
What do you want
to know about it.

485
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,440
Are you interested more in modern
art or more in classical art.

486
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Neither.

487
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,520
- You're not interested in art?
- No.

488
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
- Then why do you want to talk about it?
- I don't.

489
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,520
Now look, we are going to do this thing.
We are going to have a conversation.

490
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,520
Tell me what you did today.

491
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
I got up.

492
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
I fixed breakfast for my husband.

493
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,880
There!

494
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,040
There's something we could have
a conversation about: Your husband!

495
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,880
Oh, him?

496
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,680
I mean everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

497
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,120
What do you say to him when
you leave the house at night?

498
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,640
Nothing. He's asleep.

499
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,720
Always? Doesn't he wake up
when you come home?

500
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,360
We have seperated bedrooms.

501
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh I see.

502
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,440
So you don't... I mean I don't
like to seem like I'm prying

503
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
- but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
- No we don't.

504
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,680
Well how long has
this been going on.

505
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,920
- Forgot it.
- Wait a minute, Why do you hurry?

506
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
See if you can guess.

507
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,480
Well I can't.

508
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,880
Think real hard, Benjamin.

509
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,320
I can't see why you did, unless

510
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,240
You didn't have to marry
him or anything, did you?

511
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,720
Don't tell Elaine.

512
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,920
Oh no. You had to marry him
because you got pregnant?

513
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,560
Are you shocked?

514
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,800
Well I never thought of you and Mr.
Robinson as the kind of people who...

515
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh, I know. Let's get to bed.

516
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,400
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

517
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,240
So how did it happen?

518
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
What?

519
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,200
You and Mr. Robinson, I mean do you feel
like telling me what were the circumstances?

520
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,120
Not particularly.

521
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,800
Was he a law student at the time?

522
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,800
And you were a student also.

523
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,000
- At college.
- Yes.

524
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,080
What was your major?

525
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Benjamin, why are you asking
me all these questions?

526
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,480
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

527
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,000
- Now what was your major subject at college?
- Art.

528
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,000
Art?

529
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,680
But I thought you...

530
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,040
I guess you kind of lost interest
in it over the years then.

531
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,880
Kind of.

532
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,600
Well how did it happen?

533
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,000
- What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

534
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,680
How do you think.

535
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
I mean did he take you
up to his room with him?

536
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,120
Did you go to a hotel?

537
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,560
Oh Benjamin, what does
it possibly matter?

538
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm curious.

539
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,640
We'd go to his car.

540
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,880
Oh no. In the car you did it?

541
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
I don't think we were the first.

542
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,600
- What kind of car was it?
- What?

543
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,080
Do you remember the
make of the car?

544
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,700
- Oh my God.
- Really. I want to know.

545
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,880
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

546
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,280
A Ford! A Ford! God damn it,
That's great! a Ford!

547
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,120
That's enough.

548
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,840
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

549
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Don't talk about Elaine.

550
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,440
Don't talk about Elaine?

551
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,800
- No.
- Why not?

552
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,080
Because I don't want you to.

553
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,640
Well why don't you?

554
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,280
I wish you'd tell me.

555
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,800
There's nothing to tell.

556
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,880
Well why is she a big taboo
subject all of a sudden?

557
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,000
Well... I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date
and find out what the big deal is.

558
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,520
Benjamin, don't you ever take that
girl out. Do you understand that?

559
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,440
Well look. I have no
intention of taking her out.

560
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,360
Good.

561
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
I was just kidding around.

562
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,540
Good.

563
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,480
But why shouldn't I?

564
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,120
- I have my reasons.
- Then let's hear them.

565
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,000
- No.
- Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson.

566
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,480
Because I think I know what they are.

567
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,400
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I?

568
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm not good enough to
even talk about her, am I?

569
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,720
- Let's drop it.
- We're not dropping it.

570
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,400
I'm good enough for you but I'm too
slimy to associate with your daughter.

571
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,320
That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?

572
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,760
- Yes
- You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

573
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,440
Do you think I'm proud of myself?
Do you think I'm proud of this?

574
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,200
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, I am not.

575
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,440
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time
with a brokendown alcoholic!

576
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,240
I see.

577
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,920
And if you think I come here for
any reason besides pure boredom,

578
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,400
then you're all wrong.

579
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,600
Because, Mrs. Robinson, this is the sickest,
most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

580
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
And you do what you want
but I'm getting the hell out.

581
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,360
- Are you?
- You're goddamn right I am.

582
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,440
That's how you feel about me.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.

583
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,720
I won't start this.

584
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,360
- What?
- Don't start acting hurt.

585
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,720
Don't you expect me
to be a little hurt?

586
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,280
Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

587
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,960
Did I say that?

588
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,760
In some other words.

589
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,120
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you
if that's the impression you got.

590
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,760
Well two minutes ago you told me
I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

591
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,200
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

592
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,200
I didn't mean it. I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

593
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,760
But I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

594
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,480
- You wouldn't.
- Of course I wouldn't.

595
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,320
What are you doing?

596
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,600
Well it's pretty obvious you
don't want me around any more.

597
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,200
Well look...
I was kind of upset there.

598
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,680
I'm sorry I said those things.

599
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,360
That's all right. I think I can
understand why I'm disgusting to you.

600
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,960
Oh no. Look, I like you.
I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

601
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,600
- But if it's sickening for you...
- It's not!

602
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,680
I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the
one thing I have to look forward to.

603
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,200
You don't have to say that.

604
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,160
Well I wouldn't. I would
never say it if it wasn't true.

605
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,600
May I stay then?

606
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,200
Yes. Please. I want you to.

607
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,900
Thank you.

608
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,640
Well don't thank me,
because I want you to.

609
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,080
But you won't ever take Elaine out, will you?
I want you to promise me that.

610
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,600
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up.
It never occured to me to take her out.

611
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,080
Then give me your word you won't.

612
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,680
- This is absurd.
- Promise me, Benjamin.

613
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,000
All right, I promise, for christ's sake.

614
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,200
I promise I will never take
out Elaine Robinson.

615
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,760
Thank you.

616
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
- Benjamin.
- Let's not talk about it.

617
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,320
Let's not talk at all.

618
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,520
Elaine's back from school.

619
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,600
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

620
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,320
Suppose she's not good
enough for you, is that it?

621
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,680
Look... Elaine Robinson and I
do not get along.

622
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,920
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school.

623
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,840
Suppose your evenings, whatever
you do with them, are just too valuable.

624
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,240
That has nothing to do with it...

625
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,680
I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson

626
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,520
that you're too busy every
evening... doing God knows what...

627
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,440
Don't go on like this.

628
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,720
- If Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out...
- I do.

629
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,880
- then I'll simply invite all the
Robinsons' over on Thursday.

630
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,200
Well, Braddock... it's about
time you got around to this.

631
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,720
Hello.

632
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,680
Come on in. I'm afraid the young
lady isn't quite ready yet.

633
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,360
Hey, what would you say to a short one?

634
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,160
- Scotch still your drink?
- Bourbon.

635
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,320
Well I'll see if she's ready.

636
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,120
Now listen, this was not my
idea. It was my father's idea.

637
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,200
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

638
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,520
Look, we'll go out to dinner and
have a drink and I'll bring her right back.

639
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,640
Because it was either that or a
dinner party for the two families.

640
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,040
And I'm afriad I couldn't quite
handle that, if you don't mind.

641
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,240
Look, I have no intention of ever taking
your precious daughter out again in her life.

642
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,680
So don't get upset about it.

643
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,600
But I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

644
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,680
Hello.

645
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,500
Hello.

646
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,760
Well, I want you to keep your wits
about you tonight.

647
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,640
You never know what tricks
Ben picked up back there in the East.

648
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,440
- You're living at home now. Is that right?
- Yes.

649
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,280
- Do you know what you're going to do?
- No.

650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
- Are you going to graduate school?
- No.

651
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,400
- Do you always drive like this?
- Yes.

652
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,500
Sit down.

653
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,000
Why don't you watch the show?

654
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,480
Benjamin, do you dislike
me for some reason?

655
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,000
No... why should I?

656
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,500
I don't know.

657
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You're missing a great effect there.

658
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,960
Are you like that?

659
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,480
Could you do it?

660
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,720
- Stop.
- Hey!

661
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,500
Elaine, I'm sorry.

662
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,540
Will you take me home now?

663
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,020
I'm sorry I took you in there.

664
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,220
I think I'd better go
home now, please.

665
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,340
- Where is the car?
- I just want to tell you something.

666
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,060
- I want to go home.
- But could I just tell you this one thing?

667
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,960
- What?
- This whole idea, this date and everything.

668
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,180
It was my parents' idea.
They forced me into it.

669
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,780
Oh... that's very nice of
you to tell me.

670
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,460
No. What I mean is... that's
why I've been acting this way.

671
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,940
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.

672
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,180
Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

673
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,400
No, I couldn't.

674
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,380
- But could you try?
- No.

675
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,620
I've had this feeling ever
since I've graduated.

676
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,580
This kind of compulsion that I have to be rude
all the time. You know what I mean?

677
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,540
Yes, I do.

678
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,100
It's like I've been playing
some kind of... game...

679
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,140
but the rudes
don't make any sense to me.

680
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,900
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

681
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,820
No, I mean no one makes them up,
they seem to have made themselves up.

682
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,940
Hey... I wonder if I could request
you to turn that down a little?

683
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,660
Would you like to come in?
I could make us some coffee.

684
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,420
No, I mean... I wouldn't
want to wake anyone up.

685
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,580
We won't. Let's go inside.

686
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,740
- Wait a minute.
- Is anything wrong?

687
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,100
No... I was just thinking.
It's still early.

688
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,060
We could do something,
go somewhere else.

689
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,700
All right.

690
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,420
Where we going?

691
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,380
I'm trying to think of where there's a place
to have a drink around here.

692
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,300
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?

693
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,180
What is the matter?

694
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,940
Nothing. I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

695
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,260
I mean let's go see.
Let's go see if they do or not.

696
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,780
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there isn't a bar here.

697
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,740
I mean... as far as I know.

698
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,940
Of course there is. Look, there is
Veranda Room, right there.

699
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,900
Good evening.

700
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,220
Hello, how are you, sir?

701
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,740
Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

702
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,340
Hello again.

703
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,860
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

704
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,380
Benjamin...

705
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,540
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

706
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,100
- Do they know you?
- Of course not.

707
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,140
Good evening, sir.

708
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,540
Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.

709
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,380
Mr. Gladstone... how are you?

710
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,260
Benjamin, what's happening?

711
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,700
I don't know. They must think
I look like this guy Gladstone.

712
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,140
Hello, Mr. Brannif.

713
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,860
Elaine, I like you.

714
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,300
I like you so much.
Do you believe that?

715
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,420
- Do you?
- Yes.

716
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:55,900
You're the first... you're the first
thing for so long that I've liked.

717
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,180
The first person
I could stand to be with.

718
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,260
My whole life is such a waste.

719
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,020
It's just nothing.

720
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,140
I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

721
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,700
Benjamin... are you having
an affair with someone?

722
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's not my business.

723
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,140
It just happened.

724
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,700
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

725
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,580
Can you understand that?

726
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,460
- Was she married or something?
- Yes.

727
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,460
- With a family?
- Yes. She had a husband and a son.

728
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,940
- Did they ever find out?
- No.

729
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,660
- And it's all over now.
- Yes.

730
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,620
I'm glad.

731
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,420
- Can we do something tomorrow?
- All right.

732
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,700
During the day?
We'll go for a drive or something.

733
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,580
Okay.

734
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,340
- You sure you really want to?
- Yes.

735
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,300
Because I wouldn't want you to
do it unless you really wanted to!

736
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,340
- I do.
- You do?

737
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,620
Benjamin, I really do.

738
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,260
Drive down the block.

739
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,860
Mrs. Robinson, Elaine and I have a date.
We're going for a drive.

740
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,780
Do exactly as I say.

741
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,580
- It seems to me...
- Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin

742
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,740
You are not to see Elaine again, ever.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

743
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,660
Mrs. Robinson, do you think...

744
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,780
I can makes things quite unpleasant.

745
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,600
How?

746
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:41,060
In order to keep Elaine away from you,
I am prepared to tell her everything.

747
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,540
I don't believe you.

748
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,140
Then you'd better start believing me.

749
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,260
I just don't believe you would do that.

750
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,300
Try me.

751
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,100
- Elaine! Elaine!
- Benjamin?

752
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,420
- I'm coming up.
- I'm not dressed yet.

753
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,980
Benjamin... I said I wasn't dressed.

754
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,320
You've got to go over the back fence
and I'll meet you on the corner.

755
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,220
- What's the matter?
- Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

756
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,260
- Benjamin, Benjamin.
- Elaine.

757
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,100
What are you doing?

758
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,580
- Elaine, I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

759
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,340
- That woman.
- What?

760
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,420
- That woman. That older woman that I told you about.
- You mean that one...

761
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,380
Yes, the married woman.

762
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,060
- It wasn't just some woman...
- What are you telling me?

763
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,740
Benjamin, will you just tell
me what it is all about?

764
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,260
Oh, no.

765
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,660
- Elaine...
- Oh my God!

766
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,180
- Please!
- Get out of here!

767
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,020
Don't cry...

768
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:05,020
GET OUT! GET OUT!
OUT! GET OUT!

769
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,860
Goodbye, Benjamin.

770
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,540
Say that again.

771
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,620
I am going to marry Elaine Robinson.

772
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,140
Well... Well... Well

773
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,040
What's happening?

774
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,000
Ben says that he and Elaine
are getting married.

775
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,080
I don't believe it.

776
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,040
- That's what he says. Right?
- I'm going up to Berkeley today.

777
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,360
Eh, come on, let's call the Robinsons.
We've got something to celebrate.

778
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,120
No, I think you'll want
to wait on that.

779
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,200
- Oh, they don't know?
- No... they don't.

780
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,360
Well, when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.

781
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,320
Wait a minute. You talked
to Elaine this morning?

782
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,080
No, she doesn't know about it.

783
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,160
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

784
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,320
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

785
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,440
- When did you two talk this over?
- We haven't.

786
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,720
You haven't?

787
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,320
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

788
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,880
No, it's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

789
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
But what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

790
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,400
She doesn't. To be perfectly
honest, she doesn't like me.

791
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,300
- You are student?
- Not exactly.

792
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,640
- What's that?
- I said "not exactly". No.

793
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,120
What are you then?

794
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,640
Well, I'm just sort of traveling through.

795
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,080
I like to know who's living in my house,
like to know what my boys are up to.

796
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,440
I'm not up too much.

797
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,840
I'm just visiting.

798
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,320
I mean... I've always wanted to see Berkeley.

799
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,800
- You're not one of those agitators?
- What?

800
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,240
- One of those outside agitators.
- Oh... no.

801
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,640
I hate that.
I won't stand for it.

802
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,600
Well, how about this for a coincidence.

803
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,800
I was wondering where
you were headed.

804
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm meeting someone.

805
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,920
Ah. Where?

806
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,520
Where are you meeting this person?

807
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,480
At the zoo.

808
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,680
The Zoo. They have a pretty
good one here, do they?

809
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,960
I don't know, I've never seen it.

810
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,040
Oh. Well, I haven't either.

811
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,200
I might just ride out there with you.

812
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,880
- Is that him over there?
- No.

813
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,000
- Where did he say he was going to meet you?
- I thought he said by the monkey house.

814
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,720
Benjamin... I would like to know
what you're doing here.

815
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,640
- Here? In Berkelely?
- Yes.

816
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,000
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter
Street, and I've been getting there some classes.

817
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,920
But you're not enrolled.

818
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,040
No, I just sit in.
They don't seem to mind.

819
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,840
They've been very congenial about it.

820
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,080
Benjamin... you're...
I don't know what to say.

821
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,600
Maybe we could get together
some time and talk about it.

822
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,320
Really incredible.

823
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,240
- Here he comes.
- What?

824
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,560
I've got a real feeling
that this is the fellow.

825
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,560
Elaine!

826
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,280
He certainly is a good walker.

827
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,760
Am I late? I'm sorry.

828
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,360
We thought you said by
the monkey house.

829
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,560
This is Benjamin Braddock.
Carl Smith.

830
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,680
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

831
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,040
- Glad to meet you, Ben.
- Great meeting you, Carl.

832
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,680
Swell seeing you.

833
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,760
Who is this?

834
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,480
- I want to ask you a question and then I'm going.
- Come in.

835
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,200
No. I want to know why
you're here in Berkeley?

836
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,360
- Because... I am.
- Is it because I'm here?

837
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,680
- What do you think?
- I think it is.

838
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,120
- I said I think it is.
- All right then! Yes!

839
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,640
Well, I want you to leave.

840
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,960
Well, look, I love you!

841
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,760
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything?

842
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,080
- How could you possibly rape my mother?
- What?

843
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,500
I don't understand...

844
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,500
I don't understand how you...

845
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,800
- how anyone... could do a thing like that.
- What did she say?

846
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,920
You gotta tell me what she said.

847
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,480
- Why?
- Because it isn't true.

848
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,400
Tell me.

849
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,920
She said that she was having a drink
in the hotel with a friend and that you...

850
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,200
waited for her in the parking lot and told
her that she was too drunk to drive home

851
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,600
and you would get her a room for the night.

852
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,600
And then what?

853
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,880
Then you took her upstairs
and you raped her.

854
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,800
Oh, no, no, that's not what happened.

855
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,640
What happened was there
was this party at my parents.

856
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,200
- I drove your mother home...
- I don't want to hear it.

857
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,480
then we went upstairs
to see your portrait.

858
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,480
- No... I don't...
- and when we got up in the room...

859
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,680
- She is my mother!
- she starts taking her her clothes off

860
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,000
and then suddenly there she was without
any clothes on. I mean really naked.

861
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,640
- Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.
- Who screamed?

862
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,040
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

863
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,720
Screaming is not all right.
Not in my house, it isn't.

864
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,800
It was just a visitor.
But it's all right now.

865
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,080
What did you do to her?

866
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,640
Look, she's all right. She's upset and
she screamed. But it's okay now.

867
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,080
- Shall I get the cops?
- What?

868
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,680
- I'll get the cops.
- Hey, wait a minute.

869
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,840
Damned look, see, here
she's having some water.

870
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,960
Now there's no need
for the cops or anything.

871
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,840
All right, boys, you can all
get back to your rooms now.

872
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,440
I don't think we'll have
any more of this agitation.

873
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,520
- Will we, Braddock?
- No, sir.

874
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,400
I want you out of here.

875
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,400
- What do you mean?
- You heard me. Out of here.

876
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,240
- What for?
- Because I don't like you.

877
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,360
I'm sorry I screamed.

878
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,960
Benjamin, when you came up here,

879
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,120
what did you think was going
to happen between us?

880
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,520
Elaine... right now I don't
feel like talking much.

881
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,080
I'm sorry about everything.

882
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,600
but I'll just do this now.

883
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,920
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

884
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,840
If you want.

885
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,160
What are you going to do now?

886
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,640
I don't know.

887
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,720
- Are you going home?
- No.

888
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,640
Well, where are you going?

889
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,840
Elaine, you gonna have to stop asking me.

890
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,160
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

891
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,480
I don't understand.

892
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,480
I don't want you to go anywhere.

893
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,400
until you have a definite plan.

894
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,560
Goodbye.

895
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,640
What's happening?

896
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,440
- Benjamin?
- What?

897
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,440
Will you kiss me!

898
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,720
Will you marry me?

899
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,720
- You won't?
- I don't know.

900
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,320
- But you might.
- I might.

901
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,360
- Is that so? You might marry me?
- Yes.

902
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,000
When?

903
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,920
I don't know.

904
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,280
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy but...

905
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,880
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

906
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,200
You mean you're confused?

907
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,920
Well, look, don't be confused.

908
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,920
We're getting married.

909
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,920
I don't see how we can.

910
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,600
We just can.

911
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,440
I have to go now.

912
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,760
Elaine, are you serious about this?

913
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,040
I'll think about it.

914
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,840
- You really will?
- Yes.

915
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,360
- We can go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

916
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,080
Or this afternoon.
It's a good day for it.

917
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,480
Benjamin, I haven't even
said I'll marry you yet.

918
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,200
We'll need our Birth Certificates.

919
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,320
I happen to have mine
with me. Where's yours?

920
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,480
- I just don't think it would work.
- Why wouldn't it?

921
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,480
- Why wouldn't it?
- I just don't think it would...

922
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,880
Tomorrow then... can we get our
blood tests tomorrow morning?

923
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,280
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

924
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,960
Why don't I just drag you off?

925
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,400
All right, I will.
Right after we get the blood tests.

926
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,600
I have to see Carl first.

927
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,720
Carl who?

928
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,720
Carl who?

929
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,680
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

930
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,600
- Who, that guy at the Zoo?
- Yes.

931
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,840
Why do you have to see him?

932
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,560
Well, I said I might marry him.

933
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,440
You WHAT?

934
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,640
How did he do it?

935
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,560
Did he get down on his knees?

936
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,480
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

937
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,720
No, Benjamin.

938
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,000
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.

939
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,800
He said he thought we'd
make a pretty good team.

940
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,600
Oh no. He said that.

941
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,840
Where did he do it?

942
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,600
I'd like to know where it happened?

943
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,720
It wasn't in his car, was it?

944
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,560
Good Night.

945
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,160
- Are we getting married tomorrow?
- No.

946
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,960
The day after tomorrow?

947
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,760
I don't know. Maybe we are
and maybe we are not.

948
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,480
Do you want, or do you want to
try tell me why you did it?

949
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,400
Mr. Robinson?

950
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
Do you have a special grudge against me?

951
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,400
- Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?
- No.

952
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,680
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt?

953
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,160
Or is it just things
I stand for that you despise?

954
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,560
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

955
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,560
Well, Ben, it was quite
a bit to do with me.

956
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,120
Now look, please!

957
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,640
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings.
Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

958
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,080
I'm not threatening you.

959
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,960
Do you want to unclench your fists, please.
Thank you.

960
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,400
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

961
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,200
I am trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

962
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,120
I am trying to tell you
I do not resent you.

963
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,320
You don't respect me terribly
much either, do you?

964
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,240
No, Sir.

965
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,880
- What?
- No, Sir.

966
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:54,280
Don't shout at me, Ben. I may not be as young
as you, but I still have pretty good hearing.

967
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,280
Mr. Robinson.

968
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,320
Have the decency to wait until I finish?

969
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,080
I do think you should know the consequences
of what you've done.

970
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,480
I do think you should know that my
wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

971
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,600
- But why?
- Why?

972
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,760
Listen to me.

973
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,320
What happened between Mrs. Robinson
and me was nothing. It didn't mean anything.

974
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,880
We might just as well have been shaking hands.

975
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,200
Shaking hands. Well, that's not
saying much for my wife, is it?

976
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,120
- You miss the point.
- I guess I do.

977
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,880
The point is I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

978
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,400
All right, now listen to this.

979
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,920
I don't know what I can possibly do.
But I think I can.

980
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,400
I think I can get you behind bars if
you ever look at my daughter again.

981
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,640
I have seen Elaine and I make
damned sure you can get to...

982
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,120
Stay away from me, Ben!

983
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,360
I don't want to mince words with you.

984
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,360
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

985
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,120
Is that perfectly clear to you?
And that's all, Ben.

986
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,200
You'll pardon me if I don't
shake hands with you.

987
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,720
I think you are filth.

988
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,000
I think you are scum.

989
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,480
You are a degenerate!

990
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,680
Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

991
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,960
I want you out of here.

992
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,480
Look, I'll give you ten dollars
for a dime. I'll give you twenty.

993
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,200
For God's sake, will you
let me use that phone?

994
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,240
I'll call the police, now.

995
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,160
Could I make one phone call first?

996
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,000
Get out of here!

997
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:48,320
Elaine Robinson has left school. Her
roommate is coming down with a note for you.

998
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,800
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me.

999
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,960
Because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

1000
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,720
My father is so upset
you've got to understand.

1001
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,920
I love you, but it would never work out.

1002
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,320
Elaine.

1003
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,800
Hello, Benjamin.

1004
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,440
Where is she?

1005
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,960
Hello. Get me the police, please.

1006
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,840
Where is Elaine?

1007
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,000
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.

1008
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:40,600
Do you have a patrol car in the
vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road.

1009
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,880
Good, we have a burgler here.

1010
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,800
Just a second. I'll ask him.
Are you armed?

1011
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,320
No, I don't believe he is.
Thank you!

1012
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,400
What have you done to her?

1013
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,120
I think we have everything quite
under control now, Benjamin.

1014
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,920
Would you like a quick drink before you go?

1015
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,520
You can't stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.

1016
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,600
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite
you to the wedding, Benjamin

1017
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,440
but the arrangements have been so rushed.

1018
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,440
What the hell have you done?

1019
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,360
Ahh. I don't think you'll have
time for that drink after all.

1020
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,200
- I'll find her.
- I don't think so.

1021
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:25,840
Say, fellows. Do any of you fellows
know where Carl Smith is?

1022
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,640
He took off in the middle of
the night to get married.

1023
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,800
Probably one step ahead of the shotgun.

1024
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,040
Would you happen to know where he's
getting married? I'm supposed to be there.

1025
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,680
Why not just ask Carter?

1026
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,440
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1027
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,240
Hey, Carter, where's the
Make Out King getting married?

1028
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,640
Santa Barbara.

1029
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,880
You don't happen to know exactly where
the old Make Out King is getting married, do you?

1030
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,160
I'm supposed to be there.

1031
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,960
Where side of Santa Barbara?

1032
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,640
I don't know. Maybe at his old man's house.

1033
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,640
He only told me these words.

1034
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,600
- Are you going to the wedding?
- Yes.

1035
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,000
Hey, tell him to save the piece for me.

1036
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,880
of the wedding cake.

1037
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,160
- Can I use your phone?
- Yes.

1038
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,120
- 657-2036
- Hello... who is this?

1039
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,000
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

1040
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,160
Is the doctor anywhere?

1041
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,000
I'm afraid Doctor can't be reached right now.
If you like to...

1042
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,200
I'd like to know where he is.

1043
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,080
Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's
wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.

1044
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,560
He should be checking in any moment.

1045
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,400
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's
brother... Reverend Smith...

1046
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,360
and I am supposed to perform the
ceremony. I just got in from Portland.

1047
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,000
and I've forgotten what church, you see?

1048
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,240
Oh. Well, I'm not sure, but you
might try the First Presbyterian.

1049
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,960
- That's on Allan Street.
- Thank you!

1050
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,440
Allan Street. Where is it?

1051
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:58,760
Alan Street. It's, it's
6 blocks up, and 3 over.

1052
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,760
You need any gas, Father?

1053
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,960
Oh, Jesus... God... no...

1054
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:08,560
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1055
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,840
Who is that guy?
What's he doing?

1056
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,520
- I'll take care of him.
- He is too late.

1057
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:22,360
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1058
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,240
Get to stop him.

1059
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,800
Ben!

1060
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,160
You funky crazy buck!

1061
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,320
- Elaine, it's too late.
- Not for me!
