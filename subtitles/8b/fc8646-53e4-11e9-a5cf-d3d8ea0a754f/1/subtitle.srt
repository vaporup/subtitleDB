1
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,578
These ties of the heart...

2
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,175
are oh so lovable

3
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,289
And yet, I have such a crazy heart

4
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,563
No, not a word!
I've won the round today

5
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,332
I've got to Bombay before Jai!
Sushma...

6
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,825
You're late again, dad.
- Who's that...?

7
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,515
My flight got delayed
in London by 2 hours

8
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,617
Or I would surely have
beaten you at it this time

9
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:01,120
That's all right.
Try next time

10
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,522
So... where is she?
In the room?

11
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,859
Who?
- The girl

12
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,296
Where is my daughter-in-law to be?
You've returned empty-handed again?

13
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,801
You're the one the girls
are crazy about, dad

14
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:19,135
We can always talk about the girl.
How about wishing Mom first?

15
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:23,542
Have you met her?

16
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,808
I'm the first to arrive, but it's
your right to greet her first

17
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,160
I'm late. It's my mistake

18
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,429
And your son wouldn't meet you
because he wanted me...

19
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,330
to wish you a happy birthday first

20
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:03,616
You've given me a great son.
But there's one hitch

21
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,284
He hasn't brought me
a daughter-in-law yet

22
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,516
A daughter-in-law isn't everything...
all right, she is

23
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,524
I promise, I'll bring one
by the next year

24
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,460
But you're with me, aren't you?

25
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:19,632
He's still not willing to believe
that the plane-crash...

26
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:24,127
he still thinks that you will
return some day

27
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:50,323
I mean, I'll get a wrong shot

28
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,275
One moment

29
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,282
Give me the camera and stand
with Jai. I'll take the pictures

30
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,530
Say paneer (cottage cheese)
- It's cheese, dad

31
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:32,400
Cheese is too English, son. Paneer
brings out the Indianness in you

32
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,530
Say paneer

33
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:45,808
Wow! God has given you
your soulmate...

34
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:51,147
What's happening, dad?
- I sometimes think...

35
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:55,094
you do make a great couple.
- Couple...?

36
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:59,098
I'm Jai's best friend.
Not girlfriend

37
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,501
No marriage for Anita.
Only social-service, right?

38
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:07,098
Social-service...? You mean you do
social service in those clothes?

39
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,773
It isn't necessary to wear hand-spun
clothes for social service

40
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,279
What is necessary is to make people
like you dole out the money

41
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,114
I get it! I was only taking
a picture of yours...

42
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:21,517
and you're getting me on film!
Sit down and chat

43
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,113
You may leave, uncle. But you're
coming with me tomorrow, Jai

44
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,395
Apart from earning money, you must
also do some charity in life

45
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,298
It's good for the soul.
- But dad's waiting for me

46
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,301
It's only for ten minutes, Jai!
- Now look, Anita

47
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:40,398
You spoke about charity, I agreed.
You wanted a lift, and I gave it

48
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,474
And now...
- Give me ten minutes

49
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:48,034
I want you to the meet the principal

50
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,252
You haven't taken an appointment?
- No. She's here at 10 every day

51
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,187
I'm not meeting her
without an appointment

52
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,156
You still have 9 minutes.
Go and take the appointment

53
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:00,092
You're giving half a million
in charity, Jai

54
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,495
8 minutes...
7 minutes

55
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,088
6...

56
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,999
5,4,3,2,1 ... time out!

57
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:02,310
What do I see...?
You're studying?

58
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,218
You passed out of school
because I bribed them...

59
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:12,157
and bought the college you studied in.
And you're now studying?

60
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:17,663
You've fractured your finger?
No?

61
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,565
Know what? I bribed my way
through education too

62
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:26,330
I don't have the brains to understand
that. What are you saying?

63
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,586
Not you, dad.
- So?

64
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:46,858
So there's a girl...

65
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:50,351
My son's in love!
Fantastic!

66
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,798
And you've been scanning
the books for romantic lines?

67
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,792
I'll give you the best possible
line they've used in love. Say...

68
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,540
I know

69
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,145
That's exactly what
I'm trying to memorise

70
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,815
I love you isn't something
you got to memorise

71
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:14,152
But if you still must,
repeat it after me

72
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,156
I'd tell her, if she could listen.
- What does that mean?

73
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:21,320
She can neither hear nor speak

74
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,834
Now please don't play the
villain between us, okay?

75
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,337
In your happiness lies mine, my son.
And it's good too

76
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,513
She can't hear, nor speak.
She won't know when we fight!

77
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,681
Let's go...
- Where to?

78
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,783
You're the groom, I'm the guest.
Let's go and bring her

79
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,352
No, dad. I don't know
anything about her yet

80
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:50,288
You drive your car at
the speed of a jet...

81
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,392
but you move at snail's pace in love?
Find out about her folks

82
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:58,884
I'll prepare for the wedding

83
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:15,647
Would you know of the
beautiful teacher...?

84
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:22,049
Where's the Principal's office?
- Over there

85
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,221
I'm going to have word with her...

86
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,812
You went away yesterday!

87
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:31,816
Mr. Jai... who wanted
to see you yesterday

88
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:35,554
Have you brought your cheque today?
- Oh yes

89
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,657
Your cheque.
- You can speak!

90
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,159
You can even hear!
- You can hear and speak too!

91
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,324
What did you think? That everyone
here can neither hear nor speak?

92
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:50,559
Happens, you know. People often
mistake me for a deaf and dumb

93
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,506
I don't want to
give you this money

94
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,772
Not just this money.
I want to sponsor the whole show

95
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,846
I have a condition.
- What?

96
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:06,113
I want to help in organising the show.
- You won't be able to do it

97
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:12,280
I mean... what will you do?
- I can do just about anything

98
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,794
Dusting the chairs, perhaps.
Or hammering in a nail...

99
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:18,330
or just gaping at you.
- What?

100
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:22,290
I mean, you can hear and speak.
So can I...

101
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:28,629
it's these kids who
need to be looked after

102
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:12,117
Who's there...?
Who is it?

103
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:16,111
Me. Only me
- What are you doing up there?

104
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,519
Following you...
I mean, with lights

105
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,528
That isn't your job.
Please come down

106
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,623
I told you I could do
just about anything, I...

107
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:35,627
Are you all right?

108
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,307
The sand saved me

109
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:56,489
You asked me to come down...
I took the shortcut

110
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:27,521
Ever since I fell
in love with you...

111
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:39,804
I can't go to sleep,
nor do I have any peace

112
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:53,585
Your choice.
- How did you know?

113
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,755
When one gets close to someone...

114
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,246
go on

115
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:04,763
one gets to know about
her likes and dislikes

116
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:10,100
I always thought I'd have to
be very formal with the sponsor

117
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,272
But you...
- No formalities

118
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:19,263
No formalities.

119
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,772
So...?

120
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:28,518
You've become a part
of our lives so soon...

121
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:34,279
you don't seem to be
an outsider at all

122
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,478
Like it?
- Oh yes

123
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,247
And Mr. Sponsor wants me to
wear it during the show?

124
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,484
Oh no. Actually...

125
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,478
I'm lucky to have the opportunity
to wear such a beautiful necklace

126
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,756
Watch it

127
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,771
What are you doing?
- For memory

128
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,706
One day to go for the show.
After that...

129
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:25,109
After that it'll all be over.
This tension and stuff

130
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,279
And our relationship, too.
- Jai...

131
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,771
relationships are made.
They never end

132
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,307
What are you doing here?
- Won't you say something to her?

133
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:02,299
Are you crazy? I was just...
- Tell her how you feel

134
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,818
Put some sincerity into it. It must
look as if you can't live without her

135
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,169
No, it's not happening

136
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,172
Oh go away...
you're ruining all my confidence

137
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,510
Dad, please play Tia for a while

138
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:38,002
Come along, dad

139
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:54,232
Shut that mouth... please

140
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,293
Tia, there's something
I want to tell you

141
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,816
Ever since I have seen you...

142
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:15,153
why're you glaring
at me like that, dad?

143
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,888
Forget it, Jai.
It's not your cup of tea

144
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,257
Looks like I'll have to do something.
I'll tell her

145
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:22,318
Don't you dare say a word to her.
- I will too!

146
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:39,063
Goodness...

147
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,816
Goodness me...

148
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,323
my love, you are the one
I have fallen in love with

149
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,569
Goodness!

150
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:49,341
With my eyes, I have
secretly told you that I yield

151
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:40,564
How will I meet your gaze?
I feel so very shy

152
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,668
How will I live
without seeing you?

153
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:49,330
It almost kills me

154
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:55,780
It goes berserk in love with you...
my anklets won't listen to me

155
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:00,782
Pining torments me.
Love has been my undoing

156
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:11,119
Goodness!

157
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,421
With your name on my lips,
I spend my days...

158
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,824
I spend my nights pining

159
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,558
I remember every moment
the naughty things you did

160
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:54,772
My lips thirst for love.
The fire rages on

161
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:59,768
How will I reason with my heart?
It's so crazy

162
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:09,777
Goodness!

163
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:20,121
You are the one I have loved

164
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,796
Goodness!

165
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:38,549
You are my beloved.
You are the one I love

166
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,782
Thanks for saying yes

167
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:14,518
This humble gift... for you

168
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,122
To the beginning
of our new relationship

169
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:23,614
To the beginning
of our new relationship

170
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:29,790
I'll first have to say I love you
I've had it!

171
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:35,359
Whom are you talking to?

172
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:43,308
I'm glad I met you.
I personally wanted to thank you

173
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,416
It's because of you that this
charity show is a success

174
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,319
Oh no, I only put in some money.
- Not just the money

175
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,748
You have put your heart in it too
- Actually, you're right

176
00:26:56,094 --> 00:27:01,498
And I'm also glad I've met you.
Because I too...

177
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,703
Yes? Go on.
What is it?

178
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:11,263
May I say it?
- Of course, go ahead

179
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:33,531
That's all I've learnt...
for you

180
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:39,796
The first time I saw you,
I thought you were...

181
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,140
I've been all over the world

182
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:47,134
But no girl has ever made
a place in my heart

183
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:02,981
And I think you too...

184
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:35,281
Here's your beloved, Tia!

185
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:44,532
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
But my plane let me down again

186
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,807
What are you doing out here?
There's no one around...

187
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,244
has the show-time changed?
- The show is over, Raj

188
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,080
Shall we go?
- Looks like I'm in for trouble

189
00:28:56,081 --> 00:29:00,980
Sure, let's go

190
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:05,089
Tia, when is this programme of
yours going to be telecast again?

191
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,095
After all, I'll have to
watch your programme too

192
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:15,499
Please tighten your seat-belt.
We're ready for take-off

193
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:36,787
Say something, Tia... please

194
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:41,122
Tell me something. If you were
angry with me, why did you hug me?

195
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:46,297
And since you have hugged me,
why are you angry with me?

196
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,399
Say something, please

197
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,801
If not anything something good,
you may even scold me

198
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:57,540
You're not going to find
a lover like me, Tia...

199
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:04,807
I'm begging to be scolded!

200
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,314
I can make you open your mouth.
Which ice-cream will you have?

201
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,322
Give me an ice-cream that
will change the lady's mood

202
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,825
Be ready. The moment they
walk in, switch that on

203
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,502
And you... shower rose-petals
the moment he arrives

204
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:28,837
Astride the mare
goes the bridegroom...

205
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:34,378
with the sword tied to his waist

206
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,440
He looks so proud to have
found a beautiful bride...

207
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:45,075
they do make a great couple

208
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:02,139
Raj...
- At last, she speaks!

209
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,810
Looks like the ice-cream
has worked its magic

210
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:10,144
Yes?
- Do you love me?

211
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,141
Love...?

212
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:17,315
That's a very crooked question.
- Tell me

213
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:21,314
Tia, we've known each other
for four years

214
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:26,163
The first time I met you,
I felt a sense of belonging

215
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:29,327
Yours is the face that lingers
before my eyes all day and night

216
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,827
Whether I'm busy or far away...
you're always close to my heart

217
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:38,842
You're the one I will
live and die for

218
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:43,180
What I actually mean
to say is that...

219
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:47,184
I want to grow old with you

220
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:51,849
And some day, on this very bench,
I want to lie in your lap...

221
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,525
and have an ice-cream

222
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:58,529
Is this what they call love?

223
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,300
Why don't we get married then?
- Married...?

224
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,532
There's a problem.
- What?

225
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,810
Tell me, Raj

226
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,804
It's like this, Tia.
The two of us do want to get married

227
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:25,315
But who will marry us?

228
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:34,832
I had decided to bring your
daughter-in-law home today

229
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:38,826
I even proposed to her.
But at the last moment...

230
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:53,779
I'll do my best, Ma.
I'll do what I can

231
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,784
God... why does this happen
only to my son?

232
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:05,790
He couldn't forget his mother...
how will he ever forget his love?

233
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:14,135
Who's calling?
- I'm her friend

234
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:20,030
Tia, call for you

235
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,553
Who is it?
- Your friend

236
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:43,330
I have a request, Tia.
I want to meet you

237
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:47,905
Jai, if there's something you
want to say, tell me now...

238
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,574
No, Tia. I've got to
talk to you in person

239
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:53,444
I'm sorry, Jai.
I won't be able to come

240
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:57,506
Once... only once.
Remember what you said?

241
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,517
Relationships are born.
They never end

242
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:03,287
Do come for whatever relationship
you think we share

243
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,780
Cafe Bistro, at 5 this evening.
I'll wait for you

244
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:14,284
You will come, won't you?

245
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,552
Come

246
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,272
What is the matter, Jai? There are
no people in your restaurant...?

247
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:07,780
There will be no one.
It's booked only for you

248
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:16,126
Your choice

249
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:22,123
Tia, after the show got over,
when you were no longer with me...

250
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,294
I felt as if there was
a huge void in my life

251
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:31,139
Jai, you know I...
- I know everything, Tia

252
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,803
What you perhaps don't know is that
I run a huge business empire

253
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:42,310
M.D.'s and CEO's the world over
long to spend time with me and I...

254
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,657
I long for you, Tia

255
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:50,560
You have the whole world to
get on with your business, Jai

256
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:55,265
So why must you want to make my
little world your business?

257
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:03,106
Because I'm in love with you, Tia

258
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,777
I want to marry you

259
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:10,509
You can't turn an acquaintance of
a few days into such a relationship

260
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,518
Why not?
- Ties of the heart...

261
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,513
that you want to forge with me,
I already share with Raj

262
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:23,293
So why are you...
- Now look, Tia...

263
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:27,130
if you wish, we could right now...
- Excuse me

264
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,532
If you've called me here to seek
an answer to your proposal...

265
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:35,305
my answer is No, Mr. Jai Mehta

266
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:40,797
Thank you very much.
I'm getting late

267
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:48,144
I was so sure that Tia loves you.
She looked so happy with you

268
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:52,250
How could she refuse you and go away
with that guy on the mobike?

269
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:58,495
Cheer up, my son

270
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,498
Now listen to this!
There was this boy like you...

271
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,101
who went crazy looking for his girl

272
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,703
And someone gave him the idea
of advertising in the newspapers

273
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:09,773
Wanted wife
The boy agreed

274
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:13,277
He issued an ad...
Wanted Wife

275
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:18,511
He got thousands of letters in a week.
One thing was common in all of them

276
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:23,516
Guess what...? Take my wife away
any time you want to they said!

277
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,794
I'm only trying to change your mood

278
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,287
She came there, didn't she?
That's it, she's interested then

279
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,801
Her parents could have
made a commitment elsewhere

280
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,804
But she need not necessarily
agree with it

281
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,540
She isn't married yet, my son.
You still have a chance

282
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:47,644
Don't lose hope

283
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:51,547
Keep trying, your appeal
for love will be upheld some day

284
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:00,087
Welcome, Mr. Late Latif.
- Me...?

285
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,193
Who are you?

286
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,495
The master has sent these flowers
and a letter for you

287
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:09,762
He has also asked for a reply
- Royal style, all right!

288
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:29,275
These flowers are testimony
of my love for you

289
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:34,124
And I wait for the day
when you will love me too

290
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:38,289
The dust and pollution of this city
could make your beauty wither away

291
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:43,791
This is the key to the car at
your door-step. Your birthday gift

292
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:49,796
From me.
Yours, Jai

293
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:58,235
Give this back to him

294
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,256
Tia, tell Raj I'll be there
in a moment

295
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:09,749
Raj hasn't arrived yet, Mother.
Someone rang the bell by mistake...

296
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,367
You're back again?

297
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:20,496
I love you so much, I keep
coming back to get a scolding

298
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:23,774
This bouquet?
Where did you find it?

299
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:26,309
A gift of nature.
- Nature?

300
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,612
Yes. We were brought up
on wind, dust and water...

301
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,114
so nature obviously gave it...
- Where did you find it?

302
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:34,278
I found it lying outside and liked it.
I thought I'd pick it up for you

303
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,121
Isn't it nice?
- Can't you even buy a bouquet?

304
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,791
So you're late again?

305
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,859
How are you?
- Not nice at all

306
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,395
Nice flowers.
- He's brought someone else's bouquet

307
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,524
He can't even remember to buy flowers!
- Your love makes me forget everything

308
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,133
Why don't you forget coming here?
Or where I live? Or me instead?

309
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:54,538
I forgot that too,
but I had left my licence here

310
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,541
I saw a cop and remembered.
So where's my licence?

311
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:00,811
Which means... he doesn't even
remember my birthday!

312
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:04,314
My God! Is it your birthday?

313
00:40:04,315 --> 00:40:07,818
No wonder you're looking so good today.
For the first time ever

314
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:11,655
Look at him, Mother!

315
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:14,825
You know how Raj loves
to tease you

316
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,828
He can't digest his food
till he pulls your leg

317
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,164
Why did you do that...? You
could've spared her at least today

318
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:27,065
It's her birthday.
Now go and placate her

319
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:33,333
You look very beautiful
today... really

320
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,350
On this auspicious occasion
of her birthday...

321
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:43,582
I think I'd rather marry Tia
and take her away...

322
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,356
instead of giving her something

323
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:48,348
What say?

324
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:53,524
You're right. I think it's time
the two of you got married

325
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:57,131
But are you going to bother Tia
even after the wedding?

326
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:02,139
Absolutely. This fun and laughter
is what life is all about

327
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,142
So let's decide the rest
of the things too

328
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,806
The rest of the things...?
- I have no one of my own

329
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,648
So I'll myself have to
talk about the dowry, right?

330
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,310
Dowry...?

331
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:19,556
As you know, Raj... everything
I possess, belongs to Tia

332
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:24,161
What else do you want?
Tell me

333
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:27,831
Think it over, mother.
- Raj, what are you...?

334
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:32,169
I've thought it over.
What do you want, tell me

335
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,173
You, mother

336
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:40,577
I want a mother in dowry

337
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,847
I don't want to be orphaned
all over again

338
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,181
But a mother does not live
in her daughter's house

339
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:50,353
She lives in her son's house,
doesn't she?

340
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:56,789
Even if you don't call me your son,
treat me like one, mother

341
00:41:57,128 --> 00:42:02,619
Say yes mother

342
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:14,307
I have everything today, Mother.
Everything

343
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:21,547
Take your girlfriend to a seven-star
and she says she loves you

344
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,155
Here's the seven-star

345
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:29,826
Wait... where are we going?

346
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,318
Get down

347
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,331
Here?
- Where else?

348
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:37,824
But you said...
- Seven-star. This is the one

349
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,838
Even if it's a small place,
one must have a large-heart

350
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,842
You got to be hungry to eat.
Are you hungry?

351
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:47,834
Come on

352
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,783
Do something special today...
it's Tia's birthday

353
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:55,285
Will be done, sir

354
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:59,789
Please sit down

355
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,792
I'll be back in a moment, sir

356
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:08,284
What do you think of the place?

357
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:32,822
Why've you kept the plant here?
- It's the lady's birthday, sir

358
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:38,314
Oh yes, it is

359
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,163
You've changed the whole scene.
Why did you have to spend so much?

360
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:56,269
I have... so it's all right

361
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:02,116
Such a huge cake... for me?
- No. It's not our cake

362
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,621
Mister... please take the cake away.
It's not ours

363
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:09,292
Stop kidding, Raj. It even has
my name written on it

364
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:13,129
One moment... let me confirm

365
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,633
Any girl by the name Tia in here?
You, perhaps...?

366
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:19,803
I think you're the only one
who's Tia

367
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:22,138
May I cut the cake then?
- No

368
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:28,301
Aren't you supposed to close
your eyes and make a wish first?

369
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:39,222
I've done it.
Raj, what are you...?

370
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:44,714
Nothing. Just cut the cake

371
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,234
Where are you taking it?
- Let me serve dinner, sir

372
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:26,803
What for? We're going
to be happy with the cake

373
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:29,639
I'll have the upper-deck,
Tia'll have the lower one

374
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,475
Nice joke...
- I'm not joking!

375
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:38,308
Raj, I'll never forget
this lovely evening!

376
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,552
Neither will I.
After all those dishes...

377
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:48,044
I mean, we have yet to eat

378
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:55,598
Please get me the bill.
- Your bill has been paid, sir

379
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,260
Paid?

380
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,505
But please give me the bill.
- As I said, sir...

381
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:05,275
Maybe I look like a tramp,
but I'm a decent guy

382
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:08,611
You can adjust with me, if I'm short
of dough. You can keep my watch

383
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:11,381
Sir, you do crack nice jokes.
- I don't crack jokes at all

384
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:13,216
I'm a serious man.
- So am I...

385
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:19,015
and I tell you seriously
that your bill has been paid

386
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,529
This is strange!
Who could have paid the bill?

387
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:32,021
I know who paid it.
- Who?

388
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:37,793
Was it fun?

389
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,802
Jai, I've told you in plain terms that
there is no place for you in my life

390
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:45,882
So why did you...?
- So you're the one who sent...

391
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:48,651
those flowers and the cake...?
I'm very happy to meet you

392
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:52,755
What makes me more happy is that you
have changed the colour of our evening

393
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:56,248
Not at all. Such a big day in
Tia's Iife and this dingy place...?

394
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,495
I thought I'd make it
worthy of Tia

395
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:01,764
Mr. Jai Mehta, maybe you're
a big man...

396
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:07,504
but you have no right
to call someone small

397
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,273
And who gave you the right
to do that? Who...?

398
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:13,109
And you call Raj...
- Not me, Tia...

399
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,279
he called the eatery small.
- You don't understand, Raj

400
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,515
He sponsored the show
at our school

401
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:23,112
He even proposed to me...
but I turned him down

402
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:26,222
Ever since, he has been trying
to impress me. He's trying to...

403
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:29,784
create misunderstandings between us.
- Tia, is there room...

404
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,129
for misunderstanding between us?

405
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,532
Jai-saheb, we aren't married yet

406
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,634
But we've divorced each other
several times

407
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:41,404
Just think what a deep relationship
we must share

408
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:45,307
It's not your mistake, I must say.
Tia is indeed very beautiful

409
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:49,142
I call it my good-fortune
that Tia's in love with me

410
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:55,076
Actually, intimacy between hearts
can never be forced

411
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:57,754
It happens on its own

412
00:47:57,755 --> 00:48:02,492
Now for the bill you paid...

413
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:06,759
Please keep it.
For Tia's sake

414
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:11,257
Your arrangements were excellent.
The food and especially the music

415
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:22,779
See? This is how my Raj is

416
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,281
If you're so fond of
making arrangements...

417
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:28,774
my wedding is coming up next week.
With Raj

418
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:02,075
This relationship of hearts
is so loveable

419
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,254
And yet, we are
so crazed at heart

420
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:20,260
We are madly in love
with each other...

421
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:32,778
the whole world knows that

422
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:39,121
This relationship of hearts
is so loveable

423
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:09,548
Your kiss on my eyes, my love...

424
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:15,557
your kiss on my eyes, my love...

425
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:27,829
has made me blossom

426
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,835
You have made me blossom

427
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:40,344
And yet, we are
so crazy at heart

428
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:46,350
This relationship of hearts
is so loveable

429
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:18,811
In loneliness, my love...

430
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:25,318
in loneliness, my love...

431
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:37,163
I have called out
to you very often

432
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:49,581
We sure are crazy at heart

433
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:55,784
This relationship of hearts
is so loveable

434
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:39,836
Jai...?
- Raj?

435
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:42,171
What a co-incidence!
My motorbike has stalled

436
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:47,663
Come, I'll give you a ride

437
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:54,275
So where will you go?
- The hospital

438
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:57,511
Bikes are repaired in a garage,
not hospitals

439
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:02,124
Tia's in hospital

440
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:07,616
Which hospital?
- Avon

441
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:12,134
What happened to Tia?
- That which happens after marriage

442
00:53:12,135 --> 00:53:17,626
Tia's becoming a mother

443
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:22,812
I don't drink

444
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:25,481
Jai, my family will
be complete today

445
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:29,218
Tia will be a mother
and I - a father

446
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:32,822
This is the biggest joy in the
lives of those in love, isn't it?

447
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:36,158
Oh yes, I guess so

448
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:38,561
I forgot to ask about you

449
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:40,329
You've grown a stubble...
no problems, I hope?

450
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,562
Forget about me.
You're becoming a father and...

451
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:48,570
starting a family. How does it feel?
- Fantastic

452
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,109
Should I sing, dance, go berserk...?
I don't know what to do

453
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,513
Because I'm an orphan, I know
how precious the love of parents is

454
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:02,781
But my child isn't destined to
lead the life of an orphan

455
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,783
He'll get love from his
mother, his grandmother...

456
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:11,790
and what is most important...
the name of his father. My name

457
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:16,528
When someone asks him what
his Papa's name is...

458
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:22,405
he'll say in his
babyish way, Laj

459
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:26,142
My papa's name is Laj

460
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:29,806
The happiness shows in your eyes.
- Yes, I've found all relationships

461
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:36,806
Relationships of the heart

462
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:45,161
Aren't you coming in?

463
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:51,324
You ought to spend this time
with Tia alone

464
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,096
And Raj...

465
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:04,608
should you ever need something...

466
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,727
Tia, here comes your beloved
The nurse told me it's a baby-boy!

467
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:21,297
Here he comes. Late, as usual
- I'm not late...

468
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:26,292
Careful!
- So sweet! My little boy!

469
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:30,306
He's taken after me, hasn't he?
- Yes

470
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:33,809
But his eyes are like Tia's

471
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,147
His eyes, nose, cheeks,
ears, mouth...

472
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:42,251
are all like Tia's.
The rest is all like you

473
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:44,887
See? Your mother and my mother
have ganged up together

474
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,323
But that's all right.
You're going to be my darling boy

475
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:52,161
I'll give you all the love...

476
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:57,596
I never had in my childhood

477
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:12,776
You have given me the relationship
I probably wasn't destined to have

478
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:42,535
You have given me
the cheerfulness of the Sun

479
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:48,314
You have given me
the calmness of the Moon

480
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,757
You have given me
every happiness

481
00:56:56,093 --> 00:57:00,757
You are very kind, my dear lady

482
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:06,759
You are very kind, my dear lady

483
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:13,106
We are so crazy at heart

484
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:19,114
We are madly in love
with each other...

485
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:25,111
that we are madly in love
with each other...

486
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:31,522
the whole world knows

487
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:37,790
This relationship of hearts
is so loveable

488
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:43,796
This intimacy between our hearts
is so loveable

489
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:59,488
Don't cry, Anshu...
look, Papa's here

490
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:05,253
What happened, Raj?
- I'm tired, mother

491
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:09,096
I'm tired of life, Tia. I have
the same rickety motorbike...

492
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,434
the same irritating life...
shut up!

493
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:15,768
I thought my life would change after
you came... but nothing happened

494
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:20,776
The same old mobike!
- Am I...?

495
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:23,612
And I thought Anshu would be
bring me a stroke of good luck

496
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:27,777
But it's the same old motorbike!
When you can't get your motorbike...

497
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:30,719
serviced properly,
how is my son to blame?

498
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,780
Who's blaming him? I ask,
when Anshu grows up...

499
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,458
how will the three of us
go on the motorcycle?

500
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,519
On the rickety motorcycle!
- Yes! How will we move on it?

501
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:45,621
Like everyone else does!

502
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:51,303
Raj, we are happy. Even if
we're making less money...

503
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,576
we are at least happy, aren't we?
- But I'm not happy!

504
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:55,477
I think I'll give up...
I can't take the nagging!

505
00:58:55,478 --> 00:58:58,080
What?
- Why think? I give up!

506
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:02,245
Right now, I give up!
- What's gotten into him?

507
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:05,754
Go and find out. Go

508
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:08,490
What's gotten into you, Raj?
- I said, I give up!

509
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:12,257
I told you, I give up!
I give up this rickety motorbike!

510
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,765
For you, a new car!

511
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:19,268
A new car and an old driver

512
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:24,760
You don't want a new driver,
do you?

513
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,774
What happened?
- Raj has got a new car. Look

514
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,616
The office gave it to me.
And a promotion too

515
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:37,519
The post of branch manager.
- Why did you tease Tia?

516
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:40,122
For fun, mother

517
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:44,126
As compensation, let's all
dine at a 5-star this evening

518
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,790
5-star or 7-star?
- I told you

519
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:52,134
The two of you may go.
- No, Mother. You must join us

520
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:55,798
There are times the husband and
wife must go out on their own

521
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,874
We'll can always do that, mother.
- I told you!

522
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:04,813
Hear that...?
That's what Anshu wants too

523
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:11,306
Tia, here comes your beloved

524
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:13,656
Where are you going?
I'm your husband

525
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:18,647
I've got mother's permission

526
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:27,836
Park it carefully, please

527
01:00:27,837 --> 01:00:31,170
I could only dream of
such 5-star hotels

528
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:34,572
Give up these dreams. They're
part of someone's life now

529
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,344
You're right, Anita. But how
will I reason with my heart?

530
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:42,284
It still dreams of Tia

531
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:44,353
What else do you dream of?

532
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:47,856
Another promotion, another car
and another visit to this 5-star

533
01:00:47,857 --> 01:00:51,860
That's not what we are here for.
- What else?

534
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:56,799
We are here only for your smile

535
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:02,295
Your smile, the dot on your forehead,
and those eyes...

536
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:10,803
what happened?

537
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:21,824
She's my first and last love

538
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:25,160
How will I forget her?
- Who's asking you to forget her Jai?

539
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:28,497
I'm only asking you to take courage
from her memories

540
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:34,831
That's easier said, Anita.
It's easier said

541
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,843
This much would've paid the
grocer's bill for a month!

542
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:45,180
Do you now understand
what a 5-star is?

543
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:48,183
It's all right.
For the sake or our happiness

544
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:52,788
We don't come here every day

545
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:55,391
Shall we leave?
- The change...?

546
01:01:55,392 --> 01:02:00,883
It's a tip.
- So much...?

547
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:06,535
20 rupees should be enough

548
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:09,138
May I say something, sir?
- Go ahead

549
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:15,631
If your love is true, God will
always brings hearts together

550
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:19,148
See?
- He's right

551
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:23,813
If love is true.
- I understand

552
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:27,489
So you mean I'm not really
in love with Tia?

553
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,824
You are. But have you thought
of how much Raj loves her?

554
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:39,268
Have you thought that Tia's
happiness lies in Raj?

555
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:43,831
Have you ever considered that
if your love for Tia is true...

556
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:47,576
in her happiness must lie
your own joy

557
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:53,341
But why would you think like that?

558
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:16,632
Henceforth...

559
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,832
No more booze for me!

560
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,901
Here's my car

561
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:49,838
You won't forget your promise
after you sober down, will you?

562
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:53,509
So you don't trust me?
- I do

563
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:56,778
So your trust is perfectly in place.
Give me the keys

564
01:03:56,779 --> 01:04:02,611
I'll drive the car tonight.
Please! Only tonight

565
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:10,012
Here you are

566
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:28,141
Jai Mehta's starting a new life.
- Papa will be very happy

567
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:32,147
All thanks to you

568
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:33,308
Watch out!

569
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:42,310
What are you doing...?

570
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:49,326
You're in the wrong lane, Jai!

571
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:57,261
You've saved a jilted lover
from dying

572
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:04,760
Nothing will happen to you

573
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:10,866
Nothing's happening to you

574
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:47,779
Go to sleep...
go back to sleep

575
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:52,050
Raj and Anita...
- I know, my son

576
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:55,386
And Tia?
- The doctors are trying to revive her

577
01:06:55,387 --> 01:07:01,549
Hasn't she regained consciousness?
Please take me to her

578
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:06,481
Tia, my child...

579
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,554
Tia, look at me...

580
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:54,900
Doctor...

581
01:08:55,074 --> 01:08:57,375
what's happened to Tia?
- Everything will be all right

582
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,777
Why doesn't she speak?
- Please don't worry...

583
01:08:59,778 --> 01:09:02,447
we are doing our best

584
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:05,083
Doctor, what's happened to her?

585
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:10,021
Nothing can be said
about a case like this

586
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,390
Please arrange for the money.
We might need an operation...

587
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:15,724
You needn't worry about the money.
I'll meet all the expenses, doctor

588
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:18,830
But you must save this girl's life

589
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:21,399
Who's he...?
- Mr. Mehta

590
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,636
It's his son's car your
daughter had an accident with

591
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:30,074
Please come with me, Mr. Mehta.
We have many formalities to complete

592
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:35,907
We'll keep the patient under
observation all 24 hours

593
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:41,948
Mother...

594
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:49,794
I'm your culprit, mother

595
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:53,364
I've made this mistake, mother

596
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:56,534
I wasn't in my senses

597
01:09:56,535 --> 01:10:00,369
I was drunk. So when Raj's car...

598
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:11,882
You can hit me as much as you want to.
Give me any punishment you wish to

599
01:10:14,386 --> 01:10:18,049
Because of my negligence,
my friend Anita...

600
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:26,898
she had told me that
she wanted to drive the car

601
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:31,393
Had I listened to her,
Raj wouldn't have died...

602
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:37,475
Not Raj alone

603
01:10:37,476 --> 01:10:41,412
Under the wheels of your car,
it isn't just Raj...

604
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:47,351
you have crushed my entire family

605
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:51,550
My daughter...
she had just begun a new life

606
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:56,094
And you've turned her into
a widow, in just a moment

607
01:10:56,095 --> 01:10:57,619
You have!

608
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:03,632
Her son is longing for his mother

609
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:09,636
He hadn't even held his father's hand
and learnt to walk yet. And you...

610
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:14,712
you have orphaned him!
You have!

611
01:11:14,713 --> 01:11:19,776
And you come seeking pardon
after committing a crime?

612
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:23,387
What can you do...? What?

613
01:11:23,388 --> 01:11:27,381
Can you bring Raj back to life?
