1
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:05,222
Can you return him alive to me?
Can you...?

2
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:12,037
You can't do a thing

3
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,300
Nothing!

4
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:34,184
Accidents some time affect
a patient's mind so much...

5
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:38,188
that they either lose their memory
or remember things very faintly

6
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,033
Medically, this state is
called retrograde amnesia

7
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:44,333
Patients like them
lead a normal life...

8
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:47,139
but they can't remember their past

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,641
That's just what has
happened to your daughter

10
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:55,975
Simply put,
she has lost her memory

11
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,246
With great difficulty we have
convinced her that you are her mother

12
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,227
Doctor, when will she
regain her memory?

13
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:13,332
It might take days,
months or even years

14
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,934
Or maybe she will never
regain her memory at all

15
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,503
She might have to spend
a lifetime in this state

16
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,306
Nothing can be said for sure.
We do try to make patients...

17
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:24,504
regain their memory by reminding
them of past incidents...

18
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:27,512
but that's not how
Tia's condition is

19
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:31,847
The slightest bit of pressure on
her mind can drive her insane

20
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:38,919
She could suffer a brain hemorrhage.
She could even die

21
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:43,228
This is why you must
hide from her...

22
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,562
the truth of her husband's death
and her son's identity

23
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,066
That's not all. You must destroy
all things that remind Tia of her past

24
00:01:56,442 --> 00:02:00,310
If possible, take her to a place
where no one recognises her...

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,483
but do not try to remind her
of any old incident

26
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:09,321
Destroy all old memories

27
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:12,224
On this auspicious occasion
of her birthday...

28
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,826
I think I'd rather marry Tia
and take her away...

29
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,396
instead of giving her a present

30
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:20,332
But are you going to bother Tia
even after the wedding?

31
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,825
Absolutely. This fun and laughter
is what life is all about

32
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,455
It's great fun to be in a hospital.
Keep lying down like a Queen...

33
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:51,863
everyone runs around to serve you,
but I've never been ill!

34
00:02:57,103 --> 00:03:00,470
Mother... please listen to me

35
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,278
That which is destined,
is what always happens

36
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,014
Good things and bad things

37
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:13,884
But I was terribly upset
to hear of your loss

38
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,152
Loss...?

39
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:20,258
This is the first time I've seen
death at such close quarters

40
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,562
This accident is going to
drive me mad, mother

41
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,864
Give me one chance, please!

42
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:29,067
Madam, the doctor has forbidden you
from disturbing the patient

43
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:31,903
You're the one who's
disturbing us

44
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:35,840
She's like my own daughter.
We're very close to each other

45
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,844
Aren't we, Tia?

46
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,180
But... who are you?

47
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,275
What? Haven't you recognised me?
- Mrs. Bharucha...

48
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,856
Tia, this is Mrs. Bharucha

49
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,024
But you...
- Mrs. Bharucha...

50
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,527
Doctor Modi wants to meet you.
- What for?

51
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,123
He wants to ask you something.
- Ask me...? Let's go

52
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,200
He's in his office. Let's go

53
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:07,692
Don't ever crack such
jokes again, Tia

54
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,877
Please have your medicine

55
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,412
What was she talking about?
- I don't know what she was saying

56
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:19,904
Please take your medicine

57
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,089
What if I had said more...?

58
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,158
Someone or the other is surely
going to remind her of the past

59
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,220
What are you thinking about?
Mrs. Bharucha speaks of one problem

60
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:35,294
There are going to be many more.
I know, mother...

61
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:39,502
you hate the sight of me. I'm
responsible for whatever has happened

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,843
But I want to stand by you
in this hour of crisis

63
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:48,007
I want to devote my entire life
in the service of your family

64
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,176
Sister... wounds heal with treatment

65
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,020
And grief is alleviated
when you share it

66
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:59,515
What do you want me to do?
To forget everything and forgive him?

67
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,425
Him?

68
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:05,931
Only till Tia regains her memory.
After that...

69
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,200
I'll accept any decision
the two of you take

70
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:12,534
Please give me one opportunity
to make up for my blunder

71
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:19,173
All right. So you don't want
to give my son this opportunity

72
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,214
Don't forgive him.
Do as you wish...

73
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:27,886
tell your daughter the truth
and kill her!

74
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,022
I'm trying to reason with her,
but she...

75
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:35,289
Madam, in a car accident,
people pay money to hush up matters

76
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:39,160
No one comes forward to take
responsibility for the dead or ailing

77
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,901
But my son has taken this step.
On his own responsibility...

78
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,938
he wants to take you folks
far away from this place...

79
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,170
so that no acquaintance
will rake up the past...

80
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,713
and become the reason
for her death

81
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:59,481
But you aren't letting that happen.
Because you own their lives, you see!

82
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:05,922
Because of my son's mistake,
Raj lost his life. But you...

83
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:10,253
you will lose your daughter because
of your arrogance and stubbornness

84
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:15,100
Whether you forgive my son or not,
you must at least think...

85
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:21,365
of your daughter and
your grandson's future

86
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,870
We were going to South Africa,
to your best friend Anita's house

87
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,585
When the car met with an accident...

88
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,885
Anita and Jai were also there
with you in the car

89
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,119
You lost your memory in the accident
and Anita lost her life

90
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:47,896
Anshu is Anita and Jai's son...
he loves you very much

91
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:51,503
You're his aunt, after all

92
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:56,908
If you stay with him, he won't
feel the absence of a mother

93
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:02,647
As the doctors have said...

94
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:06,516
there will be an improvement in your
health, if you go to a new place

95
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:12,090
That is why Jai is
taking us with him

96
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:15,185
Don't cry, Anshu...
enough, my child...

97
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,597
Give him to me

98
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,227
Come to me, my son...
come to your aunt

99
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:37,109
You're doing so much for us...
mother has told me

100
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:43,054
Don't say thanks, please

101
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,582
I'm the one responsible for
whatever has happened to you

102
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:51,990
The truth is that
when I think of your loss...

103
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:58,393
I find my own grief
to be so very little

104
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:50,221
My P.A., Swami
- How's the little boss..? Anuj!

105
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:54,886
You haven't recognised Uncle Swami?
- His name is Anshu, not Anuj

106
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:00,321
Sorry. Faux pas.
- You must think before you speak

107
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:07,231
She's stern.
- Bring the luggage in your car, Swami

108
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,909
They'll come in my car.
- Take the baby, Tia

109
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,401
Give him to me

110
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,703
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

111
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:15,206
Get their luggage from the car
and show them to their room

112
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,836
If there is anything you need,
please let me know

113
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:06,784
Anshu's crying

114
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:14,599
Swami, why's he crying?

115
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,902
Looks like he needs servicing

116
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,939
We'll have to change his nappies

117
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,341
You mean me? I'm his dad, after all

118
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:41,390
When you grow up...
join the fire brigade!

119
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:48,625
Sir, here I go for a dry-cleaning

120
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,370
You don't know how to take care
of a child

121
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,472
I'll learn.
- Why haven't you yet?

122
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,607
I didn't have a child...

123
00:11:56,608 --> 00:12:00,945
I mean, he always clung to his mother

124
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:04,211
Henceforth, he'll cling
to his aunt. Right, Anshu?

125
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,886
By the way, who has
he taken after?

126
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:15,383
He's exactly like his mother.
The same lovely eyes, the smile...

127
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:21,986
the beautiful moon-like face

128
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,868
Come, steal my heart...

129
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:01,135
my sweet little angel

130
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:05,867
Give me a smile...

131
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:09,080
my sweet little angel

132
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:13,450
I have always been
in love with you...

133
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:18,084
but how do I tell you?

134
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,890
You do not understand
how I pine

135
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,830
Come, steal my heart...

136
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:29,995
my sweet little angel

137
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,904
Give me a smile...

138
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:37,308
my sweet little angel

139
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:03,594
My life now revolves
around you

140
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,467
My hopes are all pinned on you

141
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:13,408
The sight of you
makes me realise...

142
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,213
you are the one
my breath is tied to

143
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:21,219
Make me forget my woes...

144
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,486
my sweet little child

145
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:32,827
Do smile, my sweet little angel

146
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:39,462
Come, steal my heart

147
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:13,861
I live in a world
of your memories

148
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:18,266
Never can my heart
ever forget you

149
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,380
You mean the life to me.
Come, let me show you...

150
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:28,282
every time my heart beats,
it craves for you

151
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:35,484
Put me to a test,
O sweet little angel...

152
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,496
Do smile...

153
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:42,900
O sweet little child

154
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:48,199
I have always been
in love with you...

155
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:52,907
but how do I tell you?

156
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:57,471
You do not understand
how I pine

157
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:00,451
Come, steal my heart...

158
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:04,582
my sweet little angel

159
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,458
Give me a smile...

160
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:12,260
my sweet little child

161
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:45,382
I've brought tea for you

162
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,901
Tea.
- No, I've already drunk some

163
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:57,064
Have it. I don't make a bad cuppa

164
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:08,919
It's so hot...
and you drank it all in one gulp?

165
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,589
Yes, actually I'm getting late
for my office

166
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:17,581
Sit down... while I finish my tea

167
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:36,880
So how did you find Cape Town?
- I have a long list...

168
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:41,051
how many things will I tell you about?
There are trees that remain standing

169
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:44,288
Mountains that don't
budge an inch

170
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,325
And the Sun... it rises and
sets at its own time

171
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:50,394
The atmosphere is pretty healthy
and cooperative out here

172
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,664
I've seen the morning,
evening and night...

173
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,934
I can see it all from your terrace.
Come over, if you have the time

174
00:17:56,935 --> 00:18:02,999
I'll show you Cape Town too.
- In that case, get ready...

175
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:09,804
to take you around Cape Town
is my responsibility

176
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:14,585
This is Cape Town's most
interesting place

177
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,888
This is where the Atlantic Ocean
and the Indian Ocean...

178
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,450
after miles of journey,
leaving everything else...

179
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:26,862
merge together. From here begins
a new identity for them...

180
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:31,102
a new journey.
- And a new story

181
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:35,199
Like mine.
After losing my memory...

182
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:39,877
I am also moving in a new direction

183
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:43,147
I some times wonder
what my past was like

184
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:47,881
Was it better than what I have now?
Or did I lose something precious?

185
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,957
And then, I laugh it off

186
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:56,894
What is lost, is not coming back

187
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,058
And what I have,
I don't want to lose

188
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:04,435
You have come to terms with yourself
in this situation, Tia

189
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,894
But there are people in the world who
would want to live their lives again...

190
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,442
if they are given the opportunity

191
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:16,244
Jai, do you also look forward
to starting a new journey...

192
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:23,276
giving up the past like these oceans?
- Yes. I'm one of them too

193
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:29,059
But life doesn't give everyone
the opportunity

194
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,587
The past never returns...
memories are all we have

195
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:50,070
Shall we go?

196
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:59,875
Know what, Jai? I wondered how
I'd adjust life in this alien city

197
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,887
But you've made everything
so easy for me

198
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:07,882
In you, I've found a friend I
can be angry with, fight with...

199
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:13,387
and also love

200
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:18,102
How about an ice-cream?

201
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:20,504
Let's have our palms read

202
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:25,841
Sit down. I've shown many
people the right path

203
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,849
What are you getting into, Tia?
Come on

204
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,984
One moment... let's see
what he's going to say

205
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:37,352
Suspicions are but natural.
You can't control your mind

206
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:44,357
Extend your palm
without any hesitation, lady

207
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,634
Your nice times are about
to begin

208
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:54,004
A very bright future!
- Forget about the future

209
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,575
Can you tell me something
about my past?

210
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:02,613
About the days gone by?
- The days gone by...?

211
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,382
So you want to test
my prowess, I see!

212
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,918
Ask what you want to!
Without any hesitation

213
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,218
Who am I...?
- A girl, a female

214
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,447
Let's go, Tia.
- One second

215
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:23,534
Your past is all too clear
in your palm

216
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:30,027
Your past speaks of
a husband and a son

217
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:36,113
Let's go, Tia. Please.
- However...

218
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:41,946
your past is eclipsed

219
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:48,256
What does that laughter mean?
- You're getting it all wrong!

220
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:52,188
That isn't my past,
but it can very well be my future

221
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:57,868
I told you, they will say
anything for the money

222
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,304
Here you are. Let's go.
- It's God who gives

223
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:03,540
I'm only a medium! One day,
you will get to know the truth!

224
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,876
My predicition is never wrong.
- Don't take him seriously, Tia

225
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:09,880
They'll speak any lies for money

226
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:16,043
His lies could well prove
to be the truth

227
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:22,126
The truth is that you were
far away from me...

228
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:26,120
and I wanted to get close to you.
And now that you are close...

229
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,833
I must keep away from you

230
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:33,201
You have lost your memory.
And I've lost sight of my goal

231
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:40,844
I walk, but there is no path.
I live...

232
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:46,677
but I'm not among the living

233
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:53,017
Give me that photo.
- Can't I see Anita's picture?

234
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,837
Oh my heart...

235
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,279
this heart of mine...

236
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,850
oh this heart of mine...

237
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,844
when shall it be
worthy of you?

238
00:24:57,255 --> 00:25:02,746
My heart...

239
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,311
I hear the bridal shehnai
being played at a distance...

240
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:02,283
and I dream
of a bridal palanquin

241
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:08,256
That I will be your bride...

242
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:12,619
says the chiming
of my anklets

243
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:18,869
Every step you take is towards me...
for I am your goal

244
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:24,867
Oh my heart...

245
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,204
this heart of mine...

246
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:36,314
when shall it be worthy of you?

247
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:21,262
I shall love you forever...

248
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:25,563
you're the one
I'm crazy about, my love

249
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:31,870
In what words will I tell you...?

250
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:36,236
this heart of mine
beats only for you

251
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:42,886
Do please solve this
predicament for me, my love

252
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:49,292
Oh my heart...

253
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:54,053
my heart...

254
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,993
when shall it be worthy of you?

255
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:06,909
My heart... oh my heart

256
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:44,367
How did you find Cape Town?
- It's nice

257
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,195
I slipped on the beach, Ma...

258
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:04,167
Tia, go to your room and change

259
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,396
All right

260
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:21,318
Tia's speaking the truth...
- I want no clarification!

261
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,553
If I have agreed
to stay with you...

262
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,556
it's only to keep
Anshu and Tia together

263
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,493
Do not try to take advantage
of my daughter's plight...

264
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:33,055
and drive her wayward.
- But mother...

265
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,533
I gave only Raj the right
to call me mother

266
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:39,536
You mustn't even dream
of taking his place

267
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,870
Not in my life,
not in Tia's

268
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:31,488
The father won't telephone
and the son shows airs!

269
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:34,925
Come, mother

270
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:38,191
Anshu's so cute, isn't he?
Do you like him?

271
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:41,865
Very much.
- Me too

272
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:44,935
How about everything else?
- Everything else?

273
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,028
Swami

274
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:50,204
And Jai?

275
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:55,203
What is the matter, mother?
You don't ever talk about Jai

276
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:59,244
Don't you approve of me
talking and joking with him?

277
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:03,420
Every relationship has
its limits, Tia

278
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:06,890
But a relationship of the heart
knows no limits, mother

279
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:10,224
Which is why, despite losing
everything, I have a mother like you...

280
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:13,894
a son like Anshu
and a friend like Jai

281
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,228
Jai has defined his
own limits, mother

282
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:25,238
It would be good for every one,
if he keeps to his limits

283
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:29,179
The girl I wanted to
make your daughter-in-law...

284
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,615
is in your house today, Ma

285
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:34,847
But I still can't make her
your daughter-in-law

286
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,848
All I'm destined to have is
Tia's company, Ma. Only her company

287
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:49,894
Not her love

288
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:39,849
You thought you'd
give me a surprise

289
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:44,154
But I found the opportunity first.
Right?

290
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:50,351
I have another surprise. Come on

291
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,866
Your jacket, sir

292
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,869
You may keep your bag at your side.
As for the food...

293
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,863
Chef Tia has personally
cooked your favourite dishes

294
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,611
How do you know these
are my favourite dishes?

295
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:12,879
When hearts meet, one gets to know
of the other's likes and dislikes

296
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:23,656
Like you found out that
blue is my favourite colour

297
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,540
Let's make a wish today

298
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:41,534
Maybe this is the moment that
will bring light into our lives

299
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,852
And what will I have to do?

300
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:54,514
Close your eyes
and make a wish

301
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,831
What happened, Jai?
- I'm very tired

302
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:38,368
At least have your food.
- I'm not hungry

303
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:42,472
Listen, Jai...

304
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:48,002
How helpless am I?

305
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,183
I'm a shattered man

306
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:02,857
My heart is sinking...

307
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:09,528
and the shores are close by

308
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:15,865
What do You want...?

309
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,568
What do You want after all?

310
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:21,871
You took away my memories.
But I didn't complain

311
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:24,874
I thought whatever You did,
was for the better

312
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,211
But why are You distancing
Jai from me?

313
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:30,980
Why don't You awaken love for me
in his heart?

314
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:34,451
Complaint aren't the solution
to your problems

315
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:37,520
Every setback ought to be
your ladder to move forth

316
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:40,490
Your determination will get stronger
and you'll get what you wouldn't have

317
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,619
That's easier said than done.
Mere words of courage that don't help

318
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,896
They do help, my child.
- Child...?

319
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:49,065
Who are you and how did you
get into the house?

320
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,234
I walked in through the door.
- The door...?

321
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:53,369
All right, but what are you
doing in this house?

322
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,139
I'm here to meet Jai.
- Do you know him?

323
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,908
I've heard of him, but we've
never done business together

324
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:03,913
You mustn't. He can't respect a girl.
What business will he do?

325
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:07,509
He can't concentrate on his work.
He'll ruin the whole business...

326
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:10,653
and bring the old man on the streets!
- Old man?

327
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,246
His dad

328
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:18,224
His dad, the old man! Thanks for
giving me the inside stuff

329
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:25,368
Can I solve any problem for you?

330
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,871
Weren't you talking about
a problem just now...?

331
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:31,040
Well, to my misfortune,
I've fallen in love with him

332
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,372
With Jai

333
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:38,581
But he won't even look at me.
The sonofagun!

334
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,584
Useless chap! He's earning
curses for his father!

335
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:45,889
There isn't another girl, is there?

336
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,259
I've been told that
Jai Mehta is a playboy

337
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,352
What...?

338
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:56,232
Get up! Up!
- What happened?

339
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:59,302
You don't even know Jai and
you're already bad-mouthing him?

340
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,670
Get out!
- Strange!

341
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:02,906
If I say something about him,
it's a bad thing

342
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,909
You weren't singing praises
for him just now, were you?

343
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,176
I'll go and tell Jai Mehta what
sort of people live in his house!

344
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:13,917
Who are you to interfere
in our family affairs?

345
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:18,184
Who...?
I'm the gun, and he's my son

346
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:25,353
You're his...?
- Father

347
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,621
Swami told me that you've arrived

348
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:41,878
You weren't even attending the
hotel's anniversary. I was...

349
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:47,574
The anniversary was just an excuse

350
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,664
Tell me something, my child

351
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:05,157
Are you convinced that Jai
is not in love with you?

352
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:10,301
Absolutely. There are only two
people who matter in his life

353
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:16,279
Anshu. And Anshu's mother

354
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,848
You're so right, my dear

355
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,183
But that which has gone away,
never comes back. Does it?

356
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:25,919
No

357
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:29,856
So Jai must also try to start
life afresh, mustn't he?

358
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,861
Yes, he must

359
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:35,320
After all, one accident isn't
bigger than life itself

360
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:39,435
It is. Some times,
an accident is so big...

361
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:43,202
life itself is dwarfed in front of it.
- May I say something?

362
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,538
Despite a journey of mishaps,
life still goes on

363
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:51,406
Absolutely right.
Yesterday is past-tense

364
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:54,951
It can't be changed.
- You're right

365
00:39:54,952 --> 00:40:01,289
Nobody can change yesterday. It's
better to forget what has happened

366
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,225
It's time for Anshu's meal.
I'll attend to it

367
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,132
Whatever anyone says, my child,
I accept you as my daughter-in-law

368
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,365
You will have my support in anything
you do to win over Jai's heart

369
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:22,378
There's a party to celebrate the
anniversary of our hotel tomorrow

370
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,539
So...

371
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:45,262
I admit, there is a limit
to which love can go...

372
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:53,266
I do agree, there is
a limit to one's patience

373
00:40:57,181 --> 00:41:03,882
I agree, my heart beats
only for my beloved

374
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:11,894
I agree, there is a limit
to which I can yield

375
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:24,838
My love, O my love...

376
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:33,841
O my love...

377
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:02,306
In love, when fear
gripped my heart...

378
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,873
this distance between us,
my heart could not take

379
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,422
I went so crazy,
I could understand nothing...

380
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:25,834
in love, when fear
gripped my heart...

381
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:30,229
this distance between us,
my heart could not take

382
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:35,240
Oh my love...

383
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:39,441
my love...

384
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,248
O my love, my love...

385
00:43:18,155 --> 00:43:22,819
In love, I must live and die

386
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:31,834
Without love,
I have nothing else to do

387
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:41,306
I'm not going to fear
the world anymore

388
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,243
Love possesses
every heartbeat of mine

389
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:55,022
In love, when fear
gripped my heart...

390
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:59,561
this distance between us,
my heart could not take

391
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:04,462
O my love, my love...

392
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:51,848
To fall in love, isn't easy.
It's very difficult

393
00:44:56,954 --> 00:45:01,288
Those that tread the path of love,
never find their goals

394
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,962
In love, you gain nothing

395
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:19,565
What is love...?
Nobody could ever understand

396
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,391
In love, when fear
gripped my heart...

397
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:43,228
this distance between us,
my heart could not take

398
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,303
I went so crazy,
I could figure out nothing

399
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:57,336
O my love, my love...

400
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:06,918
my love, my darling

401
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:44,884
I know how it feels when your love
is reciprocated with indifference

402
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:49,423
But I also know that you are
the only one Jai loves

403
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:54,903
I mean, you are the only one
Jai will love

404
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:58,908
We must find a way
to make Jai promise...

405
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:02,311
to make you my daughter-in-law
in the next 24 hours

406
00:47:02,312 --> 00:47:07,404
Promise, my foot

407
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:17,191
He loves you very much, doesn't he?
- Oh yes, so...?

408
00:47:17,994 --> 00:47:24,361
So...?
- So...!

409
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,878
Tia, why are you crying?

410
00:47:35,879 --> 00:47:38,481
Jai, your dad has had
a heart attack!

411
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,883
Come home immediately!

412
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,285
Are these clothes okay
for the death scene?

413
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:46,155
She's talking to him! Any clothes
are okay for a death scene

414
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:50,960
Jai has left the office.
Get on with the preparations

415
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:54,897
I'm so nervous, I hope I don't
really have a heart attack

416
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:57,967
We'll handle it, if you do

417
00:47:57,968 --> 00:48:01,165
The whole game depends on you!
- You remember the lines...?

418
00:48:05,108 --> 00:48:06,609
My son...
- Wrong!

419
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,911
Your heart is on the left.
- All right

420
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:14,009
Jai, after you are dead...
- Speak the lines properly!

421
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:16,852
It's your death scene. Not Jai's!

422
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:22,189
Jai, my son... after I'm dead...
- Exactly! Get that!

423
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:27,863
My son, after I'm dead,
buy a new house for yourself

424
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:32,596
Make a new house, I say!
- Settle down! Not make a house

425
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,305
I see, so it's settle down!
- May I play the role?

426
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:38,908
I remember all the lines.
- Here comes another actor!

427
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:42,278
But this is an original play.
We can't change fathers!

428
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:44,547
May I say something,
if you don't mind?

429
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,049
You're a very bad actor.
You can't remember your lines!

430
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,518
Bring out the pain...?
- I'm trying...

431
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:51,587
I'm squeezing my sides,
but I feel no pain

432
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:53,656
Bring it out from the insides.
- I see, all right

433
00:48:53,657 --> 00:48:55,891
Where are you going?
- You said inside, didn't you?

434
00:48:55,892 --> 00:49:01,986
I mean, feelings from
inside your heart

435
00:49:01,998 --> 00:49:05,167
Master Jai is here!
- Is he...?

436
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:11,660
Look, son. I've had a heart-attack...
- Go on inside!

437
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:18,339
What happened to dad?
- In your room upstairs

438
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:30,859
Have some holy water

439
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,962
Swami, what happened to him?
- He's going away

440
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:36,455
Tia, did you telephone a doctor?
- The doctor was here

441
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:40,459
He said it's too late.
There are no chances of survival

442
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:44,940
Hasn't Jai come as yet...?
- I'm right here, dad

443
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:48,138
What happened to you?
- Heart attack

444
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:51,914
You used to take such good
care of yourself. How did...

445
00:49:51,915 --> 00:49:55,112
Quickly say what you've got to.
You don't have much time, uncle

446
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,890
That's right.
We can't see you suffering

447
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:05,884
My son, you'll have to do
what I ask of you today

448
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:09,331
Of course, I will.
- Promise me, Jai...

449
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:12,568
after I die...
- Keep talking. Don't stop

450
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:16,005
It'll relieve you of the burden.
- Say it

451
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:22,844
After I'm dead, make a house...
settle down

452
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:26,915
But dad...
- Don't refuse, Jai

453
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:31,853
You've given me your word.
You'll do as I say

454
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:40,863
Anshu needs a mother
for his upbringing

455
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:47,463
I want you to settle down
with Tia

456
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:51,204
With me...?
- Anshu won't call you aunt

457
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:55,210
He'll call you mother.
Mother!

458
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:59,045
If you wish, for Anshu's sake,
I will...

459
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:08,377
Tia has agreed to the wedding

460
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:11,890
And Anshu's so happy
with the development

461
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:16,165
Promise me... that you
will marry Tia alone

462
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:20,536
But you know...

463
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:25,507
He's gasping for breath!
Say yes!

464
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:29,069
I promise...
- Will you marry me?

465
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,892
What are you staring at?
Nothing's wrong with me!

466
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:47,029
I'm fit as a fiddle!

467
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,090
The heart-attack...?
- There was nothing! Nothing!

468
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:55,201
I wanted you to promise that you
love Tia and that you'll marry her

469
00:51:55,372 --> 00:52:00,533
And you said it!

470
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:08,044
Does anyone joke around
with death?

471
00:52:35,845 --> 00:52:39,838
Perhaps you forget.
Tia's is the mother of Raj's child

472
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:44,186
Perhaps you even forget
that it is your son...

473
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:48,257
who has brought Tia
to this state

474
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:52,194
You also forget that Tia is leading
a life of illusions

475
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:55,197
The day she gets
to know the truth...

476
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:59,032
she will start hating you
and your son

477
00:53:00,336 --> 00:53:02,871
You seem to have
forgotten everything

478
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:04,032
All right

479
00:53:04,574 --> 00:53:08,510
But you must not forget,
Tia's mother is still alive

480
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,980
It would be better if you kept
only your duties in mind...

481
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:18,215
and left my daughter's and
my grandson's future to me

482
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:04,528
I seek your forgiveness
for whatever happened today

483
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:11,540
But if you could forgive Jai...

484
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:15,238
I understand your feelings.
But before you make any decision...

485
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,815
about your daughter's
and grandson's future...

486
00:54:20,283 --> 00:54:23,852
please open this boxes
and take a look

487
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:27,812
After that, I will respect
whatever you decision you take

488
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:41,469
Good bye

489
00:54:56,853 --> 00:55:02,685
Red: Bridal Wear

490
00:55:04,894 --> 00:55:11,363
White: For widows

491
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:52,063
Come to your aunt

492
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,909
Tia, Jai's father came to me to
ask for your hand in marriage

493
00:55:57,413 --> 00:55:59,915
I have agreed

494
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:03,285
You were against it till last night.
So what happened?

495
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:06,555
All of last night, your words
echoed in my mind...

496
00:56:06,556 --> 00:56:09,925
that relationships of the heart
know no limits

497
00:56:09,926 --> 00:56:12,928
I can't live with Anshu

498
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:15,564
And Anshu cannot live
without you

499
00:56:15,565 --> 00:56:18,867
And you... without Jai

500
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:25,007
This is why I have
accepted the proposal

501
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,409
But Jai always keeps
a distance from me...

502
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:32,180
I know. He stays aloof,
only because of me

503
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:35,884
When you tell him that
I have consented...

504
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:41,323
he'll surely agree

505
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:44,960
Do you want me to
have a word with him?

506
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:48,556
No, mother.
The past is sure behind me

507
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:53,230
But I want to see my future
bright and clear

508
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:58,237
I want to know what's
in Jai's mind

509
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:04,980
I'll break the news to him

510
00:57:04,981 --> 00:57:08,144
Anshu, you will call me mother,
won't you?

511
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:14,976
Once he starts, you're the
only one he'll call mother

512
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:22,397
You have found your mother

513
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:28,366
You have found your mother, Anshu

514
00:57:30,173 --> 00:57:33,870
Tia's life isn't like a piece
of blank paper, Ma

515
00:57:35,278 --> 00:57:41,550
It's stained with blood.
Because of me

516
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:45,885
She's in love with me today. But
what if she gets to know the truth?

517
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:52,224
For my happiness,
I can't forget the past

518
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:57,132
I can't forget it. I can't

519
00:57:57,133 --> 00:58:02,264
You had once forgotten everything
and prayed for a new life, Jai

520
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:04,003
Tia...?

521
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:11,903
God has today heard your
prayers and mine, Jai

522
00:58:13,316 --> 00:58:16,852
You don't understand

523
00:58:16,853 --> 00:58:22,023
My mother has consented
to our wedding

524
00:58:22,024 --> 00:58:25,187
My palms will now be adorned
with bridal henna for you

525
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:33,030
I shall apply the
bridal vermillion for you

526
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:44,378
That's not possible.
- Not possible?

527
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:52,521
Man doesn't stop living when he
loses his dear ones, does he?

528
00:58:53,189 --> 00:58:55,891
Both of us have had to
go through the accident, Jai

529
00:58:55,892 --> 00:58:59,961
It's just that I didn't express
the anguish I felt

530
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:04,296
I'm fumbling in darkness, Jai.
With just a lamp of hope

531
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:08,970
You are my lamp of hope, Jai

532
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:13,101
You... you won't understand
my compulsions

533
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:16,244
Nobody understands it.
- What compulsion is that?

534
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:18,847
My conscience is stopping me, Tia.
- Conscience...?

535
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:22,284
So why did you buy that gift for me?
Why did you write my name on it?

536
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:25,951
Why can't you tell me how you feel?
Why don't you admit that you love me?

537
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:29,483
Because I can't forget my past.
- You will have to forget it!

538
01:00:00,356 --> 01:00:03,553
Tia... what happened?
Why are you crying?

539
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,229
We are not staying here anymore.
- What's wrong?

540
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,893
Where is the need to tell Tia?
What has happened is in the past!

541
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,668
You forgot the doctor's words?

542
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:16,304
She could have a brain hemorrhage!
She could go mad!

543
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:19,107
Yes, I've gone mad!
I don't want to live with Jai!

544
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:22,444
And what happens of Anshu...?
- It's Jai's duty to think of him

545
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:26,108
When he won't take me as his wife,
how can I be his child's mother?

546
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:28,850
Anshu is Tia and Raj's son

547
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,553
When she gets to know that,
what will she think of me?

548
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:34,923
Are you then waiting for her
to regain her memory?

549
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:37,359
So that she becomes a widow
and starts hating you?

550
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,262
No! But I know what I'm doing!

551
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,864
You're giving her more trouble
by spurning her

552
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:48,937
You're snatching away from her
the joys of her future

553
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,533
Calm down, my child.
I'll make Jai see reason

554
01:00:53,009 --> 01:00:56,478
No, you are not doing that.
I don't want any pity!

555
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:59,881
But my child...
- You called me your child, right?

556
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:03,215
So come with me. Right now!
- We can't go away, Tia

557
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:12,653
You can't be my mother!

558
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:20,332
Tia! Listen to me!

559
01:01:20,836 --> 01:01:25,040
Where are you going?

560
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:28,135
Jai! Tia has sped away in the car!
Stop her!

561
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,200
In love, I must live and die

562
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:07,876
Without love,
I have nothing else to do

563
01:02:12,888 --> 01:02:16,824
Love is the intoxication
clouds my eyes

564
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,226
in love, when fear
gripped my heart...

565
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:25,831
this distance between us,
my heart could not take

566
01:02:26,836 --> 01:02:31,170
Oh my love...

567
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:37,846
my love...

568
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:49,850
Tia! Stop there!

569
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:23,191
What's gotten into you?
Have you gone mad?

570
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:26,161
I'll do what I want to.
Who are you to stop me?

571
01:03:26,162 --> 01:03:28,830
Let me die!
- Will death set everything right?

572
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:32,100
Yes, it will. Leave me alone!
- You're thinking only about yourself

573
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:34,269
You don't care for others.
- There is no one!

574
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,172
That's not true, Tia.
- That is the truth too!

575
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:39,941
Every relationship is fake...
- Nothing is fake

576
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:43,378
It's just that you don't understand.
- I don't want to understand!

577
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:46,014
Whatever we are doing
is only for your welfare

578
01:03:46,015 --> 01:03:49,507
I don't want anyone's sympathies!
I don't need anyone!

579
01:03:50,252 --> 01:03:53,588
I don't want to live anymore!
- You will have to live!

580
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:59,649
For your mother.
For your son Anshu...

581
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:08,134
What did you say...?
Anshu... my son?

582
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:12,907
Is Anshu my son?

583
01:04:12,908 --> 01:04:16,071
Wasn't he born to you and Anita...?
Tell me the truth, Jai

584
01:04:16,412 --> 01:04:20,348
Or else...
- Anita was only my friend

585
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:27,815
I was never married

586
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:33,827
The accident in which
you lost your memory...

587
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:39,234
killed not just Anita...

588
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:44,605
it killed Raj too.
- Raj...? Who's Raj?

589
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:52,003
Your husband

590
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:55,350
My husband...?

591
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:58,843
Yes, Tia.
You were married to Raj

592
01:04:59,922 --> 01:05:03,323
You and Raj were in your car
when it collided with mine

593
01:05:04,326 --> 01:05:06,628
I'm your culprit

594
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:09,464
I'm the one because of whom
this accident took place

595
01:05:09,465 --> 01:05:13,526
I'm the one because of whom
Anshu lost his papa

596
01:05:18,974 --> 01:05:23,206
Anshu is your son and Raj's...
not mine

597
01:05:24,947 --> 01:05:28,041
Anshu... my son!

598
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:13,425
Because of what the doctor said...
- No, mother...

599
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:17,865
I had to lie to you

600
01:06:17,866 --> 01:06:21,563
To keep you alive, Tia

601
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:34,182
I did whatever I had to, for the
sake of my daughter and my grandson

602
01:06:34,183 --> 01:06:37,880
But it's Jai who has made
the biggest sacrifice

603
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:44,626
He has done more than his bit

604
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:47,629
And still, he mustn't
have spoken his heart

605
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,698
No, let me talk today

606
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:55,227
Know what, Tia? You are the only
girl he has ever loved in his life

607
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:59,305
Only you. Not just now...
from even before you got married

608
01:07:02,244 --> 01:07:06,578
But he lives with a guilt complex.
He hopes for your memory to return...

609
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:12,906
so you will pronounce a punishment
for what he did

610
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:18,860
That accident was part
of my destiny, Jai

611
01:07:18,861 --> 01:07:23,564
If not you, someone else
would have collided into us

612
01:07:23,565 --> 01:07:27,126
If my words will help taking
the burden off your chest...

613
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:33,363
I do forgive you

614
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,552
Where are you going?

615
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:49,388
Uncle, despite being told everything
and getting to know the truth...

616
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:53,161
why don't I recall my past?

617
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:59,897
But I know today that
I'm a mother, I'm a widow

618
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:04,172
But Tia...
- No, Jai

619
01:08:04,173 --> 01:08:08,269
You've tolerated me enough.
Not anymore

620
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:12,113
Not anymore

621
01:08:12,114 --> 01:08:15,242
Wait, Tia. For my sake

622
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:19,852
You're only thinking about
yourself and your child, Tia

623
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:24,389
For you, I was a married man
and a father till yesterday

624
01:08:25,194 --> 01:08:29,397
So why didn't all this
occur to you then?

625
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,856
You know why, Tia?
Because you're in love with me

626
01:08:36,872 --> 01:08:40,865
What if I tell you today that I
love you more than I ever did...

627
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:45,913
and that I won't be able
to live without you?

628
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:50,283
If I tell you today that I want to
give Anshu the love of a father...

629
01:08:50,953 --> 01:08:57,388
and my name... what will you do?

630
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:04,058
Will you marry me?

631
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:39,033
My Ma has today found
her daughter-in-law

632
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:45,059
And Anshu has found his father
