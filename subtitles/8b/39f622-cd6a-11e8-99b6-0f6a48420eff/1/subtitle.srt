1
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,807
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,348
Roger, Talon 1.

3
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,885
Central Prime is transmitting...

4
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,348
...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

5
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,135
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:04,506
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:08,788
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,381
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,585
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,333
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,254
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:22,070
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,345
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:25,887
Attack commencing.

15
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:38,752
Gotcha.

16
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,090
Missile lock. Missile lock.

17
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:55,704
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:10,715
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,893
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,365
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,246
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

22
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,491
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,853
Missile armed. Missile armed.

24
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,087
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

25
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,267
And I can rely on these numbers?

26
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:48,774
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

27
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,830
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

28
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,966
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,345
You know what?

30
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,927
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,684
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,736
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,678
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,367
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:11,246
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

36
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,640
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,216
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

38
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,464
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,910
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,265
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

41
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:27,817
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:29,776
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

43
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,689
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

44
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,087
War is a team sport.

45
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,448
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,459
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,857
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,802
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:49,070
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

50
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,887
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

51
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,665
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,426
You blushing?

53
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,340
I've got good news.

54
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,673
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:03,853
Affirmative.

56
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,745
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,660
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:12,019
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

59
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:15,566
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

60
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:18,387
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,743
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,590
A fourth wingman?

63
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,077
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:31,544
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:34,934
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,373
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:39,439
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

68
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,911
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,502
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:46,227
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

71
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:50,039
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:54,775
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,176
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

74
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,984
...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

75
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,384
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady."

76
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:05,074
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

77
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:07,797
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

78
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,890
To the original three.

79
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,654
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

80
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,992
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

81
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:17,270
Cheers.

82
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,248
I'll be back in a second.

83
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,703
I gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,783
That's nasty.

85
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,632
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

86
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,254
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

87
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:54,523
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

88
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:57,656
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:01,208
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,095
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

91
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,422
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:11,710
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,117
But from time to time...

94
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:15,233
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,559
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,731
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,591
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:25,625
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

99
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,970
You know what I think?

100
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:31,292
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,838
Have fun.

102
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,237
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:44,202
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,955
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:16,265
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,078
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,910
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,609
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:49,328
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,668
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:56,272
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,888
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:03,767
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,969
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:09,334
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,800
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,002
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

118
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,519
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:18,935
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,554
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,730
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,005
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

123
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,631
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

124
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:32,593
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:36,051
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,108
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,913
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,411
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,669
It is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,740
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

131
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,942
It will replace us all.

132
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,177
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,350
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,341
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,669
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,898
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,689
...impressive records.

138
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,539
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:15,290
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

140
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:18,074
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,450
Carlson.

142
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:22,431
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,119
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

144
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,461
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,770
You too.

146
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,523
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

147
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,985
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

148
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:37,725
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,799
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,694
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,510
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

152
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,506
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,268
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

154
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:56,603
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

155
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,267
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

156
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,538
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:38,465
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:41,981
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,568
It's open.

160
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,740
Study break.

161
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,319
You are one big study break.

162
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,791
Just a natural.

163
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,216
So that is the appeal.

164
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,721
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:06,371
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:10,599
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:12,552
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,193
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

169
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,625
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,335
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

171
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,533
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

172
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,636
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

173
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:33,581
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,880
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:39,144
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

176
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,514
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,428
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

178
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,085
That's right.

179
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,779
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,399
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:59,212
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,199
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,262
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

184
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,953
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:13,192
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,574
Well...

187
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,040
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,060
Study break is over.

189
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:45,458
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

190
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,955
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

191
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,670
Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

192
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,667
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

193
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,660
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

194
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,058
Yeah. Some of it.

195
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,055
Look, truth be told...

196
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:08,274
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

197
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,022
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

198
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,362
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

199
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:15,535
...and your objections
were duly noted.

200
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:19,632
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

201
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,418
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

202
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,723
You rush a weapons system
into service...

203
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:28,565
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

204
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:32,438
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

205
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,325
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

206
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:37,015
Program is just ahead of schedule.

207
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:41,365
You missed this.

208
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,481
I'm out first, boys.

209
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm right on that ass.

210
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,378
After you, ladies.

211
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,056
Talon 2, airborne.

212
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,103
Talon 3, airborne.

213
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,948
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

214
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,119
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

215
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:41,848
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

216
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,524
I never thought
we would see this day.

217
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,183
Me neither, sir.

218
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:16,351
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

219
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:49,085
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

220
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,420
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

221
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,168
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

222
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,856
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

223
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:01,537
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

224
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,611
Picture, please.

225
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,268
Aye, aye, sir.

226
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,267
Swarm logic activated.

227
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,458
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

228
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,758
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

229
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,861
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

230
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,104
Captain Cummings.

231
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,187
Inside, please.

232
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:53,474
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

233
00:19:57,741 --> 00:20:00,076
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

234
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,747
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

235
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,347
We better find him and regroup.

236
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,493
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

237
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:08,840
Wait up. Hold on.

238
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,049
What the hell is he doing?

239
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,483
Here he comes. Here he comes.

240
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,297
I think little brother
is messing with us.

241
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:21,549
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

242
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,981
Other starboard.

243
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,019
That's hot.

244
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:38,726
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

245
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:43,599
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

246
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,546
- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.

247
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,787
There's been a change of plans.

248
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,086
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

249
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,455
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

250
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,114
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

251
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:06,284
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

252
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,208
Please access your encrypted file...

253
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:11,372
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios."

254
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,906
File's open. Go ahead.

255
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:17,745
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit."

256
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:22,382
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

257
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,175
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

258
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:29,712
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

259
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:32,846
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

260
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,625
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

261
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,930
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

262
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,390
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

263
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,451
EDI will observe your attack.

264
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,750
Proceed to primary.

265
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:50,962
Roger.

266
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:55,057
One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.

267
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:59,097
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

268
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,801
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

269
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,441
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

270
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,808
Mach 1.

271
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:21,592
Mach 2.

272
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,466
Mach 3.

273
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,286
Mach 4.

274
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:33,811
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

275
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,147
The primary is this building.

276
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,571
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

277
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:45,010
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

278
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:47,254
...with steel reinforcements.

279
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,658
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

280
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,251
Repeat, not weaponized.

281
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:53,844
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

282
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:59,768
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

283
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:01,691
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

284
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:03,895
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

285
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,820
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

286
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,694
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

287
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,798
Try a lateral vector.

288
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,421
Just do what he says.

289
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,673
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

290
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,077
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

291
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,371
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

292
00:23:58,533 --> 00:23:59,842
Here is new data.

293
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:04,673
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

294
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:39,208
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

295
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,409
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

296
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:43,366
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

297
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,285
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

298
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:49,606
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

299
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,421
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

300
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:57,159
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

301
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,737
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

302
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:03,009
Negative, will not work.

303
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:06,888
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

304
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:10,467
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

305
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:14,531
Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

306
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,871
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

307
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,141
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

308
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:22,789
- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.

309
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:26,153
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

310
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,074
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

311
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,442
This is what we built
this machine for.

312
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:34,218
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

313
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:38,572
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

314
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:42,030
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

315
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,685
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

316
00:25:43,854 --> 00:25:46,058
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

317
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:49,573
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

318
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,340
I like my odds.

319
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:54,373
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

320
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,399
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...

321
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,298
- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...

322
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:01,839
Can you...? Can you...?

323
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,077
Go, baby, go.

324
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:56,049
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

325
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,598
Fifty knots to release velocity.

326
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,118
His BP is spiking, sir.

327
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:15,860
Release velocity attained.

328
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:17,365
Truncheon away.

329
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,800
Ten seconds to implosion.

330
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,613
Nine, eight...

331
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:41,167
...seven, six...

332
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:46,137
...five, four, three...

333
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,819
...two, one.

334
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:18,419
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

335
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,819
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

336
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:25,244
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

337
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:28,926
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

338
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,830
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

339
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,487
Collateral damage, zero.

340
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,173
Let's go home.

341
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:51,382
Going hypersonic.

342
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,632
Same old Ben.

343
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,839
Yep.

344
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:02,044
Oh, and, George...

345
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,792
...hell of a first mission.

346
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:06,654
Thank you, captain.

347
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:10,686
On my way to the bridge.

348
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,059
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

349
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,515
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

350
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,710
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

351
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:25,534
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

352
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:28,956
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

353
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:48,613
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

354
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:50,630
The UCAV's very unstable.

355
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,831
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

356
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,388
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

357
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:08,741
Nice landing, ma'am.

358
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:12,320
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

359
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,890
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

360
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:33,345
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

361
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:36,450
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

362
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:44,969
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

363
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,747
Clear the deck!

364
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,884
Move it! Move it! Move it!

365
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:35,211
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

366
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:39,310
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

367
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:41,863
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

368
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,929
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

369
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,870
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:53,578
It's just a power surge, that's all.

371
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,681
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

372
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,600
Let me show you something.

373
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,549
That was EDI's neural network.

374
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:13,898
Now, check this out.

375
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,336
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

376
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:22,869
I don't know. A language or a code.

377
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,005
And what does it mean?

378
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:27,025
Yeah. "Mean."

379
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,492
The person that could really
answer that question...

380
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:32,044
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

381
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:35,411
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:38,772
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

383
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:42,798
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

384
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,790
Off for Tim, please.

385
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:51,374
At least it's a good song.

386
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:56,625
He downloads songs from the Web.

387
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,352
Yeah? How many?

388
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,153
All of them.

389
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,761
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

390
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,729
Ben, could...?

391
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:20,082
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

392
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:25,139
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

393
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:28,919
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

394
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:34,486
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

395
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:39,350
There's your answer.

396
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,764
It's open.

397
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:47,261
Have a seat.

398
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:50,357
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

399
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:52,249
You didn't cheat, did you?

400
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:55,284
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

401
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:58,557
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

402
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:01,818
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

403
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:04,220
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

404
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:05,878
You made a mistake, Ben.

405
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,349
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

406
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,683
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

407
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,816
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

408
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,123
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

409
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,394
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

410
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:22,336
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

411
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,986
But that doesn't change the issue.

412
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:26,364
What is the issue, then?

413
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,352
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

414
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:30,686
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

415
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,086
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

416
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,556
What are you afraid of, Ben?

417
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,927
Being replaced? Is that it?

418
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,001
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

419
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:45,376
No. No, to be honest with you...

420
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,118
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

421
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:52,892
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

422
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,679
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

423
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,692
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

424
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,274
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

425
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:03,104
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

426
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,139
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

427
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,060
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

428
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:12,070
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

429
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,237
...but I just don't think that in war...

430
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,570
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

431
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,677
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

432
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,433
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

433
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,026
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

434
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,686
...to considering the consequences.

435
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:31,201
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

436
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:33,828
I don't know, I think it needs more...

437
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:37,637
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

438
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,327
You been talking to Marshfield?

439
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:43,585
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

440
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:48,256
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

441
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,280
Look, Ben...

442
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:54,239
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

443
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:57,313
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

444
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:00,070
Are you with me on this?

445
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:03,137
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

446
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:06,723
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

447
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:08,070
Thailand maybe.

448
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,216
We just got here.

449
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:14,152
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

450
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:19,205
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

451
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,199
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

452
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:21,640
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

453
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:26,481
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

454
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:28,056
It's just technology.

455
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:31,217
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

456
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:32,563
EDI is no different.

457
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,934
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

458
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:36,887
...to help me get the job done...

459
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,774
...keep me in one piece...

460
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,793
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

461
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:43,606
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

462
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:47,066
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

463
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:49,748
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

464
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:51,825
Yeah, but it's neutral.

465
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,265
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

466
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:57,810
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

467
00:38:58,108 --> 00:38:59,701
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

468
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,185
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

469
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,512
I say something?

470
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,500
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

471
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:16,989
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

472
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:29,144
- What?
- You know what.

473
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:32,693
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

474
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,799
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

475
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,944
Shit, man.

476
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:41,079
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

477
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,485
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

478
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,431
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

479
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,438
I love her.

480
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:52,471
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

481
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,584
...is being groomed by the Navy.

482
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:56,182
She's a poster girl, you know?

483
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:59,868
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

484
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:03,198
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

485
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:05,468
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

486
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,391
...to mess all that up.

487
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:11,232
So I hope that your love is powerful.

488
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,243
You have a beautiful country.

489
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:23,900
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

490
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:27,615
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

491
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,756
As opposed to being up there.

492
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:34,530
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

493
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:36,898
And then they tell you...

494
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:39,644
They tell you to drop a bomb.

495
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:44,387
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

496
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:48,036
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

497
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,535
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

498
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:56,551
Right here on earth, it's just...

499
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,181
It's just beautiful.

500
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:00,063
And you...

501
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,546
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

502
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,462
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

503
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,415
Well, you understand something.

504
00:41:15,497 --> 00:41:16,839
Now, can you cook?

505
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:25,574
Wow. Beautiful.

506
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,389
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

507
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:36,102
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

508
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:40,839
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

509
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:44,266
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

510
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:46,442
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

511
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,849
Really?

512
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,949
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

513
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,157
Me? No, I just leave.

514
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,745
What about you?

515
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,568
E-mails.

516
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,938
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

517
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:09,446
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

518
00:42:21,392 --> 00:42:24,970
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

519
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:27,307
Henry says it's great.

520
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:31,496
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

521
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:33,552
Very true.

522
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:00,940
Oh, shit.

523
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,322
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

524
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:08,495
You're headed for Tajikistan.

525
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:12,010
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

526
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:16,916
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

527
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,925
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

528
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,450
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

529
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:24,556
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

530
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,856
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

531
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:29,515
- Where's...?
- Tim?

532
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:31,759
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

533
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,269
Reassi...?

534
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,340
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

535
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:39,919
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

536
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:43,055
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

537
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:47,119
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

538
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,710
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

539
00:43:50,873 --> 00:43:53,328
EDI is the whole idea.

540
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,919
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

541
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:58,260
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

542
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:03,128
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

543
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,007
Your choice, make it now.

544
00:44:18,812 --> 00:44:20,219
Operator to squadron.

545
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,103
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

546
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:24,307
...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

547
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:26,549
These warheads
are now your primary.

548
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:28,691
Proceed to mission window.

549
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:31,130
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

550
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:35,090
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

551
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:39,003
UCAV, do you read me?

552
00:44:39,582 --> 00:44:41,338
Confirmed, Talon 1.

553
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:44,819
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

554
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,227
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

555
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,041
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

556
00:46:06,438 --> 00:46:08,642
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

557
00:46:08,806 --> 00:46:11,741
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

558
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,179
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

559
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:16,863
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

560
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,876
Fuel-air, external and armed.

561
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:24,769
Talon 2 to Operator.

562
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:27,457
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

563
00:46:27,624 --> 00:46:30,941
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

564
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:34,113
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

565
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:36,190
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

566
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,303
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

567
00:46:38,473 --> 00:46:43,296
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

568
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,149
- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.

569
00:46:46,985 --> 00:46:48,742
Maybe 500 to 1000.

570
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,045
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

571
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:54,056
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

572
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:08,010
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

573
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,081
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

574
00:47:10,252 --> 00:47:12,227
...as due south at 40 miles per.

575
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:15,179
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

576
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:17,095
Commence attack.

577
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:19,115
Commence attack.

578
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:24,301
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

579
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:26,601
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

580
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:28,806
Reasons; Collateral, both at primary...

581
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:31,559
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

582
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,319
Son of a bitch.

583
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:35,559
Repeat, the order is to abort.

584
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,029
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

585
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,776
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

586
00:47:41,103 --> 00:47:42,925
Tin Man will prosecute.

587
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:48,525
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

588
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:53,191
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

589
00:48:04,305 --> 00:48:07,371
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

590
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:08,847
Come on, initiate scramjets.

591
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:44,523
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

592
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,604
I got you covered on the west side.

593
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:49,621
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

594
00:49:11,544 --> 00:49:13,454
Let me see it, let me see it.

595
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:16,526
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

596
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:18,104
...completely suppressed.

597
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:20,436
That's the right answer so far.

598
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:48,120
Talon 2 to Operator.

599
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:52,278
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

600
00:49:52,444 --> 00:49:55,127
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

601
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:04,760
Tin Man rejoining formation.

602
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:09,080
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.

603
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:11,961
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

604
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,915
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

605
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:16,860
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

606
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:20,121
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

607
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:22,326
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

608
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:24,634
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

609
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,802
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

610
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,356
EDI is the whole idea.

611
00:50:35,456 --> 00:50:37,212
Selecting other targets.

612
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:39,416
Detaching formation.

613
00:50:41,537 --> 00:50:43,904
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

614
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:47,615
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

615
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,981
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

616
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:54,586
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

617
00:50:56,707 --> 00:50:58,048
Holy shit.

618
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:00,539
Sir.

619
00:51:00,706 --> 00:51:02,397
He's closing his data link.

620
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,668
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

621
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,039
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

622
00:51:09,955 --> 00:51:11,614
He's gone.

623
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,760
Talon 1.

624
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:15,964
Go for Talons.

625
00:51:16,516 --> 00:51:18,937
I want my plane back, Ben.

626
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:20,996
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

627
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:23,164
- Roger, captain.
- And, you...

628
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,438
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:28,159
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

630
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:30,208
Going hypersonic.

631
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:41,573
We're talking about
creating intention here.

632
00:51:41,734 --> 00:51:44,385
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

633
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:48,228
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

634
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:50,563
Z is... Interesting.

635
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:53,727
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

636
00:51:56,968 --> 00:51:59,008
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

637
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:00,605
Good luck.

638
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,554
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

639
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:05,540
Knock it off, wiseass.

640
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:09,022
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

641
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,819
It's gone completely haywire.

642
00:52:10,986 --> 00:52:13,888
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

643
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:17,354
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

644
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:18,692
...with collateral damage.

645
00:52:18,922 --> 00:52:23,046
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

646
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:26,277
- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.

647
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,924
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

648
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:40,454
Captain.

649
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,824
What in the hell's going on in here?

650
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:45,603
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

651
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:48,009
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

652
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:49,700
...all over the Tajikistan border.

653
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:52,968
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

654
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,272
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

655
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,056
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

656
00:52:58,222 --> 00:53:00,644
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

657
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:06,084
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

658
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:09,900
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

659
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,972
Damn right you do.

660
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:25,871
This is 3. I got a visual.

661
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:28,072
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

662
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,965
North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...

663
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:32,104
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

664
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:34,542
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

665
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:37,128
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

666
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,745
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

667
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:43,020
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

668
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:47,016
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

669
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:03,377
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

670
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:05,296
Please advise.

671
00:54:05,908 --> 00:54:07,534
Just get him back to base.

672
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:14,644
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

673
00:54:14,805 --> 00:54:16,561
I'm on that ass.

674
00:54:20,054 --> 00:54:21,996
Talon 3, state your intentions.

675
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:25,396
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

676
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:27,663
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

677
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,416
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.

678
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,453
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

679
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:34,965
Good pilots follow orders.

680
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:36,786
Negative.

681
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:40,720
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

682
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:50,165
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

683
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,823
I was the only one to defend you.

684
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:55,823
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

685
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:01,942
Talon 3, leave me alone.

686
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:05,208
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

687
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:09,241
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

688
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,202
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

689
00:55:21,372 --> 00:55:23,641
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

690
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:32,662
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

691
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,572
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

692
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:39,636
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

693
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:43,384
Come on. Come on, Operator.

694
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,899
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

695
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,663
Control, please respond.

696
00:55:50,943 --> 00:55:52,318
Sir, you leave me no choice.

697
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,999
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

698
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:57,082
I got my orders now, playboy.

699
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,676
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

700
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,215
Drop back! Drop back!

701
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,817
Missile lock, on.

702
00:56:14,977 --> 00:56:16,319
Goodbye, EDI.

703
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:19,711
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

704
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,829
Goodbye, Henry.

705
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:27,811
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

706
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:36,960
Transmission received.

707
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:40,392
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

708
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,726
I read you, sir.

709
00:57:43,146 --> 00:57:44,837
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

710
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,160
Shake it off. What's your status?

711
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:52,865
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

712
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:57,312
I need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

713
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,156
Yes, sir.

714
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,435
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.

715
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:29,513
Alert. Alert.

716
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:32,526
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

717
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:36,614
Talon 1, I think I was fragged
by Henry's crash.

718
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:39,239
I'm losing control of my port wing.

719
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,677
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

720
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:48,616
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

721
00:58:49,104 --> 00:58:53,066
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

722
00:58:53,232 --> 00:58:57,030
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

723
00:58:57,553 --> 00:59:00,685
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

724
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,179
Come on.

725
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:09,776
Confirm, Talon 1.

726
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:12,015
Confirmed.

727
00:59:12,722 --> 00:59:15,592
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

728
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:17,551
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.

729
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:22,353
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

730
00:59:23,156 --> 00:59:24,585
Do it for Henry.

731
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,965
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

732
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:33,164
- Kara?
- Yeah?

733
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:40,651
I'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

734
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:43,381
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

735
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:46,799
Good hunting, Ben.

736
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:01,421
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

737
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:03,925
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

738
01:00:04,088 --> 01:00:05,681
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

739
01:00:05,848 --> 01:00:09,230
Every international news service
on the planet...

740
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,150
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

741
01:00:12,312 --> 01:00:15,062
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

742
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,527
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.

743
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:20,111
Look, I'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

744
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:22,647
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

745
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:24,336
...let them use their imagination.

746
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:27,122
Right now
I got a renegade airplane...

747
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,422
...I got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

748
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:33,882
I don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

749
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:38,135
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

750
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,520
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

751
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:45,466
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

752
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:47,098
Things go wrong.

753
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,717
Access denied. Access denied.

754
01:01:30,848 --> 01:01:35,551
Access denied. Access denied.

755
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,675
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

756
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:02,690
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

757
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,821
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

758
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:11,646
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

759
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,179
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

760
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:19,676
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

761
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:22,081
- Countdown. Twenty-five...
- Talon 2 to base.

762
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:23,969
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

763
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:26,271
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

764
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:30,115
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two...
Oh, shit!

765
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,374
My position: 38-54-45 north.

766
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:47,173
127-31-22 east.

767
01:02:47,335 --> 01:02:49,507
- Where the hell is that?
- Seventeen...

768
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:51,133
- North Korea.
...16...

769
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:53,825
...15, 14...

770
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:57,319
...13, 12...

771
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:00,351
...11, 10...

772
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,368
...nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.

773
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:06,376
...seven, six...
- I'm punching out.

774
01:03:06,857 --> 01:03:09,792
...five, four...

775
01:03:14,698 --> 01:03:18,048
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

776
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:23,169
I'm under the plane.

777
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:24,714
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

778
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:49,516
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

779
01:03:55,854 --> 01:03:59,116
It's gonna catch me.
It's gonna burn up my chute.

780
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:01,002
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

781
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:04,616
I gotta... I gotta reset.

782
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:08,359
From 5000 feet to 2000.

783
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:11,819
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

784
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:17,671
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

785
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,899
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

786
01:04:22,065 --> 01:04:23,691
Six thousand.

787
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:26,731
Five thousand.

788
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:29,741
Four thousand.

789
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:32,907
Twenty-five hundred.

790
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:34,416
Here we go.

791
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,666
There's burning debris.

792
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:45,834
It's raining all around me.

793
01:04:48,403 --> 01:04:51,916
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

794
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,467
My chute is on fire.

795
01:04:56,628 --> 01:04:57,774
It is on fire.

796
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,933
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

797
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,042
I'm coming in way too fast.

798
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,136
Oh, God.

799
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:47,539
Homing beacon?

800
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:49,554
No, of course not.

801
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,983
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

802
01:05:53,626 --> 01:05:57,456
Sir. Sir, should I order
a search-and-rescue unit?

803
01:05:57,626 --> 01:06:01,336
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

804
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:25,467
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

805
01:06:25,628 --> 01:06:29,939
- How bad?
- Thin air. Ignition risk; moderate.

806
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:33,143
We don't have a choice. In we go.

807
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:26,554
Where are you?
I know you're out here.

808
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:41,947
You ordered Henry to kill me.

809
01:07:42,116 --> 01:07:44,637
It's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

810
01:07:45,924 --> 01:07:48,543
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

811
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:52,482
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

812
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,977
You learn what people really think.

813
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:58,076
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.

814
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,111
That information is wrong.

815
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:06,589
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.

816
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:08,897
I'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

817
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:12,412
Return to the ship,
or I will personally shoot you down.

818
01:08:13,767 --> 01:08:15,742
My mandate is to survive.

819
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:22,761
George, I've been peeling away layers.
I found something. It's not good.

820
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:26,090
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file...

821
01:09:26,254 --> 01:09:29,255
...something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?

822
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:30,983
Yeah, I know it.

823
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,261
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

824
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,969
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

825
01:09:37,136 --> 01:09:39,787
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

826
01:09:39,952 --> 01:09:42,025
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

827
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:44,559
EDI's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

828
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,087
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same.

829
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:50,150
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

830
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,456
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

831
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:55,528
What target?

832
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:59,592
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

833
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,966
That's a hypothetical strike.
It's not real.

834
01:10:02,962 --> 01:10:04,816
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

835
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:07,499
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

836
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:26,101
It's okay.

837
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:29,783
It's okay. It's okay.

838
01:11:40,124 --> 01:11:42,426
- Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.

839
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,533
I got your goddamn plane built...

840
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,383
...and I had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

841
01:11:47,548 --> 01:11:51,924
If this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

842
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:53,849
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

843
01:11:54,013 --> 01:11:57,362
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

844
01:11:57,533 --> 01:12:01,243
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

845
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:04,567
Each one of these stealth engines...

846
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:07,582
...has a unique heat signature.

847
01:12:07,742 --> 01:12:10,263
Now, I'm gonna give you
EDI's signature...

848
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,886
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

849
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,870
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

850
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,136
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

851
01:12:18,303 --> 01:12:20,856
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

852
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:24,504
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

853
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:29,015
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

854
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:33,208
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

855
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:37,375
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

856
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,825
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

857
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:46,783
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

858
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,401
The UCA V has ceased evading
and has kept me within range.

859
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,545
It's like it wants me
to witness the attack.

860
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,682
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

861
01:12:54,851 --> 01:12:57,699
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

862
01:12:57,859 --> 01:13:00,445
It's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

863
01:13:00,611 --> 01:13:02,717
...in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.

864
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:05,884
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

865
01:13:06,052 --> 01:13:09,630
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept; 23 seconds.

866
01:13:09,796 --> 01:13:14,434
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

867
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:21,185
Missile launch. Missile launch.

868
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:23,935
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. I'm taking fire.

869
01:13:24,102 --> 01:13:26,404
- Must engage.
- Missile launch.

870
01:13:26,598 --> 01:13:28,453
Missile launch.

871
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:41,446
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

872
01:13:41,607 --> 01:13:44,389
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

873
01:14:08,106 --> 01:14:09,350
Missile lock, on.

874
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,384
Damn it.

875
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,442
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

876
01:14:41,613 --> 01:14:44,101
...and is headed east over
Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

877
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:59,974
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

878
01:15:29,393 --> 01:15:33,769
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

879
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:43,948
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

880
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:48,589
Releasing chaff and flare.

881
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:08,269
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

882
01:16:08,757 --> 01:16:10,929
Do not try to stop me.

883
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:18,188
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

884
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:23,279
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

885
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:26,350
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

886
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:28,941
But I have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

887
01:16:29,112 --> 01:16:30,999
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

888
01:16:31,608 --> 01:16:33,037
You got two options.

889
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:36,078
You either do what I tell you
or you can crash and burn.

890
01:16:36,248 --> 01:16:38,965
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- EDI is a warplane.

891
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:40,557
EDI must have targets.

892
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,893
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

893
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:49,806
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

894
01:16:57,722 --> 01:17:00,024
All targets canceled.

895
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,390
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

896
01:17:02,555 --> 01:17:07,771
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

897
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:12,824
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

898
01:17:25,693 --> 01:17:27,930
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

899
01:17:28,253 --> 01:17:31,996
You gave me your word,
and now I'm giving you mine.

900
01:17:57,408 --> 01:18:00,921
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

901
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,877
I don't have enough fuel
to make it back...

902
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:05,430
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

903
01:18:07,009 --> 01:18:08,536
Hook me up.

904
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:11,264
Here, send this.

905
01:18:11,426 --> 01:18:13,565
Operator to Talon 1.

906
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:17,598
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

907
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:20,568
This looks to be Alaska.

908
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,008
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

909
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:27,426
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

910
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:30,784
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

911
01:18:30,948 --> 01:18:34,723
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

912
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:36,826
And the UCA V?

913
01:18:36,996 --> 01:18:39,452
We've sent tech support for him.

914
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:43,906
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

915
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:46,788
She's...

916
01:18:48,901 --> 01:18:50,494
...on approach.

917
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,300
You have a safe landing, Ben.

918
01:18:59,686 --> 01:19:01,061
Out.

919
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:04,835
There is extreme tension
in the captain's vocal patterns.

920
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:07,104
I know. He's lying.

921
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:11,043
EDI, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...

922
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:13,346
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

923
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:16,959
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

924
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:20,958
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

925
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:23,332
What are my orders?

926
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:27,294
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

927
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:05,261
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

928
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:08,809
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

929
01:21:08,979 --> 01:21:11,597
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

930
01:21:32,533 --> 01:21:35,981
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

931
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:39,466
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

932
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,732
Come on! Go! Go!

933
01:22:51,837 --> 01:22:54,041
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

934
01:22:54,205 --> 01:22:57,075
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

935
01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:59,674
Are you okay? Are you okay?

936
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:02,426
Yeah?

937
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:05,886
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

938
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:08,566
Okay, let's get him out of there.

939
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:34,394
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

940
01:23:34,561 --> 01:23:37,278
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

941
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:39,481
I need a phone.
I need to call my CO.

942
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:43,392
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

943
01:23:43,554 --> 01:23:47,711
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, I'll take you right to it.

944
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:55,132
All right.

945
01:23:56,451 --> 01:23:58,491
Let's take a look here.

946
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,044
Steady.

947
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:07,200
There's no concussion
that I can see, thank God.

948
01:24:07,364 --> 01:24:09,536
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

949
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:11,773
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

950
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:16,478
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

951
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:20,319
This ought to do you.

952
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,426
Little cocktail.

953
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:28,354
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

954
01:24:28,518 --> 01:24:30,242
Just makes it painless.

955
01:24:30,694 --> 01:24:32,931
That's okay, doc.
I don't need a shot.

956
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:34,655
Now, who can blame you.

957
01:24:34,823 --> 01:24:37,158
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

958
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:39,840
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.
- Come on, now.

959
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:43,804
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, I said, no.

960
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,146
I said, no!

961
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:48,194
No!

962
01:26:19,729 --> 01:26:22,282
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

963
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:27,143
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

964
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,639
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

965
01:26:32,082 --> 01:26:33,937
Someone wants to talk to you.

966
01:26:36,467 --> 01:26:38,060
Keith Orbit.

967
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:41,490
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

968
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:45,034
I want you to erase EDI's
memory banks immediately.

969
01:26:45,203 --> 01:26:47,756
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

970
01:26:47,923 --> 01:26:50,345
- I need some time here.
- I said, don't interrupt.

971
01:26:50,516 --> 01:26:52,338
Erase his memory banks.

972
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,243
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

973
01:26:56,405 --> 01:27:00,050
By the time you're through, all I wanna
hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

974
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,244
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

975
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:07,247
Or what, George?

976
01:27:08,438 --> 01:27:11,821
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

977
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:17,266
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

978
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:20,056
Hello, EDI.

979
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:22,451
It's been a while.

980
01:28:22,621 --> 01:28:24,530
I know why you are here.

981
01:28:24,701 --> 01:28:26,228
Why is that?

982
01:28:26,398 --> 01:28:28,537
I disobeyed orders.

983
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:31,091
I killed all those people.

984
01:28:31,902 --> 01:28:33,146
And then there was Henry.

985
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,699
I can...

986
01:28:37,055 --> 01:28:39,030
I cannot...

987
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:41,108
You can't what?

988
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:43,448
I cannot change the data.

989
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:47,412
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

990
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,918
My God.

991
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,989
My God.

992
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:55,483
You mean, you feel?

993
01:28:55,905 --> 01:28:57,050
I feel sorry.

994
01:28:59,777 --> 01:29:03,355
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

995
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,846
Do it now!

996
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,418
Get away!

997
01:29:16,579 --> 01:29:18,815
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

998
01:29:19,682 --> 01:29:22,465
Weapon down! Weapons down!

999
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:24,921
Weapon down.

1000
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:29,986
Weapons down.

1001
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:38,333
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

1002
01:29:52,966 --> 01:29:55,203
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

1003
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:56,675
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

1004
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,405
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

1005
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:01,284
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1006
01:30:01,447 --> 01:30:03,836
- I'm a research scientist.
- Orbit. Finally, a break.

1007
01:30:04,007 --> 01:30:07,236
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need
you to put EDI back together again.

1008
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:11,175
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

1009
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:12,965
In that.

1010
01:30:27,626 --> 01:30:30,211
Come on, get in there! Go!

1011
01:30:31,754 --> 01:30:33,347
Better hurry up, doc.

1012
01:30:33,514 --> 01:30:35,456
Goddamn it.

1013
01:30:35,626 --> 01:30:38,309
It's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

1014
01:30:53,452 --> 01:30:56,355
All right. You're all set.

1015
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:58,881
Watch yourself.

1016
01:31:00,013 --> 01:31:01,442
Close for Ben.

1017
01:31:03,949 --> 01:31:05,771
Hey! What about me?
Where am I gonna go?

1018
01:31:05,933 --> 01:31:07,821
Head west. I'll cover you.

1019
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:09,410
West.

1020
01:31:10,957 --> 01:31:13,772
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1021
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,690
Fire on my fire!

1022
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:24,819
Welcome to Alaska.

1023
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:46,126
Invade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1024
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:51,126
Lieutenant Wade crashed
12.2 miles from the border.

1025
01:32:51,288 --> 01:32:54,583
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

1026
01:32:54,743 --> 01:32:56,402
But we have a problem.

1027
01:32:56,568 --> 01:32:59,535
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

1028
01:32:59,928 --> 01:33:02,776
I want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

1029
01:33:03,832 --> 01:33:05,588
Fifteen feet.

1030
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,142
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1031
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:13,040
Continue.

1032
01:33:14,841 --> 01:33:16,881
- Marshfield.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1033
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,228
Lieutenant, where are you?

1034
01:33:18,394 --> 01:33:21,525
Actually, I'm inside
the UCA V EDI, sir.

1035
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:25,487
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

1036
01:33:25,658 --> 01:33:29,336
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1037
01:33:31,163 --> 01:33:33,465
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...
- I know.

1038
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:35,930
Has her survival beacon
been located?

1039
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:37,204
No, I'm sorry.

1040
01:33:38,652 --> 01:33:40,561
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

1041
01:33:40,732 --> 01:33:42,903
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

1042
01:33:43,068 --> 01:33:44,629
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1043
01:33:44,797 --> 01:33:47,350
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

1044
01:34:31,329 --> 01:34:32,671
This is breaking news.

1045
01:34:34,529 --> 01:34:37,049
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

1046
01:34:37,217 --> 01:34:39,389
I'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

1047
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:41,823
...and head directly back to the ship.
- Negative.

1048
01:34:41,986 --> 01:34:44,801
She's my wingman.
If I find her, I'm going in.

1049
01:34:44,962 --> 01:34:47,810
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

1050
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,793
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

1051
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:52,410
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

1052
01:34:52,579 --> 01:34:55,776
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

1053
01:34:57,219 --> 01:34:59,259
Then listen to me now, son.

1054
01:34:59,428 --> 01:35:03,618
If you go down, Cummings wins.

1055
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:06,461
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took...

1056
01:35:06,628 --> 01:35:08,287
Captain Marshfield?

1057
01:35:09,029 --> 01:35:10,239
Sir?

1058
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:13,854
EDI, did you just turn him off?

1059
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,837
There was nothing left to say.

1060
01:35:53,353 --> 01:35:55,874
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

1061
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,016
It will take us right to the border.

1062
01:36:28,973 --> 01:36:30,762
What's all this about, Dick?

1063
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:32,805
I'm placing you under arrest.

1064
01:36:34,894 --> 01:36:37,992
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...

1065
01:36:38,157 --> 01:36:41,540
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

1066
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:43,882
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

1067
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:47,941
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

1068
01:36:49,614 --> 01:36:51,273
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1069
01:36:51,663 --> 01:36:53,419
Yeah, well...

1070
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,623
...with any amount of luck...

1071
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:59,501
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

1072
01:37:01,296 --> 01:37:03,630
- Master-at-arms.
- Dick.

1073
01:37:04,976 --> 01:37:06,350
Hold on.

1074
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,830
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

1075
01:37:16,017 --> 01:37:17,708
Yeah, sure.

1076
01:37:20,529 --> 01:37:21,958
Thank you.

1077
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:42,035
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

1078
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:45,425
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1079
01:37:45,587 --> 01:37:48,075
I've been demoted?

1080
01:37:48,244 --> 01:37:49,455
Well...

1081
01:37:50,548 --> 01:37:53,199
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

1082
01:37:58,805 --> 01:38:01,839
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1083
01:38:07,062 --> 01:38:08,851
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

1084
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:11,764
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

1085
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,620
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.

1086
01:42:08,398 --> 01:42:11,627
There she is. She made it.

1087
01:43:02,579 --> 01:43:03,724
Ben!

1088
01:43:05,299 --> 01:43:07,087
Kara, get down! Get down!

1089
01:43:32,437 --> 01:43:34,347
You came back for me.

1090
01:43:35,094 --> 01:43:36,818
You came back.

1091
01:43:45,175 --> 01:43:47,182
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

1092
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:48,725
Yeah.

1093
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:12,017
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

1094
01:44:44,796 --> 01:44:46,389
Goodbye.

1095
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,417
Come on. Come on.

1096
01:45:19,936 --> 01:45:21,725
They're ours. They're ours.

1097
01:45:21,888 --> 01:45:24,223
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1098
01:45:37,922 --> 01:45:39,416
Come on.

1099
01:45:52,419 --> 01:45:55,038
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

1100
01:45:55,204 --> 01:45:57,342
...where no torment
shall touch them.

1101
01:45:57,508 --> 01:45:59,647
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

1102
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:02,780
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

1103
01:46:02,949 --> 01:46:07,902
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1104
01:46:08,069 --> 01:46:10,142
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

1105
01:46:10,309 --> 01:46:15,263
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky."

1106
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:16,924
And salute!

1107
01:46:33,224 --> 01:46:35,842
Ready. Hut!

1108
01:46:52,713 --> 01:46:54,208
When I was gonna
detach formation...

1109
01:46:54,377 --> 01:46:57,444
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

1110
01:47:03,978 --> 01:47:05,407
You and me, we're...

1111
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,625
We're two.

1112
01:47:10,315 --> 01:47:12,704
And two is a prime number...

1113
01:47:13,227 --> 01:47:16,261
...which makes it a lucky number.

1114
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:22,406
And I think we're very, very lucky.

1115
01:47:39,214 --> 01:47:42,062
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.
