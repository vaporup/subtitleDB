to me as favors.

522
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,995
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

523
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:20,248
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

524
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:22,332
He... He's coming to Gotham?

525
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,959
Yes, he is.

526
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:26,586
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

527
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:31,843
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

528
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:36,179
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

529
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,473
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

Well, there's an answer to that too.

Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

- Why is no one answering the phone?

549

It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

551

I'm sorry to disappoint.

552
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:56,129

- Wayne.

He's back.

I can't stop the big machine.

557

- I understand.

For spelunking.

They'll have to be large orders,

- For you and the police, maybe.

1367
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:32,745
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1368
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:36,247
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1369
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:40,127
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

Gentlemen.

1373

Who the hell authorized this?

COMPUTER:
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1375
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:28,645
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1376
02:00:28,811 --> 02:00:30,187
If that pressure reaches us...

1377
02:00:30,354 --> 02:00:33,356
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

You will never learn.

02:01:20,402 --> 02:01:21,444
Sorry.

1381
02:01:25,406 --> 02:01:28,408
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

MAN:
Evacuate the building.

Don't be afraid, Bruce.

Come on. Come on.

1391
02:02:59,536 --> 02:03:01,621
DUCARD:
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1392
02:03:01,788 --> 02:03:05,666
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1393
02:03:05,834 --> 02:03:08,419
Who said anything about stopping it?

1394
02:03:14,217 --> 02:03:15,760
Yes!

BATMAN: You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1396
02:03:35,195 --> 02:03:37,697
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1397
02:03:37,989 --> 02:03:40,282
I won't kill you...

1398
02:03:44,703 --> 02:03:46,871
...but I don't have to save you.

JESSICA: The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1400
02:05:09,366 --> 02:05:12,285
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1401
02:05:12,786 --> 02:05:14,370
You did.

1402
02:05:14,538 --> 02:05:16,623
I got another job.

have made the front page...

What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1410
02:05:38,727 --> 02:05:41,604
- The fact that I'm the owner.
EARLE: What are you talking about?

1411
02:05:41,771 --> 02:05:43,647
The company went public a week ago.

1412
02:05:43,816 --> 02:05:45,275
And I bought most of the shares.

1413
02:05:45,651 --> 02:05:49,112
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1414
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:52,490
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1415
02:05:52,698 --> 02:05:55,992
... is that my company's future
is secure.

1416
02:05:56,369 --> 02:05:57,787
Right, Mr. Fox?

02:05:57,953 --> 02:05:59,788
FOX:
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1418
02:06:01,999 --> 02:06:03,583
Didn't you get the memo?

1419
02:06:22,518 --> 02:06:25,729
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

02:06:25,896 --> 02:06:27,272
...I'm sorry.

The day that Chill died, I...

1422
02:06:32,695 --> 02:06:34,321
I said terrible things.

1423
02:06:34,821 --> 02:06:36,572
But true things.

1424
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:39,033
I was a coward with a gun...

1425
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:42,995
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1426
02:06:44,038 --> 02:06:46,707

And when I heard you were back, I...

02:06:53,255 --> 02:06:55,465
I started to hope.

1430
02:07:19,529 --> 02:07:22,239
But then I found out about your mask.

1431
02:07:23,409 --> 02:07:26,245
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1432
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:28,538
No. This...

1433
02:07:29,706 --> 02:07:31,416
...is your mask.

1434
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:36,921
Your real face is the one

...he never came back at all.

out there somewhere.

Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

02:08:18,126 --> 02:08:20,586

- Precisely, sir.

- The Narrows is lost.

And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

- Escalation?
