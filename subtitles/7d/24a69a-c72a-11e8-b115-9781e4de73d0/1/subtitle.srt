I've been having...

369
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,636
I've been having
some trouble sleeping.

370
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,545
I was hoping
you could give me
something for It.

371
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,449
Mmm. How long's
this been going on?

372
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,481
About four nights now.

373
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,215
You're not sleeping at all?

374
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,519

but real restless.

00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,885
Well, lthinkfour nights
is a little too soon to tell.

376
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,829
My advice would be to
not eat or drink anything

377
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,594
after 0:00 at night.

378
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,498

any alcoholic drinks,

00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,741
Get some daily exercise.

381
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,002
Well, I think...

382
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,211
lthink I might need
to try some medication.

383
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,578
Why do you say that?

384
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,413

having trouble sleeping

385
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,978
ls these dreams
I've been having.

386
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,319
I didn't think
It was anything at ﬁrst,

387
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,759
but then
the other day I woke up

388
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,628

391
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,030
Couple days before that,

392
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,904
I had a dream that
my dog attacked me

393
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,442
and It took all day
for the pain

394
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,410
in my arm to go away.

No. Nothing like that.

536
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,091
There was always...

537
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,594
There was always a panic

538
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,139
that took hold of me.

539
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,973
(WHISPERING) I thought
people were watching me

540
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,674
and listening to me.

541
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,914

that psychiatrist.

553
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,339
Yeah, It's Just too far.

554
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,375
Is there somewhere local

Is she okay?

562
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,217
Yeah. I Just wanted
to check up on her.

563
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,218
You should've told me,
we would have gone with you.

564
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,886

569
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,041
I gotta tell you, Curtis,

570
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,051
banks aren't loaning money
the waythey used to.

00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,313
We've got you
a loan today,

572
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,514
but the Interest rates
are variable.

573
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,988
We have to tie It
to your house.

574
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,457
That's ﬁne.

575
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,492

00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,370
Okay.

615
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,485
I'm gonna start
by asking you
some questions.

616
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,080
Okay. I already answered
all the questions
on the form.

617
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,482
Yeah, I know.
I looked at them,

618
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,584
but I need to get
a proﬁle started on you.

619
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,595
nght. Well...

620
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,393
Out of the ﬁve
possible symptoms

621
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,369
needed to be diagnosed
with schizophrenia,

622
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,002
delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech,

623
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,704
disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms,

624
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,005
I've had two.

625
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,590
So, Itookthis quiz
in the back ofthe book.

626
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,991
I scored a ﬁve
out of a possible 20.

627
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,056
Schizophrenia starts
at 12. So...

628
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,832
They say it might be
a brief psychotic disorder.

629
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,103
Yeah. Whatever it is,
I need to know what to do

630
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,201
or what to get on

631
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,817
Look. I'm a counselor.

632
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,987
Certlﬂed,
but I'm not a psychiatrist.

633
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,579
I ean't prescribe
anything to you.

634
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:17,559
I ean talk to you,
lean recommend where
to send you,

635
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,117
but that's It.

636
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:26,828
Now, that said,
If you want to talk,
I'll llsten.

637
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,400
For a lot of people,
that's a good start.

638
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,236
Now you said here

639
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,643
that your mother
was diagnosed

640
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,477
wlth paranoid schizophrenia
In her 30s.

641
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,948
And you're at 35.

642
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,480
You wanna talk
about that?

643
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,823
Yeah, I don't know
my mother's symptoms.

644
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,586
lwasjust 10.

645
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,663
My brotherwas 17. And...

646
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,169
I don't know. She Just
left me In the ear

647
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,270
in the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.

648
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,081
And she didn't come back.

649
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,421
And then they
found her a week later

650
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,922
eatlng trash
out of a dumpster

651
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,822
in Northern Kentucky.

652
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,791
My dad had to put her
In the State Hospital
In Columbus.

653
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,696
And she's been in
assisted living ever since.

654
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,465
Yep.

655
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,471
My dad raised me.

656
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,143
He died last April.

657
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,153
So tell me
about these dreams.

658
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,433
SAMANTHA: I don't know
what our schedule will be,
but...

659
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,333
That's all right.

660
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,845
But I really do think
you should continue
with the sign language.

661
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,272
And any additional therapies
that kids need for
the cochlear implant.

662
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,873
SAMANTHA: Absolutely.
Okay.

663
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,679
Good night.
Good night.
