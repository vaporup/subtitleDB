1
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,866
<i>- Whoa.</i>

2
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,332
<i>Whoa.</i>

3
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,979
<i>Who's that stumbling'
around in the dark?</i>

4
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,926
<i>State your business
or prepare to get winged!</i>

5
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,682
<i>Calm yourselves, gentlemen.</i>

6
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,196
<i>I mean you no harm.</i>

7
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,201
<i>I'm simply a fellow weary traveller.
Whoa, boy.</i>

8
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,200
<i>Good cold evening, gentlemen.</i>

9
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,706
<i>I'm looking for a pair of slave traders</i>

10
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,538
<i>that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.</i>

11
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,532
<i>Might that be you?</i>

12
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,654
<i>- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.</i>

13
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,697
<i>I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.</i>

14
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,452
<i>- What kind of doctor?
- Dentist.</i>

15
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,428
<i>Now, are you the Speck Brothers?</i>

16
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,389
<i>And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?</i>

17
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,134
<i>- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.</i>

18
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,638
<i>- Speak English.
Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

19
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,027
<i>Please forgive me.
It is a second language.</i>

20
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,485
<i>Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,</i>

21
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,059
<i>is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.</i>

22
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,701
<i>Hello, you poor devils!</i>

23
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,610
<i>Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident</i>

24
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,080
<i>of the Carrucan plantation?</i>

25
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,045
<i>I'm from the Carrucan plantation.</i>

26
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,040
<i>Who said that?</i>

27
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,630
<i>What's your name?</i>

28
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,666
<i>Django.</i>

29
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,586
<i>Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.</i>

30
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,692
<i>Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?</i>

31
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,303
<i>Who are they?</i>

32
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,349
<i>Big John.</i>

33
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,495
<i>Ellis.</i>

34
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,819
<i>Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.</i>

35
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,420
<i>They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.</i>

36
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,660
<i>Not anymore.</i>

37
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,797
<i>Tell me...</i>

38
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,175
<i>...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,</i>

39
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,012
<i>- would you recognize them?
- Hey.</i>

40
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,643
<i>- Stop talking' to him like that.
- Like what?</i>

41
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,337
<i>Like that.</i>

42
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,798
<i>My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...</i>

43
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,020
<i>Speak English, goddamn it.</i>

44
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,924
<i>Everybody calm down.</i>

45
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,822
<i>I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.</i>

46
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,984
<i>I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.</i>

47
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,154
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.</i>

48
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,455
<i>Move it.</i>

49
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,541
<i>My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture</i>

50
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,491
<i>or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?</i>

51
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,448
<i>Last chance, fancy pants.</i>

52
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,221
<i>Oh, very well.</i>

53
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,404
<i>I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,</i>

54
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,500
<i>but I didn't want you
to do anything rash</i>

55
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,950
<i>before you had a moment
to come to your senses.</i>

56
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,549
<i>You goddamn son of a bitch!</i>

57
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,510
<i>- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...</i>

58
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,379
<i>And you killed Ace!</i>

59
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,223
<i>I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.</i>

60
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,218
<i>And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...</i>

61
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,358
<i>...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.</i>

62
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,395
<i>- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.</i>

63
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,110
<i>Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,</i>

64
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,606
<i>I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.</i>

65
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,071
<i>- God-fucking'-damn it!
- As I was saying...</i>

66
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,962
<i>...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?</i>

67
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,327
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,783
<i>Sold American!</i>

69
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,928
<i>So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?</i>

70
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,833
<i>That iron is nasty business.</i>

71
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,186
<i>Oh, could you hold this for a moment?</i>

72
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>Thank you. Django?</i>

73
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,846
<i>Get up on that horse.</i>

74
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,822
<i>Also, if I were you,</i>

75
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,989
<i>I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.</i>

76
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,007
<i>Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.</i>

77
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:05,610
<i>Goddamn it! Oh!</i>

78
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:12,450
<i>One hundred... ten... 20...</i>

79
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,444
<i>...and five...</i>

80
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,870
<i>...for young Django here.</i>

81
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,195
<i>And since he won't
be needing it anymore,</i>

82
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,861
<i>I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.</i>

83
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,541
<i>Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.</i>

84
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,303
<i>Do you have one?</i>

85
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,375
<i>- You go to hell, dentist.</i>

86
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,540
<i>I thought not.</i>

87
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,210
<i>No worries. I come prepared.</i>

88
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,152
<i>Thank you.</i>

89
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,894
<i>This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.</i>

90
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,233
<i>Whoa.</i>

91
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,874
<i>Now, as to you poor devils.</i>

92
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:14,095
<i>So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,</i>

93
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,090
<i>you gentlemen have two choices.</i>

94
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,380
<i>One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,</i>

95
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,480
<i>then carry him to the nearest town.</i>

96
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,226
<i>Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.</i>

97
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:34,074
<i>Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,</i>

98
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,784
<i>put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,</i>

99
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,496
<i>and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.</i>

100
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,748
<i>Choice is yours.</i>

101
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,280
<i>Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,</i>

102
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,461
<i>the North Star is that one.</i>

103
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,083
<i>Ta-ta.</i>

104
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,992
<i>Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!</i>

105
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,037
<i>You got to be reasonable
in a situation like this!</i>

106
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,496
<i>I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doing' my job!</i>

107
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,246
<i>Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?</i>

108
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,385
<i>Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,</i>

109
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,591
<i>- I'll get you your freedom.</i>

110
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,509
<i>- No. No, please...</i>

111
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,222
<i>All right, now.</i>

112
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,379
<i>I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...</i>

113
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,776
<i>- ...and then in the morning...</i>

114
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,692
<i>That's a nigger on a horse.</i>

115
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,095
<i>What's everybody staring at?</i>

116
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,749
<i>They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.</i>

117
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,054
<i>Whoa.</i>

118
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,107
<i>Good morning, innkeeper!</i>

119
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,922
<i>Two beers for two weary travellers.</i>

120
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,822
<i>It's still a bit early.</i>

121
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,411
<i>We won't be open for another hour.</i>

122
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,417
<i>By then, we'll be serving' breakfast.</i>

123
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:45,003
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?</i>

124
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,270
<i>Get that nigger outta here!</i>

125
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,812
<i>Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!</i>

126
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,140
<i>Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.</i>

127
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,180
<i>Sheriff! Help!</i>

128
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,974
<i>Alas.</i>

129
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,910
<i>Now we must act as our own bartender.</i>

130
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,065
<i>Sit down, my boy.</i>

131
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,631
<i>- What kind of dentist are you?</i>

132
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:28,061
<i>Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.</i>

133
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,982
<i>But these days,
I practice a new profession...</i>

134
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,564
<i>...bounty hunter.</i>

135
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,986
<i>Do you know what a bounty hunter is?</i>

136
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,745
<i>No.</i>

137
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,113
<i>Well...</i>

138
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,862
<i>...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,</i>

139
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,383
<i>a bounty hunter deals in corpses.</i>

140
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,761
<i>Hat</i>

141
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,042
<i>Proust.</i>

142
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,898
<i>The state places a bounty
on a man's head.</i>

143
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,734
<i>I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.</i>

144
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,868
<i>After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.</i>

145
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,734
<i>Sometimes that's easier said than done.</i>

146
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,703
<i>I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,</i>

147
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,572
<i>I truly have killed him,</i>

148
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,746
<i>at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.</i>

149
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,246
<i>So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.</i>

150
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,865
<i>What's a bounty?</i>

151
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,139
<i>It's like a reward.</i>

152
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,666
<i>You kill people?
And they give you a reward?</i>

153
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,709
<i>Certain people, yeah.</i>

154
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,002
<i>Bad people?</i>

155
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,151
<i>Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.</i>

156
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,596
<i>Which brings me to you.</i>

157
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,014
<i>And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.</i>

158
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,603
<i>On one hand, I despise slavery.</i>

159
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,906
<i>On the other hand, I need your help.</i>

160
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,440
<i>If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.</i>

161
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>So, for the time being, I'm going to
make this slavery malarkey</i>

162
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,381
<i>work to my benefit.</i>

163
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,205
<i>Still, having said that, I feel guilty.</i>

164
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:32,136
<i>So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.</i>

165
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,015
<i>I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.</i>

166
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,033
<i>However, at this endeavour,</i>

167
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:52,311
<i>I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.</i>

168
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,452
<i>But you do. Don't ya?</i>

169
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,836
<i>I know what they look like all right.</i>

170
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,488
<i>Good. So here's my agreement.</i>

171
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,090
<i>- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we going?</i>

172
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,869
<i>I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,</i>

173
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,208
<i>but I don't know where.</i>

174
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,683
<i>That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.</i>

175
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:21,102
<i>And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.</i>

176
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,511
<i>You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,</i>

177
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,807
<i>$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.</i>

178
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,705
<i>And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.</i>

179
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,961
<i>OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.</i>

180
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,184
<i>- All right, folks, calm down.</i>

181
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,924
<i>Go about your business.</i>

182
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,098
<i>These jokers will be gone soon.</i>

183
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:07,474
<i>Now, why y'all want to come
into my town and start trouble?</i>

184
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,890
<i>And scare all these nice people.</i>

185
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,742
<i>You ain't got nothing better to do</i>

186
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,124
<i>than to come into Bill Sharp's town</i>

187
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,535
<i>and show your ass?</i>

188
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,790
<i>- What'd you just do to our sheriff?</i>

189
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,444
<i>Now you can get the marshal.</i>

190
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,281
<i>Marshal! Marshal!</i>

191
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,692
<i>- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?</i>

192
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,064
<i>After you.</i>

193
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,739
<i>Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.</i>

194
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,787
<i>I want six men, six rifles behind it.</i>

195
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,115
<i>I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.</i>

196
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,632
<i>Two men, two rifles on that roof.</i>

197
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,761
<i>All the barrels aimed
at that front door.</i>

198
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,923
<i>Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.</i>

199
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,252
<i>You in the saloon!</i>

200
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,760
<i>We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that building'.</i>

201
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,634
<i>You got one chance
to get out of this alive.</i>

202
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,967
<i>You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,</i>

203
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,102
<i>and I mean right now.</i>

204
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,656
<i>Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?</i>

205
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,616
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

206
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,872
<i>This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.</i>

207
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,317
<i>Na wunderbar, marshal.</i>

208
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,409
<i>I have relieved myself of all weapons,</i>

209
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,492
<i>and just as you have instructed,</i>

210
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,339
<i>I am ready to step outside</i>

211
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,597
<i>with my hands raised above my head.</i>

212
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,085
<i>I trust as a representative</i>

213
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,627
<i>of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,</i>

214
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:09,641
<i>I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies</i>

215
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,643
<i>before I've had my day in court.</i>

216
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,157
<i>You mean like you did our sheriff.</i>

217
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,114
<i>Shot him down like a dog in the street.</i>

218
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,620
<i>Yes, that's exactly what I mean.</i>

219
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,457
<i>Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?</i>

220
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,031
<i>Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,</i>

221
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,212
<i>ain't nobody going to cheat
the hangman in my town.</i>

222
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,223
<i>Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.</i>

223
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,212
<i>They're a little tense out there.</i>

224
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,844
<i>So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.</i>

225
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,855
<i>- Come ahead.</i>

226
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,151
<i>You unarmed?</i>

227
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,024
<i>Yes, indeed we are.</i>

228
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,112
<i>Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,</i>

229
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,238
<i>and apparently the
entire town of Daugherty,</i>

230
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,752
<i>as to the incident that just occurred?</i>

231
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,548
<i>- Go on.
- Thank you.</i>

232
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,834
<i>My name is Dr. King Schultz.</i>

233
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,243
<i>Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.</i>

234
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,845
<i>The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daugherty</i>

235
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,103
<i>saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,</i>

236
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,859
<i>is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,</i>

237
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,599
<i>with a price on his head of $200.</i>

238
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,739
<i>Now that's $200, dead or alive.</i>

239
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,240
<i>The hell, you say!</i>

240
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,438
<i>I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.</i>

241
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,774
<i>But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff</i>

242
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,440
<i>sometime in the past two years?</i>

243
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,358
<i>Yeah.</i>

244
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,961
<i>I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle</i>

245
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,582
<i>from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.</i>

246
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,540
<i>Now, this is a warrant
made out by</i>

247
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:07,392
<i>Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Lauder milk of Austin, Texas.</i>

248
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,260
<i>You're encouraged to wire him.</i>

249
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,482
<i>He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.</i>

250
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,565
<i>In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.</i>

251
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,749
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

252
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,368
<i>After this Brittle business
is behind us,</i>

253
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,071
<i>you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...</i>

254
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,283
<i>What's your plan after that?</i>

255
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,388
<i>Find my wife, and buy her freedom.</i>

256
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:31,502
<i>Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.</i>

257
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,299
<i>Do most slaves believe in marriage?</i>

258
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,057
<i>Oh, me and my wife do.</i>

259
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,403
<i>Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.</i>

260
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,223
<i>Django.</i>

261
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,484
<i>Django, Django.</i>

262
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,362
<i>You got sand, Django.</i>

263
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,940
<i>Boy's got sand.</i>

264
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,873
<i>I got no use for a nigger with sand.</i>

265
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,075
<i>I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.</i>

266
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,300
<i>And the girl, too.</i>

267
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:12,213
<i>And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.</i>

268
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,919
<i>Both of 'em.</i>

269
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,838
<i>Separately.</i>

270
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,652
<i>And this one...</i>

271
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,980
<i>...you will sell him cheap.</i>

272
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,445
<i>In Greenville...</i>

273
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,959
<i>...there should be some sort
of a records office.</i>

274
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,385
<i>You know when she was sold...</i>

275
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,806
<i>...you know where she came from,</i>

276
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,796
<i>and you know her name.</i>

277
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,128
<i>What is her name?</i>

278
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,975
<i>Broomhilda.</i>

279
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,798
<i>- What?
- Broom-hilda.</i>

280
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,932
<i>- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.</i>

281
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,025
<i>- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?</i>

282
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,311
<i>She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.</i>

283
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,034
<i>She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.</i>

284
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,324
<i>She speak a little German, too.</i>

285
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,231
<i>- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.</i>

286
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,240
<i>When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody</i>

287
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,003
<i>to speak German with.</i>

288
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,163
<i>Well, let me get this straight.</i>

289
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,930
<i>Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?</i>

290
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,203
<i>Yep.</i>

291
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,001
<i>They call me Hildi.</i>

292
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:59,293
<i>When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.</i>

293
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,361
<i>You'll be playing a character.</i>

294
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,369
<i>Hm?</i>

295
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,500
<i>No?</i>

296
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,974
<i>During the act, you can
never break character.</i>

297
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,597
<i>Do you understand?</i>

298
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,904
<i>Yeah. Don't break character.</i>

299
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:37,149
<i>And your character
is that of The Valet.</i>

300
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,408
<i>What that is?</i>

301
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,703
<i>That's a fancy word for servant.</i>

302
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,122
<i>- Valet?
- Hm-mm.</i>

303
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:50,128
<i>And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.</i>

304
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,378
<i>Youse going to let me
pick out my own clothes?</i>

305
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,504
<i>But of course.</i>

306
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,492
<i>Whoa.</i>

307
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,375
<i>It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.</i>

308
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,913
<i>This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.</i>

309
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,970
<i>- I said niggers on horses...
- His name is Django.</i>

310
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,935
<i>He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.</i>

311
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,556
<i>Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.</i>

312
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:53,222
<i>My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.</i>

313
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,867
<i>Allow me to unring this bell.</i>

314
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,872
<i>My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.</i>

315
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,158
<i>And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.</i>

316
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,371
<i>Mr. Bennett?</i>

317
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,747
<i>I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.</i>

318
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,888
<i>And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee</i>

319
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,969
<i>to parley with you now.</i>

320
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,100
<i>I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.</i>

321
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,733
<i>You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee</i>

322
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,689
<i>to buy one of my nigger gals?</i>

323
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,524
<i>No appointment, no nothing?</i>

324
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,610
<i>Oh, I'm afraid so.</i>

325
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,184
<i>Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?</i>

326
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,031
<i>Or your fancy-pants nigger?</i>

327
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,412
<i>And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.</i>

328
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,527
<i>Now what you got to say about that?</i>

329
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,790
<i>Mr. Bennett.</i>

330
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,196
<i>If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,</i>

331
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:56,550
<i>I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.</i>

332
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,216
<i>Well, come on inside and get
yourself something' cool to drink.</i>

333
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,302
<i>Hm-mm.</i>

334
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,691
<i>Oh, maybe while we discuss business,</i>

335
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,410
<i>you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures</i>

336
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,950
<i>to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.</i>

337
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,278
<i>Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Bettina.</i>

338
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,193
<i>- Yes sir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...</i>

339
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,236
<i>What's your Jimmie's name again?</i>

340
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,916
<i>- Django.
- Django.</i>

341
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,244
<i>Bettina, sugar, could you
take Django there</i>

342
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,638
<i>and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.</i>

343
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,082
<i>As you please, Big Daddy.</i>

344
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,170
<i>Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.</i>

345
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,678
<i>He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,</i>

346
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,339
<i>He must be treated
as an extension of myself.</i>

347
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,520
<i>- Understood, Schultz. Bettina, sugar?
- Yes'm?</i>

348
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,317
<i>Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?</i>

349
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,812
<i>You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,</i>

350
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,899
<i>'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?</i>

351
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,952
<i>You want I should
treat him like white folks?</i>

352
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,246
<i>No. That's not what I said.</i>

353
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,961
<i>Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.</i>

354
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,963
<i>Yes, I can see that. Uh...</i>

355
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,588
<i>What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?</i>

356
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,715
<i>His mama work over at the lumberyard.</i>

357
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,627
<i>- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!</i>

358
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,307
<i>You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?</i>

359
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,602
<i>- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.</i>

360
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,738
<i>You just treat him like you would Jerry.</i>

361
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,402
<i>That house we just left from
is The Big House.</i>

362
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,822
<i>That there is the pantry.</i>

363
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,488
<i>That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.</i>

364
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,714
<i>Po' little squirrels.</i>

365
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,832
<i>What you do for your Massa?</i>

366
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,806
<i>Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?</i>

367
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,336
<i>- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.</i>

368
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,854
<i>You mean you want to dress like that?</i>

369
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,150
<i>- Bettina, I need to ask you something'.
- What you want?</i>

370
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,403
<i>I'm looking' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.</i>

371
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,030
<i>Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?</i>

372
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,054
<i>- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.</i>

373
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:26,533
<i>John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.</i>

374
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,527
<i>I don't know them.</i>

375
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,946
<i>They could be using' a different name.</i>

376
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,369
<i>They would a come to the plantation
this past year.</i>

377
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,152
<i>- You mean the Shaff ears?
- Maybe.</i>

378
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,457
<i>- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.</i>

379
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,364
<i>- They here?
- Uh-huh.</i>

380
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,283
<i>Could you point one of 'em out to me?</i>

381
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,748
<i>Well, one's over in that field.</i>

382
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,445
<i>Old Man Carrucan ain't
going to appreciate this, now.</i>

383
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,725
<i>She work in the house, John.</i>

384
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,596
<i>You could mess her skin up,
and you going to mess her up</i>

385
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,730
<i>and she ain't going to be worth...
she ain't going to be worth a damn thing.</i>

386
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,767
<i>Now, your Bible say...</i>

387
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,527
<i>Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.</i>

388
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,317
<i>You ready?</i>

389
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,782
<i>She didn't want to run off with me. If
anybody should be getting' whupped now,</i>

390
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,332
<i>it should be me. It should be me, John.</i>

391
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,469
<i>Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.</i>

392
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,260
<i>You know Massa Carrucan
ain't going to appreciate this.</i>

393
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,963
<i>She's a... she's a house slave.</i>

394
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,565
<i>- She a house slave, she can't be...</i>

395
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,412
<i>On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?</i>

396
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,462
<i>I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.</i>

397
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,538
<i>I's on my knees, John.</i>

398
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,673
<i>I like the way you beg, boy.</i>

399
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,983
<i>Is that who you was looking' for?</i>

400
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,982
<i>Yep.</i>

401
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,557
<i>Where the other two at?</i>

402
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,485
<i>They by the stable,
punishing' Little Jody for breaking' eggs.</i>

403
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,324
<i>They whipping' Little Jody?</i>

404
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,811
<i>Point me in that direction.</i>

405
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,542
<i>You go to that tree
and keep going' that-a way.</i>

406
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,257
<i>Go get that white man
I came here with.</i>

407
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,161
<i>- Come on, now.
- No, no, please!</i>

408
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,837
<i>- Come on, girlie.
- Please!</i>

409
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,553
<i>- Come on. Get you set up now.</i>

410
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,184
<i>"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."</i>

411
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,312
<i>- "...and the dread of ye</i>

412
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,757
<i>shall be on every beast
of the earth."'</i>

413
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,434
<i>Come here now, woman!</i>

414
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,696
<i>- You'd better give me that arm!</i>

415
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,612
<i>OK, she's ready!</i>

416
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,725
<i>And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.</i>

417
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,067
<i>John Brittle!</i>

418
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,299
<i>- You remember me?</i>

419
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>I like the way you die, boy.</i>

420
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,904
<i>Goddamn son of a bitch!</i>

421
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,427
<i>- Keep it funny!</i>

422
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,454
<i>Y'all want to see something?</i>

423
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,622
<i>No!</i>

424
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,289
<i>Who were they?</i>

425
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,009
<i>That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.</i>

426
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,677
<i>Where's Ellis?</i>

427
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,187
<i>He's the one hightailing' it
across that field right now.</i>

428
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,519
<i>- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.</i>

429
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,608
<i>- Positive?
- I don't know.</i>

430
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,024
<i>- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.</i>

431
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,442
<i>- It means you're sure.
- Yes.</i>

432
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,895
<i>- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.</i>

433
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,716
<i>I'm positive he dead.</i>

434
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,745
<i>Django!</i>

435
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,961
<i>Everybody calm down.</i>

436
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,388
<i>We mean no one else any harm.</i>

437
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,090
<i>Who are you two jokers?</i>

438
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,268
<i>I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative</i>

439
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,108
<i>of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.</i>

440
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,867
<i>The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.</i>

441
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,982
<i>In my pocket is a warrant,</i>

442
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,248
<i>signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Lauder milk of Austin, Texas,</i>

443
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,286
<i>for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,</i>

444
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:54,447
<i>of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.</i>

445
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,718
<i>They were going' by the name Shaffer.</i>

446
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,246
<i>You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.</i>

447
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,096
<i>These are wanted men.</i>

448
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,727
<i>The law wants 'em for murder.</i>

449
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,004
<i>Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,</i>

450
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,481
<i>so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,</i>

451
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,102
<i>we were operating
within our legal boundaries.</i>

452
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,600
<i>I realize passions are high,</i>

453
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,816
<i>but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force</i>

454
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,430
<i>against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty</i>

455
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,448
<i>is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.</i>

456
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:41,202
<i>Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?</i>

457
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,413
<i>Gimme.</i>

458
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,325
<i>Satisfied?</i>

459
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,110
<i>May I have that back, please?</i>

460
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,835
<i>- Get off my land.
- Post haste.</i>

461
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,927
<i>Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.</i>

462
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,275
<i>Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.</i>

463
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,577
<i>Come on, men!</i>

464
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:41,280
<i>- We're coming for you, nigger!
Hee-haw!</i>

465
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,934
<i>Now, unless they start shooting' first,
nobody shoot 'em.</i>

466
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,315
<i>That's way too simple for these jokers.</i>

467
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,674
<i>We're going to whup that
nigger-lover to death.</i>

468
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,904
<i>And I'm going to personally
strip and clip that garb on myself.</i>

469
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,983
<i>Damn.</i>

470
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,938
<i>I can't see fucking' shit
outta this thing.</i>

471
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,153
<i>We ready or what?</i>

472
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,704
<i>Aw, hold on,
I'm fucking' with my eyeholes.</i>

473
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,249
<i>- Oh... Oh, shit.</i>

474
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,634
<i>I just made it worse.</i>

475
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,840
<i>Who made this goddamn shit?</i>

476
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,973
<i>- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!</i>

477
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,715
<i>Look, nobody's saying'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.</i>

478
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,468
<i>Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,</i>

479
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,310
<i>I could a cut it better than this!</i>

480
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,272
<i>What about you, Robert?
Can you see?</i>

481
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,640
<i>Not too good.</i>

482
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,145
<i>I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.</i>

483
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,808
<i>But when I start riding', the bag's
moving' all over, and I'm riding' blind.</i>

484
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,079
<i>- Shit.
- Yeah.</i>

485
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,286
<i>I just made mine worse.</i>

486
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,230
<i>Oh, God.</i>

487
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,944
<i>Anybody bring any extra bags?</i>

488
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,088
<i>No, nobody brought an extra bag!</i>

489
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,862
<i>I'm just asking'.</i>

490
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,838
<i>Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?</i>

491
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,206
<i>Oh, well, shit fire!</i>

492
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,471
<i>If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!</i>

493
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,587
<i>Well, I can't see
in this fucking' thing!</i>

494
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,465
<i>I can't breathe in this fucking' thing
and I can't ride in this fucking' thing!</i>

495
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,047
<i>Well, fuck all y'all! I'm going' home!</i>

496
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,010
<i>Now, I watched my wife work all day
getting' 30 bags together</i>

497
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,174
<i>for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,</i>

498
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,107
<i>and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!</i>

499
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,435
<i>From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothing'!</i>

500
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,614
<i>Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.</i>

501
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,875
<i>We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!</i>

502
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,376
<i>And we got to make a lesson out of him.</i>

503
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,381
<i>OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?</i>

504
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:49,329
<i>I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.</i>

505
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,623
<i>- Yeah.</i>

506
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,724
<i>But, not pointing' any fingers,
they could a been done better.</i>

507
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:59,396
<i>So how 'bout no bags this time,</i>

508
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:04,549
<i>but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.</i>

509
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,765
<i>- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.</i>

510
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,228
<i>Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.</i>

511
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,389
<i>But nobody can see.</i>

512
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,648
<i>So?</i>

513
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,684
<i>So it'd be nice to see.</i>

514
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,618
<i>Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!</i>

515
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:26,165
<i>So what? All that matters is can
the fucking' horse see! That's a raid!</i>

516
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,129
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

517
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,624
<i>I can't see shit!</i>

518
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,424
<i>There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!</i>

519
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,248
<i>And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!</i>

520
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,042
<i>That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!</i>

521
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,630
<i>- What?
- They tricked us!</i>

522
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,851
<i>Well, where are they?</i>

523
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,425
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

524
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,944
<i>Oh!</i>

525
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,153
<i>Bull's-eye.</i>

526
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,452
<i>- Look at 'em run.</i>

527
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,657
<i>Yeah, cowards tend to do that.</i>

528
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,784
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

529
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,171
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

530
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,506
<i>Would you care to?</i>

531
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,140
<i>Can't see shit outta this!</i>

532
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,931
<i>- He's getting away.
- I got him.</i>

533
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,449
<i>Big Daddy's getting away.</i>

534
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,860
<i>I got him.</i>

535
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,171
<i>Got him.</i>

536
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,009
<i>The kid's a natural.</i>

537
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,475
<i>How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?</i>

538
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,901
<i>Broomhilda is a German name.</i>

539
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,775
<i>If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.</i>

540
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,198
<i>Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?</i>

541
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,960
<i>Broomhilda is the name of a character</i>

542
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,032
<i>in the most popular
of all the German legends.</i>

543
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,162
<i>There's a story about Broomhilda?</i>

544
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,039
<i>Oh, yes, there is.</i>

545
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,549
<i>- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.</i>

546
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,352
<i>Would you like me to tell you?</i>

547
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:59,849
<i>Well, Broomhilda was a princess.</i>

548
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,790
<i>She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.</i>

549
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,044
<i>Anyway, her father is really mad at her.</i>

550
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,454
<i>What she do?</i>

551
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,881
<i>I can't exactly remember.</i>

552
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,714
<i>She disobeys him in some way.</i>

553
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,039
<i>So he puts her on top of the mountain.</i>

554
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:21,828
<i>Broomhilda's on a mountain?</i>

555
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,258
<i>It's a German legend,</i>

556
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,223
<i>there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.</i>

557
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,424
<i>And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.</i>

558
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,185
<i>And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.</i>

559
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,982
<i>And there, Broomhilda shall remain.</i>

560
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:49,569
<i>Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.</i>

561
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,252
<i>Does a fella arise?</i>

562
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,381
<i>Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.</i>

563
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,587
<i>A fella named Siegfried.</i>

564
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,292
<i>Does Siegfried save her?</i>

565
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,079
<i>Quite spectacularly so.</i>

566
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,251
<i>He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.</i>

567
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,146
<i>He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.</i>

568
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,800
<i>And he walks through hellfire...</i>

569
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,524
<i>...because Broomhilda's worth it.</i>

570
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,326
<i>I know how he feel.</i>

571
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,660
<i>I think I'm just
starting to realize that.</i>

572
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:41,340
<i>Now, look, Django...</i>

573
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,294
<i>...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...</i>

574
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,011
<i>...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.</i>

575
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,516
<i>A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.</i>

576
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,565
<i>Free or not, it's just too dangerous.</i>

577
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,687
<i>But let me ask you a question.</i>

578
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,613
<i>How do you like the
bounty hunting business?</i>

579
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,466
<i>Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?</i>

580
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,635
<i>What's not to like?</i>

581
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,205
<i>Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.</i>

582
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,212
<i>I thought you was mad at me
for killing' Big John and Lil Raj.</i>

583
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,476
<i>Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,</i>

584
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,591
<i>but normally, that's a good thing.</i>

585
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,606
<i>How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?</i>

586
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,755
<i>What you mean "partner up"?</i>

587
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:42,234
<i>You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...</i>

588
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,221
<i>...I give you a third of my bounties.</i>

589
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:50,356
<i>So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,</i>

590
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,442
<i>I'll take you to Greenville myself</i>

591
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,836
<i>and we'll find
where they sent your wife.</i>

592
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,822
<i>Why you care what happen to me?</i>

593
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,542
<i>Why you care if I find my wife?</i>

594
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,089
<i>Frankly...</i>

595
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,260
<i>...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.</i>

596
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,272
<i>And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.</i>

597
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,236
<i>Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.</i>

598
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,650
<i>As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest</i>

599
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,432
<i>to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.</i>

600
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,729
<i>You got her.</i>

601
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:51,465
<i>Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Want to
Shoot White Folks For Money"?</i>

602
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,335
<i>- His son's with him.
- Well, good.</i>

603
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,098
<i>He'll have a loved one with him.</i>

604
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,748
<i>Maybe even share a last word.</i>

605
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,809
<i>That's better than most of them get.</i>

606
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,258
<i>Damn sight better than he deserves.</i>

607
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,783
<i>Put down the rifle.</i>

608
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,485
<i>Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.</i>

609
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,624
<i>Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.</i>

610
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,080
<i>Read it aloud.</i>

611
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,754
<i>Consider that today's lesson.</i>

612
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,842
<i>"Wanted. Dead or alive."</i>

613
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,711
<i>"Smitty Bacall and the
Smitty Bacall"</i>

614
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,137
<i>- Gang.
- "Gang."</i>

615
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,967
<i>"For murder and stagecoach...</i>

616
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,928
<i>...robbery."</i>

617
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,901
<i>- "Seven-zero-zero-zero..."
- Seven thousand.</i>

618
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,406
<i>Thousand.</i>

619
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:58,775
<i>"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."</i>

620
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:04,030
<i>"$1,500 for each of his...</i>

621
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,997
<i>...gang..."</i>

622
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,026

<i>"Known members of the Smitty Bacall
Gang are as follas:"</i>

00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,284
<i>- Follows.
- "Follows."</i>

625
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:20,183
<i>"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."</i>

626
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,223
<i>Crazy Craig Koon’s.</i>

627
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,472
<i>That is who Smitty Bacall is.</i>

628
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,517
<i>If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,</i>

629
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,640
<i>they would never have printed that.</i>

630
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,777
<i>But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches</i>

631
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,351
<i>and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.</i>

632
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,360
<i>Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?</i>

633
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,082
<i>This is what I do.</i>

634
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,790
<i>I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.</i>

635
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,492
<i>This corpse is worth $7,000.</i>

636
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,884
<i>Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.</i>

637
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,388
<i>Pa?</i>

638
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,897
<i>Pa!</i>

639
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,063
<i>Here.</i>

640
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,327
<i>You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.</i>

641
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,579
<i>- Why?
- It's good luck.</i>

642
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,536
<i>You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.</i>

643
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,865
<i>That's accurate.</i>

644
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,320
<i>Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?</i>

645
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,524
<i>Who the hell-a you got there?</i>

646
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,654
<i>The Wilson-Lowe Gang.</i>

647
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,828
<i>Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?</i>

648
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:41,076
<i>Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.</i>

649
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,879
<i>Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.</i>

650
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,423
<i>Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow</i>

651
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,421
<i>and get yourselves some coffee.</i>

652
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,140
<i>We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.</i>

653
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,713
<i>Pretty good.</i>

654
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,211
<i>Move along!</i>

655
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,636
<i>Move it, boy!</i>

656
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,422
<i>Keep moving'.</i>

657
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,545
<i>Get on up on that auction block.</i>

658
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,470
<i>Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.</i>

659
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,154
<i>Keep going'!</i>

660
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,528
<i>"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.</i>

661
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,113
<i>'r' on right cheek."</i>

662
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,041
<i>Calvin Candie.</i>

663
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:08,633
<i>He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi: Candy land.</i>

664
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,138
<i>Candy land?</i>

665
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,378
<i>Oh, so you've heard of it.</i>

666
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,642
<i>Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candy land.</i>

667
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,474
<i>Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...</i>

668
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,309
<i>- ...and that's the repellent gentleman</i>

669
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,022
<i>who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.</i>

670
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,312
<i>Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.</i>

671
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,469
<i>She... she pretty.</i>

672
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,070
<i>And she talk good, too.</i>

673
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,491
<i>But when they tore her back up
and then they...</i>

674
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,815
<i>...burned that runaway "r"
on her cheek...</i>

675
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,412
<i>...they goddamned her.</i>

676
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,498
<i>She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough</i>

677
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,655
<i>for the house no more either.</i>

678
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,119
<i>They going to try to
make her a comfort girl.</i>

679
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,159
<i>What's a comfort...? Oh.</i>

680
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,374
<i>Not while I got freedom.</i>

681
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,763
<i>Not while I got my gun.</i>

682
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,552
<i>So do we offer to buy her?</i>

683
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,560
<i>So...</i>

684
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,817
<i>...say...</i>

685
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,201
<i>...a man wants to buy a horse.</i>

686
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,408
<i>Needs to buy a horse.</i>

687
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,333
<i>He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door</i>

688
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,164
<i>and asks the farmer to buy his horse.</i>

689
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,124
<i>And do you know what the farmer says?</i>

690
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,505
<i>The farmer says no.</i>

691
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:31,959
<i>Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealing' that horse.</i>

692
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:36,248
<i>Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.</i>

693
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,625
<i>Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner</i>

694
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,334
<i>because the horse is still his property.</i>

695
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:44,392
<i>We need her and we need a bill of sale.</i>

696
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,158
<i>Well, if we ain't going to try to buy her,
then how we going to get her?</i>

697
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,520
<i>May I offer an alternative
plan of action?</i>

698
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,192
<i>Go ahead.</i>

699
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,898
<i>So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,</i>

700
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,607
<i>he knocks on the farmer's door...</i>

701
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:05,375
<i>...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.</i>

702
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:08,905
<i>And makes an offer so ridiculous,</i>

703
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,881
<i>the farmer is forced to say yes.</i>

704
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,494
<i>- We going to offer to buy Candy land?
- No, it's far too big.</i>

705
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,915
<i>But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.</i>

706
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,433
<i>How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?</i>

707
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,586
<i>What?</i>

708
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,596
<i>Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone</i>

709
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,439
<i>who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?</i>

710
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,649
<i>Why?</i>

711
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,441
<i>Because my character is that
of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>

712
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:37,032
<i>here in Greenville to buy my way
into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

713
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:41,108
<i>And your character is a Mandingo expert
I hired to help me do it.</i>

714
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,238
<i>They call that "One-Eyed Charley."</i>

715
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,796
<i>Bonjour.</i>

716
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,787
<i>We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.</i>

717
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,553
<i>Entraz.</i>

718
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,516
<i>- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.</i>

719
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,167
<i>You want me to play a black slaver?</i>

720
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,019
<i>Ain't nothing' lower than a black slaver.</i>

721
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,640
<i>A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...</i>

722
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,438
<i>...and, buddy,
that's pretty fucking' low.</i>

723
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,554
<i>Then play him that way.</i>

724
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,771
<i>Give me your black slaver.</i>

725
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,030
<i>Dr. Schultz!</i>

726
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,428
<i>- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.</i>

727
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,385
<i>Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity</i>

728
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,346
<i>- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.</i>

729
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,342
<i>So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.</i>

730
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,924
<i>Yes, this is Django Freeman.</i>

731
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,772
<i>Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.</i>

732
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,891
<i>Just call me Leo.</i>

733
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:56,224
<i>Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all want to follow me?</i>

734
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,758
<i>How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?</i>

735
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,327
<i>Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11</i>

736
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,284
<i>when we went to
boarding school together.</i>

737
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,541
<i>Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.</i>

738
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,704
<i>One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.</i>

739
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,610
<i>One could almost say you see a nigger.</i>

740
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,908
<i>What did you say?</i>

741
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:16,824
<i>- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.</i>

742
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,803
<i>Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?</i>

743
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,956
<i>Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.</i>

744
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,932
<i>What civilized people aren't?</i>

745
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,347
<i>And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.</i>

746
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:35,146
<i>He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.</i>

747
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,317
<i>Get back on top, now!
Turn around!</i>

748
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,783
<i>There you go.</i>

749
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,908
<i>Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?</i>

750
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,499
<i>You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?</i>

751
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,114
<i>Quit stalling, now.</i>

752
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,635
<i>Answer the question.</i>

753
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,721
<i>The awful truth? I'm bored.</i>

754
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,261
<i>This seems like a good bit of fun.</i>

755
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,173
<i>Well, come on over.</i>

756
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,059
<i>We got us a fight going' on
that's a good bit of fun.</i>

757
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,575
<i>Won't you accompany me to the bar?</i>

758
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,306
<i>You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.</i>

759
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,860
<i>- Dr. Schultz.
- What a rare pleasure.</i>

760
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,375
<i>Keep fighting, niggers.</i>

761
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,348
<i>- And I might add, an honour.
- Honour to meet you.</i>

762
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,434
<i>Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.</i>

763
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,089
<i>Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.</i>

764
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,553
<i>And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.</i>

765
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,243
<i>Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go.</i>

766
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,670
<i>He's much bigger and stronger!</i>

767
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,429
<i>Come on, now!</i>

768
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,079
<i>He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.</i>

769
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,976
<i>Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!</i>

770
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,234
<i>- You either hit him or are you ain't?</i>

771
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,328
<i>- Big Fred, come on!</i>

772
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,022
<i>Turn him around! Now...</i>

773
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:58,160
<i>Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!</i>

774
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,046
<i>There you go!</i>

775
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,845
<i>There you go! Look at that.</i>

776
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,891
<i>See, I told you to put
some more power in there.</i>

777
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,097
<i>Do what I told you, boy!</i>

778
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,728
<i>- There you go!</i>

779
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,174
<i>- No!
- Do what I told ya!</i>

780
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,385
<i>Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!</i>

781
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,303
<i>- Oh, no, Luigi.</i>

782
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:31,439
<i>- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

783
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,243
<i>Oh...</i>

784
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,077
<i>Finish him.</i>

785
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,121
<i>Go on, boy, finish him!</i>

786
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,344
<i>That's why they
call him Big Fred.</i>

787
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,939
<i>- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.</i>

788
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,319
<i>Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.</i>

789
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:06,482
<i>You did a fine job.
A real fine job.</i>

790
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,813
<i>Mercedes.</i>

791
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,127
<i>Tequila.</i>

792
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,642
<i>What's your name?</i>

793
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,313
<i>Django.</i>

794
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,404
<i>Can you spell it?</i>

795
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:56,566
<i>D-J-A-N-G-O.</i>

796
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,576
<i>The D is silent.</i>

797
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,335
<i>I know.</i>

798
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,787
<i>Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.</i>

799
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,671
<i>You find him a room
with a soft bed,</i>

800
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,424
<i>then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.</i>

801
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,394
<i>But you be ready to travel to Candy land
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?</i>

802
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,503
<i>Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.</i>

803
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:25,561
<i>Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.</i>

804
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,401
<i>You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.</i>

805
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,853
<i>Yes sir.</i>

806
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:47,158
<i>- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.</i>

807
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,326
<i>Where'd you dig him up?</i>

808
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,746
<i>A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.</i>

809
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,561
<i>I've heard tell about you.</i>

810
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,045
<i>I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.</i>

811
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,350
<i>Ain't nothing' nobody
is selling' is worth buying'.</i>

812
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:09,726
<i>I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?</i>

813
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,101
<i>I'm curious what makes you so curious.</i>

814
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,497
<i>- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.</i>

815
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,874
<i>No offense given...</i>

816
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,906
<i>...none taken.</i>

817
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,784
<i>Monsieur Candie...</i>

818
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,446
<i>...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.</i>

819
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,092
<i>One...</i>

820
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,838
<i>...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?</i>

821
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,837
<i>- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.</i>

822
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,839
<i>Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,</i>

823
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,841
<i>and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.</i>

824
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,105
<i>Do not spare the rum.</i>

825
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,756
<i>Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.</i>

826
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,641
<i>You are, well, you are a neophyte.</i>

827
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:54,931
<i>I'm simply trying' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is taking' advantage of you.</i>

828
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,621
<i>With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...</i>

829
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,187
<i>...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.</i>

830
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,493
<i>I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger</i>

831
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,208
<i>at above top-dollar market price.</i>

832
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,919
<i>Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,</i>

833
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,459
<i>it would be to discuss business.</i>

834
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,638
<i>Well, we weren't talking' business yet.</i>

835
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,141
<i>We were discussing' my curiosity.</i>

836
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,417
<i>Thank you.</i>

837
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,302
<i>Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.</i>

838
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,766
<i>Sheba... you stay right there.</i>

839
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,472
<i>I know you didn't mean me.</i>

840
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,723
<i>- Proust!
- German.</i>

841
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,440
<i>Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,</i>

842
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,661
<i>I'm doing business with both y'all.</i>

843
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,236
<i>He does the eyeballing',
you the billfold? Is that it?</i>

844
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,165
<i>Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.</i>

845
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,502
<i>Hm.</i>

846
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:54,781
<i>So...</i>

847
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,882
<i>...Bright Boy...</i>

848
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,004
<i>...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh</i>

849
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,334
<i>and you was
none too impressed, huh?</i>

850
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,009
<i>Not for top dollar.</i>

851
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,226
<i>Well, then,
we got nothing' more to talk about.</i>

852
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,516
<i>You see, you want to buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,</i>

853
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,935
<i>those are the beat-ass niggers
I want to sell so...</i>

854
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,058
<i>He don't want to buy the niggers
you want to sell.</i>

855
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,184
<i>He wants the nigger
you don't want to sell.</i>

856
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,658
<i>Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't want to sell.</i>

857
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,570
<i>Well, you won't sell your best.</i>

858
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,155
<i>You won't even sell your second best.</i>

859
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,993
<i>But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.</i>

860
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:39,080
<i>But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...</i>

861
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,927
<i>...who knows what could happen?</i>

862
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,545
<i>And what do you consider ridiculous?</i>

863
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,649
<i>For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?</i>

864
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,440
<i>How much would you say, Django?</i>

865
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,522
<i>Twelve thousand dollars.</i>

866
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:09,076
<i>Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,</i>

867
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,165
<i>but now you have my attention.</i>

868
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:30,519
<i>Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!</i>

869
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,092
<i>- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.</i>

870
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:37,180
<i>- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.</i>

871
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,232
<i>Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.</i>

872
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,934
<i>Oh, thank you very much.</i>

873
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,236
<i>You can tie your horse up back there.</i>

874
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,737
<i>Django.</i>

875
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,171
<i>Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues</i>

876
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:07,513
<i>is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,</i>

877
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,794
<i>above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.</i>

878
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,636
<i>Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.</i>

879
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,311
<i>The exceptional nigger.</i>

880
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,360
<i>Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?</i>

881
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,653
<i>Sun is up.</i>

882
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,683
<i>Shining on all of us.</i>

883
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,362
<i>- Have a seat, doc.
- Thank you.</i>

884
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,821
<i>Quite an honour.</i>

885
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,702
<i>- The honour is all ours.
- Thank you.</i>

886
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,240
<i>But I do believe that,
given time,</i>

887
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,387
<i>exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...</i>

888
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,170
<i>...become if not frequent...</i>

889
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,040
<i>...more frequent.</i>

890
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:56,399
<i>Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.</i>

891
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,436
<i>The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.</i>

892
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:13,700
<i>- Whoa!</i>

893
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,626
<i>- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!</i>

894
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,711
<i>Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.</i>

895
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,920
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

896
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,074
<i>- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!</i>

897
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,800
<i>Now take your hand off your pistol!</i>

898
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,679
<i>Butch, that means you too.</i>

899
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,888
<i>Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.</i>

900
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,608
<i>Hoot! Get back up on your horse.</i>

901
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,886
<i>He broke my collarbone!</i>

902
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:45,361
<i>For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.</i>

903
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,561
<i>- Yes sir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.</i>

904
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,321
<i>You better listen to your boss,
white boy.</i>

905
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,956
<i>Oh, I'm going to go
walking in the moonlight with you.</i>

906
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,913
<i>You want to hold my hand?</i>

907
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,172
<i>Willie, take us home.</i>

908
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,411
<i>Start moving!</i>

909
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,055
<i>Head 'em out!</i>

910
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,284
<i>You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?</i>

911
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,645
<i>No, sir.</i>

912
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,313
<i>You want a boot heel in it?</i>

913
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,478
<i>No, sir.</i>

914
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,686
<i>Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.</i>

915
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,989
<i>You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.</i>

916
01:16:16,259 --> 01:16:17,795
<i>Now move, nigger!</i>

917
01:16:19,929 --> 01:16:22,057
<i>You niggers are going to
understand something about me.</i>

918
01:16:22,223 --> 01:16:24,089
<i>I'm worse than any of these
white men here.</i>

919
01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:27,851
<i>You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.</i>

920
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:31,059
<i>He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he?</i>

921
01:16:31,232 --> 01:16:32,575
<i>Indeed.</i>

922
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,437
<i>May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?</i>

923
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:42,336
<i>You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candy land,</i>

924
01:16:42,493 --> 01:16:45,588
<i>so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have</i>

925
01:16:45,747 --> 01:16:50,116
<i>a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.</i>

926
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:54,919
<i>You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?</i>

927
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:57,137
<i>I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candy land.</i>

928
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:03,762
<i>- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,</i>

929
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:07,300
<i>but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.</i>

930
01:17:07,477 --> 01:17:09,343
<i>Now, while it's not wise to assume,</i>

931
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,989
<i>in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.</i>

932
01:17:12,148 --> 01:17:16,779
<i>Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.</i>

933
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:18,902
<i>You lose sight of why we're here.</i>

934
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:20,873
<i>- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.</i>

935
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:23,524
<i>Stop antagonizing Candie.</i>

936
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:28,662
<i>You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.</i>

937
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:33,496
<i>And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.</i>

938
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,674
<i>I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.</i>

939
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:39,388
<i>You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.</i>

940
01:17:40,385 --> 01:17:45,801
<i>I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son</i>

941
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:47,772
<i>and he didn't bat a eye.</i>

942
01:17:49,185 --> 01:17:50,300
<i>You remember that?</i>

943
01:17:52,563 --> 01:17:53,906
<i>Yeah, of course I remember.</i>

944
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:57,524
<i>What you said was that
this is my world...</i>

945
01:17:58,486 --> 01:18:00,477
<i>...and in my world you got to get dirty.</i>

946
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:04,368
<i>So that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting' dirty.</i>

947
01:18:08,037 --> 01:18:11,200
<i>Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...</i>

948
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,761
<i>...that was the general gist.</i>

949
01:18:18,506 --> 01:18:20,008
<i>See you at Candy land.</i>

950
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:30,307
<i>All right, niggers, back at it.</i>

951
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:33,650
<i>That means you too, Moonlight.</i>

952
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:23,906
<i>I'll be. D'Artagnan!</i>

953
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:27,315
<i>Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?</i>

954
01:19:27,492 --> 01:19:29,586
<i>I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.</i>

955
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,030
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

956
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:34,754
<i>You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.</i>

957
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:37,328
<i>Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?</i>

958
01:19:37,502 --> 01:19:40,119
<i>- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!</i>

959
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:42,344
<i>Marsha, hush up! Marsha!</i>

960
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:44,043
<i>Hush up! Hey!</i>

961
01:19:44,217 --> 01:19:46,834
<i>Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!</i>

962
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:59,813
<i>Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.</i>

963
01:19:59,982 --> 01:20:01,655
<i>Yes sir.</i>

964
01:20:24,215 --> 01:20:26,343
<i>How long was he loose?</i>

965
01:20:26,509 --> 01:20:29,752
<i>A night. Day.</i>

966
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:31,545
<i>Half the other night.</i>

967
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,218
<i>How far he get off the property?</i>

968
01:20:34,392 --> 01:20:36,099
<i>'Bout 20 miles off the prop.</i>

969
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:38,397
<i>Pretty far considering
that limp he got.</i>

970
01:20:38,563 --> 01:20:39,940
<i>Hm.</i>

971
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:44,524
<i>Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?</i>

972
01:20:44,694 --> 01:20:46,310
<i>One-a this new lot.</i>

973
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:50,196
<i>Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.</i>

974
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,858
<i>Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.</i>

975
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:54,555
<i>- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...</i>

976
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:57,116
<i>Now, no begging'.</i>

977
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,759
<i>No playing' on my soft heart.</i>

978
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:05,761
<i>- You in trouble now, son.
- Yes sir.</i>

979
01:21:08,676 --> 01:21:12,226
<i>I done paid $500 for you.</i>

980
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:17,258
<i>When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger</i>

981
01:21:17,435 --> 01:21:19,813
<i>- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.</i>

982
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:23,859
<i>You got to understand
that I'm running' a business here.</i>

983
01:21:24,025 --> 01:21:26,733
<i>- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.</i>

984
01:21:26,903 --> 01:21:28,405
<i>Yes, you did. Yes, you did.</i>

985
01:21:28,571 --> 01:21:31,575
<i>But that last one, you muddled the line
between winning' and losing'.</i>

986
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:32,788
<i>Yes sir.</i>

987
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,501
<i>Still, the fact remains:</i>

988
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:41,293
<i>I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!</i>

989
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:44,008
<i>So what about my $500, huh?</i>

990
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,803
<i>What about my $500?</i>

991
01:21:49,342 --> 01:21:50,878
<i>You going to reimburse me?</i>

992
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:59,269
<i>You even know what "reimburse" means?</i>

993
01:21:59,435 --> 01:22:01,483
<i>Huh?</i>

994
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:09,484
<i>I'll reimburse you!</i>

995
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:14,447
<i>You will?</i>

996
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,196
<i>Yep.</i>

997
01:22:19,956 --> 01:22:22,664
<i>You'll pay $500</i>

998
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:26,292
<i>for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?</i>

999
01:22:26,462 --> 01:22:27,577
<i>No, he won't.</i>

1000
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,934
<i>He just tired of you
toying' with him is all.</i>

1001
01:22:32,843 --> 01:22:34,800
<i>Matter of fact, so am I.</i>

1002
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:37,440
<i>But we ain't paying' a penny
for that pickaninny.</i>

1003
01:22:37,598 --> 01:22:39,478
<i>Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?</i>

1004
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:42,349
<i>You heard him.</i>

1005
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:55,284
<i>You're going to have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.</i>

1006
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:59,113
<i>He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.</i>

1007
01:22:59,912 --> 01:23:01,869
<i>Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?</i>

1008
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,593
<i>That right.</i>

1009
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:07,929
<i>For that matter...</i>

1010
01:23:09,213 --> 01:23:10,806
<i>...nor have I.</i>

1011
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:18,059
<i>Now...</i>

1012
01:23:19,223 --> 01:23:22,352
<i>...seeing' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...</i>

1013
01:23:24,854 --> 01:23:28,188
<i>...you won't mind me handling'
this nigger any way I see fit?</i>

1014
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:30,853
<i>He's your nigger.</i>

1015
01:23:34,614 --> 01:23:36,708
<i>Mr. Stonesipher?</i>

1016
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:41,462
<i>Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.</i>

1017
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:46,411
<i>- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!</i>

1018
01:23:47,877 --> 01:23:50,096
<i>Get 'im, get 'im!</i>

1019
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,622
<i>- Yeah!
- Whoo!</i>

1020
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:55,210
<i>Whoo-ee!</i>

1021
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:25,627
<i>Your boss looks a little
green around the gills</i>

1022
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,952
<i>for a blood sport like nigger fighting.</i>

1023
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:32,756
<i>Nah, he just ain't used to seeing'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.</i>

1024
01:24:33,339 --> 01:24:34,625
<i>Hm.</i>

1025
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:37,093
<i>You are used to it?</i>

1026
01:24:37,259 --> 01:24:40,229
<i>I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.</i>

1027
01:24:40,388 --> 01:24:45,110
<i>- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...</i>

1028
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:46,883
<i>...whenever you're ready.</i>

1029
01:24:47,061 --> 01:24:50,429
<i>We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.</i>

1030
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:52,222
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1031
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:57,811
<i>'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.</i>

1032
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,443
<i>Follow me.</i>

1033
01:26:58,734 --> 01:27:01,442
<i>Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.</i>

1034
01:27:03,072 --> 01:27:04,449
<i>Stand up straight, now!</i>

1035
01:27:05,616 --> 01:27:06,902
<i>Get up there.</i>

1036
01:27:07,076 --> 01:27:09,659
<i>Get up there, boy. Come on.</i>

1037
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:11,445
<i>Give me a line! Give me a line!</i>

1038
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:13,716
<i>Get in line there! Straighten up!</i>

1039
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,966
<i>Hello! Stephen, my boy!</i>

1040
01:28:15,144 --> 01:28:17,818
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.</i>

1041
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:20,950
<i>Who this nigger up on that nag?</i>

1042
01:28:21,108 --> 01:28:24,442
<i>Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?</i>

1043
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:26,990
<i>- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yes sir.</i>

1044
01:28:27,156 --> 01:28:30,706
<i>I miss you like a hog miss slop!</i>

1045
01:28:30,868 --> 01:28:34,782
<i>- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.</i>

1046
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:38,801
<i>I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.</i>

1047
01:28:41,211 --> 01:28:45,671
<i>Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?</i>

1048
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:47,514
<i>Hey, Snowball?</i>

1049
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,303
<i>Want to know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.</i>

1050
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:55,306
<i>Just who the hell you calling'
"Snowball," horse boy?</i>

1051
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:57,236
<i>I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there</i>

1052
01:28:57,311 --> 01:28:58,688
<i>- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

1053
01:28:58,854 --> 01:29:00,974
<i>- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.</i>

1054
01:29:01,106 --> 01:29:05,407
<i>Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.</i>

1055
01:29:05,569 --> 01:29:07,947
<i>- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.</i>

1056
01:29:08,113 --> 01:29:10,366
<i>Let me at least
introduce the two of you.</i>

1057
01:29:10,532 --> 01:29:14,321
<i>Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.</i>

1058
01:29:14,495 --> 01:29:17,738
<i>Stephen, this here's Django.
You two ought a hate each other.</i>

1059
01:29:17,915 --> 01:29:21,920
<i>Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?</i>

1060
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:26,000
<i>Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.</i>

1061
01:29:26,173 --> 01:29:27,550
<i>And they are our guests, Stephen.</i>

1062
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:31,209
<i>And you, you old decrepit bastard,
ought a show them every hospitality.</i>

1063
01:29:31,387 --> 01:29:33,765
<i>- You understand that?
- Yes sir. Him I understand.</i>

1064
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:35,604
<i>But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.</i>

1065
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:38,383
<i>You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?</i>

1066
01:29:39,395 --> 01:29:40,897
<i>Yes sir. I understand.</i>

1067
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:43,532
<i>Well, good.
They're spending' the night.</i>

1068
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:45,819
<i>Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.</i>

1069
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:48,659
<i>He going to stay in The Big House?</i>

1070
01:29:48,821 --> 01:29:51,040
<i>Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.</i>

1071
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:53,781
<i>- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?</i>

1072
01:29:53,951 --> 01:29:56,238
<i>Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,</i>

1073
01:29:56,412 --> 01:29:58,460
<i>if you ain't got no problem
with burning' the bed, the sheets,</i>

1074
01:29:58,622 --> 01:30:00,966
<i>the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!</i>

1075
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,378
<i>That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!</i>

1076
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:05,763
<i>Now your problem right now
is making' a good impression!</i>

1077
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:07,844
<i>And I want you to start solving'
that problem right now</i>

1078
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:09,623
<i>and get them goddamn rooms ready!</i>

1079
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,683
<i>Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.</i>

1080
01:30:15,139 --> 01:30:16,311
<i>Go on, now.</i>

1081
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:19,636
<i>Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.</i>

1082
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:21,153
<i>Your daddy rolling' over
in his goddamned grave.</i>

1083
01:30:21,311 --> 01:30:24,861
<i>Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's getting' worse and worse.</i>

1084
01:30:25,024 --> 01:30:26,196
<i>Now...</i>

1085
01:30:26,358 --> 01:30:31,023
<i>Where is my beautiful sister?!</i>

1086
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:34,291
<i>There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

1087
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:39,502
<i>Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.</i>

1088
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:43,668
<i>Darling', you are a tonic for tired eyes.</i>

1089
01:30:44,918 --> 01:30:48,286
<i>May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.</i>

1090
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:51,832
<i>Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charley.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.</i>

1091
01:30:52,009 --> 01:30:54,137
<i>- Come on, Charley. Come on, now!
- Let's go.</i>

1092
01:30:54,303 --> 01:30:55,350
<i>You know where it is.</i>

1093
01:30:55,512 --> 01:30:57,253
<i>Like you on a rope!</i>

1094
01:30:58,474 --> 01:31:01,216
<i>Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!</i>

1095
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:04,939
<i>- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?</i>

1096
01:31:05,105 --> 01:31:08,894
<i>Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?</i>

1097
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:10,024
<i>Nigger gal?</i>

1098
01:31:10,194 --> 01:31:13,198
<i>Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.</i>

1099
01:31:13,363 --> 01:31:15,946
<i>Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?</i>

1100
01:31:16,116 --> 01:31:20,292
<i>Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?</i>

1101
01:31:20,454 --> 01:31:24,630
<i>You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.</i>

1102
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:28,160
<i>Stephen, when you get through showing'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,</i>

1103
01:31:28,337 --> 01:31:30,169
<i>get her cleaned up
and smelling' real nice,</i>

1104
01:31:30,339 --> 01:31:31,750
<i>and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.</i>

1105
01:31:31,924 --> 01:31:33,597
<i>Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,</i>

1106
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:36,433
<i>there's-a something'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.</i>

1107
01:31:36,637 --> 01:31:40,301
<i>- What?
- Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.</i>

1108
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:43,089
<i>What's she doing' there?</i>

1109
01:31:43,143 --> 01:31:45,885
<i>What you think she
doing' there in the Hot Box?</i>

1110
01:31:46,063 --> 01:31:47,531
<i>She being' punished.</i>

1111
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:50,033
<i>- What she do?
- She run off again.</i>

1112
01:31:50,192 --> 01:31:52,866
<i>Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?</i>

1113
01:31:53,028 --> 01:31:55,520
<i>- Two.
- When did she go?</i>

1114
01:31:55,697 --> 01:31:58,189
<i>Last night.
They brung her back this morning.</i>

1115
01:31:58,367 --> 01:32:01,041
<i>How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?</i>

1116
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:05,447
<i>Lucky for her,
they was out chasing' D'Artagnan's ass.</i>

1117
01:32:05,624 --> 01:32:09,925
<i>Bill and Cody went looking' for her,
found her, brung her back.</i>

1118
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:13,000
<i>Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self</i>

1119
01:32:13,173 --> 01:32:14,379
<i>running' through them
damn bushes and shit.</i>

1120
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:16,223
<i>How long she been in the box?</i>

1121
01:32:16,385 --> 01:32:19,184
<i>How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.</i>

1122
01:32:19,346 --> 01:32:22,020
<i>And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.</i>

1123
01:32:22,182 --> 01:32:25,220
<i>- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?</i>

1124
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:29,308
<i>Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.</i>

1125
01:32:29,481 --> 01:32:30,437
<i>Hildi is my nigger.</i>

1126
01:32:30,607 --> 01:32:33,770
<i>Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.</i>

1127
01:32:33,944 --> 01:32:37,164
<i>- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.</i>

1128
01:32:37,322 --> 01:32:39,734
<i>What is the point of having'
a nigger that speaks German</i>

1129
01:32:39,908 --> 01:32:42,377
<i>if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?</i>

1130
01:32:42,536 --> 01:32:46,712
<i>Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.</i>

1131
01:32:46,874 --> 01:32:48,046
<i>Yes sir.</i>

1132
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:51,917
<i>Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible</i>

1133
01:32:52,087 --> 01:32:55,455
<i>for getting' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.</i>

1134
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:57,009
<i>Of course, darling'.</i>

1135
01:32:57,176 --> 01:33:02,046
<i>Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.</i>

1136
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:05,101
<i>It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.</i>

1137
01:33:09,938 --> 01:33:12,680
<i>Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!</i>

1138
01:33:12,858 --> 01:33:15,407
<i>Cora! Come here!</i>

1139
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:18,607
<i>Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...</i>

1140
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:21,158
<i>- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.</i>

1141
01:33:21,325 --> 01:33:23,794
<i>Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.</i>

1142
01:33:23,952 --> 01:33:27,320
<i>- Yes sir.</i>

1143
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,624
<i>Come on, girl. Stand up.</i>

1144
01:34:43,657 --> 01:34:47,207
<i>Is you coming' with me or is you going to
sleep in that little box over yonder?</i>

1145
01:36:22,381 --> 01:36:23,849
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

1146
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:27,375
<i>Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?</i>

1147
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:34,025
<i>Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.</i>

1148
01:36:35,477 --> 01:36:37,605
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.</i>

1149
01:36:38,647 --> 01:36:40,991
<i>I've heard a lot of
good things about you.</i>

1150
01:36:41,149 --> 01:36:43,948
<i>Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.</i>

1151
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:49,188
<i>As I look at you now, Broomhilda,</i>

1152
01:36:49,366 --> 01:36:54,327
<i>I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.</i>

1153
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,010
<i>The doctor here speaks German.</i>

1154
01:37:02,003 --> 01:37:03,960
<i>And I've been informed you do as well?</i>

1155
01:37:05,507 --> 01:37:07,669
<i>Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.</i>

1156
01:37:14,224 --> 01:37:15,840
<i>Ha!</i>

1157
01:37:16,017 --> 01:37:18,008
<i>Astonishing.</i>

1158
01:37:24,985 --> 01:37:27,204
<i>- And I shall bring you...
- Much obliged.</i>

1159
01:37:36,705 --> 01:37:37,820
<i>Ja.</i>

1160
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:02,697
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1161
01:38:40,769 --> 01:38:43,261
<i>Hm. Pardon.</i>

1162
01:38:50,862 --> 01:38:52,148
<i>Danke.</i>

1163
01:40:37,594 --> 01:40:39,187
<i>Hey, Little Trouble Maker.</i>

1164
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:51,071
<i>You silver-tongued devil, you.</i>

1165
01:40:52,651 --> 01:40:53,994
<i>- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.</i>

1166
01:40:54,152 --> 01:40:55,513
<i>No, no, no, they drinking' tonight.</i>

1167
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,610
<i>Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?</i>

1168
01:40:58,698 --> 01:41:01,440
<i>- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.</i>

1169
01:41:01,618 --> 01:41:03,837
<i>That's 'cause
you knows what I like.</i>

1170
01:41:03,995 --> 01:41:06,578
<i>Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.</i>

1171
01:41:06,748 --> 01:41:12,551
<i>Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.</i>

1172
01:41:12,712 --> 01:41:17,081
<i>But the best three by far were Samson...</i>

1173
01:41:18,468 --> 01:41:20,069
<i>- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.</i>

1174
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:23,554
<i>Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.</i>

1175
01:41:23,723 --> 01:41:26,306
<i>By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?</i>

1176
01:41:26,476 --> 01:41:29,571
<i>You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.</i>

1177
01:41:29,729 --> 01:41:32,312
<i>His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?</i>

1178
01:41:35,985 --> 01:41:41,333
<i>Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.</i>

1179
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:45,212
<i>You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.</i>

1180
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:49,125
<i>Hm-hm.
All three are champions.</i>

1181
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,885
<i>Samson's the champion.</i>

1182
01:41:52,043 --> 01:41:53,841
<i>The other two pretty good.</i>

1183
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:56,731
<i>Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...</i>

1184
01:41:56,798 --> 01:41:57,913
<i>It's all right.</i>

1185
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:00,185
<i>You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,</i>

1186
01:42:00,343 --> 01:42:03,711
<i>while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,</i>

1187
01:42:03,888 --> 01:42:08,189
<i>I do have a little bit of a background
in the European travelling circus.</i>

1188
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:09,432
<i>Is that right?</i>

1189
01:42:09,602 --> 01:42:13,698
<i>Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.</i>

1190
01:42:13,857 --> 01:42:14,813
<i>Hm.</i>

1191
01:42:14,983 --> 01:42:17,452
<i>I need something more
than just a big nigger.</i>

1192
01:42:19,195 --> 01:42:21,414
<i>Yeah, he needs to have panache.</i>

1193
01:42:21,573 --> 01:42:24,668
<i>- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...</i>

1194
01:42:24,826 --> 01:42:27,568
<i>- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.</i>

1195
01:42:27,746 --> 01:42:30,966
<i>I want to be able to bill hirn
as The Black Hercules.</i>

1196
01:42:32,917 --> 01:42:34,397
<i>The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?</i>

1197
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:35,451
<i>More like Nigger-les.</i>

1198
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:43,304
<i>I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...</i>

1199
01:42:43,803 --> 01:42:46,602
<i>...'the right nigger."'</i>

1200
01:42:46,765 --> 01:42:51,066
<i>Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.</i>

1201
01:42:51,227 --> 01:42:53,935
<i>But is he right as rain?</i>

1202
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:56,601
<i>Oh, Dr. Schultz,</i>

1203
01:42:56,775 --> 01:43:00,564
<i>I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game</i>

1204
01:43:00,737 --> 01:43:02,660
<i>that appreciates
the value of showmanship</i>

1205
01:43:02,822 --> 01:43:04,563
<i>more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.</i>

1206
01:43:04,741 --> 01:43:05,731
<i>Nobody.</i>

1207
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:07,789
<i>But one must not forget
the most important thing</i>

1208
01:43:07,911 --> 01:43:09,311
<i>- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.</i>

1209
01:43:09,454 --> 01:43:11,445
<i>And that is a nigger
that can win fights.</i>

1210
01:43:11,623 --> 01:43:12,829
<i>Hm-mm.</i>

1211
01:43:12,999 --> 01:43:17,209
<i>Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.</i>

1212
01:43:17,378 --> 01:43:19,458
<i>Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,</i>

1213
01:43:19,589 --> 01:43:23,560
<i>then you can start
to implement a grand design.</i>

1214
01:43:23,718 --> 01:43:26,267
<i>In other words, first thing is first.</i>

1215
01:43:26,429 --> 01:43:27,897
<i>First things first.</i>

1216
01:43:35,563 --> 01:43:38,931
<i>Ooh! I see you two getting' on.</i>

1217
01:43:39,108 --> 01:43:40,974
<i>Famously.</i>

1218
01:43:41,736 --> 01:43:44,410
<i>Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like</i>

1219
01:43:44,572 --> 01:43:47,906
<i>not to hear your
native tongue in four years.</i>

1220
01:43:48,076 --> 01:43:49,956
<i>Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.</i>

1221
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,378
<i>Two weeks in Boston!</i>

1222
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:57,340
<i>- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!</i>

1223
01:43:57,502 --> 01:43:59,209
<i>Two weeks in Boston!</i>

1224
01:43:59,379 --> 01:44:04,590
<i>I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.</i>

1225
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:08,855
<i>And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.</i>

1226
01:44:09,013 --> 01:44:10,879
<i>Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.</i>

1227
01:44:11,057 --> 01:44:12,400
<i>You might-a caught yourself</i>

1228
01:44:12,559 --> 01:44:13,811
<i>- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!</i>

1229
01:44:13,977 --> 01:44:16,071
<i>Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.</i>

1230
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:18,220
<i>- Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.</i>

1231
01:44:18,398 --> 01:44:20,014
<i>Once it catches your ass, you're caught.</i>

1232
01:44:20,191 --> 01:44:23,161
<i>Yes sir, you stuck.</i>

1233
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:24,855
<i>I don't know, doctor.</i>

1234
01:44:25,029 --> 01:44:27,282
<i>You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,</i>

1235
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:31,954
<i>but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.</i>

1236
01:44:34,372 --> 01:44:36,841
<i>Well, naturally.</i>

1237
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,630
<i>It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,</i>

1238
01:44:40,795 --> 01:44:43,594
<i>- not the plucked chicken.</i>

1239
01:44:43,756 --> 01:44:46,248
<i>Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.</i>

1240
01:44:46,426 --> 01:44:48,349
<i>You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.</i>

1241
01:44:48,511 --> 01:44:49,711
<i>You got to clean these dishes,</i>

1242
01:44:49,721 --> 01:44:51,882
<i>you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?</i>

1243
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,109
<i>You know that nigger, don't you?</i>

1244
01:44:55,018 --> 01:44:56,304
<i>- Who?
- "Who?"</i>

1245
01:44:56,477 --> 01:44:59,572
<i>Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talking' about.</i>

1246
01:45:01,316 --> 01:45:03,307
<i>At the table?</i>

1247
01:45:03,484 --> 01:45:04,736
<i>I don't know him.</i>

1248
01:45:04,903 --> 01:45:07,941
<i>- You don't know him.
- No.</i>

1249
01:45:08,114 --> 01:45:10,947
<i>- "No," what?
- No, sir.</i>

1250
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:18,049
<i>You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?</i>

1251
01:45:22,253 --> 01:45:23,459
<i>OK.</i>

1252
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:27,843
<i>Yeah. If you say so.</i>

1253
01:45:34,307 --> 01:45:37,732
<i>Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.</i>

1254
01:45:39,103 --> 01:45:44,280
<i>But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.</i>

1255
01:45:44,442 --> 01:45:46,786
<i>What would your price be?</i>

1256
01:45:46,945 --> 01:45:48,902
<i>Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...</i>

1257
01:45:49,072 --> 01:45:52,531
<i>...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...</i>

1258
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:56,736
<i>...9,000. Maybe.</i>

1259
01:45:57,997 --> 01:46:03,800
<i>Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.</i>

1260
01:46:03,962 --> 01:46:06,124
<i>You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.</i>

1261
01:46:06,297 --> 01:46:07,253
<i>Sure wasn't.</i>

1262
01:46:07,423 --> 01:46:09,130
<i>It was you who approached me to buy one.</i>

1263
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,462
<i>- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure</i>

1264
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:14,048
<i>Bright Boy's been bandying' about,
that ain't too far off from right.</i>

1265
01:46:14,222 --> 01:46:15,942
<i>And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,</i>

1266
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:18,985
<i>- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.</i>

1267
01:46:19,143 --> 01:46:23,387
<i>But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.</i>

1268
01:46:24,023 --> 01:46:28,028
<i>It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000</i>

1269
01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:31,027
<i>- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.</i>

1270
01:46:39,205 --> 01:46:43,301
<i>You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.</i>

1271
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:49,625
<i>Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.</i>

1272
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:53,133
<i>- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- Hooray, doctor.</i>

1273
01:46:53,302 --> 01:46:55,430
<i>Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.</i>

1274
01:46:55,596 --> 01:46:59,146
<i>However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.</i>

1275
01:46:59,308 --> 01:47:02,471
<i>And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.</i>

1276
01:47:02,645 --> 01:47:04,443
<i>Pernickety man named Tuttle.</i>

1277
01:47:04,605 --> 01:47:07,700
<i>And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract</i>

1278
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:10,897
<i>before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.</i>

1279
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,060
<i>Hm-mm.</i>

1280
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:13,911
<i>Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined</i>

1281
01:47:14,073 --> 01:47:16,690
<i>- by a physician of my choosing.
- Naturally.</i>

1282
01:47:16,868 --> 01:47:21,590
<i>So, say I return in about...</i>

1283
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,037
<i>- ...five days time.
- Five days?</i>

1284
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,462
<i>With my Mr. Tuttle.</i>

1285
01:47:27,628 --> 01:47:29,676
<i>And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy</i>

1286
01:47:29,839 --> 01:47:32,809
<i>can hash out the finer
details between themselves.</i>

1287
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:36,672
<i>I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.</i>

1288
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,602
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

1289
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:41,590
<i>...may I propose a toast.</i>

1290
01:47:43,978 --> 01:47:48,848
<i>To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?</i>

1291
01:47:49,025 --> 01:47:51,699
<i>- To The Black Hercules.</i>

1292
01:47:51,861 --> 01:47:53,238
<i>The Black Hercules.</i>

1293
01:47:53,404 --> 01:47:54,815
<i>To The Black Hercules.</i>

1294
01:47:54,989 --> 01:47:58,835
<i>You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.</i>

1295
01:47:58,993 --> 01:48:00,404
<i>Hm.</i>

1296
01:48:00,578 --> 01:48:03,821
<i>Hildi, top my drink off.</i>

1297
01:48:06,918 --> 01:48:11,970
<i>So, Hildi, how you like serving'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?</i>

1298
01:48:12,131 --> 01:48:15,351
<i>When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.</i>

1299
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:18,252
<i>- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.</i>

1300
01:48:18,429 --> 01:48:21,171
<i>It's a lot better than sizzling'
in that Hot Box or dragging' your ass</i>

1301
01:48:21,349 --> 01:48:22,692
<i>through a bramble bush.</i>

1302
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:25,971
<i>But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
getting' to pleasure all them Mandingos,</i>

1303
01:48:26,104 --> 01:48:27,697
<i>- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.</i>

1304
01:48:27,855 --> 01:48:29,027
<i>- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?</i>

1305
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,658
<i>No, sir.</i>

1306
01:48:30,817 --> 01:48:32,160
<i>You know, Monsieur Candie,</i>

1307
01:48:32,318 --> 01:48:35,982
<i>the doctor here might be interested
in seeing' Hildi's peeled back,</i>

1308
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:39,398
<i>seeing' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.</i>

1309
01:48:39,575 --> 01:48:41,703
<i>Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,</i>

1310
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:44,907
<i>did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?</i>

1311
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:46,822
<i>No, we just talked and...</i>

1312
01:48:46,999 --> 01:48:49,377
<i>Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?</i>

1313
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:51,342
<i>- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.</i>

1314
01:48:51,504 --> 01:48:53,552
<i>Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.</i>

1315
01:48:53,714 --> 01:48:56,809
<i>Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.</i>

1316
01:48:56,968 --> 01:48:58,925
<i>- Go on.
- Uh, Calvin.</i>

1317
01:48:59,095 --> 01:49:01,473
<i>I just got her all dressed up
and looking' nice.</i>

1318
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:04,552
<i>But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.</i>

1319
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:07,729
<i>They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.</i>

1320
01:49:07,895 --> 01:49:10,478
<i>I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.</i>

1321
01:49:10,648 --> 01:49:14,232
<i>These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.</i>

1322
01:49:14,402 --> 01:49:16,564
<i>Hildi's got something'
like four lashes on her back.</i>

1323
01:49:16,737 --> 01:49:18,737
<i>Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.</i>

1324
01:49:18,865 --> 01:49:19,946
<i>- Sure would.
- Look at that, doctor.</i>

1325
01:49:20,116 --> 01:49:22,369
<i>- It's like a painting'. Look at that.
- Calvin!</i>

1326
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:26,199
<i>We are eating. Ain't no one want to
look at her whipped up back.</i>

1327
01:49:27,874 --> 01:49:30,286
<i>- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.</i>

1328
01:49:30,459 --> 01:49:33,133
<i>After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.</i>

1329
01:49:34,338 --> 01:49:36,136
<i>During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?</i>

1330
01:49:42,513 --> 01:49:44,049
<i>Cora, come get this girl!</i>

1331
01:49:47,518 --> 01:49:50,738
<i>- She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. Oh!</i>

1332
01:49:50,897 --> 01:49:53,366
<i>Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.</i>

1333
01:49:53,524 --> 01:49:54,867
<i>Come on in here.</i>

1334
01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:05,154
<i>Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.</i>

1335
01:50:05,328 --> 01:50:07,285
<i>You say you ain't know him.</i>

1336
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:09,495
<i>Huh?</i>

1337
01:50:09,665 --> 01:50:15,263
<i>I said, you said you ain't know him.</i>

1338
01:50:16,422 --> 01:50:19,790
<i>- I don't.
- Yes, you do.</i>

1339
01:50:21,969 --> 01:50:23,585
<i>Mr. Stephen...</i>

1340
01:50:24,597 --> 01:50:25,587
<i>...I don't.</i>

1341
01:50:25,765 --> 01:50:28,257
<i>Why is you lying to me?</i>

1342
01:50:30,645 --> 01:50:31,988
<i>I ain't.</i>

1343
01:50:32,146 --> 01:50:34,638
<i>Then why is you crying?</i>

1344
01:50:34,815 --> 01:50:36,977
<i>You scaring' me.</i>

1345
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:41,065
<i>- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.</i>

1346
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,835
<i>To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi</i>

1347
01:50:45,993 --> 01:50:49,122
<i>was positively soul-enriching.</i>

1348
01:50:49,288 --> 01:50:52,167
<i>Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.</i>

1349
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:55,166
<i>You stay right here.</i>

1350
01:51:00,508 --> 01:51:05,014
<i>You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.</i>

1351
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:08,012
<i>Why, yes.
Yes sir ee bob, I did.</i>

1352
01:51:10,017 --> 01:51:15,979
<i>In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.</i>

1353
01:51:16,148 --> 01:51:17,525
<i>I'm all ears.</i>

1354
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:19,399
<i>Hurry up, goddamn it!</i>

1355
01:51:20,027 --> 01:51:21,620
<i>- Monsieur Candie...
- Stephen!</i>

1356
01:51:22,655 --> 01:51:25,124
<i>You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.</i>

1357
01:51:26,242 --> 01:51:28,370
<i>I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.</i>

1358
01:51:28,536 --> 01:51:31,244
<i>My ears ain't worth a damn these days.</i>

1359
01:51:31,414 --> 01:51:32,529
<i>Excuse him.</i>

1360
01:51:32,707 --> 01:51:36,462
<i>Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?</i>

1361
01:51:36,627 --> 01:51:38,550
<i>You mean get up out of my chair?</i>

1362
01:51:38,713 --> 01:51:42,047
<i>- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?</i>

1363
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:46,062
<i>- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?</i>

1364
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,837
<i>I'd rather discuss that in private.</i>

1365
01:51:49,015 --> 01:51:50,881
<i>We're having white cake!</i>

1366
01:51:51,058 --> 01:51:53,402
<i>What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?</i>

1367
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:57,896
<i>You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.</i>

1368
01:51:58,065 --> 01:51:59,863
<i>Meet me in the library.</i>

1369
01:52:00,026 --> 01:52:03,121
<i>I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.</i>

1370
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:05,145
<i>Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.</i>

1371
01:52:05,323 --> 01:52:10,318
<i>Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.</i>

1372
01:52:10,494 --> 01:52:11,666
<i>Yes sir.</i>

1373
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:16,244
<i>Well, gentlemen, as you can see,</i>

1374
01:52:16,417 --> 01:52:18,258
<i>talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,</i>

1375
01:52:18,336 --> 01:52:21,966
<i>from time to time,
adult supervision is required.</i>

1376
01:52:24,967 --> 01:52:26,765
<i>If you'll excuse me a moment.</i>

1377
01:52:32,933 --> 01:52:34,731
<i>You may clear
the dinner service.</i>

1378
01:52:36,187 --> 01:52:39,555
<i>You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.</i>

1379
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:45,148
<i>So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.</i>

1380
01:52:45,321 --> 01:52:47,995
<i>The circus?</i>

1381
01:52:54,455 --> 01:52:56,253
<i>What is the matter?</i>

1382
01:53:01,504 --> 01:53:06,590
<i>Them motherfuckers
ain't hereto buy no Mandingos.</i>

1383
01:53:06,759 --> 01:53:10,309
<i>- They wants that girl.</i>

1384
01:53:10,471 --> 01:53:13,213
<i>Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?</i>

1385
01:53:13,391 --> 01:53:16,554
<i>They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.</i>

1386
01:53:16,727 --> 01:53:20,391
<i>They ain't here for
no muscle bound Jimmie.</i>

1387
01:53:20,564 --> 01:53:22,726
<i>They here for that girl.</i>

1388
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,517
<i>Wh... What girl? Hildi?</i>

1389
01:53:25,694 --> 01:53:29,324
<i>Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.</i>

1390
01:53:31,033 --> 01:53:32,626
<i>He just bought Eskimo Joe.</i>

1391
01:53:32,785 --> 01:53:35,163
<i>- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...</i>

1392
01:53:35,329 --> 01:53:37,798
<i>Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, no how.</i>

1393
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,210
<i>But he's just about to buy</i>

1394
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:43,596
<i>who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.</i>

1395
01:53:43,754 --> 01:53:46,758
<i>"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.</i>

1396
01:53:52,179 --> 01:53:54,170
<i>Where you getting' all this?</i>

1397
01:53:55,307 --> 01:53:57,105
<i>Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger</i>

1398
01:53:57,268 --> 01:53:59,760
<i>with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?</i>

1399
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:04,238
<i>They doing' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.</i>

1400
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,232
<i>She probably his wife.</i>

1401
01:54:06,402 --> 01:54:09,201
<i>Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch</i>

1402
01:54:09,363 --> 01:54:12,458
<i>is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.</i>

1403
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:16,992
<i>If she's who they want...</i>

1404
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,881
<i>...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?</i>

1405
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:25,535
<i>You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.</i>

1406
01:54:25,713 --> 01:54:31,186
<i>But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?</i>

1407
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,561
<i>Yes, it did.</i>

1408
01:54:38,893 --> 01:54:40,509
<i>His Wife, huh?</i>

1409
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:48,119
<i>If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.</i>

1410
01:54:51,405 --> 01:54:53,396
<i>Those lying...</i>

1411
01:54:54,241 --> 01:55:00,237
<i>...goddamn time-wasting'
sons of bitches.</i>

1412
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,630
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

1413
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:09,041
<i>...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theatre types.</i>

1414
01:55:10,299 --> 01:55:11,767
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>

1415
01:55:11,926 --> 01:55:14,725
<i>I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.</i>

1416
01:55:16,514 --> 01:55:18,676
<i>That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?</i>

1417
01:55:18,849 --> 01:55:21,944
<i>Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.</i>

1418
01:55:22,102 --> 01:55:25,140
<i>Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver</i>

1419
01:55:25,314 --> 01:55:26,395
<i>trying to sell a passel of ponies.</i>

1420
01:55:26,565 --> 01:55:30,445
<i>Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?</i>

1421
01:55:30,611 --> 01:55:32,864
<i>- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.</i>

1422
01:55:46,126 --> 01:55:49,847
<i>- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.</i>

1423
01:55:51,882 --> 01:55:54,795
<i>Apropos, before your exit,</i>

1424
01:55:54,969 --> 01:55:58,974
<i>we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.</i>

1425
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:02,052
<i>Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.</i>

1426
01:56:02,226 --> 01:56:04,354
<i>And we will again. In a moment.</i>

1427
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:22,876
<i>Who's your little friend?</i>

1428
01:56:27,835 --> 01:56:29,337
<i>This is Ben.</i>

1429
01:56:30,671 --> 01:56:35,666
<i>He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.</i>

1430
01:56:35,843 --> 01:56:38,255
<i>And I do mean a long damn time.</i>

1431
01:56:39,346 --> 01:56:43,101
<i>Old Ben here took care of my daddy...</i>

1432
01:56:43,976 --> 01:56:46,024
<i>...and my daddy's daddy.</i>

1433
01:56:46,186 --> 01:56:48,769
<i>Till he up and keeled over one day...</i>

1434
01:56:51,609 --> 01:56:53,282
<i>...Old Ben took care of me.</i>

1435
01:56:55,863 --> 01:56:59,652
<i>Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi</i>

1436
01:56:59,825 --> 01:57:05,696
<i>puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.</i>

1437
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:12,624
<i>I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candy land...</i>

1438
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:17,670
<i>...surrounded by black faces.</i>

1439
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,064
<i>Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,</i>

1440
01:57:22,222 --> 01:57:25,385
<i>I only had one question:</i>

1441
01:57:29,104 --> 01:57:31,573
<i>- Why don't they kill us?</i>

1442
01:57:34,568 --> 01:57:39,745
<i>Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,</i>

1443
01:57:39,907 --> 01:57:44,834
<i>Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.</i>

1444
01:57:44,995 --> 01:57:50,115
<i>Now, if I was Old Ben, I would a
cut my daddy's goddamn throat</i>

1445
01:57:50,292 --> 01:57:53,717
<i>and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.</i>

1446
01:57:56,256 --> 01:57:57,758
<i>But he never did.</i>

1447
01:57:59,635 --> 01:58:00,921
<i>Why not?</i>

1448
01:58:02,304 --> 01:58:07,094
<i>You see, the science of phrenology</i>

1449
01:58:07,267 --> 01:58:12,353
<i>is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.</i>

1450
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:17,912
<i>In the skull of the African here,</i>

1451
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:20,198
<i>the area associated
with submissiveness</i>

1452
01:58:20,364 --> 01:58:25,871
<i>is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.</i>

1453
01:58:41,385 --> 01:58:43,342
<i>If you examine...</i>

1454
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,884
<i>...this piece of skull here...</i>

1455
01:58:53,188 --> 01:58:56,772
<i>...you will notice
three distinct dimples.</i>

1456
01:59:00,362 --> 01:59:04,083
<i>Here, here and here.</i>

1457
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:05,493
<i>Now...</i>

1458
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:10,654
<i>...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,</i>

1459
01:59:10,831 --> 01:59:13,323
<i>these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull</i>

1460
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,834
<i>most associated with... creativity.</i>

1461
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,336
<i>But this is the skull of Old Ben.</i>

1462
01:59:19,965 --> 01:59:22,093
<i>And in the skull of Old Ben,</i>

1463
01:59:22,259 --> 01:59:24,546
<i>unburdened by genius,</i>

1464
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:28,896
<i>these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...</i>

1465
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:31,360
<i>...servility.</i>

1466
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,093
<i>Now, Bright Boy...</i>

1467
01:59:35,022 --> 01:59:37,184
<i>...I will admit you are pretty clever.</i>

1468
01:59:39,651 --> 01:59:41,745
<i>But if I took this hammer here...</i>

1469
01:59:43,864 --> 01:59:46,208
<i>...and I bashed in your skull with it...</i>

1470
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:52,549
<i>...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...</i>

1471
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:55,259
<i>...as Old Ben.</i>

1472
01:59:56,376 --> 01:59:59,960
<i>Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!</i>

1473
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,100
<i>If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,</i>

1474
02:00:03,258 --> 02:00:06,501
<i>Mr. Pooch is going to let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.</i>

1475
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:10,725
<i>There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,</i>

1476
02:00:10,891 --> 02:00:13,235
<i>but that you can believe!</i>

1477
02:00:13,393 --> 02:00:16,192
<i>Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol</i>

1478
02:00:16,355 --> 02:00:18,733
<i>hanging off these boys' hips here?</i>

1479
02:00:23,445 --> 02:00:25,857
<i>- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.</i>

1480
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,787
<i>Where were we?</i>

1481
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,661
<i>Jackass.</i>

1482
02:00:41,672 --> 02:00:43,174
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

1483
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:46,082
<i>I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me</i>

1484
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,729
<i>a proposition to buy Broomhilda.</i>

1485
02:00:48,887 --> 02:00:50,264
<i>Am I right?</i>

1486
02:00:54,268 --> 02:00:55,611
<i>Right.</i>

1487
02:00:58,021 --> 02:00:59,523
<i>Bring Out Hildi!</i>

1488
02:01:02,276 --> 02:01:03,812
<i>Get over there yonder.</i>

1489
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:07,532
<i>- Sit your ass in that goddamn...</i>

1490
02:01:07,698 --> 02:01:09,098
<i>Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.</i>

1491
02:01:09,116 --> 02:01:10,652
<i>Now shut your mouth!</i>

1492
02:01:14,955 --> 02:01:17,538
<i>Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,</i>

1493
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:20,450
<i>you yourself said that
for the right nigger</i>

1494
02:01:20,627 --> 02:01:24,962
<i>you'd be willing' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.</i>

1495
02:01:25,132 --> 02:01:28,170
<i>To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"</i>

1496
02:01:28,343 --> 02:01:32,314
<i>To which you said, "$12,000."</i>

1497
02:01:33,098 --> 02:01:34,839
<i>- Now, considering y'all</i>

1498
02:01:35,017 --> 02:01:36,974
<i>have ridden a whole lot of miles,</i>

1499
02:01:37,144 --> 02:01:41,115
<i>went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull</i>

1500
02:01:41,273 --> 02:01:43,685
<i>to purchase this
lovely lady right here,</i>

1501
02:01:43,859 --> 02:01:49,821
<i>it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.</i>

1502
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:53,745
<i>And if y'all want to leave
Candy land with Broomhilda,</i>

1503
02:01:53,911 --> 02:01:59,543
<i>the price is $12,000.</i>

1504
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:03,497
<i>And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?</i>

1505
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:07,292
<i>Yes, I do, doctor.</i>

1506
02:02:08,133 --> 02:02:11,137
<i>You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,</i>

1507
02:02:11,303 --> 02:02:14,853
<i>Broomhilda here is my property.</i>

1508
02:02:15,015 --> 02:02:20,135
<i>And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!</i>

1509
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:23,516
<i>And if y'all think my price...</i>

1510
02:02:24,191 --> 02:02:26,899
<i>...for this nigger here
is too steep...</i>

1511
02:02:27,069 --> 02:02:30,528
<i>- ...what I'm going to desire to do is...</i>

1512
02:02:34,451 --> 02:02:37,580
<i>...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!</i>

1513
02:02:37,746 --> 02:02:39,874
<i>- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.</i>

1514
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:44,546
<i>Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!</i>

1515
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:48,887
<i>Now, what's it going to be, doc?
Huh?</i>

1516
02:02:49,049 --> 02:02:50,392
<i>- What's it going to be?</i>

1517
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:54,430
<i>May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?</i>

1518
02:02:55,639 --> 02:02:56,982
<i>Yes, you may.</i>

1519
02:03:10,737 --> 02:03:11,943
<i>That 12.</i>

1520
02:03:15,993 --> 02:03:17,859
<i>- Sold!</i>

1521
02:03:18,036 --> 02:03:20,585
<i>To the man with the exceptional beard</i>

1522
02:03:20,747 --> 02:03:24,081
<i>and his unexceptional nigger.</i>

1523
02:03:29,923 --> 02:03:32,210
<i>- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?</i>

1524
02:03:32,384 --> 02:03:36,048
<i>Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?</i>

1525
02:03:36,221 --> 02:03:37,962
<i>$12,000.</i>

1526
02:03:41,101 --> 02:03:43,263
<i>It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.</i>

1527
02:03:44,146 --> 02:03:45,887
<i>Now, gentlemen...</i>

1528
02:03:47,107 --> 02:03:48,973
<i>...if you care to
join me in the parlour...</i>

1529
02:03:49,943 --> 02:03:52,412
<i>...we will be serving white cake.</i>

1530
02:05:20,742 --> 02:05:22,085
<i>Well done, Calvin.</i>

1531
02:05:24,579 --> 02:05:27,458
<i>Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?</i>

1532
02:05:28,917 --> 02:05:32,581
<i>Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!</i>

1533
02:05:36,842 --> 02:05:37,923
<i>Doctor!</i>

1534
02:05:38,093 --> 02:05:40,710
<i>- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.</i>

1535
02:05:40,887 --> 02:05:42,059
<i>He ain't got no business
going in there.</i>

1536
02:05:42,222 --> 02:05:43,565
<i>Let it be.</i>

1537
02:05:43,723 --> 02:05:45,646
<i>He's just a little upset, that's all.</i>

1538
02:05:45,809 --> 02:05:47,220
<i>I'll handle this.</i>

1539
02:06:13,086 --> 02:06:14,372
<i>White cake?</i>

1540
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:17,633
<i>I don't go in for sweets, thank you.</i>

1541
02:06:18,675 --> 02:06:19,881
<i>Hm.</i>

1542
02:06:27,601 --> 02:06:30,309
<i>You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?</i>

1543
02:06:31,021 --> 02:06:35,777
<i>Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.</i>

1544
02:06:35,942 --> 02:06:37,774
<i>D'Artagnan.</i>

1545
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:42,359
<i>And I was wondering What
Dumas would make of all this.</i>

1546
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:44,000
<i>Come again?</i>

1547
02:06:47,078 --> 02:06:51,117
<i>Aleixandre Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.</i>

1548
02:06:51,291 --> 02:06:52,964
<i>Yes, of course, doctor.</i>

1549
02:06:53,126 --> 02:06:54,662
<i>I figured you must be an admirer.</i>

1550
02:06:54,836 --> 02:06:59,262
<i>You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.</i>

1551
02:06:59,424 --> 02:07:03,145
<i>Now, if Aleixandre Dumas
had been there today,</i>

1552
02:07:03,303 --> 02:07:05,260
<i>I wonder what
he would have made of it.</i>

1553
02:07:07,307 --> 02:07:09,139
<i>You doubt he'd approve, huh?</i>

1554
02:07:11,353 --> 02:07:16,530
<i>Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.</i>

1555
02:07:18,818 --> 02:07:20,616
<i>Soft-hearted Frenchie.</i>

1556
02:07:22,489 --> 02:07:24,708
<i>Aleixandre Dumas is black.</i>

1557
02:07:28,536 --> 02:07:31,335
<i>- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.</i>

1558
02:07:31,498 --> 02:07:33,171
<i>- May I?
- Of course.</i>

1559
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:34,710
<i>Thank you.</i>

1560
02:07:36,836 --> 02:07:39,806
<i>That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,</i>

1561
02:07:39,965 --> 02:07:42,127
<i>and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.</i>

1562
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:44,519
<i>Would you have ink and pen for me?</i>

1563
02:07:45,762 --> 02:07:48,675
<i>- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.</i>

1564
02:08:09,995 --> 02:08:11,201
<i>Thank you.</i>

1565
02:08:14,791 --> 02:08:17,078
<i>Broomhilda Von Shaft...</i>

1566
02:08:19,337 --> 02:08:21,715
<i>...consider yourself a free woman.</i>

1567
02:08:33,643 --> 02:08:35,600
<i>Mr. Candie...</i>

1568
02:08:37,564 --> 02:08:41,353
<i>...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1569
02:08:41,526 --> 02:08:45,986
<i>But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"</i>

1570
02:08:46,156 --> 02:08:48,500
<i>and since I never
wish to see you again,</i>

1571
02:08:48,658 --> 02:08:53,323
<i>to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."</i>

1572
02:08:57,208 --> 02:08:58,494
<i>Let's go.</i>

1573
02:08:59,461 --> 02:09:00,997
<i>Come on.</i>

1574
02:09:02,714 --> 02:09:04,808
<i>One more moment, doctor!</i>

1575
02:09:06,676 --> 02:09:07,723
<i>What?</i>

1576
02:09:12,432 --> 02:09:14,560
<i>It's a custom here in the South...</i>

1577
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:20,442
<i>...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.</i>

1578
02:09:21,274 --> 02:09:23,322
<i>It implies good faith.</i>

1579
02:09:23,485 --> 02:09:26,523
<i>- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...</i>

1580
02:09:26,696 --> 02:09:28,983
<i>...in my house, doctor.</i>

1581
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:32,779
<i>- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?</i>

1582
02:09:32,952 --> 02:09:34,943
<i>On what?
That I shake your hand?</i>

1583
02:09:35,121 --> 02:09:38,421
<i>Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.</i>

1584
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:42,046
<i>- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?</i>

1585
02:09:42,212 --> 02:09:44,010
<i>No, I don't.</i>

1586
02:09:45,673 --> 02:09:50,884
<i>- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.</i>

1587
02:09:51,054 --> 02:09:56,015
<i>Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done</i>

1588
02:09:56,184 --> 02:09:58,801
<i>until the two parties
have shook hands.</i>

1589
02:09:59,687 --> 02:10:02,520
<i>Even after all that paper signing',
don't mean shit...</i>

1590
02:10:03,483 --> 02:10:06,976
<i>...you don't shake my hand.</i>

1591
02:10:07,946 --> 02:10:13,624
<i>If I don't shake your hand,
you're going to throw away $12,000?</i>

1592
02:10:13,785 --> 02:10:15,526
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1593
02:10:16,538 --> 02:10:17,710
<i>Mr. Pooch?</i>

1594
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:24,263
<i>If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,</i>

1595
02:10:24,421 --> 02:10:26,162
<i>you cut her ass down.</i>

1596
02:10:48,194 --> 02:10:51,528
<i>You really want me to shake your hand?</i>

1597
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,792
<i>I insist.</i>

1598
02:10:55,869 --> 02:10:58,543
<i>If you insist.</i>

1599
02:11:15,138 --> 02:11:18,142
<i>No! Calvin!</i>

1600
02:11:19,225 --> 02:11:20,818
<i>Calvin!</i>

1601
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:29,642
<i>I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.</i>

1602
02:11:41,915 --> 02:11:44,077
<i>Nigger's gone crazy! Help!</i>

1603
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:46,048
<i>- Help, he's killing everyone!</i>

1604
02:11:52,008 --> 02:11:53,055
<i>Ah!</i>

1605
02:12:03,102 --> 02:12:04,217
<i>Holy...!</i>

1606
02:12:04,395 --> 02:12:06,614
<i>Shit! Son of a bitch!</i>

1607
02:12:10,777 --> 02:12:11,983
<i>Damn it! Fucking'...!</i>

1608
02:12:12,153 --> 02:12:14,497
<i>- Get the...!</i>

1609
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:17,959
<i>Damn it, son of a bitch!</i>

1610
02:12:18,117 --> 02:12:19,653
<i>What...? Fucking...</i>

1611
02:12:19,827 --> 02:12:21,443
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

1612
02:12:22,789 --> 02:12:25,076
<i>- What the fuck is going on?</i>

1613
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:27,207
<i>You shot me!</i>

1614
02:12:27,377 --> 02:12:30,472
<i>- You stupid son of a bitch!
- Sorry, Jessie!</i>

1615
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:34,749
<i>Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?</i>

1616
02:13:04,789 --> 02:13:05,904
<i>Aim low!</i>

1617
02:13:08,251 --> 02:13:10,083
<i>Nigger! Gonna kill...!</i>

1618
02:13:11,045 --> 02:13:13,207
<i>God! Oh, my God!</i>

1619
02:13:13,381 --> 02:13:15,338
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

1620
02:13:24,183 --> 02:13:25,355
<i>Shit!</i>

1621
02:14:22,325 --> 02:14:23,406
<i>Shit.</i>

1622
02:14:35,588 --> 02:14:36,999
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

1623
02:14:40,426 --> 02:14:41,928
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

1624
02:14:43,846 --> 02:14:45,712
<i>Stop shooting', goddamn it!</i>

1625
02:14:54,524 --> 02:14:55,867
<i>Django!</i>

1626
02:14:56,025 --> 02:14:57,277
<i>What?</i>

1627
02:15:00,488 --> 02:15:02,104
<i>We got your woman!</i>

1628
02:15:03,533 --> 02:15:06,025
<i>Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.</i>

1629
02:15:06,202 --> 02:15:08,785
<i>- You don't stop all that carrying on,</i>

1630
02:15:08,955 --> 02:15:11,993
<i>- he going to blow her goddamn brains out.</i>

1631
02:15:12,166 --> 02:15:16,137
<i>And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.</i>

1632
02:15:17,755 --> 02:15:18,961
<i>Or...</i>

1633
02:15:19,132 --> 02:15:22,136
<i>...you can give up,
throw your gun out...</i>

1634
02:15:23,261 --> 02:15:25,423
<i>- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!</i>

1635
02:15:25,596 --> 02:15:29,317
<i>Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.</i>

1636
02:15:30,393 --> 02:15:35,024
<i>You give up,
ain't no harm going to come to her.</i>

1637
02:15:36,482 --> 02:15:38,894
<i>And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?</i>

1638
02:15:39,068 --> 02:15:41,776
<i>Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!</i>

1639
02:15:41,946 --> 02:15:44,984
<i>I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,</i>

1640
02:15:45,158 --> 02:15:49,038
<i>we going to blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!</i>

1641
02:15:51,289 --> 02:15:55,044
<i>Don't do it.
You give me up.</i>

1642
02:15:55,209 --> 02:15:57,041
<i>- Six!
- Just let me go.</i>

1643
02:15:57,211 --> 02:15:58,747
<i>- Seven!
- They got too much.</i>

1644
02:15:58,921 --> 02:16:00,514
<i>- Django.
- Eight!</i>

1645
02:16:00,673 --> 02:16:03,165
<i>- I love you.
- Nine!</i>

1646
02:16:03,342 --> 02:16:05,436
<i>- Hold it!
- No.</i>

1647
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:08,511
<i>I give up.</i>

1648
02:16:09,724 --> 02:16:12,466
<i>I can't hear you, nigger.</i>

1649
02:16:12,643 --> 02:16:15,135
<i>I said I give up!</i>

1650
02:16:38,252 --> 02:16:40,801
<i>No!</i>

1651
02:16:41,964 --> 02:16:43,432
<i>No!</i>

1652
02:18:14,682 --> 02:18:17,265
<i>Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.</i>

1653
02:18:22,565 --> 02:18:24,693
<i>So y'all bounty hunters, huh?</i>

1654
02:18:25,651 --> 02:18:28,393
<i>I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.</i>

1655
02:18:29,405 --> 02:18:31,624
<i>We found your wanted posters...</i>

1656
02:18:32,199 --> 02:18:34,418
<i>...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.</i>

1657
02:18:35,828 --> 02:18:37,444
<i>I got to say...</i>

1658
02:18:38,164 --> 02:18:41,464
<i>...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.</i>

1659
02:18:41,626 --> 02:18:44,664
<i>Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?</i>

1660
02:18:45,713 --> 02:18:48,330
<i>Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?</i>

1661
02:18:57,808 --> 02:18:59,640
<i>Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.</i>

1662
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:02,484
<i>- On three. One...</i>

1663
02:19:02,647 --> 02:19:05,526
<i>- I got you. Two...</i>

1664
02:19:05,691 --> 02:19:08,911
<i>- Calm down, now, here it comes.</i>

1665
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:11,653
<i>Captain?</i>

1666
02:19:11,822 --> 02:19:13,563
<i>Miss Lara want to see you.</i>

1667
02:19:14,408 --> 02:19:18,322
<i>Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.</i>

1668
02:19:18,496 --> 02:19:22,285
<i>Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.</i>

1669
02:19:23,084 --> 02:19:25,917
<i>She going to give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.</i>

1670
02:19:27,755 --> 02:19:29,883
<i>Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.</i>

1671
02:19:37,139 --> 02:19:38,937
<i>How disappointing.</i>

1672
02:20:01,872 --> 02:20:03,215
<i>You leaving'.</i>

1673
02:20:04,875 --> 02:20:07,913
<i>This here what you take with you.</i>

1674
02:20:11,298 --> 02:20:14,757
<i>Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House</i>

1675
02:20:14,927 --> 02:20:18,352
<i>could talk about
for the last few hours.</i>

1676
02:20:18,514 --> 02:20:22,235
<i>Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in the life</i>

1677
02:20:22,393 --> 02:20:25,101
<i>was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.</i>

1678
02:20:25,271 --> 02:20:30,562
<i>Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fucking' with your fun parts.</i>

1679
02:20:30,735 --> 02:20:36,276
<i>Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...</i>

1680
02:20:37,867 --> 02:20:40,120
<i>...when you snip a nigger's nuts,</i>

1681
02:20:40,286 --> 02:20:44,496
<i>most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.</i>

1682
02:20:44,665 --> 02:20:46,258
<i>Most of 'em.</i>

1683
02:20:46,459 --> 02:20:49,622
<i>Well, more than most.</i>

1684
02:20:50,379 --> 02:20:56,216
<i>Then I says: "Shit fire."</i>

1685
02:20:56,385 --> 02:21:00,390
<i>"The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."</i>

1686
02:21:01,432 --> 02:21:04,140
<i>And they still saying',
"Let's whip him to death."</i>

1687
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:07,610
<i>Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."</i>

1688
02:21:07,772 --> 02:21:10,992
<i>And I said,
"What's so special about that?"</i>

1689
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:13,278
<i>"We do that shit all the time."</i>

1690
02:21:13,444 --> 02:21:19,315
<i>"Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."</i>

1691
02:21:20,451 --> 02:21:23,159
<i>Lo and behold,</i>

1692
02:21:23,329 --> 02:21:28,176
<i>out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea</i>

1693
02:21:28,334 --> 02:21:31,793
<i>of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.</i>

1694
02:21:34,173 --> 02:21:39,293
<i>And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,</i>

1695
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:43,020
<i>henceforth, till the day you die,</i>

1696
02:21:43,182 --> 02:21:46,311
<i>all day, every day,</i>

1697
02:21:46,477 --> 02:21:49,310
<i>you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,</i>

1698
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:54,111
<i>turning big rocks into little rocks.</i>

1699
02:21:54,276 --> 02:21:58,873
<i>Now, when you get there,
they going to take away your name,</i>

1700
02:21:59,031 --> 02:22:01,944
<i>give you a number
and a sledgehammer,</i>

1701
02:22:02,118 --> 02:22:04,530
<i>and say, "Get to work!"</i>

1702
02:22:04,703 --> 02:22:07,115
<i>One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.</i>

1703
02:22:07,289 --> 02:22:09,633
<i>And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.</i>

1704
02:22:09,792 --> 02:22:13,456
<i>Oh, they does that real good.</i>

1705
02:22:13,629 --> 02:22:15,222
<i>They going to work ya.</i>

1706
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:20,376
<i>All day, every day,
till your back give out.</i>

1707
02:22:20,553 --> 02:22:23,136
<i>Then they're going to hit you
in the head with a hammer,</i>

1708
02:22:23,305 --> 02:22:25,717
<i>throw your ass down the nigger hole.</i>

1709
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:31,273
<i>And that will be the story of you,
Django.</i>

1710
02:23:10,311 --> 02:23:12,871
<i>And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?</i>

1711
02:23:12,938 --> 02:23:15,066
<i>You don't root abos.</i>

1712
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:21,288
<i>Hey, white boy.</i>

1713
02:23:22,823 --> 02:23:24,985
<i>I said, hey, white boy.</i>

1714
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:28,254
<i>Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.</i>

1715
02:23:28,412 --> 02:23:30,699
<i>How'd you like to make $11,000?</i>

1716
02:23:30,873 --> 02:23:32,045
<i>Do what, now?</i>

1717
02:23:32,208 --> 02:23:38,011
<i>I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.</i>

1718
02:23:38,172 --> 02:23:40,129
<i>What the fuck are you talking about?</i>

1719
02:23:40,299 --> 02:23:44,964
<i>Back there at that plantation,
Candy land, there was an $11,500 fortune,</i>

1720
02:23:45,137 --> 02:23:47,970
<i>just sitting' there.
And y'all rode right past it.</i>

1721
02:23:48,933 --> 02:23:50,640
<i>You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.</i>

1722
02:23:50,809 --> 02:23:55,019
<i>I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.</i>

1723
02:23:55,189 --> 02:23:56,600
<i>You can't steal it.</i>

1724
02:23:56,774 --> 02:23:58,447
<i>You got to earn it, white boy.</i>

1725
02:23:59,401 --> 02:24:01,392
<i>You got something to say, mate,
you say it.</i>

1726
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:04,790
<i>The $11,500 fortune waiting'
for you back at Candy land</i>

1727
02:24:04,949 --> 02:24:07,077
<i>is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty</i>

1728
02:24:07,243 --> 02:24:09,587
<i>on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.</i>

1729
02:24:09,745 --> 02:24:11,213
<i>Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?</i>

1730
02:24:11,372 --> 02:24:14,672
<i>Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,</i>

1731
02:24:14,833 --> 02:24:16,426
<i>the Bacall Gang.</i>

1732
02:24:16,585 --> 02:24:19,828
<i>There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,</i>

1733
02:24:20,005 --> 02:24:23,339
<i>$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:</i>

1734
02:24:23,509 --> 02:24:26,752
<i>Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,</i>

1735
02:24:26,929 --> 02:24:29,637
<i>and Crazy Craig Koon’s.</i>

1736
02:24:29,807 --> 02:24:31,218
<i>Now, all four of them gentlemen,</i>

1737
02:24:31,392 --> 02:24:33,520
<i>they back there at Candy land
laughing their ass off.</i>

1738
02:24:33,686 --> 02:24:37,350
<i>You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.</i>

1739
02:24:37,523 --> 02:24:39,059
<i>But it ain't got to be that way.</i>

1740
02:24:39,233 --> 02:24:42,533
<i>You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.</i>

1741
02:24:42,695 --> 02:24:43,855
<i>What'd these jokers do again?</i>

1742
02:24:43,946 --> 02:24:47,439
<i>These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.</i>

1743
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,859
<i>Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.</i>

1744
02:24:51,954 --> 02:24:54,958
<i>I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.</i>

1745
02:24:55,124 --> 02:24:56,296
<i>Get it out.</i>

1746
02:24:58,043 --> 02:25:03,300
<i>"Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."</i>

1747
02:25:03,465 --> 02:25:04,808
<i>- But you're a slave.
- "For murder..."</i>

1748
02:25:04,967 --> 02:25:07,459
<i>- I ain't no goddamn slave.
- "...and stagecoach robbery."</i>

1749
02:25:07,636 --> 02:25:08,916
<i>Do I sound like a fucking' slave?</i>

1750
02:25:09,221 --> 02:25:10,782
<i>- "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?</i>

1751
02:25:10,848 --> 02:25:13,647
<i>- That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.</i>

1752
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:17,643
<i>Yesterday, as a free man,</i>

1753
02:25:17,813 --> 02:25:22,353
<i>I rode into Candy land on a horse
with my German white partner,</i>

1754
02:25:22,526 --> 02:25:24,062
<i>Dr. King Schultz.</i>

1755
02:25:24,236 --> 02:25:28,992
<i>We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.</i>

1756
02:25:29,158 --> 02:25:32,071
<i>We finally found their ass
laying' low in Candy land.</i>

1757
02:25:32,244 --> 02:25:35,737
<i>We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,</i>

1758
02:25:35,914 --> 02:25:39,248
<i>my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,</i>

1759
02:25:39,418 --> 02:25:43,594
<i>then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.</i>

1760
02:25:45,591 --> 02:25:47,514
<i>But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.</i>

1761
02:25:47,676 --> 02:25:50,475
<i>And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.</i>

1762
02:25:50,637 --> 02:25:53,971
<i>But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,</i>

1763
02:25:54,141 --> 02:25:57,441
<i>and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect</i>

1764
02:25:57,603 --> 02:25:59,856
<i>is y'all riding' back in there
and getting' it.</i>

1765
02:26:00,022 --> 02:26:01,763
<i>What's the deal?</i>

1766
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:05,399
<i>You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?</i>

1767
02:26:05,569 --> 02:26:08,448
<i>No, no, no, no.
I ain't going to tell you who they are.</i>

1768
02:26:08,614 --> 02:26:12,107
<i>But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,</i>

1769
02:26:12,284 --> 02:26:16,790
<i>and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.</i>

1770
02:26:16,955 --> 02:26:18,821
<i>This is a real handbill.</i>

1771
02:26:18,999 --> 02:26:20,046
<i>Now just 'cause it's a real handbill</i>

1772
02:26:20,209 --> 02:26:22,303
<i>doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.</i>

1773
02:26:22,461 --> 02:26:28,389
<i>Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?</i>

1774
02:26:33,055 --> 02:26:35,854
<i>Did that black ride
into Candy land yesterday?</i>

1775
02:26:42,189 --> 02:26:46,160
<i>All right, I'm going to ask you again.</i>

1776
02:26:47,361 --> 02:26:49,978
<i>I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.</i>

1777
02:26:50,697 --> 02:26:52,529
<i>Is he a Candy land slave,</i>

1778
02:26:52,699 --> 02:26:56,488
<i>or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?</i>

1779
02:26:56,662 --> 02:27:00,326
<i>Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,</i>

1780
02:27:00,499 --> 02:27:03,048
<i>and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.</i>

1781
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:07,886
<i>Now this white man,
was the black his slave?</i>

1782
02:27:08,048 --> 02:27:09,550
<i>He weren't no slave.</i>

1783
02:27:09,716 --> 02:27:13,562
<i>- You fucking' sure about that?
- Damn sure.</i>

1784
02:27:17,516 --> 02:27:21,066
<i>- What happened over in Candy land?

<i>- Who shot him?
- The German.</i>

1787
02:27:25,482 --> 02:27:26,529
<i>Why'd he do that?</i>

1788
02:27:27,192 --> 02:27:30,651
<i>Nigger and the German was acting'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.</i>

1789
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:33,916
<i>- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.</i>

1790
02:27:34,992 --> 02:27:38,326
<i>Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.</i>

02:27:57,222 --> 02:27:59,600
<i>- Cut him loose.

02:27:59,766 --> 02:28:01,564
<i>You got yourself a deal, blackie.</i>

1798
02:28:01,727 --> 02:28:03,889
<i>You got yourself a deal, mate.</i>

02:28:04,062 --> 02:28:05,769
<i>Hey!</i>

<i>What them saddlebags got in 'em?</i>

02:28:22,247 --> 02:28:24,113
<i>- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't riding' no horse</i>

1807
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:26,214
<i>with no goddamn dynamite on its back.</i>

1808
02:28:26,376 --> 02:28:28,242
<i>I can understand that.</i>

1809
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:31,253
<i>Frankie, why don't you

1810
02:28:31,423 --> 02:28:33,255
<i>and stick 'em in the nigger cage.</i>

02:28:34,885 --> 02:28:37,047
<i>A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.</i>

<i>Now, don't drop the fucking' thing,

1817
02:29:00,077 --> 02:29:02,990
<i>I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.</i>

1818
02:29:03,163 --> 02:29:04,278
<i>Oh, that's good to know.</i>

1819
02:30:36,673 --> 02:30:38,380
<i>Throw me up that dynamite.</i>

<i>It's me, baby.</i>

02:36:13,385 --> 02:36:15,638
<i>Would you prepare us some coffee?</i>

1827
02:36:15,804 --> 02:36:17,932
<i>Sheba, you help her.</i>

1828
02:36:18,098 --> 02:36:19,441
<i>Come on.</i>

1829
02:36:29,651 --> 02:36:33,406
<i>Oh, y'all going to be together with Calvin
in the by-and-by, all right.</i>

1830
02:36:39,619 --> 02:36:41,747
<i>Just a bit sooner
than y'all was expecting'.</i>

1831
02:36:50,463 --> 02:36:51,999
<i>Billy Crash.</i>

1832
02:36:52,173 --> 02:36:53,846
<i>- Now, where were we?</i>

1833
02:36:54,009 --> 02:36:56,478
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

1834
02:36:56,636 --> 02:37:01,005
<i>Last time I seen you,
you had your hands on my...</i>

1835
02:37:13,611 --> 02:37:17,070
<i>D-jango!
You black son of a bitch!</i>

1836
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:18,617
<i>The D is silent, hillbilly.</i>

1837
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:21,066
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1838
02:37:23,079 --> 02:37:25,787
<i>Now, all you black folks,</i>

1839
02:37:25,957 --> 02:37:29,325
<i>I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.</i>

1840
02:37:30,295 --> 02:37:31,968
<i>Not you, Stephen.</i>

1841
02:37:32,505 --> 02:37:34,667
<i>You right where you belong.</i>

1842
02:37:37,052 --> 02:37:41,478
<i>Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?</i>

1843
02:37:41,639 --> 02:37:46,486
<i>- Do what now?
- I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."</i>

1844
02:37:48,104 --> 02:37:50,323
<i>- Bye, Miss Lara.</i>

1845
02:37:54,069 --> 02:37:55,241
<i>Y'all two run along now.</i>

1846
02:38:13,797 --> 02:38:18,257
<i>Stephen, how you like my new duds?</i>

1847
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:21,843
<i>You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my colour.</i>

1848
02:38:33,483 --> 02:38:35,406
<i>I count six shots, nigger.</i>

1849
02:38:36,861 --> 02:38:38,693
<i>I count two guns, nigger.</i>

1850
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:44,532
<i>You said in 76 years on this plantation,</i>

1851
02:38:44,702 --> 02:38:47,319
<i>you seen all manner-a shit
done to niggers.</i>

1852
02:38:47,497 --> 02:38:50,535
<i>But I notice,
you didn't mention kneecapping'.</i>

1853
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,163
<i>Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!</i>

1854
02:38:54,337 --> 02:38:56,297
<i>- Seventy-six years, Stephen.</i>

1855
02:38:56,381 --> 02:38:58,054
<i>How many niggers you think
you see come and go, huh?</i>

1856
02:38:58,216 --> 02:38:59,809
<i>Seven thousand?</i>

1857
02:38:59,968 --> 02:39:01,675
<i>Eight thousand?</i>

1858
02:39:01,845 --> 02:39:03,552
<i>Nine thousand?</i>

1859
02:39:03,721 --> 02:39:06,520
<i>Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?</i>

1860
02:39:06,683 --> 02:39:09,061
<i>Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth</i>

1861
02:39:09,227 --> 02:39:10,570
<i>was nothing' but horseshit.</i>

1862
02:39:10,728 --> 02:39:14,574
<i>But he was right about one thing:
I am that one nigger in 10,000.</i>

1863
02:39:17,402 --> 02:39:19,143
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

1864
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:22,062
<i>You motherfucker!</i>

1865
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,527
<i>Oh, sweet Jesus,

1866
02:39:26,119 --> 02:39:29,089
<i>You ain't going to get away with this,
Django!</i>

02:39:29,247 --> 02:39:31,238
<i>They going to catch your black ass.</i>

02:39:31,416 --> 02:39:33,703
<i>You going to be on the
wanted posters now, nigger.</i>

02:39:33,877 --> 02:39:36,710
<i>The bounty hunters

1870
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:41,124
<i>You can run, nigger,
but they going to find your ass!</i>

1871
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:45,215
<i>And when they do, oh, Lord,

1872
02:39:45,388 --> 02:39:48,096
<i>They ain't going to just kill you, nigger!</i>

1873
02:39:48,266 --> 02:39:50,007
<i>You done fucked up!</i>

1874

<i>This Candy land, nigger!</i>

1875
02:39:52,437 --> 02:39:55,145
<i>You can't destroy Candy land!</i>

1876
02:39:55,315 --> 02:39:58,945
<i>We been here!
There's always going to be a Candy land!</i>

1877
02:40:09,954 --> 02:40:13,504
<i>Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!</i>

1878
02:40:13,666 --> 02:40:16,283
<i>They going to find your black ass!</i>

1879
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,423
<i>Django!</i>

1880
02:40:23,593 --> 02:40:25,971
<i>You uppity son of a...</i>

1881
02:41:00,755 --> 02:41:02,291
<i>Hey, Little Trouble Maker.</i>

1882
02:41:02,966 --> 02:41:04,889
<i>Hey, Big Trouble Maker.</i>

1883
02:41:32,203 --> 02:41:36,834
<i>You know what they are going to call
you? "The fastest gun in the South."</i>

1884
02:41:44,465 --> 02:41:46,058
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

1885
02:45:14,926 --> 02:45:16,462
<i>Who was that nigger?</i>
