1
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,908
How do you want me?

2
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:47,030
Oh, that's good. Yeah, just...
Just get comfortable.

3
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,910
I'm a little nervous.

4
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,620
You're doing great.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,334
A little to the right there,
gorgeous.

6
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:02,921
- Okay. Like this?
- Oh, that a girl.

7
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,722
Yeah. Okay.

8
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,932
- You ready?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,643
- You're blushing, Dorothy.
- Don't blush, Kathy.

10
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,645
Oh, Kathy.

11
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,149
Okay, and big smile.

12
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,234
Kathy Regan.

13
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,111
I will always remember...

14
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,238
...the game against Fairfield.

15
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:29,240
That one final kick.

16
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:32,035
State champion, senior year.

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,120
Hunter McCaffrey.

18
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:36,039
I will always remember...

19
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:39,042
...all the great times
with the dirty dozen...

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,419
...and macking all
the honeys.

21
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,422
Cindy K. Tina B.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,717
Michelle H. Goddamn!

23
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:48,427
Just too many to remember.

24
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:53,223
I'll always remember
lacrosse champions.

25
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:56,435
All the glory days with
the boys.

26
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:58,020
I will always remember...

27
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,522
...the math-club madmen...

28
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:03,650
...making the perfect
fake ID's...

29
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:06,445
...which lasted six seconds

30
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:10,240
- Troy Cochran.
- Troy Cochran.

31
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,950
- Troy gives good head.
- Fuck you!

32
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:13,827
I'll always remember...

33
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,621
Seniors!

34
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,040
...the senior prank.

35
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:26,819
Matthew Kidman.
I will always remember...

36
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,453
YEARBOOK MEMORIES FORM
SENIORS ONLY!

37
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:38,039
MATTHEW KIDMAN
I'll always remember...

38
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,552
Yeah, well, I told you
I wanted to try out.

39
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,516
We'd like to honor
a student...

40
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,936
...who has shown outstanding
leadership.

41
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,814
We have no doubt that
he will be one...

42
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,649
...of the great politicians
in Washington.

43
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,151
Georgetown
UNIVERSITY

44
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,946
The award for
the brightest leader...

45
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,032
...of tomorrow,
Matthew Kidman.

46
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,120
- I'm in! I'm in!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

47
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,040
Georgetown!
They gave it to you!

48
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,831
Hey, Jenny.

49
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,127
Yeah, dude, come on.

50
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:17,224
SENIOR PROM
DO YOU HAVE THE FEVER?

51
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,437
- Do you have the fever?
- No.

52
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,148
Why? Do you?

53
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,817
I don't know. Maybe.

54
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,319
How about you?

55
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:31,655
I just gotta fuck something.

56
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:34,450
I said, everybody say, "Ho!"

57
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,623
You know what I say?

58
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:45,753
I say, this prom is gonna be
off the hook! Do you feel me?

59
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,721
Security's gonna be tight.
Get wasted before you show up.

60
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,849
That's enough!

61
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,518
That's enough. I can wait.

62
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,355
I can wait, people.

63
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:07,442
Now, it is your
student-council president...

64
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:10,028
...who has a few announcements
to make.

65
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,531
Thanks, Mr. Salinger.

66
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,747
All right, how you doing?

67
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,627
Okay, let's start off
with Operation Get Samnang.

68
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,837
Sam Young, baby!

69
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,256
Yeah.

70
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,137
Well, we did it.
We raised the 25,000 dollars...

71
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:38,557
...so now we can bring the genius
Samnang out of Cambodia...

72
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,643
...and bring him here
to study at Westport.

73
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:47,149
Speaking of which,
Samnang sent us a new tape.

74
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,151
Show that shit!

75
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,738
Show it!

76
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,950
Hi, everyone, it's Samnang.

77
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,745
Sam Young!

78
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:03,749
I am very excited to be
coming soon. Are you excited?

79
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:11,841
I told my class that I am coming
to America. They were sad.

80
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,426
I am so happy.

81
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,138
- I wanna bang you!
- Go, Cougars!

82
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,947
How do they just skip class
every day and go to the beach?

83
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:36,325
Because they just don't care.

84
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,254
Let's go with them.

85
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:53,050
- Seriously, let's just do it.
- Why?

86
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,928
Because, I mean,
we never do anything.

87
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:59,140
I mean, we're graduating. We
should be going nuts right now.

88
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,641
Let's just do something.

89
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,852
I am doing something,
I'm going to class.

90
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,229
Klitz, you already got
into Yale.

91
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:06,939
I mean, it doesn't
matter anymore.

92
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:08,649
Yeah, Klitz, you pussy.

93
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,652
- Well, why don't you go?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.

94
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,738
Beach is for fags, man.

95
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:16,449
- The beach is for fags?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,536
You know what?
You guys are fags.

97
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,542
Everyone to the beach!

98
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,922
Let's go! Lock them
and load them, dude.

99
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,633
WESTPORT HIGH SCHOOL

100
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:36,929
Fuck it.

101
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,449
SCHOOL
SECURITY

102
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,452
Personal power means
the ability to act...

103
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:03,247
...the ability to take action.

104
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,332
STOP
CHECK-OUT WITH SECURITY

105
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,127
Three steps to personal power
are necessary for results.

106
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,962
Here's number one step
to personal power.

107
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,631
It's called energy.
Energy.

108
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,634
When you wake up feeling
really lethargic, really lousy...

109
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,054
...do you usually
jump up and go-?

110
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,523
Oh, shit.

111
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:51,463
Hey! Pull it over!

112
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,133
Pull it over! Pull-

113
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,625
Oh, well, you're home early.

114
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,127
I postponed yearbook.
I gotta work on my speech

115
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,630
- Hi, Mr. Peterson.
- Mr. President.

116
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,840
- Mrs. Peterson.
- Congratulations.

117
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,927
- Oh, thank you.
- Congratulations. Georgetown.

118
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,931
Wow, you must be flying.

119
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,057
It's cool.

120
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,558
What's the speech
you're working on?

121
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,561
Oh, it's for this scholarship
I need to get so I can...

122
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,730
...actually go to Georgetown.

123
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,524
It's pretty expensive.

124
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:52,734
What kind of scholarship
is it?

125
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:53,443
What do they give it for?

126
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:58,240
It's for the student who best
demonstrates moral fiber.

127
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,325
Oh, moral fiber. Well, that's-

128
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,328
- Oh, I'm sure you'll get it.
- Thanks. I mean, I hope so.

129
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,955
I mean, there's some stiff
Competition...

130
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,541
...and they only pick
one of us...

131
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:11,128
...so I'll just have to blow
them away with my speech.

132
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:18,051
Okay, so why do I deserve
this scholarship?

133
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,262
1. MAKE EYE CONTACT
2. BE CHARMING 3. JFK!

134
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,057
...can do for you
but what you can do..."

135
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,727
John F. Kennedy once said,
"Ask not what

136
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,055
Look, I don't know
who she is.

137
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,351
I'm just saying that
this girl was unbelievable.

138
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,936
I mean, she was
like this angel.

139
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,732
I mean, she had this smile.
I mean, you should have seen it.

140
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,152
- So did you bang her?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I banged her.

141
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,029
That's what a man does,
okay?

142
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,240
- Yeah. Okay, Eli.
- Good.

143
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,454
Oh, my God. She's so hot.

144
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,540
- What channel, dude?
- No, the girl next door.

145
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,334
I can see her through
my window.

146
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,835
How's the rack?

147
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,339
- God, who is this girl?
- How's the rack?

148
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,257
- Hold on. Relax.
- No. You relax.

149
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,426
Be a man and go over there.

150
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,053
Okay. Say what?

151
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,848
I don't know. Get off your
ass and do something. Fuck!

152
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,647
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What?

153
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,649
Hey, dude, seriously,
I told you...

154
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,068
...it really freaks me out
when you watch that while...

155
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,444
...you're talking to me.

156
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,947
Just learn to like it.

157
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,955
Oh, my God.

158
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,457
What? Matt, what?

159
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,959
Matt!

160
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,259
Dude, what the fuck?

161
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:40,031
Shit!

162
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,731
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.

163
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,152
- Dan.
- What's going on?

164
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:18,362
Matthew!

165
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:21,656
Matthew, come down here.

166
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,754
- What are you doing up there?
- Nothing.

167
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,964
Come down here.

168
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,765
This is Danielle.

169
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:50,853
You know Mrs. Clark from
next door. Danielle's her niece.

170
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,940
Danielle just told us
something very interesting.

171
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:58,569
Mrs. Clark is in Africa for
two weeks with her church group.

172
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,071
Did you know that?

173
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,950
Anyway, Danielle just came
in from Los Angeles...

174
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,953
...and she's housesitting
while her aunt's away.

175
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,663
Why don't you show
her around.

176
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,134
Such a long road, you know.

177
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:32,855
- What are we doing?
- Did you like what you saw?

178
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:35,232
What are you talking about?

179
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:40,571
Okay, I saw you for,
like, an instant.

180
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,239
- An instant?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:43,949
It was no big deal.

182
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,330
No, no, it was- It was a
big deal, but it's just that...

183
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,333
I didn't...

184
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,962
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,756
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:02,051
So, what are we gonna
do about this?

187
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,971
I mean, I said I was sorry.

188
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,644
What?

189
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,146
You saw me...

190
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,859
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna
strip right here?

191
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,947
Are you serious?

192
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,869
No.

193
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:31,664
No. No, never gonna happen.

194
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,670
The whole package.

195
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,463
No, come on,
this is good enough.

196
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,343
Jesus! Come on,
will you relax?

197
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:47,347
Frigging psycho.

198
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:57,149
There. You happy now?

199
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:03,656
Yep.

200
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,160
Hey! Wait!

201
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,871
No!

202
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,834
Jesus. Sorry.

203
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,636
You're an asshole.
It's not funny.

204
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,847
It's a little funny.

205
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,269
Come on.

206
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,771
Let me in. Let me in.

207
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,160
It's not funny.

208
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,037
It's a little funny.

209
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,343
So, what else do you do
besides torture people?

210
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,764
- Seriously, what's your story?
- I don't know.

211
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,558
I kind of just quit my job.

212
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,438
I want to start over.
Maybe go to college.

213
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,573
So are you here
alone or what?

214
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,867
- What?
- Just ask.

215
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:36,667
Do you have a boyfriend?

216
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,045
No.

217
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,967
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I have a girlfriend?

218
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,137
- No.
- Okay.

219
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,474
So you're about to graduate.
You must be going nuts right now.

220
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,645
Yeah.

221
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:59,066
I mean, it's just been
off the hook, you know?

222
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:00,943
- Really?
- Yeah.

223
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:04,446
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

224
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,157
Oh, I mean, it's hard to tell,
you know, because we-

225
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:09,952
I've just done so much
nuts stuff. I mean...

226
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:13,372
It's just off the hook,
off the walls. I mean...

227
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,166
You haven't done anything,
have you?

228
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:18,669
No.

229
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:22,339
It's kind of- It's kind
of been my problem lately.

230
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,967
Come on, there's gotta
be something.

231
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,261
What about your girlfriend?

232
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,473
Okay.

233
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,643
We can figure this out.
You just need a girl.

234
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,063
What kind of girl?

235
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,275
Definitely someone cute.

236
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,444
Definitely.

237
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,947
Someone who can make
him laugh.

238
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,660
But he also needs someone
who's gonna push him.

239
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:54,039
Someone who's gonna
make him do...

240
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,041
...things he never thought
he could do.

241
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,753
Like stripping
in the middle of the street?

242
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,446
- Well, thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

243
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,164
Well...

244
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:37,958
...good night.

245
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,543
Good night.

246
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:45,758
"Good night"?
What are you, gay?

247
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:50,971
- I would have nailed her.
- Ok, you wouldn't have nailed her.

248
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,474
- Whatever, dude.
- And, you know, secondly...

249
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,352
...you know,
the vibe was not right.

250
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,856
The vibe wasn't right? She comes
to your house and makes you strip.

251
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,567
What does she have to do,
sit on your face?

252
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:05,153
Come on, bitch.

253
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:09,074
- Damn. Should have kissed her.
- Are you okay? Dude?

254
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,953
All right, you all have
this graph, correct?

255
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,539
Good. Let's move along then.

256
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,541
Now, it's a very simple
equation here.

257
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,960
Somebody give me
the answer to this.

258
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,257
All right, if no one knows
the answer to this...

259
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:29,678
Looking at this calculation,
what does this make us think of?

260
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,643
Questions on this?

261
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:07,050
Good news, ladies and gentlemen.
Pop-quiz time.

262
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:54,348
That's Samnang Sok.
He's this complete genius.

263
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,558
So we raised all
this money for him...

264
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,769
...to come here and
study at our school.

265
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,148
- Who's "we"?
- Well, I mean, I did...

266
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:04,859
...but he could be
the next Einstein, you know.

267
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,570
You know,
he could cure cancer.

268
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:17,747
Let's go.

269
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,254
So, what do you wanna do?

270
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:28,758
What?

271
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,179
I'm not stripping again.

272
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,765
Come on.

273
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:51,866
Danielle!

274
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:54,869
Come on.
Where are you going?

275
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,760
Hey, come on,
let's get out of here.

276
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,679
How do you know
no one's home?

277
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:15,473
- I don't.
- Come on.

278
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,183
Seriously, this is nuts.

279
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:30,155
Oh, boxers.

280
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:35,160
I always wear boxers. You just
caught me on a weird day.

281
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,550
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

282
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,055
This is right up there.

283
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:10,071
Oh, my God.

284
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:14,659
- That's Mr. Salinger.
- Who?

285
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,869
That's my principal.
Seriously, let's go.

286
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,165
- It's not funny.
- It's a little funny.

287
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,670
Hey.

288
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:30,049
Just go with it.

289
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:53,365
Dude, I'm kind of uncomfortable
watching this with you.

290
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:56,076
Dude, learn to like it.

291
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:03,083
I'm all wet. Can I come in?

292
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:13,052
Hey, guys. This is Danielle.

293
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:16,472
You must be Eli. And Klitz.
Right.

294
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,557
Hey, come on,
we're all going out.

295
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:23,479
- Can I use your bathroom first?
- Oh, it's over here to the left.

296
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,280
- Dude.
- I know.

297
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,282
Dude.

298
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,784
I know.

299
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,468
- Dude, what are we doing here?
- Yeah, I know.

300
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:55,053
Guys, seriously, it's gonna get...

301
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,971
...broken up, like,
any second now, right?

302
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,183
Guys?

303
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,865
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Sorry.

304
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,171
Go.

305
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,883
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Let's just chill.

306
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,760
Hi, guys.

307
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:39,849
- Is this your party?
- No, it's a friend of mine's.

308
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,476
- I'm Hunter.
- Danielle.

309
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:44,478
This is Matthew.

310
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,981
- Hey, Matt, what's up?
- What's up?

311
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,151
Can I get you something
to drink?

312
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:51,069
- Yeah.
- Hey, man, what's up?

313
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,071
- Can you come here for a second?
- Yeah.

314
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,365
No, it's cool. They're pals.

315
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:57,576
What's up?

316
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:00,370
Yeah, man, this party's
getting kind of full, bro.

317
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,957
- Yeah, so?
- So you're gonna have to take off.

318
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:11,173
Okay, but I'm with her.
I mean-

320
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:13,383
Oh, it's cool, dude.
She's taken care of.

321
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,389
There's the door.

322
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:45,666
Yo, man!

323
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,252
When's Samsung getting here?

324
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,089
- Samnang.
- Yeah!

325
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,174
I love him.

326
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:57,553
Dude, I'm gonna do that little
guy when he gets here.

327
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:59,555
Hard.

328
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,184
Cool, dude.
I'm sure he'll like that.

329
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,561
Sam Young!

330
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,067
Excuse me.

331
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,753
- Dude.
- I know.

332
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:11,588
- What?
- You're coming with me. Right now.

333
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:15,467
Everybody out. Let's move.

334
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:24,392
I said out, minions! Move! Move!
Faster, you little maggots.

335
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,856
- So how's everything going?
- Fine.

336
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:32,692
Is everything, you know,
okay at home?

337
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,653
All right, what?

338
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:36,989
Perhaps you should have a seat.

339
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:39,658
Perhaps you should bite me.

340
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,869
Perhaps.

341
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:46,374
Matthew...

342
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:49,585
...we live in a crazy,
mixed-up world.

343
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:53,172
Crazy, but, oh, so beautiful.

344
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:13,359
Excellent, grasshopper.

345
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,155
And now for the final task
of your training.

346
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,371
You're gonna need a harder piece
of wood than that, cowboy.

347
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,583
- That's not her.
- Yeah, it is.

348
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,387
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

349
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:52,774
Matt! Matt! Dude, you're
missing the best part.

350
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,988
Fuck! Fuck!

351
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:00,783
Settle down, tiger.
I know. I know.

352
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:03,077
It's not funny.
Seriously, get away from me.

353
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,663
- Dude, don't mess this up.
- Mess what up?

354
00:32:05,872 --> 00:32:07,457
Matt, she's a porn star,
okay?

355
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,460
Take her to a motel room
and bang her like a beast.

356
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,462
Eli, I like this girl.

357
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,465
And you can still like her
with your penis inside her.

358
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,259
I'm telling you,
you're gonna regret this.

359
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,678
What would JFK do?
You know he'd tap that ass.

360
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,889
Eli, I'm never gonna
see her again.

361
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:24,265
Oh, you know what? Fine.

362
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,892
- Fine.
- Fine!

363
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:27,894
Goddamn it, Matt.

364
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:31,064
I swear to God, if you don't
fuck her, I'll kill myself!

365
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:37,195
Matt, please. Please, Matt.
Fuck her for me. For me!

366
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,668
- Oh, Marci, you're so funny.
- Oh, thanks.

367
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,257
- I just saw you naked.
- What?

368
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,968
Don't worry, honey,
you were only 2 days old.

369
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,388
- Let's see what else we have.
- Why are you here?

370
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:03,972
I just came here to say hi.

371
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:06,558
Hi.

372
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,268
Look at this one of him.

373
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,697
Hey, buddy.

374
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,158
- That one's the best.
- It is. He looks so adorable.

375
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,494
He looks really-
Oh, that's such a good one.

376
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:27,372
- Here you go, Danielle.
- Oh, thanks.

377
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:37,590
- Thattagirl.
- This is a cute one.

378
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,592
Oh, who's your daddy?

379
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:43,263
So you were going to school
in Los Angeles?

380
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,266
For a while. But then I started
working on other things.

381
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,685
Oh, what kind of things?

382
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,188
Let me show you.

383
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,783
Jesus!

384
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,790
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I don't know, I...

385
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,084
I don't feel so good.

386
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:19,258
What can I do to make you
feel better?

387
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,067
I think I'm feeling
a lot better now.

388
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,278
- We can go out another night.
- No, we're going out tonight.

389
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:42,199
- You sure?
- Positive.

390
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,997
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Yes, you can.

391
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:51,958
But tonight, be the man.

392
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:55,670
First off, act like
you don't even like her.

393
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,465
- Hey.
- Hey.

394
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:03,261
Second, get her drunk.
Really drunk, okay?

395
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:06,098
That way the true porn star
will come out in her.

396
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:12,896
Here, I... I got us something.

397
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,984
Bourbon?

398
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:21,488
- Are you trying to get me drunk?
- No, what?

399
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:25,576
- I thought you like to rock.
- "Like to rock?"

400
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,663
Last and most important...

401
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:31,165
...always be touching her,
Matt.

402
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:33,960
That tells her you came here
to get down tonight.

403
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,799
What are we doing?

404
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,885
Just chilling.

405
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:48,891
Hey, look.

406
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:50,685
MOTEL
Glen Capri

407
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:59,193
Maybe we should get a room.

408
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:01,696
Okay.

409
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:10,664
Here it is.

410
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:32,561
This is- This is really nice.

411
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:34,897
TV.

412
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,774
Air conditioner.

413
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,902
Got a little lamp there.

414
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,863
Is that Monet?

415
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:48,578
What?

416
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,290
- What are you thinking?
- What are you thinking?

417
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,586
I don't know.

418
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,473
Do you wanna fuck me?

419
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:18,191
Come here.

420
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:37,086
How do you want me?

421
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:40,297
Why are you doing this?

422
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,175
What?

423
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,469
This.

424
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,765
Isn't this what you want?

425
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:53,185
To fuck a porn star
in a cheap motel room?

426
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,776
So this is what
you think of me.

427
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:05,197
- Danielle, wait. I'm sorry.
- Let me guess.

428
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:06,992
You saw a tape,
and you thought:

429
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,494
"What the hell?
She does it for a living, right?"

430
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:12,998
- Eli told me to do it.
- Oh, now that's a mature response.

431
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,376
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because I didn't want to, okay?

432
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:22,174
Because I loved the way
you looked at me.

433
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:26,970
God, do you have
any idea how-?

434
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,890
Forget it.

435
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,602
- Hold on.
- Fuck you.

436
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,869
ONLY 9 DAYS LEFT!
SAMNANG

437
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,667
You're done.

438
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,175
WHY DO I DESERVE
THIS SCHOLARSHIP?

439
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:26,572
Look, I'm an idiot, okay?
I saw the tape, and I freaked out.

440
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,576
Hi. I'm coming in.
Can I come in?

441
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,996
Look, I've just
been crazy lately.

442
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,583
I mean, the whole scholarship
thing, you know, I mean...

443
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,377
It's killing me, you know?

444
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,380
But I'm not even
thinking about that.

445
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:45,968
The only thing I care about
is you, you know?

446
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,804
All I want is just for us
to go back to normal again.

447
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,099
It's a real nice place
you got here, D.

448
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,102
I...

449
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,866
Can we...

450
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,370
...talk about this later?
- Yeah.

451
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,291
Sure.

452
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,476
I like that.

453
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:38,188
- What?
- What you said in there.

454
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:39,981
Thanks.

455
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,780
Kelly.

456
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,407
Matthew.

457
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:56,707
- So you're friends with D, huh?
- Yeah.

458
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:01,003
Well, we're-
We're kind of going out.

459
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:08,386
Look at you.
You are a forest fire.

460
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,805
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

461
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:12,681
You coming with us?

462
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,476
- Where are you going?
- Can't. He's got school tomorrow.

463
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,978
No, no, I'm cool.
Like, where are we going?

464
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,009
Hey, there.
What can I get for you?

465
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:50,095
We'll get two Scotch
rocks and...

466
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:53,974
Make it three. Actually, I'll
have a Long Island iced tea.

467
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,104
So, what grade are
you in, man?

468
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:01,982
I'm a senior.
But I'm about to graduate.

469
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,401
Congratulations. What's next?

470
00:42:04,776 --> 00:42:06,194
Georgetown, hopefully.

471
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:09,281
- Matthew wants to be president.
- Really?

472
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:11,074
- That's great, man.
- Yeah.

473
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,285
How do you
two know each other?

474
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,289
How do we know each other?

475
00:42:16,873 --> 00:42:20,710
- We used to work together.
- So you're, like, an actor?

476
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:24,297
No. Strictly producer.

477
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:28,384
But D and I also used to go out.
Excuse me a sec.

478
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:31,596
So you guys went out?

479
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,391
Thank you.

480
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,602
Look, can we just talk?

481
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:39,687
Talk.

482
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:43,274
I don't know if this
is really the place.

483
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:48,071
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- No, nothing. It's fine, you know.

484
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,281
It's one of my favorites.

485
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,498
Hey, you got one for me?

486
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:08,175
- What are you doing?
- What?

487
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:09,885
Here.

488
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:13,680
And you turn it like so:

489
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,483
- Hey, where are you going?
- The bathroom. Is that okay?

490
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:26,485
Yeah.

491
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,199
So you're really into her,
huh?

492
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:36,496
Hey. I get it, man, believe me.
She's gorgeous.

493
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,290
I just think you'd want
someone more your age.

494
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:44,295
- She's my age.
- Yeah, I meant experience-wise.

495
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:46,172
No offense.

496
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:50,009
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna take care of you.

497
00:43:51,886 --> 00:43:54,305
Oh, my God.
That's Mr. Peterson.

498
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:55,647
That's my dad's
friend.

499
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:57,809
He comes over all
the time with his wife.

500
00:43:58,393 --> 00:43:59,602
Really?

501
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:00,812
Hey, Peterson.

502
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,190
What? Dude,
what are you doing, man?

503
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:06,901
Yeah, you. Get over here.

504
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:11,406
Goddamn, Peterson, haven't
seen your black ass in ages.

505
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:14,701
- Do I know you?
- What the fuck's your problem?

506
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:18,414
- I...
- Just fucking with you, man.

507
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,084
Hey, you know my friend
Matty here, right?

508
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:31,385
- Matthew. Hi.
- Peterson, this is Matty's first time.

509
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:34,597
Why don't you buy him a dance.

510
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:43,397
So did you hear about
that scholarship yet?

511
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,485
No, big dinner's on Thursday.

512
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:55,785
So, what's it for again?

513
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,079
The scholarship.

514
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:01,291
It's for...

515
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,585
...moral fiber.

516
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,299
Me? A Teenage Daddy?

517
00:45:09,508 --> 00:45:12,010
Who is this guy?
Is he a porn producer?

518
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:14,179
Klitz, shut up.
Now, the strippers.

519
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:17,682
When you get a lap dance, were they
cool with you grabbing their ass?

520
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,976
Dude. I'm trying to talk
about Danielle here.

521
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:22,813
Fine. Selfish bitch.

522
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:26,900
For teenagers, sexual intercourse
can be dangerous.

523
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:28,693
Jesus, what hack made this?

524
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:31,780
I could make a better sex-ed
film with my mom.

525
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:33,782
Why don't they update this thing?

526
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:36,284
Special events,
such as your senior prom...

527
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:39,580
...place added pressure on young
teens to lose their virginity...

528
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:42,291
...and also engage
in unprotected sex.

529
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,293
9 months later...

530
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,714
- Hello?
- Hey, Bob.

531
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,090
We're all going
to the creek tonight.

532
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:52,093
It's gonna be a gas.
You're coming, right?

533
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:54,303
I can't, guys.

534
00:45:55,304 --> 00:45:58,391
I have a baby now.

535
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:02,103
Because of prom.

536
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:04,105
Dude.

537
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:09,110
- What?
- Yeah, right.

538
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,698
- You guys ever thought about it?
- No.

539
00:46:15,408 --> 00:46:17,285
I just think you guys
would be really hot.

540
00:46:17,577 --> 00:46:19,287
- You girls are 18, right?
- I am.

541
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:21,498
- I will be in a month.
- Really?

542
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,084
- You ever been photographed?
- A couple of times.

543
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,712
Hey, you guys know Matty?

544
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:29,798
I hung with him last night.
Guy's the tits.

545
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:32,593
Here's my man.

546
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:36,180
- How you doing?
- What's up, fellas?

547
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,977
Matty, you didn't tell me
you got some serious burners...

548
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:43,187
...at your school here.

549
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:45,189
Oh, shut up.
You did not say that

550
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,192
Hey, you know who's got
the killer bud?

551
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:52,696
This fucker right here.

552
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:56,492
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, come on.

553
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,494
Yeah, you have some?

554
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:00,204
Yeah, come on.

555
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:03,208
- Holy shit.
- You guys should party.

556
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,502
- Can I-?
- All right, we're out.

557
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:07,879
- Hold on a sec.
- Where are you guys going?

558
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:10,215
- We got things to do.
- Do you wanna hang out?

559
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:14,177
- Hop in, fellas.
- Aren't you gonna photograph us?

560
00:47:17,097 --> 00:47:18,890
Always leave
them wanting more.

561
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,892
Punch it!

562
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:39,911
Man, there is
some talent here.

563
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:43,499
You get those girls together
with those ass-bags there...

564
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,001
...shoot them humping at,
like, a football...

565
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:48,504
...game or at a prom,
that video would sell.

566
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:50,715
Fuck, I'm good!

567
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:55,094
How do I get these ideas?
It's like a gift, you know?

568
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:56,804
It's like I can't control it.

569
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:04,395
So, what are we doing, man?

570
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:10,609
You know, you really didn't
have to come with me.

571
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:14,488
It's cool.
I like running errands.

572
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:19,118
So you raised 25 G's just
to bring this Chinese guy over.

573
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:21,495
No, he's Cambodian.

574
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:25,292
Okay, so that's 25,000
total deposited...

575
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,086
...into the Operation
Get Samnang account.

576
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:30,797
Hey, so you raised
all the money you needed.

577
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:32,591
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

578
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:35,010
So is this Samnang
really as smart as they say?

579
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:38,013
Well, he did teach himself
calculus without even using...

580
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:39,598
...his textbooks, so...

581
00:48:39,806 --> 00:48:43,685
Those crazy little fuckers, man.
They sure know their numbers.

582
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:49,900
Jeannie, this is my-
This is my student advisor.

583
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:52,868
Oh, you're Mr. Salinger?

584
00:48:52,903 --> 00:48:56,281
Just here to make sure
everything's up to par. Wow.

585
00:48:56,615 --> 00:48:59,493
- What?
- I love those earrings.

586
00:48:59,701 --> 00:48:59,993
Oh, thank you.

587
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:02,700
They really complement your coloring.

588
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:04,581
Thanks. I just got back
from Cabo.

589
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:06,292
- Did you?
- Yeah.

590
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,295
Okay, well, we gotta go.
Thanks, Jeannie.

591
00:49:10,588 --> 00:49:12,715
Man, what were you doing-?

592
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,009
There's a bar,
you sit with the people.

593
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,010
You have been there.

594
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,304
- See? I knew it.
- No, no.

595
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:21,599
- This guy is unbelievable.
- You.

596
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:33,611
- Where you guys going?
- Vegas, baby.

597
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:38,783
We got the convention. Gotta press
the flesh, meet the fans.

598
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:41,911
So that's it?
You're just going back?

599
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,080
I don't belong here.

600
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:47,918
What do you-? What do you mean?
What about starting over?

601
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:49,920
This is what I am.

602
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:56,301
All right, D, let's roll.

603
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:17,781
- Dude, it's not your fault.
- No, it is my fault.

604
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:21,410
If I hadn't been such a dick and
taken her to that motel room...

605
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,996
Yeah, it was a little forward,
don't you think?

606
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,582
- Dude.
- What?

607
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:29,502
Matt, the point is,
she made her decision.

608
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:32,422
There's nothing
you can do about it now.

609
00:50:37,594 --> 00:50:39,095
Yeah, there is.

610
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:47,812
- Hey, Dad?
- Don't wait up.

611
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:50,315
- I'll be late tonight.
- I'll watch it tomorrow.

612
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:53,693
- Shark Week is all week long.
- God, I just wanna bang hot chicks.

613
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:12,004
LAS VEGAS WELCOMES
THE ADULT FILM CONVENTION

614
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:44,787
- Move it.
- Sorry.

615
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:46,997
Big smile.

616
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,086
- Sasha!
- Sasha!

617
00:51:57,718 --> 00:52:00,721
- Yo, man, no press.
- No, no. No, I'm not press.

618
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:02,597
I'm still in high school,
okay?

619
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:04,599
This is for my high school
video yearbook.

620
00:52:04,808 --> 00:52:06,101
I swear to God.

621
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:11,106
That's right, bitch.

622
00:52:17,487 --> 00:52:18,989
Jesus, is that her?

623
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:20,490
Athena.

624
00:52:41,095 --> 00:52:43,014
Give me a second, guys.

625
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:44,891
- Athena!
- Athena!

626
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:47,393
- Danielle.
- Athena! Athena!

627
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,687
- Danielle.
- Come on! Athena, right here!

628
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:53,316
- Work it, Athena.
- You are so hot, Athena.

629
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:00,406
- Look, I'm sorry. I had to come.
- Asshole, I'm next.

630
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:04,118
- I feel like this is all my fault.
- Who is this guy?

631
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:08,915
- Will you at least look at me?
- Bend over.

632
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:11,626
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me, okay?

633
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:13,712
- Me too!
- Oh, Danielle.

634
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:15,798
He's so sweet.

635
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:20,803
Danielle.

636
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:23,514
Nice job, dickwad.

637
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:26,392
- Danielle.
- Hey, man, get me out of this thing.

638
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,227
- Take me with you, dude.
- Danielle.

639
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,021
Just leave me alone, please.

640
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:33,399
Danielle.

641
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,320
- Danielle, Danielle.
- Hugo, hi.

642
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:40,989
Look at you.
You look fantastic.

643
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:46,412
Just starting out,
and everyone knows your name.

644
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,122
No, they don't.

645
00:53:48,288 --> 00:53:50,708
- So how's Kelly treating you?
- Okay.

646
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,918
Just okay?

647
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:55,296
Danielle, what do we know?

648
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:59,926
What do we know? We know
that you should be with me.

649
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:04,097
At the top.
Where the air is crisp.

650
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,307
- Nice tan.
- Kelly.

651
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:09,394
- What do we say?
- Fuck you.

652
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:12,689
Always with the big words.

653
00:54:12,897 --> 00:54:16,609
Danielle,
where the air is crisp.

654
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:21,614
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. He's just being Hugo.

655
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:24,909
Matty. What are you doing here?

656
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,206
Look, Kelly, no offense, but I
really don't think Danielle...

657
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:31,791
...wants to be here right now.

658
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:39,925
Matthew, please just go home,
okay?

659
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:43,721
Hey, D.

660
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:48,726
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

661
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:54,523
What's up?

662
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:57,526
It's not cute anymore.

663
00:54:57,693 --> 00:54:59,904
- What?
- Stop filling her head with that-

664
00:55:00,112 --> 00:55:03,616
- Do not piss me off.
- Hey, I thought we were friends.

665
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:07,203
Friends don't fuck
with each other's business.

666
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,289
And that's what this is,
my fucking business.

667
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:14,794
What?

668
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,090
What are you gonna do?

669
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:26,390
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Stay the fuck away from her.

670
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,021
Matt, seriously, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

671
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,691
What about your thing tomorrow?
Okay, the scholarship dinner?

672
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:40,028
Sorry, I gotta do this.

673
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:49,121
Oh, by the way, if things get
bad, just bolt, okay?

674
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,289
What? What do you mean,
"if things get bad"?

675
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:52,791
Just bolt.

676
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:54,418
Wait, what's he
talking about?

677
00:55:58,715 --> 00:56:01,008
You wanna get me a drink?
No, I'm just kidding.

678
00:56:13,312 --> 00:56:14,605
Hi.

679
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,696
Dude...

680
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:23,531
...am I ugly?

681
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:28,327
What? No. No, man,
you're fine. Just relax.

682
00:56:28,494 --> 00:56:30,329
No, I'm ugly. I know it.

683
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:36,127
- So, what do you guys do?
- I get freaky.

684
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:41,425
- We're directors.
- Really?

685
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:44,720
Would you guys ever wanna
use me in one of your movies?

686
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,723
Hell, yeah, we'll use you.

687
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:51,894
Baby, I'll do things to you
I wouldn't do to a farm animal.

688
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:55,898
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Honey. These guys are directors.

689
00:56:56,106 --> 00:56:58,817
- And they wanna use me.
- Use you?

690
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:01,820
Guys, this is my boyfriend,
Mule.

691
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:06,325
Hi, Mule.

692
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:11,914
Let's do it.

693
00:57:12,998 --> 00:57:16,293
Man, you gotta use my girl, bro.
She's so good.

694
00:57:16,502 --> 00:57:18,212
I am. I really am.

695
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:22,008
- You wanna give her a throw?
- Yeah, try me out.

696
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:25,011
No, you know, no, I'm okay,
though, thank you.

697
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:27,806
Well, come on.
At least feel her tits.

698
00:57:28,932 --> 00:57:31,226
I'm okay. I can't.
Thank you, though.

699
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:34,813
Fuck it. I'll feel one.

700
00:57:45,907 --> 00:57:47,409
We're all set for tomorrow.

701
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:51,413
Athena will be there,
ready to shoot. Right, babe?

702
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:56,710
Not bad, huh?
Suckers cost me 6 grand.

703
00:57:56,918 --> 00:58:00,422
Yo, Mule, what the hell
are you doing?

704
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:05,594
Steel, check it out, man.
These guys are directors.

705
00:58:05,928 --> 00:58:07,221
Man, these punks ain't
directors.

706
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:10,224
They're in high school,
you idiot.

707
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:14,395
Okay, here's the thing-

708
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:24,405
Oh, shit!

709
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:29,118
- Come on, Klitz, come on.
- Get off.

710
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:40,921
Matty, time to go, time to go.
Time to go.

711
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,216
- What happened?
- It got bad. Bolt. Bolt!

712
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,719
- Dude, wait up.
- Fuck you, dude!

713
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,311
Excuse me.

714
00:58:54,394 --> 00:58:57,606
I just wanna let you know,
I know who you really are.

715
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:02,903
And you're better than this.

716
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:41,901
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM...

717
00:59:43,027 --> 00:59:45,029
Yeah?

718
00:59:52,328 --> 00:59:53,704
Need a ride to school?

719
00:59:58,126 --> 01:00:01,796
It's all you now. I mean,
now you can do whatever you want.

720
01:00:03,005 --> 01:00:04,800
Why do you believe
in me so much?

721
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:07,720
I don't know. Maybe I'm stupid.

722
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:16,228
- Good luck tonight.
- Thanks.

723
01:00:17,229 --> 01:00:19,606
- Bye.
- Bye.

724
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:36,999
Will you go to prom with me?

725
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:41,128
What?

726
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,803
I would love to.

727
01:00:52,223 --> 01:00:55,518
Now for the scientific
explanation. Anybody?

728
01:00:55,727 --> 01:00:57,520
JOHN F. KENNEDY once said:
ASK NOT...

729
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:02,108
That's your speech?

730
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:04,611
Yeah.

731
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:07,197
You ready for tonight?

732
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,617
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're gonna be great.

733
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:12,911
I have to be.

734
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:27,134
That bitch can't just
run away because...

735
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:29,011
...she don't wanna fuck
on film anymore.

736
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,930
May I help you?

737
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:35,309
- Get up.
- Okay, okay.

738
01:01:43,818 --> 01:01:46,028
Stay in school.

739
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:52,535
Look, I have the most important
dinner of my life tonight...

740
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,203
...so wherever we're going,
you know...

741
01:01:54,328 --> 01:01:56,205
...we just have to be
home by 6.

742
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:58,624
Just so you know.

743
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:02,837
Here he comes.

744
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,425
- It's a cool ride, huh?
- Yeah, if you're a fag.

745
01:02:07,634 --> 01:02:10,721
- Jesus!
- It's cool, it's cool.

746
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:12,723
Get in.

747
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,738
- Where are we going?
- I thought you were cool, man.

748
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:30,031
I tried to be your friend,
and what do you do?

749
01:02:30,198 --> 01:02:31,908
- You fuck me.
- I didn't fuck you.

750
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:34,619
She didn't show up on set
because of what you said.

751
01:02:34,828 --> 01:02:36,329
Now I'm out 30 grand.

752
01:02:37,706 --> 01:02:41,626
- Guess who's paying me back.
- What? I don't have 30 grand.

753
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:44,629
- Get your folks to help.
- They don't have that kind of money.

754
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:50,636
Look, Kelly, I'm a problem solver,
all right? This is what I do. Okay?

755
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:54,932
Let's just- Let's just think
outside of the box here.

756
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:57,602
Look, she'll get a job,
I'll keep mowing...

757
01:02:57,727 --> 01:03:00,313
...lawns, and over time
we'll pay it down.

758
01:03:00,521 --> 01:03:03,232
You know? This can work.
We can do this.

759
01:03:03,441 --> 01:03:05,818
It'll be like a payment plan.

760
01:03:13,409 --> 01:03:16,329
- You really care about her, huh?
- Yeah, I really do.

761
01:03:16,537 --> 01:03:20,041
Yeah, I don't know. If I'm gonna
do this payment-plan thing...

762
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:22,502
...I need a show of good faith,
you know?

763
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:26,214
- Something concrete.
- Well, like what?

764
01:03:28,424 --> 01:03:29,717
A blowjob.

765
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:34,306
No. I told you she's not gonna
do that anymore.

766
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:37,226
Who said anything about her?

767
01:03:40,938 --> 01:03:44,942
Yeah, we're definitely
outside the box now, huh?

768
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:50,239
Now, you gotta ask yourself,
how far are you willing to go?

769
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:55,119
How much do you
really care about her?

770
01:04:00,332 --> 01:04:01,917
I'm joking, man.

771
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,921
Relax.

772
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:10,509
- Damn. Do I look gay to you?
- No, but, Jesus-

773
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,936
You wanna be president?

774
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:22,439
Let me tell you the first
rule of politics:

775
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,901
Always know if the juice
is worth the squeeze.

776
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:30,113
You know what that means?
It means you don't steal my girl...

777
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:32,741
...unless you're ready
to accept the consequences.

778
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:40,707
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

779
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,629
That's gonna swell up like
a bitch. Here, take this.

780
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:53,304
I'm telling you,
it's gonna hurt like shit.

781
01:04:59,518 --> 01:05:05,524
I'm sorry I got upset.
I felt taken advantage of.

782
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:09,528
Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.
I know she loves you.

783
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,031
I'm gonna leave you guys alone.

784
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:14,325
But now you're doing
something for me.

785
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,505
Remember that ass-bag, Hugo,
from the convention?

786
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:30,007
We used to be partners
a long time ago.

787
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:33,219
One day, I had this killer
idea to make films set...

788
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:34,221
...in real-life situations.

789
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,516
You know, Real World porn.

790
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,727
I told the idea to Hugo.
He says he'll think about it.

791
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:42,938
And what does
that motherfucker do?

792
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,733
Takes my best girl, starts
his own company with my idea...

793
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,319
...and the guy makes millions.

794
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,737
It's not the money
that pisses me off.

795
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:53,031
I mean, fuck,
it does piss me off...

796
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,242
...but that's not it.
It's the perception.

797
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,245
Everybody thinks Hugo's
the genius. It was my idea.

798
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:02,207
It's like he's Simon,
and I'm Garfunkel.

799
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:07,337
Look at me, man.
I'm fucking Garfunkel.

800
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:15,430
- Look, seriously, I can't do this.
- Don't be a pussy. Nobody's home.

801
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,813
- Why do you want this thing so bad?
- Because it should've been mine.

802
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,441
- I'll grab it and leave.
- You don't understand...

803
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,526
...I have to be at
a dinner in an hour.

804
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,528
My whole life depends on it.

805
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,405
You want me out
of Danielle's life?

806
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,823
Yes, I do.

807
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,534
- Then let's go.
- But wait, seriously.

808
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,828
Sometimes, if you wanna do
something good...

809
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,913
...you gotta do
something bad.

810
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,416
Yeah, but this is breaking
and entering.

811
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,043
This is politics.

812
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,841
Hey.

813
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,844
After this, we're cool, okay?

814
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,433
You're all right, man.

815
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,921
Yes.

816
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,923
I'd like to report a robbery.

817
01:07:40,308 --> 01:07:42,519
AVN BEST PICTURE 1999
"CHITTY CHITTY GANG BANG"

818
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:44,020
HUGO POSH PRODUCER

819
01:07:45,021 --> 01:07:47,440
Bang me.

820
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:51,111
Cradle the balls.

821
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:06,334
Stop! Stop! Help me!

822
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:09,129
Help! Oh, fuck!

823
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:15,427
Wait!

824
01:08:15,635 --> 01:08:17,011
Come on!

825
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:38,033
Okay, so what time
does the dinner start?

826
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:39,535
Six o'clock.

827
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:42,621
- Why? What time is it now?
- 6:30.

828
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:45,207
- Oh, my God.
- Dude, don't worry, all right?

829
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,710
We'll get there.
You know what? Try and-

830
01:08:47,918 --> 01:08:51,714
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I don't know. I just...

831
01:08:52,715 --> 01:08:54,633
...feel so good.

832
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,437
Oh, my God.

833
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,149
I just feel so weird.

834
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,610
Don't worry.
Ecstasy is not that bad.

835
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,821
- What?
- Kelly likes dosing people with E.

836
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:18,450
Oh, my God. Am I gonna die?

837
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:22,621
No, no, no. It's okay, Matt.
You're gonna be fine. I promise.

838
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:26,541
You're such a good friend, Klitzy.
I love you.

839
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,919
I love you so much.

840
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,214
This is gonna be amazing.

841
01:09:33,632 --> 01:09:35,509
Wait a second.

842
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:37,636
Oh, my God.

843
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:39,846
WELCOME TO THE SHERIDAN
SCHOLARSHIP BANQUET

844
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,936
You don't understand. It's
really kicking in right now.

845
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:47,313
Just try not to talk
so much, okay?

846
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,315
Talk so much?
I'm giving a speech.

847
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:51,651
- It's okay. Just go with it.
- Wait, wait.

848
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:52,735
In a few minutes, we'll begin
the speeches, and we hope...

849
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:04,622
Thank you again
for coming to what...

850
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,625
...promises to be a
very eventful evening.

851
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:11,838
Matthew Kidman?

852
01:10:16,134 --> 01:10:17,427
My competition.

853
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:20,930
- Hey, what's up, Ryan?
- Jesus, what happened to you?

854
01:10:21,139 --> 01:10:23,642
Just living life, my man.

855
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:25,811
Mina, how are you?

856
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:27,938
Okay. Just a little nervous.

857
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:30,441
But you're a little temptress,
though, aren't you?

858
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,533
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

859
01:10:39,742 --> 01:10:42,745
Hey. Thanks a lot,
thanks a lot.

860
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:09,314
Hey, there's the big daddy.

861
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:12,150
Matthew, what has been
going on with you?

862
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:14,027
Some serious shit.

863
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,113
But, Jesus, man,
it's good to see you.

864
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:19,741
Will you excuse us, please?

865
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:22,744
Oh, my God.
Am I blowing it?

866
01:11:22,952 --> 01:11:24,746
Just try and control yourself.

867
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:28,249
- Just breathe, okay?
- All right.

868
01:11:33,129 --> 01:11:35,632
I have learned a lot
from my teachers.

869
01:11:36,716 --> 01:11:40,136
But my best teacher
has always been my mother...

870
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:43,014
...a woman who worked three
jobs trying to support me...

871
01:11:43,223 --> 01:11:45,351
...ever since
I was a little niña.

872
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:48,521
I will never forget the day
she said to me:

873
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:54,527
And that is why I have always
tried to answer the call...

874
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:56,445
...of the great
John F. Kennedy...

875
01:11:56,654 --> 01:12:00,241
...who urged us to
"Ask not what your country"-

876
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,752
Let's see here...

877
01:12:11,919 --> 01:12:14,130
I can't speak a
foreign language...

878
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,631
...so that's out.

879
01:12:15,923 --> 01:12:19,718
And I- I certainly
can't quote J.F.K. Now...

880
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:22,430
...can I, Ryan? You know what?

881
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:25,726
It's funny, I have this whole
speech prepared...

882
01:12:25,934 --> 01:12:28,437
...and I've been
practicing for weeks...

883
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:30,522
...but you know what?

884
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:32,232
I'm just gonna go with it.

885
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:37,946
Moral fiber.

886
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:40,741
So, what is moral fiber?
I mean...

887
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:44,327
It's funny, I used to think
it was always telling the truth...

888
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:46,121
...doing good deeds.

889
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:48,749
You know, basically
being a fucking Boy Scout.

890
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,919
But lately, I've been seeing
it differently.

891
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:56,339
Now I think that moral
fiber's about...

892
01:12:56,548 --> 01:12:58,842
...finding that one thing
you really care about.

893
01:13:00,051 --> 01:13:01,553
That one special thing
that means more...

894
01:13:01,636 --> 01:13:04,014
...to you than anything
else in the world.

895
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,143
And when you find her...

896
01:13:08,436 --> 01:13:11,647
...you fight for her.
You risk it all.

897
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:12,196
...your future, your life...

898
01:13:12,231 --> 01:13:16,027
You put her in front of
everything...

899
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:17,820
...all of it.

900
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:22,450
And maybe the stuff you do
to help her isn't so clean.

901
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:24,827
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

902
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:29,248
Because in your
heart you know...

903
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:32,126
...that the juice
is worth the squeeze.

904
01:13:34,754 --> 01:13:37,048
That's what moral
fiber's all about.

905
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:03,534
First, I'd just like to commend
the candidates on...

906
01:14:03,617 --> 01:14:05,828
...their impressive remarks.

907
01:14:06,954 --> 01:14:10,124
This year was a
very tough decision.

908
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:14,837
And as much as we'd love to give
you all scholarships, we can't.

909
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:18,549
And so I am proud to announce
the winner...

910
01:14:18,715 --> 01:14:20,843
...of this year's
Sheridan scholarship:

911
01:14:26,223 --> 01:14:28,935
Ryan Winger.

912
01:15:09,726 --> 01:15:11,520
Oh, God, what happened?

913
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:14,356
Yeah, I slipped.

914
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:17,151
Listen, Jeannie,
Samnang's coming on Monday.

915
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:19,737
- I know. How exciting.
- Yeah.

916
01:15:19,945 --> 01:15:21,947
So I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

917
01:15:22,156 --> 01:15:23,741
What do you mean?

918
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:26,452
I mean I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

919
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:29,455
- But it's already closed.
- What are you talking about?

920
01:15:29,747 --> 01:15:32,625
Your teacher came by yesterday
and cleared out the account.

921
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,126
Who? What- What teacher?

922
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:36,045
Your student advisor.
Mr. Salinger.

923
01:15:36,128 --> 01:15:38,047
The one you were
with the other day.

924
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,634
Mr. Salinger? What are you-?

925
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,730
Cambodia

926
01:15:54,022 --> 01:15:56,525
Samnang, what's wrong, my son?

927
01:15:56,942 --> 01:15:59,027
That Matthew Kidman.

928
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:04,324
He fucked me, Mom.
He fucked me so bad.

929
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:06,159
Son of a bitch.

930
01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:10,747
Oh, my God.

931
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:12,833
- What's wrong?
- Jeannie...

932
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:15,544
...didn't you ask
for ID or anything?

933
01:16:16,628 --> 01:16:19,548
You said he was
your student advisor.

934
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:20,924
Oh, my God.

935
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,554
- Jeannie, where are you going?
- To get the manager.

936
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:27,347
No, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

937
01:16:28,348 --> 01:16:29,641
Matthew, what's going on?

938
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:31,852
Look...

939
01:16:32,645 --> 01:16:34,731
...that guy wasn't
my student advisor.

940
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:39,026
No, I know, I know.
I can get the money back.

941
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:42,947
We just need to keep this
between me and you for now, okay?

942
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:46,743
That's a great blouse, by the way.
Have you lost weight?

943
01:16:47,034 --> 01:16:48,828
No? No, wait, wait.

944
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,247
Jeannie.

945
01:16:52,832 --> 01:16:55,752
You think about this.
This is your fault too. Right?

946
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:58,546
You didn't ask for ID.
You didn't do anything.

947
01:16:58,755 --> 01:17:00,757
And I saw you flirting
with him too...

948
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,924
...all right?
So unprofessional.

949
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:04,051
You'll lose your job
over this.

950
01:17:04,135 --> 01:17:05,428
Don't threaten me,
you little shit.

951
01:17:05,636 --> 01:17:07,555
I could give a fuck about you
and your rice boy.

952
01:17:07,638 --> 01:17:09,056
I'm not getting fired.

953
01:17:09,223 --> 01:17:12,143
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Just- Please, I...

954
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:14,521
Just- No one can ever
find out about this.

955
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,524
If this gets out, I'll be expelled.
My life will be over.

956
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,526
If that money isn't
back by Monday...

957
01:17:19,651 --> 01:17:21,653
...I wouldn't worry about
being expelled.

958
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:23,447
I'd worry about going to jail.

959
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,242
- Jeannie...
- Hi, Jeannie.

960
01:17:27,451 --> 01:17:29,244
Hi, Martin.

961
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,255
BANK MANAGER

962
01:17:57,732 --> 01:17:59,734
Matthew, what's wrong?

963
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:03,655
Matt, is there something
you want to talk about?

964
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,950
Matthew, honey, what is it?

965
01:18:13,832 --> 01:18:16,960
- Hi.
- Come here.

966
01:18:24,342 --> 01:18:26,553
I'm in so much trouble.

967
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:42,361
I can't believe
we're even thinking about this.

968
01:18:45,322 --> 01:18:48,159
Well, if you need that kind
of money by Monday...

969
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:50,453
Yeah- What are we doing?

970
01:18:50,536 --> 01:18:52,329
I mean, I can't get you
involved in this.

971
01:18:52,663 --> 01:18:54,457
I want to do it.

972
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:56,459
Why?

973
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:00,463
Moral fiber.

974
01:19:02,548 --> 01:19:03,048
I'm in.

975
01:19:03,132 --> 01:19:04,925
You haven't heard
the whole plan yet.

976
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:06,427
Doesn't matter.

977
01:19:06,635 --> 01:19:08,554
Fuck film school.

978
01:19:08,763 --> 01:19:12,349
This is gonna be huge.
This is gonna be my calling card.

979
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:15,853
- No.
- Klitzy...

980
01:19:16,061 --> 01:19:17,856
- No way.
- Klitz...

981
01:19:18,064 --> 01:19:20,942
...you know I wouldn't ask for
this unless I really needed it.

982
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:23,653
Matt believe me,
I want to help you, but- No.

983
01:19:23,862 --> 01:19:25,947
- We'll get expelled and-
- Klitz, shut up.

984
01:19:26,156 --> 01:19:28,450
Do me a favor, okay?

985
01:19:28,658 --> 01:19:32,162
Take a look at us, okay?
Take a good look at us.

986
01:19:32,954 --> 01:19:35,248
Do you know what we are,
the three of us?

987
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:42,339
- What?
- We're a fucking tripod.

988
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:44,758
- A tripod?
- Yeah.

989
01:19:44,925 --> 01:19:46,760
And you know what that means?

990
01:19:46,927 --> 01:19:50,639
That means that if you kick out
one of our legs, then we all fall.

991
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:54,226
Come on, baby.

992
01:19:59,148 --> 01:20:00,942
Fuck.

993
01:20:02,735 --> 01:20:04,654
I know it was you, Klitzy.

994
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:10,243
- Where is she?
- Oh, there they are. Hey.

995
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:14,247
- Hey!
- Hi, Danielle.

996
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,959
Hi.

997
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,961
- Hey, let's get our luggage!
- Yeah.

998
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:21,838
- Yeah!
- All right?

999
01:20:22,255 --> 01:20:24,257
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay!

1000
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:47,948
So if I pull this off,
I get the 25 grand on Sunday?

1001
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:51,827
Kid, you pull this off I'll
take care of your little Samsung.

1002
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:53,036
Samnang.

1003
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:54,538
Whatever.

1004
01:20:54,747 --> 01:20:56,457
Have a nice prom, kid.

1005
01:21:00,043 --> 01:21:03,255
- All right, minions, over here.
- Good luck.

1006
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:15,851
Relax, relax.

1007
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:18,061
You know what?
Go wait in the car. Go.

1008
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:24,652
Jesus.

1009
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:31,034
Gentlemen, these are your
prom dates, April and Ferrari.

1010
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:35,955
Ladies, we have Eli and Klitz.

1011
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:38,333
Your name is Klitz?

1012
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,835
With a K.

1013
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:45,048
Okay, get a two-shot. Minions.
All right, guys, get closer.

1014
01:21:45,256 --> 01:21:48,843
Yeah, that's right. Show me
the love. Oh, feel it. Feel it!

1015
01:21:49,135 --> 01:21:50,762
- Nice.
- Eli?

1016
01:21:51,054 --> 01:21:53,264
Do those girls go to
your school?

1017
01:21:53,932 --> 01:21:55,433
Actually, no.

1018
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:57,143
Mrs. Kidman...

1019
01:21:57,352 --> 01:22:01,565
...they're porn stars.
- Oh, yeah, right.

1020
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:18,833
You look...

1021
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,168
You- You look really nice.

1022
01:22:22,044 --> 01:22:23,546
Thanks.

1023
01:22:23,754 --> 01:22:26,132
You really do, hon.
You look so beautiful.

1024
01:22:26,465 --> 01:22:27,758
Really?

1025
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:29,343
Thanks.

1026
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:49,865
WELCOME
TO THE SENIOR PROM

1027
01:23:18,143 --> 01:23:19,644
What are all these cameras for?

1028
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:22,355
For video yearbook.

1029
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:50,134
So, what should we do?
Should we start setting up?

1030
01:23:50,468 --> 01:23:53,137
Yeah, look, we just gotta
keep this low-key, okay?

1031
01:23:53,346 --> 01:23:54,639
Okay. What are you gonna do?

1032
01:23:56,557 --> 01:23:58,142
I'm gonna get our actors.

1033
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:04,357
- Dude, make sure they can act.
- Yeah, all right.

1034
01:24:04,565 --> 01:24:07,945
- Just get out of here, okay?
- Hey, I got this taken care of.

1035
01:24:08,153 --> 01:24:11,156
You just show this little lady
a good time tonight, all right?

1036
01:24:11,365 --> 01:24:13,867
- Minions, let's move.
- Wait. So, what are we doing?

1037
01:24:14,034 --> 01:24:15,369
Relax, relax.

1038
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:22,334
Come on, play it cool,
play it cool.

1039
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:39,560
Look, they're coming to you.

1040
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:41,854
I, Matt.

1041
01:24:42,062 --> 01:24:44,064
- What's up?
- What's up?

1042
01:24:44,648 --> 01:24:48,361
- Can we talk to you for a second?
- Dude, I'm with my girl here.

1043
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:51,448
- Sorry, man.
- Should we come back?

1044
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:53,950
No, I'll leave you guys alone.

1045
01:25:07,338 --> 01:25:08,047
What's up?

1046
01:25:08,173 --> 01:25:10,049
Hey, man, what's up
with those girls?

1047
01:25:10,341 --> 01:25:13,970
- What about them?
- Are they, like...?

1048
01:25:15,138 --> 01:25:16,473
Are they porn stars?

1049
01:25:17,348 --> 01:25:19,768
- Yeah.
- Shit.

1050
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,771
I knew I recognized them.
I knew it.

1051
01:25:23,938 --> 01:25:25,940
- Can we meet them?
- Yeah.

1052
01:25:29,236 --> 01:25:31,739
How'd you boys
like to be in a movie?

1053
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:33,741
- What are these?
- Your scripts.

1054
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:35,743
Sign the release
form at the top.

1055
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:38,245
Come on, you guys, wait up!

1056
01:25:41,373 --> 01:25:42,541
PHOTO RELEASE

1057
01:25:46,754 --> 01:25:48,047
Are these our actors?

1058
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:50,841
Just these two.

1059
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:52,968
What about me, dude?

1060
01:25:53,135 --> 01:25:56,847
Sorry, bro.
Party's all full.

1061
01:25:58,641 --> 01:26:00,142
Gentlemen.

1062
01:26:04,647 --> 01:26:08,442
As an artist, I want it
to come from a truthful place.

1063
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:12,239
Holy shit.

1064
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:17,953
- Ferrari. Ferrari. Focus. Listen.
- Oh, okay.

1065
01:26:18,161 --> 01:26:20,247
- Are we...?
- No, I can do this. Don't worry.

1066
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:22,457
Think Meryl Streep,
Sophie's Choice.

1067
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:33,260
Hey.

1068
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:34,970
Hey.

1069
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:42,644
Next location! Come on, move!

1070
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:45,439
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1071
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:54,240
- I gotta be in this.
- Shut up. Take this.

1072
01:27:10,339 --> 01:27:12,341
Oh, come on! Take the pain!

1073
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:14,051
Take the pain!
Get up. Come on!

1074
01:27:17,847 --> 01:27:19,474
May I have a word with you?

1075
01:27:21,142 --> 01:27:23,644
- What's up?
- I found this in the hallway.

1076
01:27:24,353 --> 01:27:25,646
Do you know what this is?

1077
01:27:26,355 --> 01:27:27,565
No, what is it?

1078
01:27:27,648 --> 01:27:30,067
Looks like a release
form for something.

1079
01:27:31,153 --> 01:27:32,946
Yeah, I don't
know what it is.

1080
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,159
Have a good night.

1081
01:27:55,344 --> 01:27:56,845
You're strong.

1082
01:27:57,054 --> 01:27:58,555
You're firm.

1083
01:27:58,764 --> 01:28:01,058
But you have a secret.

1084
01:28:01,266 --> 01:28:03,268
Show that to me.

1085
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:18,660
Thank you.

1086
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,037
For what?

1087
01:28:21,454 --> 01:28:23,456
I never went to prom.

1088
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:47,355
Excuse me, sir?

1089
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:49,357
We have a problem.

1090
01:28:51,943 --> 01:28:54,238
- What's wrong?
- Derek didn't work out.

1091
01:28:54,655 --> 01:28:56,949
- What happened?
- Let's just say he wasn't strong...

1092
01:28:57,241 --> 01:28:58,951
...or firm.

1093
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,245
Guys, I can't work like this.

1094
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:03,664
Okay, relax.
We'll just get somebody else.

1095
01:29:03,873 --> 01:29:04,540
There is nobody else.

1096
01:29:04,665 --> 01:29:06,959
I thought everyone's
dying to be in this.

1097
01:29:07,168 --> 01:29:09,378
Not this scene.

1098
01:29:11,756 --> 01:29:13,048
All right.

1099
01:29:13,257 --> 01:29:15,468
This is the key scene.

1100
01:29:15,676 --> 01:29:18,763
If we don't get this,
Hugo's not gonna buy it.

1101
01:29:19,472 --> 01:29:21,974
Yeah, well, somebody's
gotta step up.

1102
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:25,060
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because you're doing it.

1103
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:27,563
Whoa, whoa,
Mr. I-Just-Wanna-Bang-Hot-Chicks.

1104
01:29:27,772 --> 01:29:29,940
Here's your first chance.

1105
01:29:30,441 --> 01:29:32,359
Klitz, I can't act
and direct, okay?

1106
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:33,944
Oh, okay, fine. I'll direct.

1107
01:29:34,153 --> 01:29:35,739
- You're a director now?
- Yeah, I am.

1108
01:29:35,947 --> 01:29:37,866
Okay, Spielberg,
what lens will you use?

1109
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:39,451
- It's a video camera.
- So?

1110
01:29:39,743 --> 01:29:42,454
Dude, you don't need to change
the lens on a video camera.

1111
01:29:42,662 --> 01:29:45,665
You know what? Take this camera
and shove it up your ass!

1112
01:29:45,874 --> 01:29:47,542
I'll do it.

1113
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:51,880
I'll do it.

1114
01:29:52,839 --> 01:29:55,175
You guys have been great,
but this is my mess.

1115
01:29:55,342 --> 01:29:57,260
- I'll clean it up.
- Matt. Matt.

1116
01:29:57,469 --> 01:29:59,971
Your face is gonna be in this.
Think about that.

1117
01:30:32,755 --> 01:30:35,675
- Come here, baby.
- Let's...

1118
01:30:36,551 --> 01:30:38,344
Picture's up, people.

1119
01:30:51,149 --> 01:30:52,567
Are you ready, hon?

1120
01:30:52,775 --> 01:30:54,068
Yeah.

1121
01:30:54,277 --> 01:30:56,070
Okay, let's do this.

1122
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:06,165
And...

1123
01:31:06,457 --> 01:31:07,875
...action.

1124
01:31:11,754 --> 01:31:13,964
What the hell
is going on in here?

1125
01:31:17,342 --> 01:31:19,344
- Nobody move!
- Oh, shit.

1126
01:31:19,553 --> 01:31:21,346
Who is in charge of this?

1127
01:31:22,973 --> 01:31:24,767
I asked you people
a question!

1128
01:31:24,975 --> 01:31:26,977
Who is in charge here?

1129
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,452
Fuck it.

1130
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:15,652
All right, everybody,
take five.

1131
01:32:16,778 --> 01:32:18,071
What's wrong?

1132
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:19,949
I can't do this.

1133
01:32:20,157 --> 01:32:21,784
What happened?

1134
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:35,881
What are you gonna do?

1135
01:32:38,384 --> 01:32:40,469
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

1136
01:32:44,557 --> 01:32:46,475
No.

1137
01:32:46,684 --> 01:32:48,352
I'll do it.

1138
01:32:48,978 --> 01:32:50,646
Klitz, it's cool.
You don't have to-

1139
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:52,148
No, no, I'm doing it.

1140
01:32:53,274 --> 01:32:54,859
Why?

1141
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:57,778
Because we're
a fucking tripod.

1142
01:32:59,155 --> 01:33:02,159
All right, here we go, people.
Picture's up.

1143
01:33:03,577 --> 01:33:06,580
Listen, I know this
is unprofessional...

1144
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,874
...but I think
you're really cute.

1145
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:10,667
Yeah, right.

1146
01:33:11,668 --> 01:33:13,670
I'm serious.

1147
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,964
Really cute.

1148
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,049
How we doing, Klitzy?

1149
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,344
Fucking great, man.

1150
01:33:21,553 --> 01:33:22,846
Let's do this.

1151
01:33:23,263 --> 01:33:25,348
And action!

1152
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,777
See you guys.

1153
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,156
Good night, guys.

1154
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:28,872
So...

1155
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:31,667
...what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

1156
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:49,371
- Hello?
- We're dead.

1157
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,874
- Eli?
- Dude, the tape's not here.

1158
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,375
- I can't find it.
- What?

1159
01:35:53,584 --> 01:35:56,754
Dude, I'm not kidding, okay?
I've looked everywhere, okay?

1160
01:35:57,088 --> 01:35:57,880
All right,
calm down.

1161
01:35:57,963 --> 01:35:59,882
No, dude, you calm down!
It's gone!

1162
01:36:00,049 --> 01:36:02,760
- What do you mean it's gone?
- I mean it's freaking gone.

1163
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,054
Somebody stole it!

1164
01:36:05,262 --> 01:36:06,555
Jesus Christ!

1165
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,182
Matthew, could you
come in here?

1166
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:16,065
This is Mr. Simon.

1167
01:36:18,067 --> 01:36:21,153
He says he has something
very important to discuss with us.

1168
01:36:25,366 --> 01:36:26,660
Why don't you sit down.

1169
01:36:30,372 --> 01:36:32,582
Actually, if you don't mind...

1170
01:36:32,749 --> 01:36:35,085
...may I have a word
with the boy alone first?

1171
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,255
Sure.

1172
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:48,473
So how was prom?

1173
01:36:51,476 --> 01:36:53,270
- That's mine.
- You know, we were fine.

1174
01:36:53,478 --> 01:36:56,565
But now you go and do this?
This was my idea.

1175
01:36:56,773 --> 01:36:58,567
Now I'm really gonna
fuck your shit up.

1176
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:01,278
I'm gonna need that back.

1177
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,366
Take it from me.

1178
01:37:09,954 --> 01:37:11,873
Yeah...

1179
01:37:12,081 --> 01:37:14,083
...what are you gonna do?

1180
01:37:16,085 --> 01:37:17,462
I don't have to do anything.

1181
01:37:18,171 --> 01:37:19,964
Hugo Posh will.

1182
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:23,050
Yeah, he's my partner
on this, 50-50.

1183
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:26,554
So could I please
have my tape back?

1184
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,556
Fuck you!

1185
01:37:29,682 --> 01:37:32,185
Fuck you.
I'm taking your half then.

1186
01:37:32,351 --> 01:37:35,980
No. That money's going to Samnang.
The money you stole from him.

1187
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:39,567
You say that like I care.
I don't give a shit.

1188
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:41,569
You're giving me your half.

1189
01:37:42,069 --> 01:37:44,155
And if I don't?

1190
01:37:44,864 --> 01:37:46,157
Showtime.

1191
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:55,250
- Okay.
- "Okay," what?

1192
01:37:56,877 --> 01:37:58,670
Show them the tape.

1193
01:37:58,962 --> 01:38:00,672
I'm not fucking around.

1194
01:38:02,257 --> 01:38:04,259
I just don't care anymore.

1195
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:07,679
This...

1196
01:38:07,888 --> 01:38:10,474
...is gonna be interesting.

1197
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:16,855
Dan, Marci, Mr. Salinger...

1198
01:38:17,064 --> 01:38:20,192
...would you mind joining me
in the living room for a second?

1199
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:21,860
Great.

1200
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:32,872
Matthew, is there anything you want
to say before we watch this?

1201
01:38:36,793 --> 01:38:38,878
Okay, then. On with the show.

1202
01:38:42,382 --> 01:38:44,467
Hello. I'm April.

1203
01:38:44,676 --> 01:38:46,261
And I'm Ferrari.

1204
01:38:46,469 --> 01:38:50,056
You may recognize us as stars of
the adult entertainment industry.

1205
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:52,559
And today we're taking time
out to talk about...

1206
01:38:52,684 --> 01:38:54,352
...a very important subject.

1207
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:56,062
- Sex.
- Sex.

1208
01:38:57,272 --> 01:38:59,566
Special events
such as senior prom...

1209
01:38:59,774 --> 01:39:00,859
...place added pressure
on young teens...

1210
01:39:01,067 --> 01:39:04,070
...to lose their virginity
and engage in unprotected sex.

1211
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:06,656
I know I lost my virginity
at my senior...

1212
01:39:06,781 --> 01:39:08,658
...prom. When'd you
lose yours, April?

1213
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:11,871
- When I was 10.
- Moving on.

1214
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:14,582
In this video,
we'll go through.

1215
01:39:14,665 --> 01:39:16,167
...everything from kissing
to foreplay.

1216
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:20,171
And for our finale, we'll show you
how to put a condom on properly...

1217
01:39:20,379 --> 01:39:22,590
...using a real person.

1218
01:39:22,673 --> 01:39:25,259
No cucumbers or bananas
in this video.

1219
01:39:25,468 --> 01:39:27,553
So for those of you
naughty boys...

1220
01:39:27,678 --> 01:39:29,388
...expecting to see a
raunchy porn video...

1221
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:32,892
...you might as well
turn this off now...

1222
01:39:33,058 --> 01:39:34,769
...because you're not
gonna see sex.

1223
01:39:34,977 --> 01:39:36,479
What the fuck is this shit?

1224
01:39:36,687 --> 01:39:39,482
You're gonna see sex education.

1225
01:39:41,692 --> 01:39:43,277
The ELI EXPERIENCE
presents

1226
01:39:44,653 --> 01:39:47,865
ADULT EDUCATION
Sex Education for the 21st Century

1227
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:52,954
This is interesting, Matthew.

1228
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,793
Yeah.

1229
01:39:57,959 --> 01:40:00,378
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea.

1230
01:40:03,757 --> 01:40:07,094
Well, you remember those
sex-ed films back in our day.

1231
01:40:07,677 --> 01:40:10,972
Well, I'll tell you, if
they were anything like this...

1232
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:14,267
...we sure would've paid
more attention, don't you think?

1233
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:18,188
I think it's atrocious.

1234
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:22,484
But...

1235
01:40:22,692 --> 01:40:24,486
...the hell with it.

1236
01:40:25,779 --> 01:40:28,073
The kids today
are so goddamn screwed up...

1237
01:40:28,281 --> 01:40:31,284
...maybe this is the only way
you can reach them.

1238
01:40:34,288 --> 01:40:36,582
You just might
have something here, Matthew.

1239
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,960
I think it's pretty wild.

1240
01:40:40,169 --> 01:40:42,171
This could really sell,
don't you think?

1241
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:45,758
How'd you come up
with such an idea, Matthew?

1242
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,594
What can I say?

1243
01:40:49,971 --> 01:40:52,056
It's like a gift, you know?

1244
01:40:52,974 --> 01:40:55,059
It's like I can't control it.

1245
01:40:59,063 --> 01:41:00,356
We've Only.
Just Begun.

1246
01:41:03,776 --> 01:41:05,069
YEARBOOKS
TODAY!

1247
01:41:05,278 --> 01:41:08,865
Courtney Booth. I will always
remember late nights in Cabby-

1248
01:41:09,073 --> 01:41:10,867
Eric Zierdal.
I'll always remember-

1249
01:41:11,075 --> 01:41:12,368
Kurt Kilgore. I will-

1250
01:41:12,577 --> 01:41:13,578
Joseph Croft.

1251
01:41:13,786 --> 01:41:16,373
I will always remember wrestling
and the great memories we had.

1252
01:41:16,582 --> 01:41:19,668
Matthew Kidman.
I will always remember...

1253
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:24,673
...the three legs of
the tripod.

1254
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:28,469
I'm here with Hugo Posh,
the producer of Adult Education...

1255
01:41:28,677 --> 01:41:31,972
...the hottest-selling
sex-education video ever made...

1256
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:34,975
...being utilized in classrooms
across the globe.

1257
01:41:35,184 --> 01:41:39,480
Hugo, you're known primarily as
a hard-core pornographer, correct?

1258
01:41:39,688 --> 01:41:40,981
My business partner.

1259
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,566
Let me break it down for you

1260
01:41:42,775 --> 01:41:45,861
See, Hugo Posh isn't just tits.
He isn't just ass.

1261
01:41:46,987 --> 01:41:50,866
I mean, yes, he is those things,
but Hugo Posh is also heart.

1262
01:41:51,492 --> 01:41:53,285
What an ass-bag.

1263
01:41:53,994 --> 01:41:55,497
THE JUICE WAS
WORTH THE SQUEEZE

1264
01:41:55,997 --> 01:41:58,082
Fucking kid.

1265
01:41:58,291 --> 01:42:00,084
My student advisor.

1266
01:42:00,293 --> 01:42:02,295
All right, people.

1267
01:42:02,796 --> 01:42:04,297
Let's make some fucky-fucky.

1268
01:42:04,464 --> 01:42:07,258
Now, Hugo, you and your partner
have made millions on this.

1269
01:42:07,467 --> 01:42:09,177
So who is this silent partner?

1270
01:42:10,595 --> 01:42:13,556
Well, he prefers to remain
anonymous.

1271
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:24,192
You better cure cancer, kid.

1272
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:25,985
The next Einstein.

1273
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:28,279
All right.
Yeah, next question.

1274
01:42:29,364 --> 01:42:31,491
- All right.
- Eli's calling card.

1275
01:42:31,658 --> 01:42:33,785
- How about you, buddy?
- Yeah, Mr. Brooks...

1276
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:36,079
...why did you decide
to skip film school?

1277
01:42:36,287 --> 01:42:38,165
Don't you think you're
a little young?

1278
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,583
Shut the fuck up!

1279
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:41,293
Next question! Faster!

1280
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,879
I got the tape! Can you see?
I got the tape!

1281
01:42:45,965 --> 01:42:47,883
For our finale,
I will now demonstrate...

1282
01:42:47,967 --> 01:42:48,884
...the proper technique...

1283
01:42:49,093 --> 01:42:50,678
...for putting a condom
on the real thing.

1284
01:42:50,761 --> 01:42:52,596
Is my volunteer ready?

1285
01:42:52,763 --> 01:42:54,598
Klitz's big debut.

1286
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:56,767
Shut up, shut up!
Here he is, here he is.

1287
01:43:04,358 --> 01:43:07,069
Jesus, look at that guy.

1288
01:43:07,862 --> 01:43:10,698
He is huge.

1289
01:43:15,369 --> 01:43:18,665
My own scholarship
to Georgetown.

1290
01:43:23,378 --> 01:43:25,964
And of course,
I'll never forget...

1291
01:43:26,173 --> 01:43:27,466
...the girl next door.

1292
01:43:35,474 --> 01:43:37,559
As for me...

1293
01:43:38,393 --> 01:43:40,771
...I'm just going with it.
