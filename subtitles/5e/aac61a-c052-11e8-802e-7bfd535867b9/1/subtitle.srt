1
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,710
The princess nodded,
and the frog said,

2
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,030
"That which you have promised,
you must perform."

3
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,310
Very good.
Keep reading.

4
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,410
"So the princess leaned in
and kissed the frog,

5
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,470
"but as she did, he became
a handsome prince,

6
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,510
"and they rode off
to his kingdom,

7
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,160
where they lived
happily ever after."

8
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,640
Happily ever after.

9
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,370
There's no such thing
as "happily ever after."

10
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,910
Not for a real princess.

11
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,520
The prince my father wants me
to marry will always be a frog.

12
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,790
My offer still stands.
I will help you get to America.

13
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,190
- America?
- That's very kind.

14
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,200
But we're running out of time.

15
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,570
I know of a ship bound for America,
but we must leave tonight.

16
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,450
- Leave tonight?
- We must hurry, Princess.

17
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,430
Hurry, Princess.

18
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,840
Mung Goo Hi.

19
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,880
Zhou Hei.

20
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,090
Chow Lu.

21
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,460
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's it.

22
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,550
Okay. Great.
Great. Okay.

23
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,240
Come here. Look at this.
Spent a lot of time on this.

24
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,520
Now, pay attention,
'cause I don't want any mistakes.

25
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,950
Now, I've calculated the speed of
the train and the speed of our horses.

26
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,190
We meet at this vector.
The only variable is the wind.

27
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,360
- Technically, if you travel
over here on the horses...
- Is this the train?

28
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,070
All right. We're just gonna wing it...
like we always do.

29
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,060
Ride down, jump on the train,

30
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,840
hoorah the money, head back
to the cathouse, all right?

31
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,390
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go. Come on. Move out. Go!

32
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,240
You okay? Nervous? It's all right
to be nervous when you're new.

33
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,610
You'll be okay.
I'll keep an eye on you.

34
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,550
All you gotta do is follow my lead.
All right, look alive, outlaws!

35
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,470
"So the princess
leaned in and kissed the frog,

36
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,460
"but as she did,
he became a handsome prince,

37
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,990
"and they rode off
to his kingdom,

38
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,960
where they lived
happily ever after."

39
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,120
Reach for the sky,
ladies and gentlemen!

40
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,750
Touch that gun and I'll
blow your god damn head off!

41
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,720
What are you doin'? I sorta like
to be the only guy that talks, Wallace.

42
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,960
- All right. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay. Good.

43
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,400
Don't worry. Come on, come on.
Big 'Un, let's go.

44
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,640
Why is the new guy talking?
Where did you get this guy?

45
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,670
You know I'm the only one who talks.
Okay, everybody keep calm.

46
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,920
You think
you're gonna shoot me? Is that right?

47
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,510
What you got right in here?
Yeah, you got this gun?

48
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,520
You think you're gonna
do something with that gun?

49
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,900
Come on, Lady Bird.
You got anything in here besides yarn?

50
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,260
- You got it out for me!
- Hey!

51
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,690
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

52
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,990
Come here. Come here.
We don't steal from women.

53
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,810
Get over here.
Take that side.

54
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,910
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

55
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,170
I'm so sorry about that.
I apologize.

56
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,010
First time you've
seen an outlaw?

57
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,570
Scared?
Kind of excited too?

58
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,130
All mixed up? Yeah.

59
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,120
Last train we robbed, we were naked,
it was so hot out.

60
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,200
Yeah, it was somethin'.

61
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah, it's got
my initials right there.

62
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,820
What are you lookin' at?

63
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,520
Wait! Stop!
Where did you get this guy?

64
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,550
- Texas.
- Texas? Are you insane?

65
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,890
Just shoot me now, 'cause I don't
understand what we're doing here.

66
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,640
Sir, sir, sir, sir. Come here,
come here, come here. Sit down.

67
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,330
- Excuse me.
- Sir, sit down.

68
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,430
- What happened? Wallace, what are you doing?
- I'm just wingin' it.

69
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,120
No! That's not how we wing it!

70
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,800
No more winging it!
Stop! Come on, Big 'Un.

71
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,660
- You've lost your "winging it" privileges.
- Damn.

72
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,100
Damn!

73
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,980
Who killed my uncle?
Who did this?

74
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,640
Give me the dynamite.
Give me the dynamite.

75
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,040
No, no, no, no. You stay here.
You don't get to come.

76
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,750
- Keep an eye on Wing Nut.
- Hey, Blue, looky here!

77
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,190
Okay.

78
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,680
- Who killed my uncle?
- What the hell is this, the Orient Express?

79
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,510
- Get him!
- Come here!

80
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,300
Wh... Hey!
The safe's getting ready to blow!

81
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,810
Get ready to reap
the fruits of our labor.

82
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,910
Move it! Let's go!

83
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,520
Roy, you just blew
the shit out of our fruits.

84
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,400
Oh, shit.

85
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,880
We got a Chinaman to catch.

86
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,630
Stop! Stop!

87
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,770
Stop! Stop!
Turn around!

88
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,660
Turn around!

89
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,710
What the...

90
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,710
- Who are you?
- Hey, Roy!

91
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,740
Don't you worry about a thing!
I got you covered!

92
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,760
No!

93
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,550
No!

94
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,410
Roll, baby, roll!

95
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,520
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!
It's my gang now!

96
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,100
I don't understand.

97
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,840
You said your friend
had a large estate.

98
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,950
He does.

99
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,960
- What exactly does he do?
- Well, you could say...

100
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,070
he's a philanthropist.

101
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,530
He helps Chinese immigrants
get back on their feet.

102
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,890
Welcome to America, Princess.

103
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,250
Lo Fong.

104
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,860
Forgive me
if I do not bow.

105
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,350
Calvin, this man
is a trai...

106
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,430
Traitor.

107
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,990
Why? Because he ran away
from the Forbidden City?

108
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,280
Your reward is on the table,
Mr. Andrews.

109
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,310
Well, now you're gonna have to
double it, or I'm gonna kill her.

110
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,840
One thing about the Chinese,
Mr. Andrews...

111
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,570
Aah!

112
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,290
We do not renegotiate.

113
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,830
Whatever you think
I'm going to do for you,

114
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,640
you're wrong.

115
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,380
It was just
like a nightmare.

116
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,860
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

117
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,290
My gang left me in the desert. I felt
like all the other cowboys hated my guts.

118
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,660
Everyone was... I just missed you.
I missed all of you.

119
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,270
We missed you too, Roy.

120
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,550
I think it's
medication time.

121
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,630
Come here, devil woman.

122
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,890
Oh. Mmm.

123
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,680
Oh!
Ooh, that's naughty.

124
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,880
Ohh. Ow, careful.
Careful with that.

125
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,250
Ow, ow. Careful.
Ow.

126
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,650
Ow. Aaaah!

127
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,530
Holy crap! The vultures are
eating my head!

128
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,870
Aaaah! Aaaah!

129
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,680
Help! Help!
My gang buried me!

130
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,400
They left me for dead!

131
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,770
Ooh! Ooh.

132
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,510
Oh, thank heavens.
I thought you were a mirage.

133
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,930
- Oh, come on. Water.
- You.

134
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,240
- You killed my uncle!
- Bull!

135
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,510
That was Wallace
all the way.

136
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,990
- He was one of your bandits.
- He wasn't part of my gang.

137
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,710
He was a new guy.
He's crazy as a road lizard.

138
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,360
- You deserve to die.
- Hold on a second.

139
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,790
You know what
no one's saying here?

140
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,890
I had a chance to kill you
on that train, and I chose not to.

141
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,680
'Cause I'm not
a barbarian.

142
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,130
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Carson City.

143
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,810
I'm closer to diggin' myself to China
than you are to gettin' to Carson City.

144
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,790
- Hey!
- Which way?

145
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,990
Hey, that's better.
Dig me out and I'll show you.

146
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,040
Which way?

147
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,080
You see the...
mountains over there?

148
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,940
Carson City
is on the other side.

149
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,630
All right, dig me out.
I kept my end of the bargain.

150
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,440
Dig me out.

151
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,830
Dig.

152
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,570
Hey! Hey!

153
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,830
- Come on!
- Don't talk. Just dig.

154
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,200
Aargh!

155
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,210
Hey!

156
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,640
Where is Carson City?

157
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,250
- How.
- How.

158
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,350
- How.
- How.

159
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,480
- How. How. How. How.
- How.

160
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,240
I thought
you might be hungry.

161
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,080
- You were wrong.
- You would find me a much better host...

162
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,080
if we could come to
some sort of an arrangement.

163
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,270
An arrangement?

164
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,430
Like the one you have with the slaves
working on this railroad?

165
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,270
These people
are free to leave.

166
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,750
What do you
want with me?

167
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,290
Once I have the emperor's gold,
my work will be complete.

168
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,910
Princess.

169
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,000
I think it is time for you
to be among your people.

170
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,300
They don't look like any injuns
I ever seen, Jedediah.

171
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,570
That's because they're not
injuns, woman! They're Jews!

172
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,040
You, stay.

173
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,590
You guys,
get a load of this.

174
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,340
How.

175
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,440
Is this Carson City?

176
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,440
No, this ain't
Carson City, Chief.

177
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,960
You're gonna have to get
your firewater somewhere else.

178
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,960
All right, Roy, ante up.

179
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,630
And stay out!

180
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,440
You bounce back fast, kimosabe.

181
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,290
Ow.

182
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,010
What are you doin' here? I thought
you were going to Carson City.

183
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,210
You! You gave me
bad directions!

184
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,340
No, I gave you
wrong directions.

185
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,990
You want your toothpicks back?

186
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,290
- You got a lot of nerve,
comin' in here with that...
- Give it back to me!

187
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,570
Ain't that somethin'?

188
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,600
Take your hand off me.

189
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,590
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

190
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,550
Hey, I just want to go
to Carson City!

191
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,520
You're goin' for a ride!

192
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,440
Aaah! Aaah!

193
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,360
No!

194
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes! Yeah!

195
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,630
Yes! Yes!

196
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,120
No! No!

197
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,240
Sorry! I'm sorry!

198
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,230
You!

199
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,120
- Who in the hell started this?
- The Chinaman.

200
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,320
Let me out!
Give me the book back!

201
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,270
I have to go to Carson City
to rescue the princess!

202
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,210
You've got the wrong person!
I don't belong here!

203
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,320
Hey!

204
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,270
Keep goin' with the Chinese. That's
workin'. They're about to let you out.

205
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,070
- Give me the book back!
- For cryin' out loud, just
give him the book back, please.

206
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,280
- If it'll give us some peace
and quiet... Forget about it.
- Open it up!

207
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,320
- They're not givin' you
the book back. Drop the book.
- I wasted enough time with you.

208
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,740
- What? You've wasted enough
time with me? What about me?
- Give me the book!

209
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,880
- Listen for a second. Stop!
- Give me the book! Hey!

210
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,250
Listen! Stop!
You're not in the East, okay?

211
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,990
You're not in China. This is the West.
The sun doesn't rise here, it sets here,

212
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,800
and you're closer
to getting us hung than you are
getting that book back, okay?

213
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,950
Now, just...
I like that.

214
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,130
That's what I'm talking about.
You're wound so tight.

215
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,880
You're the most irritable guy I've ever
been around. Just relax for a second.

216
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,800
Take ten minutes, and then
you can go back to screaming, I promise.

217
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,930
I'll join you.
Okay, just relax for a second.

218
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,120
Come on, sit down.

219
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,410
Come on.

220
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,390
Just relax.

221
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,010
Is that relaxed?

222
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,520
You look sort of
rigid there.

223
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,670
You know what?
We got off on the wrong foot.

224
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,970
Let's try to start again.

225
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,590
Man, you sure can fight.

226
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,800
I've never seen anything like that.

227
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,900
It was...

228
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm trying to give you
a compliment.

229
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,040
You're not still mad about me pointin'
you in the wrong direction, are you?

230
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,500
Come on. You gotta be able
to laugh at stuff like that.

231
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,020
Like me in the desert. I don't
hold any grudges. I laugh about it.

232
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,190
I'm not angry at you. You just
left me there with chopsticks to die.

233
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,450
Roy, all by his lonesome. Just me
and the buzzards pickin 'at my head.

234
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,040
You're a very silent man,
aren't you?

235
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,220
You weren't expecting to see
old Roy in that bar, were you?

236
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,230
Be honest.
Were you? Huh?

237
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,040
Did you really
use those chopsticks?

238
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,260
You better believe it.

239
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,430
Now you laugh. That's funny.
I gotta remember that one.

240
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,800
- So, who are you?
- I'm Imperial Guard to the Emperor of China.

241
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,240
China.

242
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,560
- What's with the book?
- The book belongs to Princess Pei Pei.

243
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,380
- Who?
- Princess Pei Pei.

244
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,870
She was kidnapped
from the Forbidden City.

245
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,140
Forbidden City?
I like that, the Forbidden City.

246
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,880
A princess kidnapped.
It's so mysterious. Oh, go ahead.

247
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,120
The emperor sent us
to get her back.

248
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,360
Us? You mean your friends
from the train?

249
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,320
They are also Imperial Guards. They have
four days to bring the gold to Carson City.

250
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,170
- What gold?
- The gold for the princess.

251
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,970
The gold...
Was the gold on the train?

252
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,730
Yes.

253
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,860
How much gold?

254
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,280
One hundred thousand pieces.

255
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,380
Sir? Sir?
Could you hand us that book, please?

256
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,620
Sir, there's been a mistake.
He has...

257
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,960
Sir... Yeah.

258
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,820
We're gonna get that book,
and we're gonna get you out of here.

259
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,610
- You help me escape?
- Shh. Yes.

260
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,560
- Why?
- Why? I'm gonna tell you why.

261
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,070
Because there are some things
in this world that are just wrong,

262
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,030
and stealing a princess
is one of them.

263
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,170
Yeah. That's wrong.

264
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,240
I'll tell you another thing. I feel guilty
about leading you up that mountain.

265
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,450
What was I thinking?
How much time did we waste there?

266
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,170
That was stupid.
It wasn't funny. All right?

267
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,440
Now, sit tight and let me
figure this out.

268
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,860
All right,
come on, Roy.

269
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,790
Maybe... Maybe I pretend to be sick, then
attack the guards when they come in.

270
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,010
Okay, you mean
the sick prisoner routine?

271
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,280
Yeah. Does that still
work in China?

272
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,270
'Cause here it's sorta
been done to death.

273
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,320
- I have another idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

274
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,550
Here's how you help me. You stay on your side
of the room, let me figure it out over here.

275
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,760
Okay, you play over there.

276
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,810
Think. Think.
What do we got here? Oh, yeah.

277
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,660
Okay.

278
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,280
We got wood. We got a wall
made out of wood.

279
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,360
That's good.
Oh, we got pillows.

280
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,250
We got pillows, sheets.
We got the sheets and the mattress.

281
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,760
Okay, let's put it all together.
Let's think. Add it up, add it up.

282
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,680
What do we got?
What do we got?

283
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,000
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

284
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,140
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

285
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,310
- Hold this for me.
- No, no. That's your shirt. You hold it.

286
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,140
I like your energy,
but I'm not with you.

287
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,720
- When the shirt gets wet, it doesn't break.
- I don't know what that means.

288
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,000
And then...

289
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,560
Okay. And then what...
Then with the wet shirt, you...

290
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,830
You bend the bars.
That's the pay-off.

291
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,830
Don't waste my time
with stuff like that, okay?

292
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,360
A 2,000-year-old civilization,
that's all you can come up with?

293
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,770
Shame on you.
Shame on you.

294
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,290
Come on. Stop, please.
It's embarrassing.

295
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,240
- See? I told you so.
- No, you said, "Wet shirt don't break"

296
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,280
not "Piss shirt bend bar"

297
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,880
- Twist it.
- Help.

298
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,360
Okay, there.
Get it. There you go.

299
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,270
Just one more.
Yeah.

300
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,640
You're as strong as an ox!
Go! You can do it!

301
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,890
There, you got it!
We're gettin' it!

302
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,440
- Hold it for me. I'll get through.
- Okay.

303
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,840
No, no, no. You hold it
and I'll go through.

304
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,120
No! Not your hand! Stop.

305
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,150
- Hold it.
- Adios, sucker.

306
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,420
- What?
- I'm just kidding. Come on. Go.

307
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,500
I wouldn't leave
my old pal there.

308
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,740
Go. Really squeeze.

309
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,150
No, no, no, no.
Grab this, grab that.

310
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,160
Work your magic right here.

311
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,400
- Too dry.
- What? Juice it up. Juice it up. Go.

312
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,290
I can't! No more!

313
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,400
Ah, damn it.

314
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,670
Come on out, little Roy.
Work your magic.

315
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,460
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

316
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,180
- Stop! Don't look at me.
- Relax!

317
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,920
- Relax. It'll come.
- Thanks.

318
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,810
- That helps. Yeah. Good.
- Is that called relax?

319
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,710
Whoa!

320
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,870
Sheriff! Oh, thank God
you're here. Get the guns!

321
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,320
- Get my book!
- I got it!

322
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,910
Whoa, whoa.
Wow, who's the pretty lady?

323
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,470
- That's my wife.
- How long you been in this country?

324
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,870
- Four days.
- Nice work.

325
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,190
Hello.

326
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,650
Come on.
Let's adios, partner.

327
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,640
Hyah!

328
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,350
Well, best of luck to you.

329
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,640
Guess this is what
your people call sayonara.

330
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,520
Looks like Fido's giving you
some problems there.

331
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,560
You want me to, uh,
give you a hand?

332
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,480
- No, I can do it.
- Sure, you can.

333
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,070
How is a greenhorn like you
gonna make it to Carson City...

334
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,820
and rescue
this princess?

335
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,670
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

336
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,110
I can't take it any more.
Watch me do it.

337
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,910
Get it like this
and you put it up high.

338
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,000
See? It'll drift back
when you're riding.

339
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,350
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

340
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,660
Take you to Carson City,
help you rescue Princess "Pee Pee."

341
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,350
Pei Pei. You do not
care about the princess.

342
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,720
You don't know me
very well, do you?

343
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,640
Tell you one thing... I'd hate
to think of an innocent member...

344
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,660
of Chinese nobility suffering.

345
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,380
Tell you that.

346
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,250
You people believe in karma
over there, right?

347
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,430
Well, I've been thinking. There must be
a reason why we keep running into each other.

348
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,140
I've ridden with some terrible men...
just people I couldn't trust.

349
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,480
But when I look at you,

350
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,860
there's something different
about you, and I can see it.

351
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,390
I can see it in your eyes.

352
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,590
It's what the Indians call Chippichawa.

353
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,880
- What's that?
- Chippichawa is nobility.

354
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,880
And you have it in spades.

355
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,650
You've got yourself a partner.
This has nothing to do with gold, okay?

356
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,300
Shake on it.

357
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,920
Why you spitting in your hand?

358
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, it's customary,
to seal the deal.

359
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,660
Come on. Let's go.

360
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,470
This is gonna be a long journey.

361
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,030
You boys take care now, you hear?
Shalom.

362
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,800
- Shalom.
- Oh. Let's go.

363
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,620
Yee-haw! Goddamn!

364
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,890
Looks like y'all had a twister
touch down in here.

365
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,630
- Roy O'Bannon and his partner come through town.
- Roy O'Bannon?

366
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:02,340
Roy O'Bannon ain't got no partner, friend.
Roy O'Bannon is dead.

367
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,750
He ain't dead. He busted out of jail
last night with the Shanghai Kid.

368
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,720
Shanghai Kid?
Roy got a new gang goin'?

369
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,310
That son of a bitch.
That two-timin' son of a bitch!

370
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,160
He double-crossed us with that Chinaman
from the damn train!

371
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,710
Just like that.
See, at kind of a rakish angle.

372
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,740
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- How do I look?

373
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,230
I think you look great.
I think you look like a real cowboy.

374
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,080
Very dapper, red bandana.

375
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,670
Roy O'Bannon.

376
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,590
- My name is Chon Wang.
- John Wayne?

377
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,530
Chon Wang.

378
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,770
- That's a terrible cowboy name.
- Why?

379
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,010
No, come on, that's not gonna work.
That's horrible.

380
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:48,000
- That's so bad. And so's the ponytail.
- No!

381
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,310
It doesn't look
that bad, actually.

382
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,030
Never touch my queue.

383
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,390
That killed! Ow.

384
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,080
- We have to go to Carson City.
- Okay.

385
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,310
Now, before we go to Carson City,
I want to teach you some stuff. Come on.

386
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,080
You just follow me.

387
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,860
- What's that?
- Sensitivity. Increased reflexes.

388
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,750
Now, these are guns. These can be
your best friend or worst enemy.

389
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,080
That's a spin in my left hand.
That's a spin in my right hand.

390
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,350
That's two spins. Now, here,
I'm gonna let you hang onto this.

391
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,520
See? Whoa. Be careful.
Always be ready. Always be ready.

392
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,890
Now, try to exhale
for long-range shots,

393
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,880
inhale for short-range.

394
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,760
All right, now cover up your ears,
'cause this could be loud.

395
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,750
Cover up your ears.

396
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,840
I am like a wild horse.
You can't tame me.

397
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,170
You put the oats in the pen, though,
and I'll come in for a nibble every day.

398
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,060
But if you ever shut that gate, I'll jump
the fence. You'll never see me again.

399
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,670
Thing about your husband...
and this is nothing against him,

400
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,680
because I really like him...

401
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,020
he comes from a very
male-dominated society.

402
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,470
Let me put it this way...

403
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,580
my horse is definitely
not my best friend.

404
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,780
Now, people start
looking at you funny,

405
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,040
all you gotta say is,
"Howdy, partner."

406
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,540
- Howdy, partner?
- Faster than that or people will
think you're slow in the head.

407
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,720
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

408
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,050
- Just follow my lead. Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

409
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,390
- Howdy, partner.
- Just park it right there.

410
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,590
It's not working.

411
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:32,200
Some people aren't as tolerant as I am.
Not very friendly today.

412
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,310
John, what are you...

413
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,610
- John...
- Ow. Hurt.

414
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,330
Okay. We gotta work on that.

415
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,620
Here you go, John.
Straighten up here.

416
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,630
- Roy, it hurts so bad.
- I know, John,

417
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,160
but I'm not gonna walk with you
if you walk like that.

418
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,470
I'll be okay.

419
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,180
- Hey, Roy. It's you.
- Holy shit!

420
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,190
I'm a wanted man.
Look at this!

421
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,190
- Five hundred bucks! That's a lot of money.
- Let me see.

422
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,280
- Nice picture.
- Careful, careful.

423
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,530
Wow, look at this.
Do you know what this means?

424
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,670
- This will drive the girls crazy.
- Really?

425
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,590
Yes, really. Come on, let's get
a couple more of these.

426
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,630
- It's not bad.
- I'm wanted too!

427
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,080
- What?
- This.

428
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,420
Oh, come on.
That's not right.

429
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,460
I know. I'm not from Shanghai.

430
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,510
No! $1,000 for a sidekick?

431
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,140
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Be careful.

432
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,890
Justice system's all screwed up.

433
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,080
Man can't even ride a horse, and that's
a really cool nickname... Shanghai Kid.

434
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,190
It's like,
got a snap to it that...

435
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,980
Uh -oh, trouble.
John, come here. Get over here.

436
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,820
Tie 'em up over here, fellas.

437
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,670
- What's going on?
- Shh.

438
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,910
Oh.

439
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,600
Howdy, partner.

440
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,350
Oh, my God, it's a posse.
They can't be looking for us.

441
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,840
- What's "posse"?
- Oh, I think they're passing us by.

442
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:16,900
It looked like Marshal Nathan
Van Cleef, the psychotic killer.

443
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,160
Roy O'Bannon!
This is Marshal Nathan Van Cleef.

444
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,630
- Ohh!
- We know you're hidin 'in there.

445
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,990
Oh, God, it is him.
It is him.

446
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,630
Why don't you throw down your six-shooters
and come out with your hands up.

447
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:37,450
And that goes for the scum
you're ridin' with too.

448
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,710
- He won.
- Roy, Roy, it's okay.

449
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,590
No, it's not okay!
Stop! You don't know this guy!

450
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,430
Let me talk to them.
Remember, we have to save the princess.

451
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,700
What are you doin'?
St...

452
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,040
- Go easy, fellas.
- Why are they shooting at me?

453
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,590
What happened to "Mr. Shanghai Kid"?
"Oh, I'm a wanted man"?

454
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,590
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an outlaw.

455
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,370
- I am not an outlaw!
- Stop! You're a bad guy!

456
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:07,460
- Look at that poster. What does that say?
- Drives girls crazy.

457
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,700
Drives girls crazy?
Drives the posse crazy.

458
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,650
Makes them want to hang you,
string you up, because you're a bad guy.

459
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:19,780
- You got 20 seconds...
- Aw, God! Give us a minute!

460
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,110
Go around back, gentlemen. Make sure he isn't
trying to pull the saddle over our eyes.

461
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,610
Remember, I want the Chinaman alive.

462
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm not a bad guy.

463
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,300
You're a bad guy.
You're with me, you're a bad guy.

464
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,990
Hey, you put me in this situation!

465
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,910
- I'm the good guy, you're the bad guy!
- No! We're both bad guys!

466
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,350
- No, only you're the bad guy!
You go out there and tell them!
- No!

467
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,480
- I'm not going out there! You go out there!
- No, you have to go!

468
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,460
- Did I just do that?
- Not bad.

469
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,620
I don't know karate,
but I know "karazy," and I will use it.

470
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,800
What the hell
is going on in there?

471
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,140
You okay?

472
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,020
You just threw me
through a window.

473
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,360
You got that gold?

474
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,460
What? Gold?
What gold?

475
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,470
Wrong answer.

476
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,180
Wait. I'm...
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed!

477
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,550
No gun. Hold on, no gun.
I don't...

478
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,560
I'm unarmed!
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

479
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,930
- Don't worry. I help you.
- No, John. No, no.

480
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,230
John! John...

481
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:48,110
Fight with honor.
You will win.

482
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,550
Are you frickin' insane? Is that what
they teach you in Imperial Guard School?

483
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,760
- What...
- Pick 'em up.

484
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,670
Well.

485
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,590
If it ain't the Shanghai Kid.

486
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:13,030
How about we make the Kid dance?

487
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,580
Oh, come on!
You can do better than that.

488
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,080
You robbed
the wrong train, son.

489
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:34,120
- Look, Marshal, I think that if...
- Just shut up and put on your guns.

490
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,510
This is serious, you know?

491
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,510
We don't come back from this.

492
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,990
That's the general idea.

493
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,910
What the hell you doin'?

494
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,130
Stop procrastinating.
Come on. Hurry up, son.

495
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:12,900
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
cheapen it. All right?

496
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,390
This is a duel.
It's a sacred thing.

497
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,180
It's beautiful.
It's what separates us from the animals.

498
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,350
Oh, yeah.

499
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,530
Whew!
I do not envy you. You ready?

500
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,830
Why don't you turn
and face me like a man?

501
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,870
Why don't you do it your way and I'll
do it my way? How about that?

502
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,710
Oh, come on, Roy. You can do it.

503
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,720
Oh, no, you can't.
He's gonna kill you.

504
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,090
- One.
- He's gonna blow you away.

505
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,070
Come on, Roy.
Don't think like that.

506
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,820
Two.

507
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,290
Oh, yeah. Be positive.

508
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,940
Be the bullet.
Be the lead bullet.

509
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,330
- I'm about to die.
- Three.

510
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,180
Roy!

511
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,340
Duel's off!

512
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,470
Roy!

513
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,830
You blew it, John!

514
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,550
Never interrupt a man
in the middle of a duel.

515
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:36,810
I had him. That's what kills me.
I had him! I had him!

516
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,140
Now you know how it feels
to haul you around in that sedan chair.

517
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,240
I will never bow to you.

518
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,360
Take a good look at these faces.

519
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,160
If you attempt to escape,

520
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,310
I will kill one worker every hour...

521
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,480
until you are found.

522
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,550
Starting with this one.

523
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,950
Do not let him see you suffer.

524
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,070
I know who you are.

525
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,230
Please, tell no one.

526
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,540
You call this a special hideout?

527
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,550
Yes, it is, John.

528
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,980
It's also a good place
to gather intelligence,

529
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,790
'cause no one passes through Carson City
without these people hearing about it.

530
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,860
- Would you ask them about the princess
- Yes, sir, I will.

531
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,940
And I don't care how ugly it gets.

532
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,870
I'm not gonna rest until I've pumped
everybody in there for information, okay?

533
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,900
- Hi, Roy.
- Roy.
- Hello, ladies.

534
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,910
Make way for a couple of desperados.

535
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,910
Nice to see you again,
Mr. O'Bannon.

536
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,890
- Greetings. Hello.
- Roy.

537
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,590
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get
some information here. Trust me.

538
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,880
This is not a proper hiding place.

539
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,800
Oh, come on, John.
Let's relax for a little bit.

540
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,580
- Here, have a drink.
- No. I wanna find the princess.

541
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,670
So do I, but we can't exactly go door
to door in Carson City looking for her.

542
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,230
- Don't forget, we're wanted men.
- Only because of you.

543
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's my fault.

544
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,150
So, what's the princess like?

545
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,230
John, what's the princess like?
Is she pretty?

546
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:43,590
- Is she a pain in the neck?
- You are not fit to talk about her.

547
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:46,510
John, you better
remember where you are.

548
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,510
This is the West.
It's not the East.

549
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,300
- Remember?
- And the sun may rise where I come from...

550
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,310
Blah, blah, blah. I know.

551
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,310
Good. You remember.

552
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,340
- Is she single? Is she single?
- What?

553
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,380
Is she married?
Is she available?

554
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:03,620
Only to a member
of the Imperial family.

555
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,150
Are you a member of the Imperial family?
I don't think so.

556
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,150
Was that a joke, John?
That was a joke.

557
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,670
John, that was your first joke.
We gotta have a toast. Your first joke.

558
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,490
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

559
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,560
Come on. Drink.

560
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,550
- Just one.
- Okay.

561
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:26,820
But don't talk about
the princess any more.

562
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,540
Word of honor.

563
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,000
Be fun to play a drinking game.

564
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,500
- You know any Chinese drinking games?
- No.

565
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,670
Every country has a drinking game.
You must know one.

566
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,870
Just one?

567
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,600
- Uno mas?
- Uno... What?

568
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,010
- One more. Uno mas.
- Okay.

569
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,870
No! I lost?
One more.

570
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,230
Oh, no! Oh, yeah!

571
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,990
I'm so lost, John.

572
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,510
Ninety percent of the time,
I don't even know...

573
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,510
what I'm doin'
out here in the West.

574
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,840
Terrible outlaw.

575
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,200
- No, you're a good outlaw.
- Stop, please. I'm a screw up.

576
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,940
- No, I am screw up. Look at my scar.
- No.

577
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,870
One for arriving late at a guard duty.

578
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,360
One for dropping fighting stick.
You good. I saw you.

579
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,910
The only thing I'm good at is talking.

580
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,070
- It's true.
- John.

581
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,930
- Huh?
- Take your hand off me, John.

582
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,510
Oh.

583
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,520
One more game?

584
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,520
No. No more drinking.
That's it.

585
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:23,550
- Uno mas?
- No mas, John. No mas.

586
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,590
Roy?

587
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,030
Roy?

588
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,790
- Are you coming?
- Fifi?

589
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,800
Uno mas?

590
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,890
So, who's your funny-looking friend?

591
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,210
I don't know.

592
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,760
He's this crazy Imperial Guard I met.

593
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,750
He's-He's really funny.

594
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,750
The guy's hysterical.

595
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,310
We were just playing... Did you see us?
We were just playing that game.

596
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,270
John's going...

597
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,880
And I was going... You can't really
understand what he's saying, but...

598
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,040
Roy? Roy? I never figured you
for riding with a Chinaman.

599
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,470
Well, I'm not exactly
riding with him, Fifi.

600
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,400
He's not my friend, you know.
I mean, he's a Chinaman.

601
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,740
Well, that's good.

602
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,560
I mean...
And you really...

603
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,410
Were you guys talking
about who he was?

604
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,860
Let's talk about something else.

605
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,350
Don't you look delicious?

606
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,780
- What's going on?
- Well.

607
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,570
- You!
- If it isn't the Shanghai Kid.

608
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,350
Here.

609
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,760
Thank you.

610
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,590
Ahh. Thank you.

611
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,590
Uno mas?

612
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,160
John, come on. We gotta get going.

613
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,940
- The marshal's downstairs.
- No, no, Marshal's in there.

614
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,470
Oh, man, John.
What'd you do to him?

615
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,470
- Come on. Let's get going.
- No!

616
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,030
- I don't wanna ride with you.
- Come on, John. Damn, you're a mean drunk.

617
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,740
- Hi, horsey!
- All right. Shh, shh, shh.

618
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,110
- All right, it's time for a "yee-haw."
- Yee-what?

619
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,280
Shh, shh, shh.
Roy O'Bannon special.

620
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,170
We jump off, land on the back
of the horse, yell "yee-haw..."

621
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,570
and ride off, all right?

622
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,080
Watch me and do exactly as I do it.
Yee-haw!

623
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,030
Yee-haw!

624
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,280
Okay, hyah! Hyah!

625
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,550
- Hyah! Where's the head?
- John!

626
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,070
John, get up!

627
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,600
Tie 'em up.

628
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,550
What happened to my horse?
Is he dead?

629
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,560
No, but we are, John.

630
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,930
- Hi, horsey. You sleeping?
- Get up.

631
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,950
Hmm.

632
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:47,040
Mighty impressive hardware
you're packin'.

633
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:51,040
Why don't you get your eyes off
my package, you twisted son of a bitch.

634
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,340
- I hope that's him leaving.
- Your turn.

635
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,950
Thank you, Mr. Van Cleef.

636
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:06,020
Well, well.
What have we here?

637
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,910
Mr. O'Bannon, I presume.

638
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,640
Can I get a drink of water?
I got cotton mouth. Aah!

639
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,640
Don't mention it.

640
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:20,490
And this must be
the famous Shanghai Kid.

641
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,420
- Chon Wang?
- Lo Fong?

642
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,540
You remember
your old comrade-in-arms?

643
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,550
- Hmm?
- I remember a traitor.

644
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,630
I'm sensing some bad blood here.

645
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,380
- Where is the gold?
- Where's Princess Pei Pei?

646
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,140
Stop.

647
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,180
Come on. We're men.
We're not pinatas.

648
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:43,260
Okay? And we're really hung over.

649
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,510
We 're not trying to be tough guys.

650
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:48,070
- You wanna talk about the gold,
let's talk about the gold.
- So, you have my gold?

651
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,310
- Your gold?
- Yes, we have the gold.

652
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:54,090
- Then where is it?
- The gold's in a safe place.

653
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,510
Is he telling the truth?

654
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,500
No.

655
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:10,560
Ow! Nice, John. Way to go.
Way to think on your feet.

656
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,120
He cannot lie.
He is bound by Imperial decree.

657
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,230
Imperial decree.

658
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,020
When are you gonna learn
you're not in China any more?

659
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,490
He will never learn.
He can only follow orders.

660
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,040
At least I still have my honor.

661
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,220
Slaves have no honor.

662
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,490
- No! No!
- Hey!

663
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,470
Now you can never go back to China.

664
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:52,100
You blew it.
Whoo! You blew it, man.

665
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,780
You do not want to cut
his hair off, trust me.

666
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,150
Nothing personal, boys.

667
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,750
My loyalty is to the emperor.

668
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,860
Yeah, John, I heard
all about the emperor.

669
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:09,320
Must be a hell of a man.

670
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,420
He's only 12.

671
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,140
Are you kidding me? You're sitting here
with a noose around your neck...

672
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,760
ready to die for someone whose balls
haven't even dropped?

673
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,780
By virtue of the authority vested
in me through the territory of Nevada,

674
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,080
I do hereby order these men
to hang by their necks...

675
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,060
until their feet quit kicking.

676
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,500
You're goin' to hell, boys,

677
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,750
and your horses are taking you there.

678
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,760
Tighten 'em up.

679
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,230
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

680
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:48,190
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

681
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,140
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em!

682
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,480
Hey! Watch it, you little punk.

683
01:10:56,590 --> 01:11:00,640
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

684
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:04,060
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

685
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:08,510
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

686
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,080
John, what are you doing?

687
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:34,030
What the hell is goin' on here?
Stop those horses!

688
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,640
Stop them!

689
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,780
Pull it! Pull it!

690
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:53,640
Help me!

691
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,310
Well, don't just stand there!
Go after them!

692
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:15,080
Will you listen
to this creek, John?

693
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,200
I've never noticed
what a beautiful melody a creek makes.

694
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,190
I've never taken the damn time.

695
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,420
Look at these mountains
and these trees.

696
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,270
Hell, look at these green trees.
Come here. I don't even know the names...

697
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,670
We're gonna learn the names
of these green trees. Come here.

698
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,390
I want you to look at these.

699
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,430
Can we not...
John, what are you doing?

700
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,640
Are you still worried about your hair?

701
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,610
John, listen to me.
You're very vain.

702
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,570
By the time you're 70,
your queue, your ponytail...

703
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,570
will be as good as new.

704
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,750
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

705
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,610
Can we not take two seconds, John?
We just cheated death.

706
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,630
Come on. Let's look at
these mountains for a second.

707
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,900
- Okay, let me get my stuff.
God, you're unbelievable.
- I'm going alone.

708
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,090
What are you... John,
what are you talking about?

709
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:09,860
- I heard you.
- You heard me. Okay.

710
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,810
At Goldie's.

711
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,720
You said I wasn't your friend.

712
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,360
John...

713
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,180
Hold on a second, John.
I was talking to a girl.

714
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,440
- It was... That's taken
out of context. That's not...
- Roy.

715
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:29,320
You were right.
How could I ever be your friend?

716
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,480
I'm just a Chinaman.

717
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,100
Hold on, John. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to...

718
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,150
Sayonara, Roy.

719
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,430
Wait here.

720
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,540
Please.

721
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,180
You have come a long way.

722
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,700
I hope the princess you seek...

723
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,720
is worthy of such devotion.

724
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,100
It is my duty to bring her home.

725
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,320
I even brought her favorite book.

726
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,510
That's very kind of you.

727
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,830
But what if you found the princess...

728
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:37,160
and she did not wish to go back to
the Forbidden City?

729
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,670
Why would she want to stay here?

730
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,940
Maybe she can do more
for the people here...

731
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,880
than she could back in China.

732
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,480
Princess Pei Pei.

733
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,880
Please, don't draw attention.

734
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,550
Please. Stand up!

735
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,440
Princess, you have to come with me.

736
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,540
I cannot.
Fong cannot find me missing.

737
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,550
Princess, I cannot leave you here.

738
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,880
Please, standup!

739
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,810
Don't bow! Get up!

740
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,770
Get up!

741
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,940
You must go.

742
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,360
If I leave,
Fong will begin to kill the others.

743
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,850
It is my duty to bring you home.

744
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,860
I command you to go.

745
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:46,940
Go!

746
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,950
Go!

747
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,400
Reach for the sky, baldy!

748
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,370
That's right. It's Roy.

749
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,870
Am I interrupting?

750
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:01,860
I followed you. So what?

751
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,120
What am I supposed to do, let you
wander off? You're a greenhorn.

752
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,320
You'll get killed out here.

753
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,810
Come on! We gotta adios
out of here, partner! Come on!

754
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,310
Hyah!
You gotta stick with me.

755
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,120
Don't forget, we got
a princess to save.

756
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,330
Give my regards
to the emperor, Princess.

757
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,540
- Chon Wang?
- Chon Wang?
- Chon Wang?

758
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,960
That's right, Johnny Wayne is here.

759
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,950
Hey, it's me.

760
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,530
Why did you cut his hair?

761
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,870
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

762
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,010
Go on, drop the gun.

763
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,010
Now, slide it over.

764
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,840
Is that her?

765
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,830
She's pretty.

766
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,000
Grab her.

767
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,870
Come on.
We'll take it from here, guys.

768
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,990
John, what...
John, get up.

769
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,040
What are you...
I thought we were past this.

770
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,690
Come on, John.

771
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:50,330
Do you see?
He will always be a slave.

772
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,070
This is the West,

773
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,970
not the East.

774
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:17,380
And the sun may rise...

775
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,390
where we come from,

776
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,820
but here is where it sets.

777
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,690
You want me to translate?
The princess stays.

778
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,210
The princess stays.

779
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,000
I grab the gold,
you marry the princess.

780
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,040
We both hang Fong and call it a day.
Mission accomplished.

781
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,430
Well, well.

782
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,670
Nice to see we're all churchgoers.

783
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,020
Son of a bitch!
With my own guns!

784
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,670
Sweet, ain't it?

785
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,960
How about that?
It's a Mexican standoff.

786
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,670
Only we ain't got no Mexicans.

787
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,940
No!

788
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,100
Princess Pei Pei!

789
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,960
- I hit you?
- No.

790
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:51,430
But you're gettin' really close.

791
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,910
You've almost killed me,
like, 17 times already.

792
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,110
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

793
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,630
You're on fire today!

794
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,110
How do you survive out here?

795
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:47,070
What's that supposed to mean? These
aren't my... These guns are really weird.

796
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,060
Oh, man.

797
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,670
Stay low!

798
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,760
Maybe we should let bygones be bygones.
You got off some good shots.

799
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:10,460
I got off some good ones.
Let's call it a tie.

800
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,900
What's the matter, O'Bannon?
Out of bullets?

801
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,300
No, I got one left.

802
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,550
Tell you what I'll do.

803
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,960
I'll take out all my bullets but one.

804
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:24,950
And that way, we'll be even.
How's that?

805
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:28,670
Okay.
That sounds fair.

806
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,660
You'd do that for me?

807
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,180
Oh, yeah.

808
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,420
You bet I would.

809
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,670
We come out on three.

810
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,550
I know, but-but let me count.

811
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,280
Fight with honor.
Okay.

812
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,270
Fight with... Okay.
One!

813
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,710
Two!
Two and a half!

814
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,710
Two and seven-eights!

815
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,390
Three!

816
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,940
How the hell did that happen?

817
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,660
It's a miracle.

818
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,570
I am invincible.

819
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,590
Roy!

820
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,070
Invincible!

821
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:16,090
- Now it's time for you to die.
- Adios, partner.

822
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,020
Wow.

823
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,870
Roy!

824
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,300
He took the gold.

825
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,030
Is that all you care about
is the gold?

826
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,580
Shame on you.

827
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,940
There's more to life than money.
I hope you learn that one day.

828
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:41,940
What happened?

829
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,830
What? Nothing, nothing.
I just killed him. How'd you do?

830
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:47,740
- How?
- What do you mean, how? I shot him with my gun.

831
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,750
Come on.
Tell me the truth.

832
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,380
It was unbelievable. You missed
a miracle. I had one bullet left.

833
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,780
He had, like, a million left. He lied to me
and told me that he only had one too.

834
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:58,720
But-But when...
But when he...

835
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:11,710
- She's staying?
- Yes.

836
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:15,830
- Can I stand?
- Yes.

837
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,600
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!

838
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,190
That's my line. He stole my gang,
he's stealing my lines.

839
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,260
- That's unbelievable.
- Roy! Roy!

840
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:30,170
- Get back!
- Stop, stop. It's Wallace.

841
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:32,250
Hey, Roy,

842
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:35,580
we know you been moonlightin' on us with
that old yellow fella from the train!

843
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,690
You guys, you stay here.
This isn't your battle.

844
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:41,310
No, we stick together.
We are partners.

845
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,500
That's beautiful.

846
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,860
You go out the back door.

847
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:54,820
- No.
- Don't worry, Princess.

848
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,890
I promise you,
I will see you again.

849
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,500
That which you have promised...

850
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:03,510
you must perform.

851
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,330
- Get out of the way!
- Why?

852
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:21,780
- Come on!
- Why? What are you...

853
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:25,780
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- No, John, stop, stop.

854
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:30,300
They can't touch me. Something happened
back there. It was a miracle.

855
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,530
- There's no way...
- Hey, smart-ass! Do you hear me?

856
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,320
Time's up, O'Bannon!
It's the end of the line!

857
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,730
We can take these guys.
Yep, we can take them.

858
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,140
Are you comin' out or ain't you?

859
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,820
Gun.

860
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:57,670
You really are the Shanghai Kid.

861
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:02,970
Nice riding with you, partner.

862
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:15,870
We go out on three.
I count.

863
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:18,110
No, I count.

864
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:20,830
We'll both count.

865
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:23,580
One, two, three!

866
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,340
- Indians! Look out!
- No! My family! My family!

867
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:46,590
- Friends. Brothers!
- Roy!

868
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:51,770
I gotta tell ya, we always
figured you for a dumb shit, but, uh,

869
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:54,810
we was thinkin' maybe you wanna
come back and rejoin the gang.

870
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,430
- So, uh, what do you say?
- Yeah, what do you say?

871
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,420
I think I'm just gonna wing it.

872
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,340
All right.

873
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,350
- And you are goin ' to jail.
- That works too.

874
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,380
How, kimosabe!

875
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,720
How, kimosabe!

876
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,460
Oh, it's nice to be
standing here next to you.

877
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,830
I don't think I've ever gotten
a chance to thank you for...

878
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:27,030
for saving us so many times.

879
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:30,930
I wish you could understand what...
I feel like there's this gap between us.

880
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,950
It's like, I'm a cowboy,
you're an Indian.

881
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,360
You say "wampum,"
I say "money."

882
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,630
At a certain point,
I just think...

883
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:43,220
Shut up, Roy.
You talk too much.

884
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:45,630
Did-Did...
She just...

885
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:02,490
There she is, right on time,
carrying a big, fat payroll.

886
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,390
Oh.

887
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:09,630
I don't know if I'll ever
get used to this one.

888
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,860
Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

889
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:16,800
I can guarantee you, we won't get half
as many girls being lawmen.

890
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,780
I know we're spoken for, but...

891
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,180
You never know what's gonna
happen in a relationship.

892
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:25,850
I gotta get rid of my outlaw name.
That's not gonna work any more.

893
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:28,370
Really?
What would you call yourself?

894
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,640
I don't know. I mean,
my real name's Wyatt Earp, but...

895
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,350
Earp?
That's a terrible name for a cowboy.

896
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,720
- Why?
- Bad.

897
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,190
- Really?
- Bad!

898
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:43,450
- And John Wayne's a great cowboy name?
- Roy, look.

899
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,210
There they are.

900
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:49,950
Yep. Look at those amateurs.
That's my move!

901
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,500
Come on, Roy.
Let's go say "howdy."

902
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:54,980
Let's go!
Hyah! Hyah!

903
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:56,980
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

904
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:06,650
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

905
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:13,750
Scene up.

906
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:17,020
That which you have promised...

907
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,770
you must perform.

908
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,780
Hello.

909
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,990
He was part of your
"rushimiant..."

910
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,980
What? Regiment.

911
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,990
He's one of your bandits.

912
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:29,750
He's one of your...
He's one of your...

913
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:32,820
He was part of your regiment
of "dentists."

914
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:34,870
Bandits. Dentists?

915
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:40,630
Wow! Shit!

916
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,220
He didn't teeth brush this morning.

917
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,500
- What is this thing?
- No!

918
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,730
You can't do stunts, man.

919
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:05,660
What's this princess like?

920
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,920
I got air bubbles
coming out of my thing.

921
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,870
Uno mas, please.

922
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:21,820
Uno mas...

923
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,180
Thanks, Fido.

924
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,140
One, two, three!

925
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:45,980
Shit!

926
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,050
Thank you so much, Princess.
You're so good.

927
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:56,470
Princess!
Oh, I love you so much.

928
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:59,130
I'm talking to you!
Turn around!

929
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:02,810
Ask me if I give a shit.
