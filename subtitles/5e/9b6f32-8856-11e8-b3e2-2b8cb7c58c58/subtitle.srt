Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

349

I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

369

No...she's too old.

Your words mean nothing.

535

He runs because he is afraid.

536
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,526
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

...and have him watch me wear it.
