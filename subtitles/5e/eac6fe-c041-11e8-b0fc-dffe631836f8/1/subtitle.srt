00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:32,059
Is Master Wong Fei Hung there?

24
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,061
Fei Hung is out,

25
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:34,721
thank you for coming

26
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,729
Give them the red packets for their presents

27
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,303
I am going to fetch it at once

28
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,119
Thank you Master Tam,

29
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,768
your present is too precious!

30
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,268
Please go in and have some tea

31
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:45,168
After you...

32
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,244
Red packets...

33
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,936
Come on, it's yours

34
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:49,341
Master Chiu has arrived

35
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:52,039
Your son won in the Lion King Competition,

36
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,370
he is so famous now

37
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,040
Give a red packet as a present

38
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:56,381
Master Wong,

39
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:57,351
today is a big day.

40
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:59,439
I want to have a drink with your son.

41
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:00,346
Where is Fei Hung?

42
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,938
He has gone to the train station

43
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,759
Is this the lion head used by Wong Fei Hung

44
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:04,416
for the competition?

45
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,019
I've heard that this defeated
thousand of lions

46
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:08,659
for the gold medal

47
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,191
Someone said Master Wong joined
the competition so as to save a person

48
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,371
That's why he returned the medal to
the government after receiving it

49
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,206
What a hero!

50
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,640
Isn't it fantastic!

51
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,071
A true hero!

52
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,211
The Lion King Competition started...

53
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,281
My master,
Wong Fei Hung, appeared

54
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,621
He is the head of the 10 Tigers of Canton,

55
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,081
and he is the coach of the Local Militia

56
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,420
He stood on the tower,

57
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,586
he called, "Leung Fu,

58
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,617
Leung Fu..."

59
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,396
Who is Leung Fu?

60
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:41,924
Why did Wong Fei Hung

61
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,530
shout for his help at such at critical moment?

62
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:44,966
Leung Fu, never heard of him!

63
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:46,670
Never heard of him?

64
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:47,932
He is so famous

65
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,332
What a shame!

66
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,603
About Leung Fu,

67
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,042
his eyes are sharp and big

68
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,278
Look at me!

69
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,680
Remind you of anybody?

70
00:05:58,585 --> 00:05:59,278
Leung Fu is great,

71
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,043
he is a famous Kung-fu master
from Mei Province to Fu-Shan

72
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,079
He is famous from Fu-Shan

73
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:06,053
to Macao and to Hong Kong too

74
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,923
Inform me when you see Master

75
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:10,188
I haven't seen Master yet,

76
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,286
let Fu keep on bluffing

77
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,323
Leung Fu is the number one
student of Master Wong,

78
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,095
but...

79
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,392
He is as famous as
Wong Fei Hung

80
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:17,830
I know him so well!

81
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,236
Guess who am I!

82
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:20,100
I don't know

83
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,237
Don't you know?

84
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,241
Let me tell you

85
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,073
I am Leung Fu

86
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:27,008
It's him, it's him

87
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:28,939
Wrong guy

88
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:29,810
Foolish people,

89
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:30,679
they are too ignorant

90
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:37,936
Master...

91
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:39,965
- Master!
- What's the matter?

92
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:41,413
Some officials are coming,
they look nasty

93
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,665
- Officials?
- Yes

94
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,964
- What are they coming for?
- Maybe they are coming to arrest someone?

95
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,194
Impossible, let's go and have a look

96
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:47,951
Sire

97
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,806
The Deputy Governor is coming
with his golden dragon

98
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:51,476
with a congratulation card
from the General's Office,

99
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:52,347
for Master Wong

100
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,231
Please arrange for the reception

101
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,487
A congratulation from the General's Office?

102
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,687
Quick!
Ask them to prepare the firecrackers,

103
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,087
to welcome the golden dragon

104
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:01,956
Hurry up!

105
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,709
Brother Fu,
a golden dragon is coming from the East Gate

106
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,191
A dragon?

107
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,551
Yes, a big dragon

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,619
Coming for a challenge?

109
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,895
You are stepping on my foot

110
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:38,326
Brother Fu, what'll we do?

111
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:38,767
Inform Master now

112
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,563
There's no time!
Now, listen to me

113
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:41,304
Ah Yan,

114
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:41,827
bring me the lion head

115
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:42,672
Club Foot, the flag of our Association

116
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:45,539
Don't forget the drum

117
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,584
I see them,
they are outside the East Gate

118
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:02,286
Give way please

119
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:05,463
Here comes the Lion King

120
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:23,375
Sire

121
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:25,367
What's the matter?

122
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:26,885
A lion from the Cantonese Association

123
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,578
has come to block our way

124
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,691
Block our way?

125
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,419
Have they come to welcome us?

126
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:34,194
It doesn't seem so

127
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,728
The lion keeps kicking our dragon's head

128
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,274
Master

129
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,560
Have the people from the
General's Office arrived yet?

130
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,128
No, they've stopped in front of the East Gate

131
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:43,532
Why?

132
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,334
A lion is challenging them

133
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:52,508
Brother Fu, balance yourself,
don't fall down

134
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,677
Brother Fu, you are heavy

135
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,452
No Shadow Kick from Fu-Shan

136
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,120
The dragon head can't touch
the ground

137
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,972
I haven't lost face, have I?

138
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,039
Dragon in the sky!

139
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:20,452
Lion head

140
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:23,927
Think you can catch the lion head again?

141
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:29,158
Club Foot

142
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:31,535
Master!

143
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,131
Master!

144
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,015
You are back?!

145
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,439
Why are you standing there?

146
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,557
Hold the tail

147
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,567
Yes, Master

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,608
He must be Wong Fei Hung

149
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,228
Dragon in the sky

150
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,249
Master, watch the dragon

151
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,601
Club Foot, "Rolling tiger"

152
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:35,003
Club Foot,
"Tiger look up to the moon"

153
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,926
All right

154
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,647
They are higher,
let me test you

155
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:57,869
Clubfoot, the lion head must face the
dragon head, that's the rule, got it?

156
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,836
That's no problem at all

157
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,482
Club Foot, keep your balance,
don't make any mistakes

158
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,400
I am speedy

159
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,737
Excellent, so stable

160
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:25,275
Dragon ball

161
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,367
Dragon ball from the golden dragon,
it represents good luck

162
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,071
Catch the ball

163
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,124
Master Wong, good luck to you

164
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:43,952
Thank you very much

165
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:45,317
Ever successful

166
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,547
Ever successful

167
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,021
Club Foot, let me send you there

168
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,207
Once again

169
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,781
Master, I can't make it

170
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:23,117
Let me do it

171
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:30,213
Catch the tail

172
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,054
Yes

173
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,644
My respects!

174
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:09,539
I am the Deputy Governor,
Guan Shingtao

175
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:12,256
Your Excellency,
I am Wong Fei Hung from Fu-Shan

176
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:16,524
I've heard your name for a long time,
you're really a great master in Kung-fu

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,902
We've seen the best today

178
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,666
You really are the Lion King

179
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,935
Thank you

180
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:25,771
You're welcome

181
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,006
If it hadn't been for this,

182
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,701
we would never have seen
your fantastic lion dance

183
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,269
Master Wong rejected the gold medal of Lion King

184
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,970
Thus, his Excellency Li Hung-Chang asked me
to return the medal to you

185
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,780
Please

186
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:40,944
don't make me lose face

187
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,981
Come on, please take it

188
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,978
Your Excellency...

189
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,112
Please take it

190
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,554
Thank you, Your Excellency

191
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,756
Please be seated

192
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,823
Thank you

193
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:55,201
Fu!

194
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:56,193
Tell me,

195
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,286
how should I punish you?

196
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,520
I know what to do

197
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,423
I have packed up,
I will leave for Fu-Shan by tomorrow morning

198
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:02,723
How about the ticket?

199
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:03,922
I have asked Uncle Kau to buy it for me

200
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,360
I will go to the train station
by tomorrow morning

201
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,804
When you reach Fu-Shan,
write me a letter to tell me you're all right.

202
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,103
It's written

203
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,299
No, I mean

204
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,405
I will write a letter
right after reaching Fu-Shan

205
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,568
You are always disobedient

206
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:24,476
Brother Fu

207
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:25,678
What's the matter?

208
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,908
Let me come back to Fu-Shan with you.

209
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,216
I'll live in seclusion with you

210
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,719
Live in seclusion,

211
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:30,152
you are that great?

212
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,314
I won't stop you from living
in seclusion alone

213
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,483
You've a night to think over,

214
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,751
are you going to live in seclusion or not?

215
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:38,947
Your Excellency

216
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:39,620
Master Wong

217
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,855
Everybody, please

218
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:42,582
Master Wong, please take a look

219
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:43,322
An invitation?

220
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:44,056
Yes

221
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,229
Why is there another Lion King competition?

222
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:50,030
This Lion Competition is between 8 countries

223
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,328
Another competition

224
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,810
what a pity you're going back to Fu-Shan soon

225
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,198
Why do the foreigners want to
organize another lion competition?

226
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,433
This lion competition organized

227
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:01,272
by 8 foreign countries,

228
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,415
mirrors the present situation,

229
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,011
The relationships between China

230
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,834
and the other countries are quite tense

231
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,387
Our country is getting weaker and weaker

232
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:13,233
The challenge of the 8 countries

233
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,119
Is designed to suppress our spirit

234
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:17,211
there may be other tricks as well

235
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,681
To compete with the lions of the foreigners...

236
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:21,656
It's quite a challenge

237
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:23,286
I won't leave no matter what!

238
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,554
I guessed so

239
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,857
Master Wong

240
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:29,558
this competition is similar to a war

241
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,317
Our office has sent someone
to investigate their force

242
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:37,364
These are the plans designed by the foreigners

243
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,863
Golden Eagle, Giant Clam

244
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,492
Long Dragon, Double Horses

245
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:47,874
Flying Phoenix,

246
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,034
Golden Unicorn

247
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:52,647
I have heard that these lions

248
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,542
are much bigger than normal

249
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,776
They are specially equipped

250
00:15:57,017 --> 00:16:00,070
But I don't know how powerful they are

251
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,843
I hope you can participate

252
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:03,284
in the competition with me

253
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,548
To fight together for our beloved country

254
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:07,413
Master Wong, it's different

255
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,716
from the previous competition

256
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,118
I hope you'll come with us

257
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,265
Fu, guess what Master's answer will be

258
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:18,155
He must say,

259
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,289
"I'm afraid we may be trapped if we

260
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,231
participate in this competition"

261
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,562
I am afraid we may be

262
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:26,303
trapped if we participate in this competition

263
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,469
"But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face"

264
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,199
"I think, we should have a detailed plan"

265
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,139
But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face

266
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,105
I think, we should have a detailed plan

267
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:45,877
Master Wong, are you going to participate or not?

268
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,285
"In our present situation,

269
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:53,184
it's pointless participating in this competition"

270
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,378
Although we know this a trap

271
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,431
we should take the risk anyway

272
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:01,783
I have to participate in this competition

273
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:05,639
Master Wong

274
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,626
We're going to participate in the competition,
bravo!

275
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:12,282
Shit

276
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,028
I can't stay for the competition

277
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:17,855
Oh yes

278
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,158
Go and seek help from Aunt May

279
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:22,864
Good idea

280
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,455
Aunt May!

281
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:25,224
How can she help?

282
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,358
She has a news agency in Peking

283
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,935
Go and help her to deliver

284
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,693
the newspapers, beg her to let you stay

285
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:33,830
And ask her not to tell Master, that's it

286
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,965
Good idea, but...

287
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,004
Your ideas are usually terrible

288
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,744
Is this Man Hing News?

289
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,943
It seems to be

290
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,879
Aunt May...

291
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:45,743
Have you got the wrong address?

292
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:46,713
Aunt May

293
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:47,983
Coming...

294
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:48,914
Aunt May

295
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:49,617
Who's it?

296
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,284
It's me, Leung Fu

297
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:54,725
Aunt May

298
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:55,850
Have you had Cantonese tea yet?

299
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,524
There is no Cantonese restaurant in Peking!

300
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:00,193
Why did you bring so much luggage with you?

301
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,581
You know, Master is so mean!

302
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,900
So we didn't tell Master we came to help,
but told him we were going to Fu-Shan

303
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:06,995
Don't tell...

304
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,935
Don't tell your Master you are hiding here,
right?

305
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,235
Right...

306
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,371
So you...

307
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:14,205
Only Brother Fu was kicked out by Master

308
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:14,977
You bastard

309
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,111
What's happened?

310
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,381
Brother Fu, I don't mean to tell the truth

311
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,214
You always betray me

312
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:21,916
I didn't...

313
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,515
Not another word!

314
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:23,727
Follow me

315
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:25,851
Stupid

316
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:28,060
You deserved that!

317
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,331
Let's have a look...

318
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,829
So spacious!

319
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,505
Will they publish the news about your arrival?

320
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:44,676
Don't say anything without my consent

321
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,985
Siu Mo, come here

322
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:50,851
What's the matter?

323
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,814
Look. This word is wrong,

324
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,449
you should write it this way

325
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,084
And this paragraph,

326
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,256
why not move it down here.

327
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:00,421
So, it won't be that messy

328
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,325
That's the way to print a newspaper

329
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,663
Try it

330
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:07,007
The words are not clear enough

331
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,065
Don't be big mouth

332
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,102
it's printed on the dress

333
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,179
You assaulted Aunt May

334
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,634
Brother Fu, I was about to tell you,
but you didn't...

335
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:20,777
You always betray me,
and now you want to frame me too?

336
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:21,219
You bastard!

337
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:21,682
How dare you set me up?

338
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,586
Set up? What set up?

339
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:23,314
What was set up?

340
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,286
Fu, you must be insane!

341
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:29,586
Someone is coming

342
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:31,114
Siu King, open the door

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,124
Let me help her to open the door

344
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,394
Miss Siu King, let me open the door for you

345
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:38,871
No, thanks

346
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,865
Who is it?

347
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,403
Wong Fei Hung

348
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,469
Why did Fu react so strangely?

349
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:45,807
Master is coming,

350
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:46,404
hide up now, be quick

351
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:47,544
Master Wong

352
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:50,337
Don't tell him that I am here

353
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:53,344
What was the noise about?

354
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,077
Someone wanted to open the door for me

355
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,190
When he heard your name,

356
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:57,155
he was got scared

357
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:57,680
and ran away

358
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:03,419
Does the man have big eyes?

359
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:04,923
Right, that's him

360
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,989
And a guy like this

361
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,536
He is here too

362
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,135
And the other one, like this

363
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,509
Let's get out of here!

364
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:23,615
Brother Fu, your luggage!

365
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,818
What's wrong with you?

366
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:25,376
Why shout at me?

367
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,983
Club Foot, hurry up

368
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:31,117
Why shout at me again?!

369
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,954
Brother-in-law,

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,589
have you seen sister to the train station?

371
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,335
Where are they?

372
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,528
Stop searching,

373
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,060
they left when they saw me

374
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,137
Your sister asked me to take care of you

375
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:46,932
Sister asked me to take care of you too

376
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,212
Are you hoping sister would come back sooner?

377
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,138
I may write to her

378
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,405
What kind of important news is it?

379
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:54,711
Why is it printed on a cloth?

380
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,647
Nothing, look at it yourself

381
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:01,742
It's an article
about the status of woman in China

382
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,752
What kind of status do women have?

383
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:09,423
So, you only ever think about men?

384
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,388
This news agency of sister's is in real trouble

385
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,302
Look at the newspapers,
they are all piled up here

386
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:16,693
They never sell,
no one wants to look at them

387
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,129
No matter what we print,
it's useless

388
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:19,868
Someone will take a look at it

389
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:21,033
Who?

390
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,243
They'll give me face if I ask them to take a look

391
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,514
Of course! It's too generous of Master Wong

392
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,350
It's a gift from Master Wong, one for everyone

393
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,244
Stop fighting over them!

394
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:30,946
Everyone gets one

395
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:32,252
Be careful!

396
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,088
Don't break the things inside

397
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:39,022
What's in the wrapping?

398
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,322
Other than a paper, nothing else!

399
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,001
It is a newspaper

400
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,924
The more newspapers you read,
the more you will know about the world

401
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,630
The more you know,
the more you can achieve

402
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,101
Is this sheet of paper that powerful?

403
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,110
To be frank, my students and I

404
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,313
come from poor families

405
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:56,237
We want to learn Kung-fu

406
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:57,977
to earn a living

407
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,714
We haven't studied, so we are illiterate

408
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:04,685
How can we read the newspaper?

409
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:10,514
What a pity,
they can't show you the respect they want to

410
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,662
The paper is so dirty,
don't use it for wrapping anymore

411
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,256
OK, just once

412
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,532
I think, we should start teaching people to read
before operating a newspaper

413
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,372
Or, these papers will just be used as wrapping

414
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,725
I wish there were more people
like you in the world

415
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,776
Your sister never praised me like this

416
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:32,644
Am I nicer, or is my sister nicer?

417
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,209
You are both nice

418
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:47,427
The Ladies of the Red Lantern are coming.

419
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:48,628
Come and take a look

420
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:49,365
The Red Lanterns?

421
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,835
- Let's go and take a look
- OK

422
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:58,009
"We come from the four seas"

423
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,409
"Our lantern is hung on the

424
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,679
mast to recruit heroes"

425
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,346
"Our God sends us the swords"

426
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,374
"The angels change the clouds

427
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:07,682
with their handkerchiefs"

428
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,153
"The world, receives our order"

429
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:12,289
"Our words will be spread forever"

430
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:17,631
"We fear not foreign guns"

431
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,861
"For we use wind, fire,

432
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:22,228
thunder and lightning as weapons"

433
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,635
"We are powerful"

434
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:37,850
"Dressed in red, with little lanterns"

435
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,982
"The ladies from the Red Lantern Sect"

436
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,042
Juggle!

437
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:52,792
Expel the foreigners
and strengthen our beloved country

438
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,262
Red Lantern shines on the fairies,

439
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:55,399
expel the foreigners,

440
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:56,091
we are enriched with power

441
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:57,821
We use holy swords to go against foreign guns

442
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,224
A riot over there!

443
00:24:59,264 --> 00:24:59,791
Don't go over there,

444
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,546
It's too dangerous

445
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,235
I will wait for you right here

446
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:02,867
All right!

447
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,166
We have strong will to protect our holy land

448
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:06,931
Throw the lanterns

449
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:11,500
Juggle!

450
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:16,209
Hear my order!

451
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,009
Return the holy land to us

452
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,010
Set the altar to hang the lanterns

453
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,576
Expel the foreigners

454
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,681
Mister, please lend me the whip

455
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,316
Give way please

456
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:32,534
This is the foreigner’s drugs store

457
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:34,320
Don't kill innocent people

458
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:42,533
What's the situation?

459
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:43,562
The leased territory is ahead,

460
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,736
the foreign troops will be coming soon

461
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:45,328
Don't go there

462
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,292
You'll lose your life if they catch you

463
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:47,667
Have you seen Wong Fei Hung?

464
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:48,369
Master Wong?

465
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:49,167
He must have left

466
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:49,605
Left?

467
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:51,040
Did you see him leaving?

468
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:57,875
Go!

469
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,146
You are Ladies...

470
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,539
What drives you to kill people and set fires?

471
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:09,711
Don't kill us, we're innocent

472
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,486
I've come to save you

473
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,026
They are coming, kill them!

474
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:13,826
Yes!

475
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:15,153
Let them go

476
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,687
Don't listen to him, attack!

477
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:25,728
Don't come over here again

478
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,973
You may go now

479
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:39,310
Go, run for your lives!

480
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:40,810
Who is he?

481
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,107
He must be Wong Fei Hung

482
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:00,554
Wong Fei Hung?

483
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:01,528
Go!

484
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:05,460
Come here

485
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:09,795
Juggle!

486
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:16,833
Red Ropes!

487
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:23,283
Attack

488
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:46,462
The foreigners are coming,

489
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,058
run!

490
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:50,699
They're over there, fire!

491
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,365
Go!

492
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,485
Your ladies have all left, why haven't you?

493
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,819
Don't move

494
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,470
The lease troops

495
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,722
Take them away, go!

496
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,857
Go!

497
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,396
The Red Lantern is showing it's power

498
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:27,192
Holy Mother

499
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,826
Watch out, be careful

500
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:31,635
Yes

501
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,940
Have you seen a Chinese
fellow passing by the way you came?

502
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,335
No

503
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,187
I think the patient needs more medication

504
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:04,164
Let me help you

505
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,157
You'll go home soon. Don't cry

506
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:13,746
Miss...

507
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:15,942
We have come to a conclusion,

508
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:18,165
you should leave this place immediately

509
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,038
All right,

510
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:22,443
if that will make you feel better

511
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,506
I leave now, but...

512
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:27,250
Maybe you need some more help later

513
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:30,681
I don't think so. Go

514
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,917
Child, let me help you to open the door

515
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:40,919
Thank you

516
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:44,217
I saw everything

517
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:46,128
Our Father won't forsake

518
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,957
those who devote their lives to others

519
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,898
Father, I hope there is a real God

520
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,570
So as to solve the hatred between our nations

521
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,829
Otherwise, we can't escape
from the coming disaster

522
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:01,269
Don't worry,

523
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:02,470
God has arranged everything

524
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,205
May God bless you

525
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:06,278
Thank you Father

526
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:08,001
Take care

527
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,862
Welcome to our army

528
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,188
Your ancestors sacrificed

529
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:35,262
themselves in the

530
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:36,100
Anti-Ching movement

531
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,830
This is the 8-colour flag of the Ching army

532
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:45,609
Lui...

533
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:47,475
You'll have chance to take revenge
for your ancestors now

534
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:25,900
Wong

535
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:49,787
Bravo,

536
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,450
I'm General Henlintak

537
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:52,786
Lui, Wong,

538
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,024
tell the descendants of the Anti-Ching warriors

539
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,397
You have my full support

540
00:31:58,426 --> 00:31:59,089
To go against the Ching soldiers

541
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:00,252
who invaded your land

542
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,568
Kill him, kill him

543
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,960
You pig

544
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,753
Put him in the cell

545
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,015
Put him in the shithole

546
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,808
Wong Fei Hung

547
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,378
Did they torture you?

548
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,633
Are you the lady of the Red Lantern?

549
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:47,101
I thought you were allied with them

550
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:48,506
I'm sorry!

551
00:32:52,257 --> 00:32:56,204
We must punish the Chinese rebels
to maintain our interests in China

552
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:01,120
This may also be a warning
to the Chinese government

553
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:03,395
Moreover the Manchurian government

554
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:06,107
uses such local organizations

555
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:08,363
as a protest against us to frighten us

556
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:09,428
By punishing these people

557
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:11,109
we can prevent any further disturbances

558
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:13,830
But this is China

559
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:19,919
punishing these people will cost us our heads.

560
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:24,869
The armies of the 8 nations
made a pact in Tientsin

561
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,284
everything is set for a war
against the Manchurians

562
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:34,039
Then let us execute the China man tonight

563
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:38,819
Then tomorrow,
display his corpse in the street as an example

564
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,647
Yes, General

565
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:50,076
You won't get the chance to compete
with Wong Fei Hung

566
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:54,322
Because they will execute him tonight

567
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:57,588
Aim...

568
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:58,424
Fire!

569
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:02,501
Kill him!

570
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:15,607
There's the prisoner

571
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:16,344
Thank you

572
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:23,416
On your feet!

573
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:26,579
Are you Wong Fei Hung?

574
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,486
I am Father Thomas

575
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,053
I am sorry to have to bring you some bad news

576
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:40,519
You will be executed by the Germans
in an hour's time

577
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:41,215
Wong Fei Hung

578
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:42,685
Executed?

579
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:46,514
You devil,
you will be punished by Heaven

580
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,096
My child...

581
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:52,092
There is only one God who can save you

582
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:02,153
It's the God, who gave me this holy clothing

583
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:03,986
So they won't suspect me

584
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:21,797
Father, you should leave now

585
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:28,965
Open the door

586
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,572
Get up

587
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:35,696
Father, stay back

588
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,070
Catch him

589
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:31,924
Catch!

590
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:38,383
My child.. Wait

591
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,986
I want you to help me

592
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,412
You must knock me unconscious too

593
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:43,684
Sorry to have to hurt you

594
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:44,250
Let me do it

595
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:49,259
Why did you punch so heavily?

596
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:50,458
Not to make them suspect him

597
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:53,956
Don't hit him anymore

598
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:54,621
It's enough already

599
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:55,670
Go!

600
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:57,568
Hurry up

601
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,711
Thank you for reporting

602
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:02,676
Your Excellency, please

603
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,302
Your Excellency

604
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:06,572
Master Wong, please get up

605
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:12,504
What?

606
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:14,209
Wong Fei Hung is missing?

607
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,124
Yes, Your Excellency,

608
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:18,810
we saw the parade of the Red Lanterns

609
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:21,449
Then I was separated from my brother,
he hasn't come back yet

610
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,417
The capital is in such a mess

611
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,405
The foreigners are going against the boxers

612
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,273
It's not wise to get any side angry

613
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,413
On one hand,
the foreigners want us to protect them,

614
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,550
on the other hand,

615
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:34,250
The Empress Dowager wants us
to overlook the matter

616
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,680
Ah Fu

617
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:36,427
What?

618
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,006
Do you think Master is doing this
to draw you out of hiding?

619
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,384
Master knows I am clever,

620
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,652
so he's using this method

621
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,622
to force me out

622
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:43,914
This method is quite new

623
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,429
No, brother Fu, Master needn't use
so many people to look for you

624
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,090
Just Club Foot and I were enough

625
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:50,990
You can shut up!

626
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,782
If you hadn't let Aunt May know,

627
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,204
how would Master have suspected me
of staying in the capital?

628
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,258
Fu, behave yourself

629
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,326
Don't worry too much

630
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,187
I will try my best to find Fei Hung for you

631
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,193
Thank you, Your Excellency

632
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,218
Your Excellency,

633
00:38:10,144 --> 00:38:14,075
Fei Hung might be in the hands
of the Red Lanterns

634
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:18,006
Ho Lan

635
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,641
Your Excellency

636
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,130
Get some information on the Red Lanterns

637
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,679
Yes!

638
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,946
Are there many ladies from the Red Lanterns

639
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:25,051
Maybe

640
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:28,996
I think, Wong Fei Hung
may have been caught by the German Army

641
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:32,316
I have to check it out myself

642
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,318
Your Excellency, let me go with you

643
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:41,714
On this matter, it's better for the officials
to discuss among themselves

644
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:43,977
Please don't worry

645
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:48,771
My office carries some weight in the capital

646
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,581
It's bad luck staying with you two

647
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:54,180
One is as dumb as a stone

648
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:55,709
The other betrays me

649
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:59,592
Don't you think the street is
quieter than usual

650
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:02,964
You are just more aware

651
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:03,798
Really?

652
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:07,428
What's happened?

653
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,431
Have we come to the wrong place,
it's all red

654
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:22,431
The Red Lanterns shine,

655
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,384
here come the ladies

656
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:24,833
My dear fellows,
kneel down for worshipping

657
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:31,186
They're the Red Lantern ladies,
what beauties

658
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,941
I am going to kneel, kneel

659
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,633
Brother Fu, are you insane?

660
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,529
Not that simple!
Should we kneel down too?

661
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,469
I failed in courting Aunt Yee

662
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,260
Now, I've got so many choices!

663
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,014
You'd better let me choose first

664
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:45,169
I'm Leung Fu,

665
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,251
I'm strong and considerate

666
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:50,015
and I know how to make a lady happy
if you get my meaning

667
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,926
How dare you!
I want to know where Wong Fei Hung is

668
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:56,325
Haven't you caught Wong Fei Hung?

669
00:39:56,947 --> 00:40:00,684
How can this guy claim to be
the greatest Kung-fu master?

670
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:04,423
He conspired with the foreigners
and locked our senior up

671
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,680
Fei Hung is not that kind of person

672
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,455
Don't you dare accuse him!

673
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,446
Do you think I'll believe what you say?

674
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,592
Don't you want me to believe he's not involved
because he's in hiding?

675
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,829
Follow me to our main hall

676
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:17,488
Let's see how long will stay hidden

677
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,926
Lady, don't be so stubborn

678
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,555
We don't know what happened either

679
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:23,796
How dare you!

680
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,221
It's you who refuses to listen to the truth

681
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,626
Burn the house

682
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:28,694
Burn the house?

683
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,389
Be careful of the lanterns

684
00:40:30,426 --> 00:40:31,740
They won't have a chance to use them!

685
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:38,289
Let's get the leader first

686
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,669
I don't think so

687
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:41,996
Watch out!

688
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,234
My feet!

689
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,737
Escape from him

690
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:08,304
The Red Lantern Shines

691
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:12,333
Brother Fu,

692
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:12,933
let me handle this

693
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:14,604
She is too tall for you

694
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:15,945
Go and fetch a shorter one next time

695
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,285
No need to make it look good,
they can't see us

696
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:22,621
You act like you mean it!

697
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:29,059
Lady, why do you always attack my feet?

698
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:30,098
Burn your crude mouth!

699
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:32,467
Like that is it?

700
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,405
Let's see how you like it

701
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:35,943
Are you excited?

702
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:41,613
But you're trying not to show it!

703
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:42,643
Come on...

704
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,029
Is this dirty stance taught
by Wong Fei Hung?

705
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:50,189
Wong Fei Hung is not as smart as me

706
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,189
Some more

707
00:41:57,511 --> 00:41:58,603
Red ropes

708
00:41:58,847 --> 00:41:59,575
Let me catch them

709
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:05,684
It hurts!

710
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:13,791
Amazing Lantern

711
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,373
Catch it

712
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:15,498
Master, let me help you

713
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:27,382
Blow the powder off!

714
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,262
Why are you lying down?

715
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:35,427
That was a stupid idea

716
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:36,562
Come on

717
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,173
What...

718
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:51,449
So many people

719
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:52,565
Yan!

720
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:54,191
Master!

721
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:55,237
Club Foot!

722
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:57,392
Club Foot is missing too

723
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:01,434
Master, only you can save me

724
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,281
Your Excellency

725
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:22,326
What can I do for you?

726
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:27,072
I'd like to see Ambassador Henlintak
concerning Wong Fei Hung

727
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:32,086
Your Excellency,
I've never heard of Wong Fei Hung

728
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,959
In the German Territory,

729
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,893
no one is allowed to interfere
with our judiciary system

730
00:43:37,008 --> 00:43:38,096
You imprisoned him without reason

731
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,902
It's my duty to protect him

732
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:43,304
Don't you know the leasing terms?

733
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:44,939
It's an agreement between China and Germany

734
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,576
Change it if you want to

735
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:50,905
Otherwise, settle it with another war

736
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:52,061
Damn it!

737
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,998
What barbarians!

738
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,617
Now, even you should follow our judiciary system

739
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,193
I don't think war between us
can be avoided anymore

740
00:44:28,443 --> 00:44:30,542
Indeed, the war will start tomorrow

741
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,642
Our lions are well prepared

742
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:33,212
to fight with your dragons in the Square!

743
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:35,544
You will find out whose system is the best

744
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:39,014
Fine,

745
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:42,121
I will come for the race!

746
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,128
You will be the losers, for sure

747
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:47,001
Your Excellency,

748
00:44:47,037 --> 00:44:48,028
What about Wong Fei Hung?

749
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:51,061
I don't think they'll dare harm him

750
00:44:51,778 --> 00:44:52,403
Let's go back

751
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:03,490
What the hell happened?

752
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,300
Holy Light shines

753
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:10,201
It must be a trial of the Cantonese Association!

754
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:12,633
Why would we be on trial?

755
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:17,275
The main hall of the Red Lanterns!

756
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,177
Isn't this your main hall?

757
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,081
Yes

758
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:23,001
We are divided into
Red Lanterns, Blue Lanterns and Green Lanterns

759
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:24,515
This is our head quarters

760
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:26,849
And this is where we
execute the foreigners too

761
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:29,160
I won't care what it is,
I have to go in

762
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:34,933
Wong Fei Hung

763
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:42,178
Return my country and my power

764
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:44,180
I fear no fire or knives

765
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:48,392
The Heaven's troops come
to expel the foreigners

766
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,920
We will sacrifice our lives
for our beloved country!

767
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:51,222
Lady Miu San is taking

768
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:53,293
Wong Fei Hung to greet our Holy Mother

769
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:55,366
I am Wong Fei Hung,

770
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:57,005
I come to look for my family and students

771
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:59,668
If you know where they are, please let me know

772
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,677
Burn the incense for our Holy Mother

773
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,248
Lady Miu San is leading

774
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:07,680
Wong Fei Hung to greet the Holy Mother

775
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,527
To enter our main hall,

776
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:11,928
you must go through the

777
00:46:11,965 --> 00:46:12,954
Green Lantern Position first

778
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,196
You will pass the 1st test

779
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:15,964
only if your feet don't touch the ground

780
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:17,338
Please!

781
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,435
All right, thank you

782
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:50,209
Go down

783
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:01,479
I've kicked them all over

784
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:02,119
Can you still stand?

785
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:12,611
Return to normal position

786
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:23,173
Thank you

787
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,372
Blue Lantern Position, please try

788
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:35,588
How do I pass it?

789
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,525
This is the Whirl Position
designed by the Blue Lanterns

790
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,184
Cross this big revolving lantern

791
00:47:39,428 --> 00:47:40,589
But you can't tear any of the paper

792
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:42,496
If you can go through it safely,
then you've passed

793
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:44,087
Thank you

794
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:45,027
Watch out

795
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:08,470
Take it

796
00:48:25,432 --> 00:48:25,895
Ether powder?!

797
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,346
Lady Miu, why are you here to fight with me?

798
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:06,029
If you want to go out, fight with me

799
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:15,695
Senior

800
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:18,805
Give me the sword

801
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:24,743
Lady Miu

802
00:49:25,488 --> 00:49:27,480
We work for our own master, go now

803
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:28,774
Thank you

804
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,162
Senior

805
00:49:32,532 --> 00:49:34,021
I am fine, don't worry

806
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:39,978
Fei Hung

807
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,005
Master

808
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,937
Dad, Club Foot,
are you all right?

809
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:45,309
We are fine

810
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:46,418
Master, save us

811
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:47,949
Fu

812
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:48,783
Haven't you gone back to Fu-Shan?

813
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:50,824
You're so mean

814
00:49:51,428 --> 00:49:52,917
The candles are red

815
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:54,027
The heroes come from the

816
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:54,963
local organizations

817
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:56,264
Flying phoenix

818
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:57,359
from the poles

819
00:49:57,404 --> 00:49:59,235
The dragon is kept in the cabin

820
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:06,210
The Holy Mother is right here

821
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:08,350
Poor fellows,
kneel down to worship the Holy Mother

822
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:10,417
Are you Goddess Lotus?

823
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:12,491
My family has not offended you.

824
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:13,253
Why did you kidnap them?

825
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:14,825
Please let them go

826
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:18,656
Stepping on the Heaven's ladder

827
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:27,841
Master, what kind of Kung-fu is it?
She can fly!

828
00:50:28,617 --> 00:50:29,513
It's just some tricks!

829
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,283
Our country is in trouble,
everyone is responsible for her safety

830
00:50:32,388 --> 00:50:35,345
You should carry the duty
to expel the foreign devils

831
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:38,695
I think you should join us and be the boxers

832
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:42,869
Join the boxers?

833
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:48,912
I've no relationship with any God or ghosts.
I think, you'd better seek help from others

834
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,378
Wong Fei Hung,

835
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:51,781
why are you so stubborn?

836
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:54,639
I have to punish you on behalf of our God

837
00:50:55,323 --> 00:50:56,118
The paper troops,

838
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:56,920
listen to my order

839
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:57,495
Juggle

840
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:22,464
Do you think such tricks can save our country?

841
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:25,077
Do you want me to set them free?
It's simple

842
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:26,890
If you can pass through my
holy tower and holy bridge.

843
00:51:26,937 --> 00:51:27,801
I will let your men go

844
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,396
If not...
You must follow me

845
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:31,755
Well,

846
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,376
I have to offend you then

847
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,022
Walk on the holy ladder

848
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,489
Catch!

849
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:52,995
Take it back

850
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:59,767
Ah, it's just wires

851
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,569
Ok, let me come up and play with you

852
00:52:06,883 --> 00:52:09,077
Right ladies, let's test your balancing skills

853
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:32,667
Now, only the Holy Mother is left

854
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,031
You will be my student!

855
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:44,544
Double Dragon's stance

856
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:50,753
Master's feet are tied

857
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:51,979
Go down

858
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:53,223
Not that easy

859
00:52:57,662 --> 00:52:58,130
Come here

860
00:52:59,199 --> 00:52:59,634
All right!

861
00:53:07,406 --> 00:53:07,872
Cut!

862
00:53:29,326 --> 00:53:30,315
Take it back

863
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:40,636
Come up

864
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:43,300
Cross the bridge

865
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:46,995
Your bridge is ruined,

866
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,128
why don't you release us now?

867
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:48,940
Retreat!

868
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,613
Master, my money was on you!

869
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:56,204
No... I mean.

870
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:57,238
I was sure you'd defeat them

871
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:58,341
Burn the bridge

872
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:06,124
Fei Hung

873
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:07,221
How are you?

874
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:07,902
I am fine

875
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:08,516
Fei Hung,

876
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:09,993
I was worried about you

877
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:15,594
It's a mess, a mess

878
00:54:15,668 --> 00:54:17,957
If Aunt Yee sees Master holding Aunt May,

879
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:19,594
there'll be trouble

880
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:23,797
Fei Hung, it's fine, let's write to Aunt Yee
to tell her we're safe

881
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:25,927
Aunt Yee is enough,
how can he court Aunt May?

882
00:54:25,977 --> 00:54:29,018
Aunt Ching will come
next month... Oh my God!

883
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:30,797
What is it?
Who's there?

884
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:32,388
I want to comfort that lady

885
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:33,956
But you don't know her

886
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:36,191
So how can you comfort her?

887
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:37,491
If I don't comfort her,
how can I get to know her?

888
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,186
They are back! Come out!

889
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:49,557
Master, master

890
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:50,594
Are you all right?

891
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:53,532
I am fine

892
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:57,465
Of course, they can't
compete with master at all

893
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:00,777
How are you, sir!

894
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:02,084
I'm glad you're back

895
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,023
Old Master Wong, Master Wong

896
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,447
We were thinking of ways to save you all night

897
00:55:06,526 --> 00:55:09,487
Then we discovered
the Red Lantern Sect had visited

898
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:11,787
We've just sent someone to rescue you,
but you are back now

899
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,359
Sorry for worrying you

900
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:14,457
Time

901
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,451
Shit, it's started

902
00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:18,068
Master Wong

903
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:19,348
Your Excellency

904
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,876
General Guan has instructed us
that if we see you

905
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,396
we should ask you to go
to Tun Chau Square at once

906
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:25,966
The Dragons and the Lions are fighting now

907
00:55:27,647 --> 00:55:29,315
What?
The Lion King Competition is being held today?

908
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:32,545
Right, The Lion King Competition organized by
the 8 countries is being held today

909
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,175
Right, Master, it's today

910
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,880
Why are you so excited?

911
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:37,579
I thought you'd forgot

912
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:38,417
Think again!

913
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:39,522
Your Excellency,

914
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:40,162
please show me they way

915
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:40,726
Fine

916
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:44,396
Fei Hung

917
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,306
Aunt May

918
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:47,394
Brother-in-law,
let me go with you

919
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:50,363
If anything happened,
how could I explain it to your sister?

920
00:55:51,801 --> 00:55:53,166
Club Foot, follow me

921
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:54,899
Yes Master!

922
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:56,969
Ah Fu

923
00:55:59,074 --> 00:56:00,092
Why are you standing there?

924
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:00,648
Come on now!

925
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:15,798
So childish

926
00:56:17,379 --> 00:56:17,811
Childish

927
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:20,241
Bastard! What a copy cat

928
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,726
Our nine golden dragons

929
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:44,497
must stay alert

930
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,630
Under the bait,

931
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:49,332
there are machine guns

932
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:13,113
Nine Dragons set out

933
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,953
They are blocking our way,

934
00:57:28,993 --> 00:57:30,186
we've to find a way out

935
00:57:38,402 --> 00:57:39,698
Dragons in the sky

936
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:45,936
Dragons in the sky...

937
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:50,033
Dragons in the sky

938
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:55,904
The Yellow and the

939
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,939
Red Dragon are destroyed

940
00:57:56,983 --> 00:57:58,210
There are many enemies,

941
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,444
you'd better be more careful

942
00:57:59,652 --> 00:58:00,173
Got you!

943
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:02,237
Halt!

944
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:04,583
We are the competitors

945
00:58:04,622 --> 00:58:06,180
The competition had started,

946
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:06,692
leave now

947
00:58:09,413 --> 00:58:09,845
What did he say?

948
00:58:10,348 --> 00:58:11,690
He said the competition has started

949
00:58:11,727 --> 00:58:12,502
We are not allowed to go in

950
00:58:13,217 --> 00:58:14,011
How come!

951
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:18,649
Master, let me talk to him

952
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:19,802
Consider it carefully Fei Hung

953
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:20,811
Fu, Club Foot, let's go

954
00:58:21,324 --> 00:58:21,720
Forget about them,

955
00:58:21,757 --> 00:58:22,155
let's rush in

956
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:22,849
Fine

957
00:58:28,996 --> 00:58:30,962
Don't let them leave

958
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:41,805
They have gone that way

959
00:58:44,476 --> 00:58:46,171
Don't let them get away

960
00:58:58,351 --> 00:58:59,283
Ride on it's back

961
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:06,613
Be careful of it changing position

962
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,846
Catch the dragon head

963
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,368
Let me ride that horse

964
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:55,470
The dragon of the Blue Clan is in trouble

965
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:56,979
Take the wounded away

966
01:00:57,048 --> 01:00:57,603
Yes Sir!

967
01:00:58,882 --> 01:00:59,404
The great eagle is coming

968
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:08,085
White dragon, watch out!

969
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:22,788
Yellow dragon, be careful!

970
01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:29,695
Sir, the red dragon is trapped

971
01:01:39,147 --> 01:01:41,115
Close the gate, hurry up

972
01:01:41,482 --> 01:01:44,419
Prepare to fire weapons,
close the gate now

973
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:48,550
Close the gate

974
01:01:48,923 --> 01:01:50,721
Fei Hung, they are trying to close the gate

975
01:01:51,058 --> 01:01:51,886
They won't!

976
01:01:58,563 --> 01:01:59,995
Hurry up, they are chasing us

977
01:02:00,098 --> 01:02:01,326
Don't be afraid, I am here

978
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:12,291
Club Foot, you have no horse,
you can't catch up with us

979
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,331
Open it, quick

980
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:14,204
Yes!

981
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:15,971
Let's see who's faster

982
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,579
Damn you Clubfoot, how dare you
step on my shoulders?

983
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:28,018
They are shooting...
Get down!

984
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,912
Fei Hung, we've made it

985
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:35,703
Watch out, it's coming

986
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,553
Just our dragon is left

987
01:02:48,758 --> 01:02:50,556
His Excellency is in the middle

988
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:57,328
It's oil, let's escape

989
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:31,348
Hurry up

990
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:41,118
Sir

991
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,122
- Fei Hung
- Sir

992
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,053
Wong Fei Hung

993
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:54,620
You must take revenge... for me

994
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,259
Your Excellency...

995
01:04:03,804 --> 01:04:04,666
We were too late

996
01:04:05,205 --> 01:04:05,794
What a pity

997
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,062
Your Excellency...

998
01:04:10,474 --> 01:04:11,339
Your Excellency!

999
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:32,228
The officers from Tai Lei Temple
send their condolences

1000
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:40,765
The Officers from Shun Tin Office
send their condolences

1001
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:47,574
Sirs, thank you for your condolences

1002
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:53,842
His Excellency Li Hung Chang
sends his condolences

1003
01:05:03,322 --> 01:05:07,818
His Excellency send his condolences

1004
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:26,176
Wong Fei Hung sends his condolences

1005
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:21,136
A blood letter from Wong Fei Hung

1006
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:33,743
I am the Lion King of Ching Dynasty

1007
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:41,141
I was too late to participate
in the competition last time

1008
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:45,389
Now I am challenging
the lion kings of the 8 countries

1009
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:48,359
If you accept the challenge,

1010
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,416
I'll meet you in two days time
in the same square

1011
01:08:52,063 --> 01:08:54,585
Let destiny determine who will win or lose

1012
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,529
Wong Fei Hung

1013
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,934
Does Wong Fei Hung want to take
revenge for Guan Shing-tao?

1014
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:07,993
Fine, tell him that I will give him a chance...

1015
01:09:08,371 --> 01:09:09,598
To meet an even worse fate!

1016
01:09:38,059 --> 01:09:39,288
Brother Fu, how do I look?

1017
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:41,664
Fine, just look at Clubfoot

1018
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:42,717
so lady like

1019
01:09:43,963 --> 01:09:45,865
To be honest, I don't think so

1020
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:47,762
But I am afraid we'll be discovered by others

1021
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:48,863
Don't worry!

1022
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:50,090
If we are discovered,

1023
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:50,965
I'll handle it. Let's go

1024
01:09:56,473 --> 01:09:59,298
Sister Fu, what does your lady look like?

1025
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:01,306
She is like me, so lovely

1026
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:03,634
We're so well matched!

1027
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,086
Sister Yan, don't run off

1028
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:22,719
It doesn't matter,
we will go for our own targets later

1029
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:23,754
What for?

1030
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:25,781
To look for our own ladies

1031
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:26,615
That's big trouble

1032
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:27,995
This seems to be the road

1033
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:28,958
leading to the rented territory

1034
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:32,366
Who cares if it is or not?
Let's concentrate on the ladies!

1035
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,125
Let's go

1036
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,066
Master Chiu, why are you looking for me?

1037
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,725
I have heard that you are going to challenge
the lions of the 8 countries

1038
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:44,263
Our ancestors have left us something
to combat the "Powerful Fists"

1039
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,532
I asked the smith to repair it overnight

1040
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:49,460
I don't know whether it's useful to you or not

1041
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:55,571
The copper lion

1042
01:10:55,781 --> 01:10:56,302
Yes

1043
01:10:58,082 --> 01:11:00,309
It's made from 90 catties of copper

1044
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,183
Look at the craftsmanship in this lion head

1045
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,647
It is a work of art

1046
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:15,314
But our students can hardly handle it

1047
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:18,492
If it is useful to you in the competition,

1048
01:11:19,064 --> 01:11:22,223
Please take this as a present from our school

1049
01:11:22,401 --> 01:11:22,923
Master Chiu

1050
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:25,567
Please rise

1051
01:11:26,234 --> 01:11:31,099
Fei Hung, this lion head is much heavier
than normal lion heads

1052
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,300
It's not easy to handle

1053
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,232
Yes, but there are merits too

1054
01:11:39,078 --> 01:11:40,605
The lions of the 8 countries
are strong and powerful

1055
01:11:40,912 --> 01:11:44,604
It's useless to rely on our Kung fu against them

1056
01:11:45,248 --> 01:11:46,875
We should destroy them by tactics

1057
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:48,145
I agree with you

1058
01:11:48,385 --> 01:11:50,939
I would like to accompany you Master Wong

1059
01:11:51,448 --> 01:11:51,986
Master Chiu

1060
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:56,493
Father...

1061
01:11:57,597 --> 01:11:59,117
Father

1062
01:11:59,159 --> 01:11:59,886
The Red Lanterns are here

1063
01:12:00,493 --> 01:12:01,149
Red Lanterns?

1064
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:22,665
Listen, keep calm, keep calm

1065
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:27,061
It is not safe here, we'd better leave

1066
01:12:30,086 --> 01:12:30,486
Where are you going?

1067
01:12:30,524 --> 01:12:30,948
You devils!

1068
01:12:31,604 --> 01:12:32,841
Sister, let's chase the devils separately

1069
01:12:33,364 --> 01:12:34,260
The rest of you...

1070
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:35,193
Burn the church. Go

1071
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,294
Go, chase after the devils

1072
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:37,023
Yes!

1073
01:12:39,233 --> 01:12:39,892
It's on fire

1074
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,326
What? On fire?

1075
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:43,876
Where is on fire?

1076
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:46,475
It should be the East Alley

1077
01:12:46,815 --> 01:12:48,941
The church of Father Thomas is over there

1078
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:50,981
I have to take a look

1079
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:58,938
Fu

1080
01:12:59,817 --> 01:13:00,441
What's the matter?

1081
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:02,380
The Red Lantern ladies are burning and killing,
what'll we do?

1082
01:13:02,751 --> 01:13:03,612
Don't disclose our identities

1083
01:13:03,685 --> 01:13:04,651
Leave at once

1084
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:05,116
Freeze

1085
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:08,836
I know you are men posing as women

1086
01:13:10,605 --> 01:13:12,094
So, you've seen through our disguise

1087
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:14,131
Ladies, castrate them

1088
01:13:15,138 --> 01:13:16,002
We are in danger!

1089
01:13:16,038 --> 01:13:16,935
Let's run for our lives!

1090
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:21,330
Where are you going?

1091
01:13:21,974 --> 01:13:22,938
Club Foot, let's go separately

1092
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,267
So, whom should I go with?

1093
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,797
Kill them right here

1094
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:57,666
Wong Fei Hung?!

1095
01:13:58,438 --> 01:13:58,870
Go

1096
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,362
Why don't you go now?

1097
01:14:02,402 --> 01:14:03,267
Go now

1098
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,962
Oh... He asked us to go

1099
01:14:07,006 --> 01:14:07,593
This way is safe

1100
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:08,239
This way

1101
01:14:10,673 --> 01:14:13,067
May, you'd better stop searching
for Fei Hung with us

1102
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,725
Well, I will wait for you right here

1103
01:14:17,241 --> 01:14:19,142
Master Chiu, let's search for
Fei Hung separately

1104
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:19,610
Fine

1105
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:29,303
Go over there

1106
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:35,123
Sister, the foreigners are over there

1107
01:14:35,329 --> 01:14:36,514
Let's attack them from both sides

1108
01:14:36,564 --> 01:14:37,754
OK, follow me

1109
01:14:37,963 --> 01:14:38,430
Yes!

1110
01:14:41,331 --> 01:14:43,487
Father Thomas, are you all right?

1111
01:14:43,764 --> 01:14:44,731
Heaven have mercy

1112
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:46,926
My child, the Red Lanterns are after us,
run for your life!

1113
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:47,652
Go that way

1114
01:14:56,198 --> 01:14:56,688
It's you?!

1115
01:14:57,697 --> 01:14:58,424
Yes, it's me

1116
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,525
What bad luck!

1117
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:03,924
Father, you are here!

1118
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:05,721
It's you

1119
01:15:08,902 --> 01:15:09,830
Go over there.

1120
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:10,834
Let me fight with them

1121
01:15:12,569 --> 01:15:13,032
Go!

1122
01:15:13,233 --> 01:15:14,130
Yes, Senior

1123
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:19,058
Ladies, no massacre please,
they're innocent!

1124
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:20,567
If you want to kill, kill me first

1125
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,231
Get lost,

1126
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,131
you have no say here

1127
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,191
Catch them and kill them right here

1128
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:27,966
Yes

1129
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:28,524
Let's run for our lives

1130
01:15:28,872 --> 01:15:29,495
I'll kill the woman,

1131
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:30,196
you take the foreigners!

1132
01:15:31,138 --> 01:15:31,968
Sister, stop!

1133
01:15:34,305 --> 01:15:34,805
Father

1134
01:15:36,906 --> 01:15:37,373
You!

1135
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:41,561
Kill the devils!

1136
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:43,394
Sister

1137
01:15:49,573 --> 01:15:50,597
He saved me once

1138
01:15:52,522 --> 01:15:53,713
You liar!

1139
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:54,914
You are the betrayer!

1140
01:15:55,654 --> 01:15:57,879
When Wong Fei Hung came to our hall,

1141
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,977
I started to suspect you

1142
01:15:59,557 --> 01:16:00,945
Now, I'm proved right!

1143
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:03,083
You are not qualified to hold
this Anti-foreigner's Flag

1144
01:16:06,222 --> 01:16:06,653
Shoot!

1145
01:16:20,856 --> 01:16:21,787
Senior!

1146
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:25,122
She deserved it,

1147
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,021
God will punish her

1148
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:29,790
Miss

1149
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:32,361
Let's go

1150
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:36,757
Get lost, forget about me

1151
01:16:43,426 --> 01:16:45,914
Don't leave me alone!

1152
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:47,588
I didn't betray you

1153
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:04,488
Die bitch!

1154
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:08,927
Let's see your magic now!

1155
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:15,496
Miss

1156
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:17,529
Stop!

1157
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:23,760
Help!

1158
01:17:26,903 --> 01:17:27,423
Fei Hung?!

1159
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:30,261
Take her away

1160
01:17:52,308 --> 01:17:53,137
Prepare to fire!

1161
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:01,719
You are hurt, why do you still want to fight?

1162
01:18:03,154 --> 01:18:04,050
Don't go!

1163
01:18:05,089 --> 01:18:06,676
Move her over there

1164
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:10,245
She's been hurt.

1165
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:10,839
She must be cold

1166
01:18:11,418 --> 01:18:12,746
Use this to cover her

1167
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:42,729
It's dark! I can't see anything

1168
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,131
What a fate!

1169
01:18:48,332 --> 01:18:49,161
Where is Wong Fei Hung?

1170
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:50,354
Fei Hung...

1171
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:50,988
Where is he?

1172
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:53,324
He is here

1173
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:59,032
You're not him!

1174
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,397
I'd never have believed

1175
01:19:02,441 --> 01:19:04,496
I'd die saving the devils!

1176
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:06,334
It's my punishment!

1177
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,831
I may die in peace now

1178
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:18,899
Wong Fei Hung, at last, you've come

1179
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,808
Brother Fu, let's go

1180
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:46,347
Brother Fu, the Holy Mother is coming

1181
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:51,101
Brother Club Foot,
come and save us!

1182
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:52,207
Go to hell

1183
01:19:56,781 --> 01:19:57,630
Stay where you are!

1184
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:58,478
I want to punish you

1185
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,040
Club Foot, are you all right?

1186
01:20:01,111 --> 01:20:01,613
I'm fine

1187
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:03,476
Take aim!

1188
01:20:05,108 --> 01:20:05,870
The symbol of heresy!

1189
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:21,933
Should we save her?

1190
01:20:22,665 --> 01:20:23,290
How?

1191
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:24,860
We are wearing the uniforms

1192
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:26,486
If we go out like this,
we will be shot at

1193
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:37,679
I'm Goddess Lotus,
the spirit resides in me

1194
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,778
I'm invincible!

1195
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,181
How dare you offend me!

1196
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:45,078
I've to punish you on behalf of God

1197
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:47,249
I'll send you to hell!

1198
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:48,945
To tear your skin off!

1199
01:20:48,988 --> 01:20:50,249
To break your bones!

1200
01:20:50,552 --> 01:20:51,676
You bastards!

1201
01:21:05,546 --> 01:21:06,136
Let's go

1202
01:21:07,379 --> 01:21:08,071
Master

1203
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:09,404
The three of you, stay where you are

1204
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:12,937
Club Foot? Ah Fu? Ah Yan?

1205
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:14,668
Why are you dressed like this?

1206
01:21:15,384 --> 01:21:16,346
Are you going to be opera actors?

1207
01:21:17,781 --> 01:21:18,351
You had it coming!

1208
01:21:19,803 --> 01:21:25,495
Holy Mother...

1209
01:21:30,497 --> 01:21:32,158
Don't cry, tears can't help

1210
01:21:32,998 --> 01:21:34,894
Right, Holy Mother hasn't passed away,

1211
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,794
she is living in our hearts

1212
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:38,627
Let's take an oath, we should

1213
01:21:38,663 --> 01:21:41,583
carry on the mission
of killing the foreigners!

1214
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:46,589
Kill the foreigners,

1215
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,486
save our beloved country!

1216
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,111
This bait could hurt us anytime

1217
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:39,582
If the opposite side use fire.

1218
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:42,984
Getting the bait is less important
than beating their lions

1219
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,146
Let's attack them remember

1220
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:46,150
Yes, Master

1221
01:22:47,318 --> 01:22:47,943
Music!

1222
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:34,134
The lions roar!

1223
01:23:54,174 --> 01:23:55,661
Each lion attack a monster

1224
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:56,342
Yes!

1225
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:00,035
"One step to the sky"!

1226
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:07,790
Stop turning!

1227
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:08,662
We can't turn

1228
01:24:09,136 --> 01:24:10,725
"Magic Turn"!

1229
01:24:15,147 --> 01:24:17,139
I want you to "turn round and round"

1230
01:24:22,544 --> 01:24:24,629
Old Master Wong,
I can't identify the flag in the front

1231
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:25,667
It's so messy,
I can't identify either

1232
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:26,827
Forget the flags,
let's recognise their face

1233
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:39,195
Should we beat this one?

1234
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:39,964
No, not this...

1235
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:50,476
Club Foot, hold this for me

1236
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,178
I feel better having no lion head

1237
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,144
But, how am I going to handle
two lion heads?

1238
01:24:56,218 --> 01:24:57,943
You are abnormal anyway

1239
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,435
They may be scared of you
holding two lion heads!

1240
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:01,939
That's it

1241
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:06,671
It's our turn!

1242
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:07,182
All right!

1243
01:25:12,411 --> 01:25:13,535
"Swinging lion tail"!

1244
01:26:05,644 --> 01:26:06,472
Come on...

1245
01:26:06,811 --> 01:26:08,104
Fu, what are you doing?

1246
01:26:08,242 --> 01:26:09,034
You should be careful!

1247
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,168
"Tiger jump"!

1248
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,165
Come on...

1249
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:38,934
Why has it gone dark?

1250
01:27:16,789 --> 01:27:17,515
Where am I?

1251
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,166
Who are you?

1252
01:27:24,343 --> 01:27:25,701
Big head Buddha,
don't you recognise me?

1253
01:27:25,743 --> 01:27:27,071
Let me show you

1254
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:36,035
Some more!

1255
01:28:00,495 --> 01:28:01,460
You want to fire?

1256
01:28:01,497 --> 01:28:02,553
Not that easy!

1257
01:28:06,918 --> 01:28:07,818
Here comes a cookie!

1258
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,449
This one is even better,
I'll leave it with you

1259
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:43,414
Let's help old Master

1260
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:46,516
Attack!

1261
01:29:18,404 --> 01:29:19,334
Master Chiu, watch out!

1262
01:29:23,068 --> 01:29:23,829
Catch the lion tail

1263
01:30:42,921 --> 01:30:43,816
So you are scared away?

1264
01:30:44,553 --> 01:30:45,448
Brother Fu, look out behind!

1265
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,136
How dare you scare me?!

1266
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:02,805
The sun will soon go down

1267
01:31:02,843 --> 01:31:03,969
behind The Forbidden City

1268
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,140
History will be re-written

1269
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:09,263
We'll see who is going to be the winner

1270
01:31:37,645 --> 01:31:38,804
Throw the burning lion heads up here

1271
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:39,842
Yes!

1272
01:31:53,719 --> 01:31:54,707
The bait?!

1273
01:32:05,148 --> 01:32:05,975
Ah Yan

1274
01:32:06,582 --> 01:32:07,205
Ah Yan!

1275
01:32:15,276 --> 01:32:15,933
Take cover!

1276
01:32:19,572 --> 01:32:22,197
My ass is shot! Take me out!

1277
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:24,561
Go!

1278
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:26,629
Club Foot, come over here, be quick!

1279
01:32:33,168 --> 01:32:35,298
Master, let me send you up there

1280
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:44,094
General, leave here quickly

1281
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:54,534
We won

1282
01:32:57,936 --> 01:32:58,662
General Henlintak

1283
01:33:03,799 --> 01:33:05,758
Good news

1284
01:33:05,797 --> 01:33:10,229
Long live Germany!

1285
01:33:10,264 --> 01:33:12,594
Long live America!

1286
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,113
What has happened?

1287
01:33:21,426 --> 01:33:22,356
Why are they so cheerful?

1288
01:33:22,893 --> 01:33:24,905
Bull shit, they are celebrating for us

1289
01:33:25,456 --> 01:33:26,575
It's bull shit indeed!
Let's go and take a look

1290
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:38,114
I can't see them, move forward

1291
01:33:38,172 --> 01:33:39,033
Move forward

1292
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:39,524
Yes

1293
01:33:51,723 --> 01:33:52,153
Fei Hung

1294
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:53,929
Sir, why are you dressed like that?

1295
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,645
The allied troops of the 8 foreign countries have
marched into the Forbidden City

1296
01:33:56,747 --> 01:33:57,768
The Empress Dowager has surrendered

1297
01:34:02,057 --> 01:34:03,421
Master Wong, let's go

1298
01:34:05,493 --> 01:34:06,080
Let's go!

1299
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:14,423
Although we won this competition,
we lost our country!

1300
01:34:24,337 --> 01:34:24,981
Henlintak

1301
01:34:27,705 --> 01:34:30,634
General, go to the celebration now,
let us handle Wong Fei Hung

1302
01:34:32,741 --> 01:34:33,328
Wait for me

1303
01:34:34,374 --> 01:34:34,864
Fei Hong

1304
01:34:51,535 --> 01:34:52,363
Henlintak!

1305
01:34:56,705 --> 01:34:58,194
Get lost, don't block my way

1306
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,112
Wong Fei Hung

1307
01:35:28,691 --> 01:35:29,191
I am here

1308
01:35:46,462 --> 01:35:46,927
Hurry up

1309
01:35:58,531 --> 01:36:01,395
Don't go. Protect the General

1310
01:36:09,934 --> 01:36:10,727
What's happening?

1311
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:17,498
Henlintak, get down!

1312
01:37:25,601 --> 01:37:26,464
Lui, protect the general

1313
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:30,636
Henlintak!

1314
01:37:30,848 --> 01:37:31,471
Wong Fei Hung!

1315
01:37:32,114 --> 01:37:32,604
Master!

1316
01:37:33,717 --> 01:37:35,183
Let me handle this

1317
01:37:38,384 --> 01:37:38,905
Go down

1318
01:37:45,687 --> 01:37:46,174
Club Foot!

1319
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:50,120
Try my kick!

1320
01:37:55,163 --> 01:37:55,629
Club Foot!

1321
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:01,353
Watch out!

1322
01:38:06,225 --> 01:38:07,399
General

1323
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:10,921
Do you wanna escape

1324
01:38:12,965 --> 01:38:13,485
Do you want to cuff me?

1325
01:38:13,535 --> 01:38:14,191
Watch my kick

1326
01:38:19,945 --> 01:38:21,813
Club Foot,
I'm going to kill you

1327
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:22,376
Not that easy

1328
01:38:22,412 --> 01:38:24,270
Try my "Scissors kick"!

1329
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:39,937
Henlintak!

1330
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,573
Strike!

1331
01:39:00,943 --> 01:39:01,500
You had it coming!

1332
01:39:04,678 --> 01:39:05,336
Lui

1333
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,101
Master

1334
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:07,241
Club Foot, let me handle it!

1335
01:39:07,544 --> 01:39:08,101
Master, let me handle it!

1336
01:39:09,146 --> 01:39:09,650
Strike!

1337
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:13,468
Eat dirt!

1338
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,531
I wanna break your leg!

1339
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:29,952
Go and protect the general

1340
01:39:30,303 --> 01:39:30,823
Go

1341
01:39:34,503 --> 01:39:35,024
Wanna escape?

1342
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:36,001
Club Foot they have guns!

1343
01:39:36,038 --> 01:39:36,538
Fire

1344
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:37,511
Let's go!

1345
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:49,169
Master,

1346
01:39:49,206 --> 01:39:50,102
shall we let them escape?

1347
01:39:51,575 --> 01:39:53,596
We can't change anything
by killing him

1348
01:39:56,854 --> 01:39:57,412
Let's go

1349
01:39:58,545 --> 01:39:59,275
Master!

1350
01:39:59,281 --> 01:39:59,588
Master

1351
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,000
Are you seriously hurt?

1352
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:01,600
No!

1353
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:02,250
Fei Hung

1354
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,000
Brother

1355
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,000
It's dangerous here, we'd better leave

1356
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Dad, let's go back to the South

1357
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,200
Yes. Our capital is occupied.

1358
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,000
We should go back and prepare to retaliate

1359
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:18,318
OK, let's go back to the South, now

1360
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,000
Get in

1361
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,664
I can't sit down!
My ass hurts!

1362
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:22,500
Lie down then
