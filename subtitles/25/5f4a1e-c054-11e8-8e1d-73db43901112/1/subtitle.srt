1
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,836
- Be careful, brother.
- I will.

2
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,631
It's here so much of the time,
it'll come back by itself.

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,632
It's only on loan -
we will win it back.

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,597
Why aren't you working?

5
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,597
- I am working!
- Get to it!

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,070
(Referring to the custom of lion
blessing audience with the greens.)

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,993
Not great, won't eat.
Not great, won't eat.

8
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,433
Great, great, will eat!

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,036
- Is it prepared?
- Yes.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,117
- Have the costumes arrived?
- They're coming later.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,236
Master, Mrs. Hoi has arrived!

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,753
Of course I'm here on time!

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,391
Mrs. Hoi!

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,833
Thank you very much!

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,319
These are the costumes -
hurry up if you want to look good.

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,958
Don't get them mixed up.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,394
Each is responsible for his own.
You as well.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,436
- Brother!
- I'm coming!

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,390
Yours is here, Keung!

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,633
Brother!

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,233
Brother!

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,719
Brother!

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,796
- Are you all right?
- My leg hurts.

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,438
Who put the bucket here?

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,078
- It was Orphan Boy!
- Me?

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,230
- Help me up!
- Get him up.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,513
You sit down!

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,751
If it's not this, it's that.
You were to be the lion's head.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,274
Without Keung as the lion's head,
we'll lose.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,999
Can't anyone else do it? I can.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,230
- I'm better than you.
- Shut up.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,712
Someone else will have to be
the lion's head.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,711
- Brother...
- I'm not up to it.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,234
Of course you're not.

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,673
Lung, you'll do it.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,638
- Orphan Boy is no good.
- If he can't, I will.

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,278
- I'd do it!
- You?

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,713
Quiet!

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,789
Ready the lion!

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,360
Fellow villagers, last year was
peaceful and the weather was good.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,749
And not breaking with tradition,

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,879
this year we will again have
the Greens of Peace.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,669
Ching-fung and Wai-yee
martial arts schools will compete,

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,309
to see which of them will bring us
another year of peace.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,392
- Wow, it's big!
- What kind of greens are they?

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,833
- A green face.
- What?

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,878
My face will turn green
if I have to do it.

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,876
This isn't a joke.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,036
Wow. That's good.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,631
This is great.

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,316
He's good.

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,757
The lion has great energy.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,513
That's not Wai-yee style.
Lung, you're the head,

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,716
Chan, you take the tail.

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,715
Everyone get ready.
Get in your positions.

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,751
Official Bookmaker

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,792
- Which one?
- Black.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,672
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,399
- What are the odds?
- Black is 20-1,

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,552
- For gold, $1 pays 5 cents.
- Just 5 cents?

61
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,079
The golden lion is going to win and
if everyone backs it, I'll be broke.

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,197
- Betting slips costs money.
- I'm backing the black lion.

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,276
Queue up there.

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,433
What, black?
No need to queue then.

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,313
It's brilliant!

66
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,118
Come on! Jump across.

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,236
- Brave enough to jump?
- Yes.

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,152
Let's see how they do it.

69
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,596
Go up!

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,956
Don't let them get up!

71
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,516
Don't let them get up!

72
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,953
Good. Well done!

73
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,033
Push!

74
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,753
The belt, Chan.

75
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,031
- Is it on, Chan?
- It's on.

76
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,076
I'm going down.

77
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,679
- Big Brother!
- Don't talk. Take it if you can.

78
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,352
Big Brother, you...

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,636
Bring me up.

80
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,039
Don't let go!

81
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,436
Why are you doing this, Big Brother?

82
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,114
Right now, I'm not your brother!

83
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,316
Get it if you can.

84
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,755
You're making it hard for me.

85
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,477
Hang on. Don't fall off!

86
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,755
- Hold him!
- Quiet. Get the greens.

87
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,633
Go on!

88
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,230
Useless! He's rubbish.

89
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,272
Bravo, well done!

90
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,191
We won! We won!

91
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,832
Brother Bill danced our lion
magnificently.

92
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,395
Stop talking and get the prize.

93
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,156
Clear up and go.

94
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,036
Aren't you down yet?

95
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,196
I've won my bet.

96
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,718
You're useless.
You lost me my money.

97
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,989
I'm the black lion,
you be the golden one.

98
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,195
Come on.

99
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,510
You count it. It's all there.

100
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,876
It gets easier after the first time.

101
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,159
- You'll have to help us out again.
- But they'll find out.

102
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,232
So what? Join us
and we'll make you an instructor.

103
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,038
Think about it.

104
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,076
I'll think about it.

105
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,716
Who won, Master?

106
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,398
M-M-Mas..

107
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,793
So we lost. Why the long faces?

108
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,395
Go and practise!

109
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,639
Ah-Lung!

110
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,079
You couldn't hold onto
the lion's head.

111
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,352
Lift the table one hundred times
to strengthen your arms.

112
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,517
Watch the water,
you're getting it everywhere.

113
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,798
- Over here.
- Wipe mine down, would you?

114
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,792
Wipe yours?
Who's going to wipe mine?

115
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,916
Don't be so lazy.

116
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,910
- Wipe it yourself!
- Be quick.

117
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,958
Watch out - you're splashing me.

118
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,271
What! That again?

119
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,316
Do as you are told to.

120
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,552
- Hey.
- Over there.

121
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,070
I know, into that room.
It's not my first time.

122
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,958
Not so loud.
Master has just fallen asleep.

123
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,398
If you don't want people to know,
you shouldn't go looking for whores.

124
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,992
Here I am, naughty one.

125
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,277
- Big Brother
- What?

126
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,476
- Her again?
- Get out.

127
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,675
- Don't be long.
- I know. Go away.

128
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,431
Come and play with me.

129
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,590
Get up, fat pig.

130
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,196
The Master's coming.

131
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,913
Master.

132
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,992
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. It's cooler in here.

133
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,435
- Cooler in here?
- Yes.

134
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,312
- Do you want to suffocate me?
- Of course not.

135
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,038
You're copping a feel!

136
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,993
Master, I won't do it again.

137
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,230
This is again!

138
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,191
- Get off me!
- Get out!

139
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,753
This is a martial arts school,
not a brothel. Get out!

140
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,559
I'm going. There's nothing
to stay here for anyway.

141
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,116
Haven't you ever seen a woman before?

142
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,391
Give me your belt.

143
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,277
Wai-yee School?
Why are they giving you money?

144
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,920
- Explain.
- I...

145
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,153
Tell me! What have you done?

146
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,593
Tell me!

147
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,275
Give it to me! Give it to me!

148
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,753
Keung?

149
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,873
Keung!

150
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,269
Why is Wai-yee School giving you
money? What have you done?

151
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,432
Didn't he tell you that
I did their lion dance?

152
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,478
I've said nothing! Big Brother, he..

153
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,913
You get out!

154
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,558
- Big Brother!
- Get out!

155
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,113
Get out!

156
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,078
Master!

157
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,111
You still call me Master?

158
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,919
You'd bite the hand that feeds you?
You betrayed us.

159
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,788
Do you remember when you and Lung
were children and parentless?

160
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,632
Fighting stray dogs for food.

161
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,280
Dirty and muddy all over.

162
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,158
Who brought you back here?

163
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,360
For the last ten years, I have raised
both of you like my own sons,

164
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,955
giving you a good education,
and have I asked for a penny?

165
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,072
You lion-danced
for someone else for money!

166
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,151
Why did you do that?

167
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,552
Ah-lung isn't good enough.
This school was counting on you.

168
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,710
Did you want
to give me a heart attack?

169
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,509
- I knew he'd betray us.
- He'll be the death of the Master.

170
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,513
Tell me!

171
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,953
Leave!

172
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,393
Tell me!

173
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,837
Don't say any more. You treat me well
and I've wronged you.

174
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,831
I am leaving!

175
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,195
- Big Brother...
- Don't obstruct me!

176
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,753
Master.

177
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,590
Big Brother! Don't!

178
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,478
If you leave now,
don't ever come back!

179
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,918
Big Brother!

180
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,879
I heard the boss will be up
for sentencing in two days.

181
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,436
If we don't do it now,
we may not get another chance.

182
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,833
It isn't that easy!
Just the two of you. It'll be risky.

183
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,789
Two of us is enough.

184
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,155
The police only care about their pay.

185
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,391
They can't be bothered to train.
They can't beat us.

186
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,520
But Master Kim is in their hands?

187
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,034
He was drunk when he was caught.

188
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,750
Otherwise, even with ten more,
they couldn't take him!

189
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,071
Even so, we should plan
before we act.

190
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,232
You're up early, Uncle.
Have you had breakfast?

191
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,470
Breakfast? Not yet.

192
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,710
- Shall we go together?
- OK.

193
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,637
You? Come to learn Kung fu?

194
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,913
I'm here to see Uncle.

195
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,515
You want to see him?
He wants to see you, Uncle.

196
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,117
Why are you here?
I've paid you for the lion dance.

197
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,316
You want payment for next year too?

198
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,836
No. You said I could be
an instructor here.

199
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,876
That was yesterday.

200
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,269
Now, I've got two more brothers.

201
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,716
If your school lacks teachers,
please hire my brother.

202
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,157
- You tricked me!
- Good morning, Uncle.

203
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,471
Look at you. You haven't
done your button yet.

204
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,312
Why is he here, Uncle?

205
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,678
He wants us to take him in.
But we can't feed him!

206
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,791
I really didn't know that it was you
who lion-danced for us.

207
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,677
I do feel a bit guilty

208
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,548
but if we take you in,
your Master may get the wrong idea.

209
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,279
He's kicked you out because of this.

210
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,558
What if I tried to talk to him
and asked him to take you back?

211
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,553
No need. I'm sure I'll find someone
who will take me.

212
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,393
Stop right there.

213
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,272
What do you want?

214
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,355
I've got a way for you
to make some money.

215
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,590
You just have to be brave enough.

216
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,353
What choice do I have now?
Tell me.

217
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,270
There's no seats inside, Master.
Please wait here.

218
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,637
- Make way!
- Hi, Chung.

219
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,319
You're early, Master Kim!
Waiting for a place?

220
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,630
Your place is reserved,
Brother Bill.

221
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,948
Wait patiently then!

222
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,112
Morning, Uncle.
There's a place over there, Sam.

223
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,679
Good morning, Master Kim.
Having breakfast with your students?

224
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,910
Sorry.

225
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,112
- The bill, waiter.
- Coming.

226
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,919
- A place.
- Are you going? Three and six.

227
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,673
Thank you.

228
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,753
Thank you.

229
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,038
Yesterday your lion dance
was excellent, Brother Bill!

230
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,558
I am Big Cannon Bill. Watching
my lion dance is always a thrill.

231
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,315
Only because my Big Brother
helped you.

232
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,398
You can't even feed your students.
Anyone with sense would leave.

233
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,998
Look at us. We always have so much
to eat. Nobody will ever leave.

234
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,397
Let Big Cannon Bill give you
a roast pork bun.

235
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,676
Look at him!
He must have been starved!

236
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,953
- That took guts.
- Hit him.

237
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,153
Stab. Stab. Stab.

238
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,233
Stab this.

239
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,316
How do you like my punches?

240
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,919
Don't mess around any more, Brother
Bill. Look! The Master is angry.

241
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,437
He's still a Master.

242
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,596
We're going!

243
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,309
You haven't settled
your bill yet, Master.

244
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,279
- We haven't even ordered.
- Service is double with no order.

245
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,397
Thank you so much, Master!

246
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,235
Master!

247
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,119
You finished breakfast so quickly?

248
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,437
- What happened?
- It's all his fault!

249
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,798
I got beaten up because
he lost the lion dance to them.

250
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,233
Who's that?

251
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,718
Your useless Kung fu is
no good to anyone!

252
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,995
Your useless Kung fu
is no good to anyone!

253
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,232
We'll show him our Kung fu!

254
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,992
Leave me out of it.

255
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,436
- Why don't you do it now?
- We'll show him!

256
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,873
Come back!

257
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,191
Haven't we been shamed enough?

258
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,113
Home now!

259
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,232
Didn't you hear
what the Master said? Move!

260
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,958
Let's go, brothers.

261
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,749
Your Kung fu training isn't complete
and you want to cause trouble?

262
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,115
You've ruined my reputation.

263
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,191
They started it!

264
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,590
- If our Big Brother was here then...
- Silence!

265
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,716
All I hear is Big Brother,
Big Brother!

266
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,349
Was it just him I taught Kung fu
and not the rest of you?

267
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,474
What was that rubbish you were doing?
Show it to me again!

268
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,713
Go on!

269
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,919
Now!

270
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,630
Punch... Leopard...

271
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,756
Leopard? What else?

272
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,035
- Hang...
- Hang? Hang?

273
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,680
Is that what I taught you?
What else!

274
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,113
Continue!

275
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,599
Stab... stab... stab.

276
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,800
Stab? When did I teach you
to stab like that? What else?

277
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,793
- Horse...
- Horse? Haven't you learnt anything?

278
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,271
Everything you have learnt is
useless. It's all useless.

279
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,954
Get up. Get up now.

280
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,035
What did I do in a previous life
to deserve being your Master now?

281
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,471
Not one of you is good!

282
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,916
If you're not wasters,
you're traitors!

283
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,072
He lion-danced for someone else
for money,

284
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,869
using the Kung fu that I taught him
and bringing me shame,

285
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,192
completely ruining the reputation
of our Ching-fung School.

286
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,840
Even at breakfast, we were insulted.

287
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,755
What else have you done
to shame me?

288
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,796
Stop crying!

289
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,873
You!

290
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,356
Have you practised your Kung fu?
Fat as a pig!

291
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,750
And you! You're the youngest
and the naughtiest!

292
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,149
I haven't hit you and you're crying!

293
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,873
- Master.
- Is this how you do up a belt?

294
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,875
Did I teach you
to tie it up like this? Tell me!

295
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,951
You make me so angry!

296
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,235
Why are you still crying? Shut up!

297
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,478
Master! You can't blame us, Master!

298
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,835
It's the fault of those orphans.

299
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,632
They betrayed us! It's not our fault!

300
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,233
Silence!

301
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,874
Talk back at me?
How dare you talk back at me!

302
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,916
I haven't even punished you.

303
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,877
That's enough!

304
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,316
Because of that prize
you banished our Big Brother.

305
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,598
Now, you take your anger out on us.
What are we to you?

306
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,396
It's true that Big Brother and I
are orphans.

307
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,790
We've lived off you
and not paid you a penny.

308
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,518
And so useless!
If you need to hit someone, hit me!

309
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,636
I've got thicker skin!

310
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,112
I know you hate me the most, Master.
You're not even bothering to beat me!

311
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,352
If you don't punish me now,
you will not get the chance again.

312
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,916
I know that if you didn't take us in,

313
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,117
Big Brother and I would have starved
to death a long time ago.

314
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,475
I wouldn't be alive to shame you,

315
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,109
Big Brother wouldn't have lion-danced
for someone else!

316
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,991
And no one would have looked down
on us and called us orphans.

317
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,717
Now I understand
why Big Brother had to leave.

318
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,272
How can a man live in a place
where he is not respected?

319
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,594
Master, Big Brother left
in too much haste.

320
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,196
He didn't have time to tell you,
so I'll speak for him.

321
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,671
Thank you for teaching and caring
for us for all these years.

322
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,833
- I am leaving now.
- Where are you going?

323
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,476
If Big Brother hasn't starved
to death, I will go to him.

324
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,152
Stand there!

325
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,592
Then go and find him.

326
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,191
Bring Big Brother back home.

327
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,838
When did our Wai-yee School
turn into a refugee shelter?

328
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,195
So many refugees have come here!

329
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,837
Don't be like that! We're all human -
we all eat the same food.

330
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,790
Wai-yee School eats well. You lot
are just on three meals a day.

331
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,316
How can we eat the same food?
You are just a mouse.

332
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,949
- Brother Bill...
- Don't bother!

333
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,031
- I only want..
- Save your breath!

334
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,554
I've waited too long
for those bastards to go.

335
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,598
It's my time for glory. Don't stand
in the way of me getting rich.

336
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,477
- But...
- Leave.

337
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,870
Leave Orphan Boy.

338
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,355
You don't have to wound me
with words.

339
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,919
Wound you with words?

340
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,833
If you don't go
I'll wound you with my fists.

341
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,316
- Brother Bill! Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

342
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,916
For a big guy,
you don't stand firm.

343
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,276
Where were you when your teacher
told you to practise?

344
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,716
Call the proprietor.

345
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,870
- You sure you aren't hurt?
- I'm fine.

346
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,030
Say someone is causing trouble.

347
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,076
Why don't you have a lie-down?

348
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,838
You're so fat you can't spring up.

349
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,836
Stop fighting. Don't hit him.

350
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,990
You were lucky.

351
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,556
Enough, brother, no more fighting!

352
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,189
It's him who was hitting me
from the start. You tell him.

353
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,113
- Why did you come here?
- I came to see if my brother's here.

354
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,954
He came and he even asked me
to take him in, but I didn't.

355
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,191
And I thought
you came to steal my job.

356
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,474
Everyone, I'm sorry for the trouble.
I'm sorry Brother Bill.

357
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,190
It's over now, we can go back in.

358
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,876
They're coming.

359
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,273
Halt!

360
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,713
Get ready!

361
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,673
I want him.

362
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,273
Attack!

363
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,753
Boss.

364
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,870
How are you, Boss?

365
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,315
- Who is he?
- He's one of us.

366
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,511
- Boss?
- Let's go.

367
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,639
Quick - report that
we have been attacked.

368
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,917
- What if they ask who by?
- Tell them it was White Fan.

369
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,155
Thank you.

370
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,151
Have a look.

371
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,708
Have you seen a man
carrying a fan like this?

372
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,917
If he had any money,
I might have noticed him.

373
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,468
You're just a nuisance, so piss off.

374
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,709
Go!

375
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,915
Take a look.

376
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,592
Get out of here!

377
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,079
Please take a look.

378
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,675
Isn't that the White Fan?

379
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,228
- It doesn't look like him.
- Look closely.

380
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,999
- He looks similar.
- No, he doesn't.

381
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,915
The police sketch artists never
get it right. We could get a reward.

382
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,635
Go and get some back up
and I'll follow him. Hurry.

383
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,391
He's inside. Follow me.

384
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,677
- He's not here!
- Yeah!

385
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,194
He was here praying -
where has he gone?

386
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,271
Holy Bhudda...

387
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,155
Are you looking for me?

388
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,392
Five police officers.
What seems to be the problem?

389
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,359
White Fan, you've been caught
and you're still lippy.

390
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,317
You're coming with me.

391
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,279
Hang on, Officer, are you sure
you've got the right guy?

392
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,431
My eyes are never wrong.

393
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,512
I suppose the transport was attacked
by your Big Brother!

394
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,556
Arrest him.

395
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,358
Attack! Give me your sword.

396
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,399
- Are you hurt?
- No. Give me a sword.

397
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,272
Thank you.

398
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,596
How dare you slash at the God of War!

399
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,355
- We apologise.
- We don't believe in the spirits.

400
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,319
Get him.

401
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,834
You don't believe in the spirits?
I'll send you to meet them.

402
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,593
Are you frightened?
It's just cut your belt.

403
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,229
Oh, yes. I didn't believe before,
but now I do.

404
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,392
If you believe, go and pray.

405
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,233
- Give me the sword.
- You're still attacking?

406
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,032
Are you scared of the cross?

407
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,518
Are you OK, Sergeant?

408
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,670
The Sergeant is fine. Attack!

409
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,431
Are you going, Sergeant?

410
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,909
- Give me a sword.
- You've had all of them.

411
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,151
It's not going well.
You stay here and I'll get Sam Kung.

412
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,310
You stay here and I'll get Sam Kung.

413
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,070
You go to the station
and I'll go to his house.

414
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,953
Sam Kung, open up!
Sam Kung, open up!

415
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,396
Fourth Brother, is Sam Kung here?

416
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,435
Hey, Fourth Brother!

417
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,988
Answer him, will you?
You're not deaf.

418
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,435
What is the matter?

419
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,229
Me and my colleagues have arrested
the White Fan.

420
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,199
The White Fan?

421
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,955
Yes. So I've come for Sam Kung
so he can get a statement from him.

422
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,508
My father is already at
the police station.

423
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,353
What? Sam Kung is not here!

424
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,193
Oh, no.
Who's going to take the statement?

425
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,998
It's only a statement,

426
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,356
as you've arrested him,
take him back to the police station.

427
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,950
But he won't come with us.

428
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,070
- Let me help you out.
- How? The fight's over.

429
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,311
They don't need you to fight.

430
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,915
There'll be a sequel when I arrive.
Let's get going.

431
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,638
Wait until Dad finds out.

432
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,473
If you don't tell him,
he won't find out.

433
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,558
- He's over there, Fourth Brother.
- Get over there.

434
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,155
He doesn't like me.
You go over there.

435
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,233
Sorry.

436
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
What's the problem?
You go first then.

437
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,355
What are you trying to do?

438
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,317
Why are you picking on me?

439
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,358
I don't know even know who you are.
Give me back my bag.

440
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,516
Trying to rob me?

441
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,990
You can't rob me that easily.

442
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,313
Who are you?

443
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,556
I can't be bothered with this.

444
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,271
I didn't realise you stance was
so solid, Fourth Brother.

445
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,079
With your good stance
and my good eyes,

446
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,071
the 200 big ones will be ours.

447
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,913
- Where is he?
- I saw him go that way.

448
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,558
Why didn't you say?

449
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,113
Can I get a cup of tea, Uncle?

450
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,668
- Please, don't hesitate.
- Thank you.

451
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,634
- Sit.
- Thank you.

452
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,030
You're drenched in sweat.

453
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,390
I've had a very bad day.

454
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,270
Some bloke just crept up and
attacked me without saying a word!

455
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,716
And there's a corrupt policeman
who's trying to stitch me up.

456
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,555
Luckily, I got away
or I wouldn't be sitting here.

457
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,189
Your pipe is so unusual.
Can I have a look at it?

458
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,316
By all means - take a look.

459
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,915
Look at it closely, otherwise
you won't get the chance again.

460
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,393
- From the Emperor!
- It's not any old tat!

461
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,357
It's an antique.

462
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,755
That is such a big fan.
Can I have a look?

463
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,195
You definitely know your stuff.

464
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,195
- It has Ming inscriptions on it.
- Gold lettering on a white fan.

465
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,475
- It's beautiful.
- No mistake.

466
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,950
There are so many glorious
stories about this fan.

467
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,271
- But you wouldn't want to know.
- Have a drink of tea first.

468
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,796
Uncle, you are a good man.
Do you live here?

469
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,713
No. I'm just waiting for someone.

470
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,713
- This person is notorious.
- How so?

471
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,554
He attacked a transport
and took away what it was carrying.

472
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,757
He doesn't care
that the police are looking for him.

473
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,152
He doesn't even acknowledge the
District Marshal when he meets him.

474
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,800
This person must be infamous.

475
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,158
Yes, but he is short-sighted.

476
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,073
Short-sighted?
Like he can't even see you?

477
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,516
It's like he's blind. He's here.

478
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,955
Here?

479
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,076
Where?

480
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,435
Can't you see him?

481
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,115
Is it him?

482
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,193
It was him I was talking about,
the dog! Has he bitten you too?

483
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,229
Not only bitten me, he feeds off
of me, pesters me and stalks me.

484
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,039
- What for?
- He's stalking an inheritance.

485
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,271
You are so cruel.
Bullying old people are you?

486
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,670
When I first saw you,
I knew you weren't a good person.

487
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,478
Now the police know about you.

488
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,791
Since you are so infamous,
what's your name?

489
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,035
Can't you talk?
Not a care in the world.

490
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,509
Some people are born arseholes

491
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,717
but his father must be
the biggest arsehole of all.

492
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,076
What are you laughing at?

493
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,199
Don't get angry.
Let me teach him a lesson.

494
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,634
You with the bench,
you're nothing but a mute dog.

495
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,473
I'm not going to let you off
this time.

496
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,633
That worthless boy is
quite good with that bench.

497
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,032
Watch it, boy!

498
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,194
To teach this boy a lesson...

499
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,350
you have to use this.

500
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,676
Thank you, Uncle.

501
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,116
Give up.

502
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,675
See, Uncle? He might be good with
the bench but this is my speciality.

503
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,909
Of course, without this
you couldn't control him.

504
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,468
You can't move now, can you?

505
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,470
Uncle, this slap is from you.

506
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,833
And this slap is from me.

507
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,836
And this slap is from
your dead father.

508
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:56,280
And this...

509
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,555
Uncle, he's staring at you.

510
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,598
- You stand there a moment.
- OK. You hit him.

511
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,673
You were told to behave
but you thought it was a joke.

512
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,594
Sister Sue was looking after you
but you didn't practise your Kung fu.

513
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,835
You just wanted to show off
with your bench work.

514
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,037
And now you've been beaten
to the bone.

515
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,634
You know all about his faults.

516
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,473
- He is my little runt.
- Little runt?

517
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,233
- Little Brat.
- Little Brat?

518
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,595
He is my son.

519
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,830
So you must be his father.

520
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,512
Damn you!

521
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,516
I still won.

522
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,556
Get up!

523
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,270
So it's father and son together then.

524
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,389
You're quite talkative
for an old git.

525
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,632
You deserve what's coming to you.
I missed my lunch waiting for you.

526
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,232
Hold on!

527
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,198
Lunch! Why didn't you say?

528
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,317
It's simple. I haven't got much.

529
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,951
But here is a few coins, which should
be enough to buy you two a meal.

530
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,234
I'm buying your lunch and you hit me!

531
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,756
Kneel down.

532
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,031
We don't need your charity,
my father eats at the police station.

533
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,873
- So he's the Top Dog.
- Who else?

534
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,276
Why did you come out?

535
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,319
- Sister Sue asked me to buy food.
- Why haven't you gone then?

536
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,755
You have the right to remain silent.

537
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,753
But what ever you say
may be taken down as evidence.

538
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,751
You must have heard that a lot.

539
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,115
You have the fan.

540
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,589
So do old women
but you don't arrest them.

541
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,319
And your son
goes around with a bench.

542
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,598
- Don't mention him.
- If he was yours he'd listen to you.

543
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,151
He makes me so angry.

544
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,073
Not a sound. Not even a fart.

545
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,958
- You'd think he was a mute.
- So you two don't talk.

546
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,600
That's true.
It's not like the way we can chat.

547
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,910
Of course.

548
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,150
- Get moving!
- Can't I take a leak?

549
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,390
A leak? Over there.

550
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,040
How can I go with handcuffs on?

551
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,078
Drop your stuff and I'll uncuff you.

552
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,998
You are a good man, Uncle.

553
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,035
How can I go with you watching me?

554
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,509
If I don't watch you,
you'll run away.

555
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,755
Even if you do watch me,
I'll still run away.

556
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,392
I'm running away.
Why isn't he after me?

557
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,436
I'm really running away.

558
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,796
Run away to start a new day.
Run, run, run.

559
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,474
He's running
just where I want him to!

560
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,511
He's not following. What a relief.

561
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,432
What's going on? It's all sloppy!

562
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,118
That's what you call dropping
a criminal in the shit.

563
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,670
- Get me out!
- Don't breathe or you'll sink.

564
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,318
Get me out.

565
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,916
Every criminal who comes here
will fall in.

566
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,595
- Please, get me out.
- It's not even over your head.

567
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,116
I could help you out
but first you have to sing me a song.

568
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,749
If I like it,
I'll consider your plea.

569
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,990
OK, I'll sing.

570
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,074
A little birdy falls into the water,
into the water, into the water...

571
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,236
Why have you stopped?

572
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,232
If you don't grab the branch,
how can I rescue you?

573
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,311
Hold on tight.

574
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,276
Come on.

575
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,552
Steady.

576
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,160
- Climb up.
- I nearly drowned.

577
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,800
Over there!
Don't get the things dirty.

578
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,872
Get me out!

579
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,596
Quick, get me out!

580
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,635
You're a good man.
You could have run away.

581
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,676
Oh, yeah!

582
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,474
Thanks for reminding me. I'm off!

583
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,552
What if I sing you a song?

584
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,789
- Help me out!
- Sing then.

585
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,316
A little birdy
has fallen into water...

586
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,153
Stop, it's awful! I'll get you out.

587
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,953
Hurry up. Quick!

588
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,600
Hold on. Too bad if it breaks!

589
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,188
Anybody in? Anybody in?

590
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,396
Am I in luck?

591
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,316
Hey, young lady! Young lady.

592
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,277
Who are you?

593
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,636
I am me. Please open the door.

594
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,551
Success.
I smile and answer 'I am me'.

595
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,436
Hello, young lady.

596
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,750
- I'll wipe it off. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

597
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,229
Not from round here?

598
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,675
No, this is from this round here.

599
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,433
No, you must not be from round here,
since you fell into the quicksand.

600
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,478
Yes. Look how dirty I am.

601
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,235
I just need a bucket of water.

602
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,276
I won't make a mess.

603
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,990
Can I borrow that, please?

604
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,150
- Here.
- Thanks.

605
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,916
Clever, eh?

606
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,359
Wait! Am I leading you to
the washroom or are you leading me?

607
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,316
That's better.

608
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,517
Not a single footprint.
It's all right for you!

609
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,636
You can walk from here.

610
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,600
- Thanks.
- There's the washroom.

611
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,830
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

612
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,676
It's unisex, is it?

613
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,194
You can't wear those dirty clothes.
I'll get you my little brother's.

614
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,988
Damn! I forgot to buy the groceries.

615
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,115
I'm going to the market,
will you be all right by yourself?

616
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,714
Off you go. I'll be fine.

617
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,718
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
Only dirt and grime.

618
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,070
The District Marshal is a swine.

619
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:27,873
When I find that bastard,
I'll cut him to pieces!

620
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,916
No more talking.

621
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,950
Good job the kids aren't home.

622
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,155
That little brat is back so soon?

623
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,716
Little brother?

624
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,316
What a mess!

625
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,029
Are you OK?
I was only playing with you.

626
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,594
- It's not breathing.
- You've killed the fish, you brat!

627
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,756
- It's you.
- How come?

628
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,030
You won't escape this time.

629
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,952
You are something. You and I are only
borrowing someone's place to use.

630
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,919
You made all this mess
and I even swept up after you.

631
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,752
So what?

632
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,038
I told myself that if! met you
again, I wouldn't speak to you.

633
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,958
Suits me. The less said the better.

634
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,792
It's not your fault.

635
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,036
It's come back to life.

636
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,638
I'll cut you to pieces!

637
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,756
Hey! Stop being so unreasonable.

638
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,400
I'll kill you
and then report you missing.

639
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,036
You think I'm your son.

640
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,789
So it's the Emperor's.

641
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,157
Chop it.

642
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,030
It may be the Emperor's,
but why is it sword-resistant?

643
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,036
The Emperor fights the Hun,
the Emperor will make you run!

644
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,432
His head didn't break it.
How about this pole?

645
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,476
It still hasn't broken.

646
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,636
Still not broken.

647
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,349
- Put down the pipe.
- Put down the sword.

648
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,396
You first.

649
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,596
OK. I'll put down the sword.

650
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,636
That's more like it.

651
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,276
I'm just putting it away.

652
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,918
Die!

653
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,233
It wasn't me. He broke the furniture!

654
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,788
It's him. It's him.

655
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,030
Hit him.

656
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,595
Father.

657
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,272
He's your father?

658
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,796
You old stud!
You've got children everywhere!

659
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,276
That's enough.

660
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,710
Damn it! This can't be happening!

661
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,396
I'm just letting you win.

662
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,116
Game over.

663
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,593
OK. Rest here.

664
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,229
It's a dead end and there's no cover.
What's so good about it?

665
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,517
- Precisely, it's a dead end.
- I'm desperate, Sam Kung.

666
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,558
Typical. He needs a piss again.

667
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,919
Really? You're just looking for
a chance to escape again.

668
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,238
No, I really want to have a piss
this time.

669
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,038
Uncuff him.

670
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,872
Thank you.

671
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,352
Thank you, brother.

672
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,715
I can't go with you watching me.

673
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,953
Hey! What are you doing?

674
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,600
I always piss like this.

675
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,231
Good arm strength.
Practising your Kung fu?

676
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,788
I'm finding out
how wide the alley is.

677
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,235
Well, now you know, so get down.

678
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,716
Eat.

679
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,635
Your dad talks about you as if you
were worthless. I feel sorry for you.

680
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,076
The way you cuff me, you must be
expecting me to run away at any time.

681
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,119
When you do run away, ring the bell -
make my job easier.

682
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,032
The sun climbs to the mountain top,
the river runs to the sea.

683
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,476
If you want to see a long way,
climb higher still.

684
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,276
There's nothing to see up here,
go back down.

685
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,909
He's like a ghost. He's so annoying.

686
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,040
District Marshall, I've been
looking for you everywhere.

687
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,793
Oh, it's you. What's the matter?

688
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,670
I've heard some rumours,
somebody is going to rob some...

689
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,438
the bank!

690
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,796
Pak and his gang are going
to rob the bank at about 11 o'clock!

691
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,711
- Pak Zi-sin?
- Yes.

692
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,392
11 o'clock?

693
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,758
- Don't mess me around!
- I've never messed you around!

694
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,275
- Sin says Pak's going to rob a bank.
- We've got the wrong man, then.

695
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,555
I told you! You made a mistake!

696
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,792
You're the suspect
until I get the criminal.

697
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,110
If you don't release me
I'll sue you both.

698
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,952
All right, just the old man.

699
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,873
I can detain you
for obstructing justice.

700
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,235
You're not being reasonable!

701
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,234
If you won't run, I won't cuff you.

702
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,357
- Give me the key.
- Just till I get back.

703
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,670
I'll wait for you.

704
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,115
Hold on. Why don't I run now?

705
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,956
Why isn't Pak here?

706
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,591
- Those two have gone. How about you?
- You want to quit?

707
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,316
I fear nothing.

708
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,552
So why don't you go now?

709
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,234
Shall we say 1 o'clock?

710
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,276
The earlier the better.

711
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,316
All right, I'll go.

712
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,314
With him out of the way,
we'll get a larger share.

713
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,313
We'll use the others
to get rid of him,

714
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,960
then get the stash
at Fok Fu-ling tomorrow.

715
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,554
Man Loong Bank

716
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,392
Let me out!

717
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,436
It's no use shouting.

718
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,988
- Let me split this up.
- He'll die.

719
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,190
Someone will take the blame.

720
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,840
Your fan is in there,
go and fetch it.

721
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,352
- What was that for?
- I am representing Master Kim.

722
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,430
You're too young
to be part of our gang.

723
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,476
You're a scapegoat.

724
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,314
That's right.
Take your fan, it's hot in prison.

725
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,713
- What are you looking at?
- What's so funny?

726
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,956
There's nothing to see.

727
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,916
I told you there'd be money.

728
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,030
You've tricked me!

729
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,716
Have it back!

730
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,912
Hit here!

731
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,236
I thought I was smart.

732
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,750
Oh, you've killed me, I'm dead.

733
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,911
He'll kill him at this rate.

734
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,958
Please don't, you'll kill me.

735
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,792
You old git!

736
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,559
Please don't, you'll crush me.

737
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,908
Do you want to kill a poor old man?

738
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,752
I'm finished.

739
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,796
Oh, I'm dying.

740
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,756
Please don't.

741
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,196
If your stall is destroyed,
I'll get all your business!

742
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,912
Still pretending?

743
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,956
Stop fighting.

744
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,077
I'll die.

745
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,076
Here's your whiskers.

746
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,836
I won't fall.

747
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,275
Thank you, thanks for watching.

748
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,276
I'm finished.

749
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,796
My fabrics!

750
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,838
You want more?
Take them, they're not mine.

751
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,992
How can you do this?

752
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,275
Let me hide here.

753
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,396
You bastard!

754
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,436
Serves you right!

755
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,156
So precise.

756
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,470
My skirt, you pervert!

757
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,516
Skirt?

758
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,916
I won't fall.

759
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,316
I'll bounce.

760
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,791
You want a fight?
Fight me properly then.

761
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,512
Let me down!

762
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,036
- We should've brought more help.
- Too right.

763
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,672
Where are they?

764
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,512
They're behind me.

765
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,036
I'll break your legs.

766
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,236
They're his.

767
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,117
Fooled again.

768
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,953
I've warned you, and you still come.

769
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,232
Don't go.

770
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,352
- My fabric.
- I'll give it back.

771
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,835
Run! The police are coming.

772
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,876
Guard the bank!

773
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,390
Those inside, pay attention.
You are surrounded by the police.

774
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,632
Put down you weapons and surrender
before I count to three.

775
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,676
One, two, three!

776
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,996
I'm tied up, I can't move.

777
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,676
Calm down, Big Brother.

778
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,750
I know it's tough to walk like this,
I'll do the same.

779
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,069
I promised to take you back,
but how can I if you're on the run?

780
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,752
So you locked me up!

781
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,436
I'll take you to the police
and tell them not to come after you.

782
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,876
Rubbish! You're not haggling
at the market now.

783
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,596
What happened to sympathy?

784
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,636
Laws are laws. No deal.

785
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,436
What about plea bargaining?

786
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,036
He attacked a transport and did
unspeakable things. No sympathy.

787
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,395
What about when the police do
unspeakable things?

788
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,031
- Rubbish! It's a serious offence.
- But I brought him back.

789
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,795
- Rubbish!
- Rubbish? You can't see sense!

790
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,836
You cut someone and he heals,

791
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,753
does that mean you didn't cut him?

792
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,798
Fine. I have your pipe.

793
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,358
Put down my pipe!

794
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,079
I put it down,
it's like I never picked it up.

795
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,789
Dad, he did help you catch him.
What's wrong with that?

796
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,632
I could have caught him myself.

797
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,188
You didn't know where he was.
But I did.

798
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,511
- He's back now and we're off.
- Stop right there!

799
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,434
You're collaborating with a felon,
so you're under arrest.

800
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,554
Don't be unreasonable, Marshall.

801
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,479
I've said my bit, you figure it out.

802
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,393
I'll tap three times for a decision
so it's up to you.

803
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,391
One, two three.

804
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,630
OK. Fine.

805
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,599
Bring back Kim,
or visit Keung in prison.

806
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,993
Forty-sixty, fifty-fifty,
thirty-seventy!

807
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,235
Seventy for you and thirty for me.

808
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,596
Nothing for you.

809
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,875
Just a token amount
for all these years together?

810
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,916
Go on.

811
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,874
You really want a token?

812
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,638
All right. Have this.

813
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,551
I'm dead!

814
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,156
I've caught it.

815
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,073
You?

816
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,029
For what you two did to me
and my brother, you deserve to die.

817
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,997
So why did you catch it?

818
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,310
I didn't want to see anyone else
get hurt.

819
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,188
You're getting in the way, lad.
What are you doing here?

820
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,193
I've come to take you back
to the District Marshall.

821
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,480
The snake catcher's here, Kim.

822
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,437
Catch me?

823
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,476
What, you?

824
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,158
- What's so funny?
- It's funny if you think about it.

825
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,196
You can laugh.

826
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,550
Be careful, Kim is very dangerous.

827
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,313
Watch out for his Tiger Tail kick.

828
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:20,473
Trying that Kung fu on me, boy?
Not unless you want to die.

829
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,236
Oh, damn!

830
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,269
Although I don't know him,
I have to help this lad get that Kim.

831
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,636
Watch out.

832
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,358
Attack.

833
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,795
Get ready... Attack.

834
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,108
Don't rush in,
I haven't spoken to you yet.

835
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,556
His lower body Kung fu
is incredible.

836
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,790
Go for his upper body.

837
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,677
- Upper body?
- Go on.

838
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,998
Brilliant.

839
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,636
You're brilliant. In a few moves,

840
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,188
you've found his upper body
is just as good.

841
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,671
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You rushed off.

842
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,194
You're not the one who's fighting.

843
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:56,196
Can't you see his weakness?
He only uses his left leg.

844
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,199
You fight him, since you noticed it.

845
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,953
If I fight, how can I
be your fight co-ordinator?

846
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,792
Go on.

847
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,269
There's two of us fighting him.
Don't be afraid.

848
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,476
Come on, get up. Get up.

849
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,759
- Why aren't you hitting back?
- How can I?

850
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,990
Stop messing about.

851
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,991
Don't let go.
No matter what, don't let go.

852
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,709
I got him!

853
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,677
Well, carry on.

854
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,993
Watch out!

855
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,434
Win one, lose one.

856
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,034
That was a strong kick.

857
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,828
He's coming again. Get up. Get up.

858
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,229
Get up. Get up!

859
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,430
Get up... Hit him again!

860
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,396
I can't bear to watch.

861
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,838
Compose yourself. Concentrate.

862
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,038
Soon he'll be worn out.
Then it'll be your time for glory.

863
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,636
I'm exhausted.

864
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,033
Fresh air.

865
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,793
- Fresh air.
- Water, water.

866
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,319
Here's holy water. Drink up.

867
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,029
That's the end of round one.

868
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,554
What! That was just the first round?

869
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,996
Three more rounds and
the old bastard will be exhausted.

870
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,911
Oh shit, he's coming.

871
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,639
Get up. Get up.

872
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,669
Show him no mercy.

873
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,479
Hey, don't come over here.

874
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,632
You can't hit the referee,
it's against the rules.

875
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,278
Protect me.

876
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,795
Protect me.
Don't show that bastard any mercy.

877
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,838
No need to respect him. Go on. Go on.

878
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,076
Go on.

879
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,951
Fresh air. Fresh air.

880
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,874
- Fresh air.
- Water, water, water!

881
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,589
- You won this round.
- How?

882
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,352
I'm the referee.

883
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,956
He's coming. Attack!

884
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,396
Try and hit him again.

885
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,391
Lock his legs!

886
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,913
Don't let him rest.

887
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,754
- Drink some water.
- Water.

888
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,116
Here he comes.
He'll soften the blow.

889
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,750
I didn't know I was so light.

890
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,518
I admire you. I now appreciate what
youth really is.

891
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,752
You are indestructible.

892
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:48,631
Don't comfort me. I need water.

893
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,517
Water. I'll get it.

894
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,074
Here's some water.
I won't let you go thirsty.

895
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,434
Drink as much as you can.
Be a real man.

896
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,398
Drink up, it'll kill the germs.

897
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,478
Pipe water is still water.
Only bitter.

898
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,393
Fresh air.

899
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,512
You rotten bastard,
you kicked me up the arse!

900
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,278
Taking the gold and not the silver.

901
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,316
The gold price is going up.

902
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:45,113
What goes up quickly
comes down quickly.

903
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,029
Fantastic!

904
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,190
Stay right there.

905
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,476
You're brilliant, boy.

906
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,279
You're brilliant. You won!

907
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,076
We'll spilt the prize in half.
What are you doing?

908
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,674
You want the belt. Take it.

909
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,196
Master, Big Brother is home.

910
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,633
Come.

911
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,188
- Big Brother's home.
- Big Brother.

912
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,234
- Master.
- Get up. Get up.

913
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,400
- Where's Lung?
- There.

914
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,072
Come on!

915
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,152
Come on. Hurry up.

916
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,276
Give way. Peace.
End to violence. Tranquillity.

917
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,114
Hurry up, he's over there.

918
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,751
Master, I'm home.

919
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,553
How did this happen? Carry him back.

920
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,756
Kaifeng County once had
a governor called Bao

921
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,991
He was upright,
could tell good from evil

922
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,875
The heroes were all
willing to help him

923
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:07,192
He had Wangchao on his left,
and Mahan on his right
