00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:22,110
We're just two little girls
From Little Rock

2
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:27,626
We lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,188
But the gentlemen friends
Who used to call

4
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,708
They never did seem to mind at all

5
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:37,663
They came to the wrong side
Of the tracks

6
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:43,461
Then someone broke my heart
In Little Rock

7
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:48,741
So I up and left the pieces there

8
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,666
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about

9
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:54,268
I came to New York and I found out

10
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:59,064
That men are the same way everywhere

11
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:05,424
I was young and determined
To be wined and dined and ermined

12
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:09,865
And I worked at it
All around the clock

13
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,393
Now one of these days
In my fancy clothes

14
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:18,912
I'm goin' back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart

15
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,713
The one who broke my heart

16
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:25,309

In Little Rock

17

18
00:02:55,753 --> 00:03:01,146
I learned an awful lot in Little Rock

19
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:06,586
And here's some advice
I'd like to share

20
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,788
Find a gentleman

21
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:15,147
Who is shy or bold

22
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:19,472
Or short or tall

23
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:25,231
Or young or old

24
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:30,264
As long as the guy's a millionaire

25
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:35,986
For a kid from a small street
I did very well on Wall Street

26
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:41,387
Though I never owned a share of stock

27
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,908
And now that I'm known
In the biggest banks

28
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,621
I'm a-goin' back home
And give my thanks

29
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,472
To the one who broke my heart

30
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:52,062

31
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,663

34
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:27,581

to our dressing room.

-For what?

37
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,113
Didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.

38
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,105
lt's a bag of gumdrops.

39
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:44,347
lt was square, like a box for a ring.
l think he's got a present for me.

40
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:48,142
Only you can be on-stage
with a spotlight in your eye...

41
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,186
...and still see a diamond
in a man's pocket.

Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?

49

-lt should have a highball around it.
-Does it fit your finger?

50
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:34,183
Yes, it fits perfect.

the happiest girl in the world.

00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:49,504
You better remember you're my baby

167
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:53,507
When they give you the eye
My, my!

168
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:58,873
Although I know that you care
Won't you write and declare

169
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:05,308
Declare that though on the loose
You are still staying on the square

170
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,067
I'll be gloomy

171
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,662
But send that rainbow to me

172
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:14,508
Then my shadow will fly

173
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,507
Though you'll be gone for a while

174
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:25,750
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

175
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:30,868
With my baby by and by

176
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:49,305
I'll be in my room alone

177
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:54,104
Every postmeridian

178
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:58,266
And I'll be with my diary

179
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:04,861
And that book by Mr. Gideon

180
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:11,387
Bye-bye, baby

181
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:17,310
Remember you're my baby

182
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:24,231
When they give you the eye

183
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:31,509
And just to show that I care

184
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:37,510
I will write and declare

185
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:42,907
That I'm on the loose

186
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:48,864
But I'll stay on the square

187
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:55,112
I'll be lonely

188
00:15:55,353 --> 00:16:01,189
But even though I'm lonely

189
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:07,912
There'll be no other guy

190
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:17,229
Though I'll be gone for a while

191
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:23,110
I know that I'll be smilin'

192
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:28,470
With my baby by and by and by

193
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:31,870
With my baby by and by

194
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:37,312
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me

195
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:43,508
PORTER: All ashore! Last call!
All ashore! Last call!

196
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:52,703
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

197
00:16:55,593 --> 00:17:01,463
Bye-bye, baby
Remember you're my baby

198
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:05,421
When they give you the eye

199
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:11,384
Although I know that you care
Won't you write and declare

200
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:17,350
That though on the loose
You are still on the square

201
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,868
-You better go.
-Don't go.

202
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,150
-Step back, please.
-Bye, lover!

203
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:38,230
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by

204
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:40,349
And by

205
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:44,984
With my wonderful baby

206
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:53,472
By and by

207
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,463
-Hi.
-Hi.

208
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,672
-Hi, Miss Shaw.
-All right, guys, keep moving.

209
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:22,992
-""Mr. Amos Jones and valet.""
-What are you doing?

210
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:28,747
Checking the passenger list.
""Mr. Alfred Loman and valet.""

211
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,865
""Mr. Eugene Martin and valet.""

212
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,832
Why the sudden interest in valets?

213
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:39,663
When a man has ""and valet""
after his name, he's worthwhile.

214
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:42,706
l'm trying to find
a gentleman escort for you.

215
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:47,390
Don't bother. l just
provided myself with about 20.

216
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:51,782
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?

217
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:56,783
Who cares? l like a man
who can run faster than l can.

218
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:59,109
l hate to think where you'll wind up.

219
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:02,828
You're wasting time on
unrefined persons without money.

220
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:06,742
Did it occur to you that
some people don't care about money?

221
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:09,746
Don't be silly.
We're talking serious.

222
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:14,266
-Do you want a loveless marriage?
-Me, loveless?

223
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:19,104
lf a girl spends time worrying
about the money she doesn't have...

224
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,986
...how will she have
any time for love?

225
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:26,505
l want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.

226
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:30,985
-That baffles me.
-You'll thank me some day.

227
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:36,313
Here's a good one:
""Henry Spofford lll and valet.""

228
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:40,984
l remember. The Spofford family
owns practically a whole state.

229
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:44,390
A big one too.
l think it's Pennsylvania.

230
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:47,505
l guess l could settle
for Pennsylvania.

231
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:52,628
-Hello, Mrs. Henry Spofford lll.
-Mrs. Henry Spofford lll and valet.

232
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,905
He won't have anything l don't.
See you later.

233
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,662
Don't forget the cocktail party. 5:30.

234
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:08,271
-The whole team?
-Until after the games.

235
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,227
-You eat at 6 and go to bed at 9?
-That's right.

236
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,025
Coach is strict.

237
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:18,704
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.

238
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,790
-Not for us.
COACH: All right you guys.

239
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,591
(WHlSTLE BLOWS)

240
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:34,471
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

241
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,945
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

242
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:49,150
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

243
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:03,904
Honey, you'll hurt yourself.

244
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,468
I can't play tennis
My golf's a menace

245
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,671
I just can't do the Australian crawl

246
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:18,384
And I'm no better at volleyball
Ain't there anyone here for love?

247
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:23,263
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone here for love?

248
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:37,593
I'm apathetic and non-athletic
Can't keep up in a marathon

249
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:44,471
I need some shoulder to lean upon
And a couple of arms to hold me

250
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:48,063
Ain't there anyone here for love?

251
00:21:57,273 --> 00:22:04,065
I'm not in condition to wrestle

252
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:08,272
I've never trained in a gym

253
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:14,743
Show me a man who can nestle

254
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:19,265
And I'll pin a medal on him

255
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:24,910
Need some chappie to make me happy
And he don't have to be Hercules

256
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:29,863
Don't anyone know about birds and bees?
Ain't there anyone here for love?

257
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:34,672
Sweet love

258
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:38,661
Ain't there anyone...

259
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:42,872
...here for love?

260
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:51,472
Doubles, anyone?

261
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,263
Court's free.

262
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:07,661
Two out of three, anyone?

263
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:16,270
Doesn't anyone want to play?

264
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:22,102
I like big muscles
And red corpuscles

265
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:26,062
I like a beautiful hunk of man

266
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:30,306
But I'm no physical culture fan

267
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:34,512
Ain't there anyone here for love?

268
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:39,144
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone

269
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,503
Ain't there anyone

270
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:51,863
Ain't there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone

271
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,945
For love?

272
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:11,141
-Did you say $50?
-Oui.

273
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,947
A tidy sum just to sit at a table.

274
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:19,705
Supply and demand. Many requests
for a seat at Miss Shaw's table.

275
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:25,909
And the price goes up and up and up.
That's inevitable. Je regrette.

276
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:32,466
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.

277
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:35,949
Get it down while
l can still afford it.

278
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:39,704
-Bonjour, mademoiselle.
-Are you the headwaiter?

279
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,632
-At your service.
-l'm Miss Lee.

280
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:48,112
Oh, Miss Lee. Well, now l understand.
What can l do for you?

281
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,106
Put a certain gentleman at my table.

282
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:54,271
There's nothing l can do for you.

283
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:57,704
All seating arrangements
are completed, final.

284
00:24:57,953 --> 00:25:03,311
ln Atlantic City, all the men
at my hotel wanted to sit at my table.

285
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:08,786
-l can understand that.
-Some even gave the headwaiter money.

286
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:12,463
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it.

287
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:16,825
-That headwaiter had to give it back.
-lndeed? Why?

288
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:22,312
l had all my meals in my room.
l didn't come to the table at all.

289
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:25,630
Naturally the men wanted their money.

290
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:29,508
-l beg you--
-Do you want me to eat in my room?

291
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:31,789
That must not be.

292
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:36,032
lf Mr. Henry Spofford lll
is seated at my table....

293
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:40,351
-lt shall be.
-Thank you ever so.

294
00:25:50,753 --> 00:25:54,666
-Hi.
-Hi, Miss Shaw. Nice to see you.

295
00:25:54,873 --> 00:26:00,106
My name is Watson.
Here we are, all ready for you.

296
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:02,469
-l need it.
-What's the matter?

297
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:08,589
The entire Olympic team has to be
in bed by 9:00. What can you do?

298
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:12,308
-Write your congressman.
-Catch me a pigeon, and l will.

299
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:17,792
May l present Sir Francis Beekman?
A pigeon, if there ever was one.

300
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,472
Note the ruby eyes.

301
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:24,303
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. l have a way with ladies.

302
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:29,866
lt's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

303
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:35,107
Cheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?

304
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:38,908
l understand you're an entertainer.
l'll bet you're good.

305
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:42,304
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

306
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:45,550
l do.
Are you interested in diamonds?

307
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:50,031
-Not particularly.
-You must be an extraordinary girl.

308
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,384
-Will you do me a favor, sir?
-Call me Piggie.

309
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:56,306
-Do me a favor, Piggie?
-Anything.

310
00:26:56,513 --> 00:27:01,826
Don't spread it around about your mine.
l don't want my friend to hear.

311
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,785
She doesn't care for diamonds?

312
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:08,908
l'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.

313
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,030
Did you say ""diamonds""?

314
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:14,908
Well, well, well!
By George, l must say!

315
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:19,465
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.

316
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:24,269
-Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
-Delighted! Delighted!

317
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:30,105
You did say ""diamonds."" l can tell.

318
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:34,511
l control the second largest mine
in South Africa.

319
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:39,781
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.

320
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,110
-l wonder why.
-Oh, no, you don't.

321
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:48,746
Having heard so much about you,
l expected you'd be much older.

322
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:54,226
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?

323
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,832
The Pyramids.

324
00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:00,265
l say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.

325
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,509
Honey, lay off!

326
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,022
Bless my soul. Care to dance?

327
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:09,988
l'd enjoy to dance.
Thank you ever so.

328
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:14,143
-Another drink?
-No, thanks.

329
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:19,711
-Need a program to tell the players.
-l want to know who the players are.

330
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:24,868
-Like, who just stole second base?
-My name's Malone.

331
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:29,305
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Malone?

332
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:33,102
You're the most attractive girl here,
so l came over.

333
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:39,508
-Flattery will get you anywhere.
-Then we haven't any problems.

334
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:42,785
l was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

335
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:48,067
-l had some business to attend to.
-Then this isn't a vacation?

336
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:51,032
Not entirely.
There's still a telephone.

337
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,906
-ln fact, l just had some bad news.
-Oh?

338
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:59,426
My best 2-year-old will never
run again. He's worth $40,000.

339
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,625
lt's not the money.
This might've been good.

340
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,950
-You're not one of those?
-One of what?

341
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:09,145
The kind who tells a girl
about his money.

342
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,309
What's wrong with money?

343
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:15,711
Yes, l'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.

344
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:17,181
Wait--

345
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:20,669
l can't stand rich playboys
who think they--

346
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:25,867
Now wait a minute! l'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes l'm very nice.

347
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:28,673
Sometimes l speak without thinking.

348
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:31,512
So you're half sweet, half acid.

349
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:34,910
-Please, l made a mistake.
-Yes, you did.

350
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:39,669
l got some bad information.
Now that l've put my foot in it...

351
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:44,185
...l remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.

352
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:47,510
-Lorelei.
-Or am l wrong again?

353
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:51,467
No, money is rather
a hobby of Lorelei's.

354
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:54,826
Oh, Piggie.

355
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:59,629
-You're worried about her.
-You're very observing.

356
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,664
Am l forgiven?

357
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,752
Considering the man shortage
on this craft....

358
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:08,468
Good. We'll start all over again.
l promise that l--

359
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,311
We're gonna be interrupted.

360
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,032
We had a jolly time.

361
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:17,785
-Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
-How do you do?

362
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:23,590
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.

363
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:27,706
-l was sure he would be.
-You're trying to flatter me.

364
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,552
LORELEl: What's the matter?
-My wife.

365
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:34,428
-l thought it was his mine.
-Won't you join us?

366
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,989
-l just have.
-May l present Miss Lee?

367
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:41,350
-Miss Shaw, Mr....
-Malone.

368
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:45,785
-A pleasure, l'm ever so sure.
-Thank you.

369
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:48,712
We're having a jolly time.

370
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,703
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry l've ever seen.

371
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:59,907
l'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.

372
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:03,662
You'd never know it.
They look just like new.

373
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:09,428
You might be interested in my tiara.
l always have it with me.

374
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,783
Afraid to leave it in my room.

375
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:17,670
-But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
-Stop. She won't know you're teasing.

376
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:23,423
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

377
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:27,069
All blue stones.
Cozy little job, what?

378
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:30,623
-May l just hold it for a minute?
-Of course.

379
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:36,387
-How do you put it on?
-lt goes on your head.

380
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:42,384
-You must think l was born yesterday.
-There's no other explanation.

381
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:47,627
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. lt's a tiara.

382
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:53,908
You do wear it on your head! l love
finding new places to wear diamonds.

383
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:58,026
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.

384
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:01,430
We've got to dress for dinner.
We must go.

385
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,193
Well, all right. Au revoir.

386
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:07,465
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

387
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:11,191
My tiara. Thank you.

388
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:16,152
Poor fella. Two-to-one
she locks him in her closet.

389
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:20,107
-l'd be grateful if she did.
-l think he's cute.

390
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:25,905
You know very well what l mean.
You and that-- What are you doing?

391
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:31,466
Just testing. Wonder what l'll
wear it with. How does it look?

392
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:34,471
Exactly like trouble.

393
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:45,907
l told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about--

394
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:51,826
Finish your story, dear.

395
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:12,632
Your table, madame.

396
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:18,510
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Crossley. Mr. Franklin.

397
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,861
-Mr. Mason. How do you do?
-Mr. Brooks.

398
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:23,068
How do you do?

399
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:26,709
-ls Mr. Spofford here?
-No, but this is his chair.

400
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:30,912
-You're here, Miss Lee.
MASON: Miss Shaw, you're here.

401
00:33:31,113 --> 00:33:35,584
-Could my friend have your seat?
-But of course.

402
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:38,023
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

403
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,066
-l'm sorry.
-Not at all.

404
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:48,071
-How are we at the same table?
-l was assigned this seat.

405
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:52,505
-How much did it cost?
-l can't tell. You'd get conceited.

406
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:55,028
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?

407
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:59,431
How many times have you crossed?
lsn't it lonely on the ocean?

408
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:02,784
l just adore conversation, don't you?

409
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:06,622
-Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.
-Oh.

410
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:11,065
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.

411
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:12,348
Okay.

412
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:17,064
Right this way, sir.
Mr. Henry Spofford.

413
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,711
-Hello.
MEN: Hello.

414
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,909
Hello. Hello.

415
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:25,270
Well, are you traveling by yourself?

416
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:28,465
No, l've got a valet,
a tutor and a trainer.

417
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:35,061
Well, having heard so much about you,
l expected you to be much older.

418
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:39,266
l'm old enough to appreciate
a good-looking girl.

419
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:42,704
This promises to be quite a trip.

420
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:46,263
Personally, l don't intend
to miss a meal.

421
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:48,668
How am l doing?

422
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,664
-There's a place.
-Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?

423
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:08,505
l can't get over that passenger list.
Calling a young boy ""mister.""

424
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:12,023
A girl could waste
a whole trip to Europe.

425
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:14,383
Think we better give up the idea?

426
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:18,023
lf he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

427
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:22,590
-Drinks seemed like a good idea.
-You're a dear boy.

428
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:26,786
-What's your line, Mr. Malone?
-My line?

429
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:31,709
l tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight...

430
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:35,070
...lips like a red couch
in an ivory palace...

431
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:40,301
...and l'm lonely.
Then l generally burst into tears.

432
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,266
-Very seldom works.
-You idiot.

433
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:47,711
-What do you do for a living?
-Oh, that kind of line.

434
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:51,747
Nothing, l'm afraid.
Just clip coupons.

435
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:56,271
-Coupons. That's like money, isn't it?
-Very similar.

436
00:35:56,473 --> 00:36:01,388
l'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

437
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,708
No taste?

438
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,711
No, l'm a hobo collector.
l might find room for you.

439
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,462
-She's joking.
-l hope not, l'm counting on it.

440
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:13,308
-Some people don't get her jokes.
-l'm gonna try.

441
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:17,984
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.

442
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:22,425
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

443
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,625
-l've got to be going.
-Going? Where?

444
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,508
Don't worry.
l'm only concerned about you two.

445
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,221
There's a wonderful moon out.

446
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:36,984
There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?

447
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:41,112
l'd love to. lf you hadn't asked me,
l was going to ask you.

448
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:45,670
Really? Well, by Jove!
l say, will you excuse us?

449
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:55,030
-Do you remember last night?
-Very well.

450
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:58,782
l mean when we were talking
about the moon.

451
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:02,383
lt reminded you of a moon
in Coney lsland.

452
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:05,027
Could have been the same one. Why?

453
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:07,303
l remember l was wondering...

454
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:11,267
...what a rich man like you
were doing in Coney lsland.

455
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,422
Oh, well....

456
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:17,269
l rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

457
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,903
Wonder if l should break that up.

458
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:35,903
They're just dancing in public.
Can't make much of a case of that.

459
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,269
You sound like a detective.

460
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:42,864
Let's go find our moon
and forget about your girlfriend.

461
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:45,951
l'd get in trouble
if l pushed Piggie overboard.

462
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:47,990
Not with me.

463
00:37:48,193 --> 00:37:51,503
Why blame Piggie?
lt's not all his fault.

464
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,709
No, l....

465
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,991
Just what did you mean
by that remark?

466
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:02,551
l can't figure out how two girls can
be so different and be friends.

467
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:07,781
Let's get this straight.
Nobody talks about Lorelei but me.

468
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:11,463
She's quite a girl.
You just don't know her.

469
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:18,312
You don't mind
if l like you better, do you?

470
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:26,102
-We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
-Now what do we talk about?

471
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:28,821
Let's talk about you.

472
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:32,662
For the past hour l've been thinking.

473
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,668
Thinking about doing something.

474
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:39,471
What have you been
thinking, Mr. Malone?

475
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:17,352
(SPEAKS lN FORElGN LANGUAGE)

476
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:18,502
Aren't you clever!

477
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:23,582
That means, ""Come to my Basha.
l'll give you coconut shells.""

478
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:28,184
The natives believe
coconut shells ward off the snakes.

479
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:30,702
Africa must be fascinating.

480
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:36,033
A girl like l almost never gets
to meet a really interesting man.

481
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:40,146
-Sometimes my brain gets starved.
-Poor little thing.

482
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:44,989
lt's a terrible thing to be lonesome,
especially in the middle of a crowd.

483
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:46,586
Do you know what l mean?

484
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:49,068
You'll never be lonesome again.
Leave it to Piggie.

485
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,712
(DOOR OPENS)

486
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:55,628
-l've got to see Lorelei alone.
-Shall l wait in the next room?

487
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,667
lf you like. We're expecting
Lady Beekman for tea.

488
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:03,104
Here? l just remembered,
l have another appointment.

489
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:07,864
l better pop off. Toodle-loo,
chin-chin and all that rot.

490
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:12,667
-That was mean!
-Shut up and listen to me.

00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,983
-You're in a jam.
-Me? Why?

492
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,509
What were you doing before
Piggie started barking?

493
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:22,786
-He wasn't barking, that's Swahili.
-Before that.

494
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:27,703
Were you doing anything you
wouldn't want Mr. Esmond to see?

495
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:32,828
-Why, no-- My goodness, yes!
-What?

496
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:37,424
He was telling me about South Africa.
lt's dangerous.

497
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:44,266
Full of snakes called pythons.
lt seems a python can grab a goat...

498
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:47,988
...and kill it
by squeezing it to death.

499
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:50,787
-Get to the point.
-That's all.

500
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,712
What's incriminating about that?

501
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:58,310
Well, Piggie was being the python,
and l was a goat.

502
00:40:58,553 --> 00:41:00,145
Oh, Lorelei!

503
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:03,743
Don't worry!
Piggie won't tell anyone!

504
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:08,664
He won't have to.
When Piggie was squeezing the goat...

505
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:13,105
...Mr. Malone was taking pictures
through that porthole.

506
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:18,068
-Whatever for?
-The National Geographic magazine.

507
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:22,425
Wake up, honey.
Mr. Malone has foxed us.

508
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:25,670
He's been shining up to me
to watch you.

509
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:30,867
l'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.

510
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:36,508
Gus is jealous without pictures. He sees
that, he'll be absolutely unreasonable.

511
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:39,108
Yes, he will.

512
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:43,112
l was gonna kill him,
but l thought better.

513
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:44,911
Better?

514
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:48,264
We'll get the photos
if he doesn't know we know.

515
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,067
-l'll get them. He's a man, isn't he?
-How?

516
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:55,232
Charm won't work.
He's too smart for that.

517
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:59,711
-And he was such a doll last night.
-Oh, Dorothy!

518
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:03,462
Boy, will l tell him off
once we get the pictures!

519
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:07,552
-The question is, how do we do that?
-Well....

520
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:13,466
The simplest way is to swipe them. We'll
get our warpaint on and go to work.

521
00:42:51,993 --> 00:42:56,111
-Where's Lorelei tonight?
-You sound interested.

522
00:42:56,313 --> 00:42:59,350
l am, but not in her.

523
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:04,308
lf you are interested,
l know where we could find her.

524
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:06,191
Just asking a question.

525
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:29,028
That's all.

526
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:56,467
Hello.

527
00:43:56,633 --> 00:44:01,263
Mr. Spofford, please give me a hand.
l'm sort of stuck.

528
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,226
-Are you a burglar?
-Heavens, no!

529
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,027
l got locked in.
l was waiting for a friend.

530
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:11,511
-Why didn't you ring for him?
-l didn't think of it.

531
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:17,026
-lf you're a burglar and l help you--
-Please, help before someone comes.

532
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:22,102
l'm thinking. All right.
l'll help you for two reasons.

533
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:24,389
Never mind the reasons.

534
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:28,063
The first is, l'm too young
to be sent to jail.

535
00:44:28,273 --> 00:44:32,903
The second is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.

536
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:38,270
Look, someone's coming.

537
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:45,872
-What'll l do?
-Hold this around your neck, tight.

538
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,427
Good evening.

539
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:58,706
l say, whatever are you
doing up there?

540
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:01,513
l wanted to see the view from here.

541
00:45:01,753 --> 00:45:04,950
Are you feeling well, my dear?

542
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:09,112
Yes, thank you ever so.
But l must have caught a chill.

543
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:13,107
-What say we get a spot of sherry?
-l can't.

544
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:17,272
-Sherry's the best thing for a cold.
-l couldn't.

545
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:20,226
You do look flushed.
Let me feel your pulse.

546
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:22,185
No, no, please--

547
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:26,545
No cause for alarm, my dear.
lt's purely medical.

548
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:31,110
-There's no fever, at any rate.
-l'm all right, l'm fine.

549
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,907
-Such a little hand.
-Put that back.

550
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:39,233
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.

551
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,663
SPOFFORD: Stop that!
-Beg your pardon?

552
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,831
Well l-- Why....

553
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,666
-Laryngitis, l guess.
-No doubt.

554
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:52,828
-l need sherry. Will you get it?
-l fly on the wings of Mercury.

555
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:56,992
SPOFFORD: Just hurry up.
-All right, my dear.

556
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:05,143
How can you stand that old wolf?
His intentions aren't honorable.

557
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:08,868
For heaven's sakes,
get me out of here!

558
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:16,469
Help me over here.

559
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:21,911
You're all bruised? Malone's been
here with me the whole time.

560
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:28,302
-Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.
-Never mind. Did you get the pictures?

561
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,310
-They weren't there.
-Sure?

562
00:46:30,513 --> 00:46:34,791
l looked everywhere.
l even looked in the camera shop.

563
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:39,271
-Then he's got them in his pockets.
-He must, darn it!

564
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:43,506
He wouldn't hide them if
he thinks we're buying his act.

565
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:48,781
Order dinner for three in our cabin
and get some drinks.

566
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:51,109
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

567
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:55,101
lf we can't empty his pockets,
we're not worthy to be women.

568
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,190
l'll have everything ready.

569
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:12,588
He'll be here in a minute.
Are the drinks ready?

570
00:47:12,793 --> 00:47:14,306
Almost ready.

571
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:18,028
This room's like an oven.
Let's turn the heat off.

572
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,189
Leave it alone.

573
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:22,509
But it's hot, why don't--

574
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:27,104
Oh, for him. You know,
sometimes your brain amazes me.

575
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:32,706
Thank you. Our drink is water and
bitters, so don't make any remarks.

576
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,511
What are you doing?

577
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:38,302
This is his.
Are three sleeping pills enough?

578
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:41,431
Three's a lot. That's potent stuff.

579
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:44,545
lf a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

581
00:47:46,193 --> 00:47:48,149
Here we go.

00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,552
-Come in.
-Here are your cigarettes.

583
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:57,428
-Hi, Miss Lee.
-l got cocktails all ready.

584
00:47:57,633 --> 00:48:02,149
-Make yourself at home.
-lt's hot in here. Must be 110.

585
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:04,867
She's afraid of catching cold.

586
00:48:05,113 --> 00:48:08,901
Touch of laryngitis.
Here, specialty of the house.

587
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:14,307
-That's quite a cocktail.
-lt's very mild. Let's drink a toast:

588
00:48:14,513 --> 00:48:18,552
There was a fellow named Sidney
Who drank till he ruined a kidney

589
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:22,143
It shriveled and shrank
But he drank and he drank

590
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:24,628
He had fun doing it, didn't he?

591
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:28,826
-Appetizing.
-l know another. Bottoms up.

592
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:40,304
He looks like he'll explode.

593
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:46,111
-What are you made of? What was that?
-Scotch, vodka, brandy and gin.

594
00:48:46,353 --> 00:48:48,469
Here, try this.

595
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:56,466
-That wasn't water!
-No, straight vodka.

596
00:48:56,713 --> 00:49:00,706
Want some more? What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

597
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:04,110
-l'm burning up.
-Let's take off your coat.

00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:08,471
Yes, you'll feel better.
You'll cool off. l'll help.

Excuse me a minute.

-Any luck?
-Not so far.

601
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:20,709
Be sure you check the inside pocket.

602
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:24,787
-lt's not in here.
-lt's not in his coat.

603
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:28,269
There's one other place
it could be: his pants.

-Should l do it alone?

-Two heads are better than one.
-l suppose so.

-Yes, indeed.

Nice glass of water.

00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:58,312
-Your pants are soaked!
-We can't leave him in wet pants.

00:49:58,553 --> 00:50:02,182
-l'll put them under the hair dryer.
-l'll go and change.

-A pleasure.

No, don't say another word.

lt's invasion of privacy.

take advantage of this.

You could, if you put your mind to it.

-Of course.

00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:37,503
Besides, it's only fair l should have
her tiara. After all, she has you.

651
00:52:37,713 --> 00:52:40,432
My dear, my very dear!

652
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:45,070
-Let's get it now.
-Anything you say, my dear.

653
00:52:57,993 --> 00:53:00,632
-Keep an eye on the door.
-Oui, monsieur.

654
00:53:16,353 --> 00:53:20,232
All right, Pierre.
Take this thing back to my cabin.

655
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:26,269
l'll stay here.
Here's the microphone and a dividend.

656
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:28,429
Merci, monsieur.

657
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:32,306
-And leave the door open.
-Oui, monsieur.

658
00:53:35,113 --> 00:53:38,947
Lorelei, they're coming--
How did you get in?

659
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:43,022
-Through the door.
-Still snooping around?

660
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:46,703
Nothing to do with you.
l'm paid to watch the blonde--

661
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:49,302
l'd sure hate to have your job.

662
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:54,911
Checking up on people is messy work,
but only when they're doing things--

663
00:53:55,153 --> 00:53:58,941
Like pretending to make love to a girl
while you spy on her friend?

664
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,872
That part of it is not true.

665
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:07,830
l don't believe anything you say.
Go away, Sherlock, you're a wrong guy.

666
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:11,912
-l'm not wrong about you.
-You're only making it worse.

667
00:54:12,153 --> 00:54:14,713
Don't listen, but l'm telling you--

668
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:18,662
Come on in,
you can hear better in here.

669
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:22,430
Am l intruding, or is he leaving?

670
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:27,866
l'm leaving. But, Miss Lee,
before l go, l'll tell you this.

671
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:32,624
Sometimes even a mercenary nitwit
like you has a decent impulse.

672
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,143
Don't get your friend mixed up
in your schemes.

673
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:41,586
Because l'll rub your nose in them,
and l don't want her to get hurt.

674
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:45,183
lf you've nothing more to say,
pray, scat!

675
00:54:45,393 --> 00:54:47,702
That's about all.

676
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:52,668
Honey, except for telling you
l have money, which l haven't...

677
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:58,869
...everything else l said, l meant.
And it wasn't part of my job either.

678
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,903
Think about it.

679
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:10,702
Why did you just stand there
and let him kiss you?

680
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:15,469
lt's crazy, but l think
l'm falling in love with that slob.

681
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:19,110
You just feel that way
because he's poor.

682
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:23,829
l hope so. Come on, let's change.
We dock in an hour.

683
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:57,986
We want to buy some clothes.
You know, hats, dresses.

684
00:55:58,153 --> 00:55:59,825
(SPEAKS lN FRENCH)

685
00:55:59,993 --> 00:56:01,665
You know some good places?

686

(SPEAKS lN FRENCH)

687
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:06,072
That's where we want to go first.

688
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:29,708
-This has been fun, hasn't it?
-Yes.

689
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,866
lt's the first time
l've shopped without a man along.

690
00:56:39,073 --> 00:56:43,703
You were a big help. l've never
spent so much money so fast.

691
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:45,983
-A pleasure.
-ls that enough?

692
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:50,152
-Thank you.
-We'll be seeing you.

693
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:00,982
Bonjour, madame.

694
00:57:01,153 --> 00:57:04,463
Bonjour. l am the manager.
May l help you?

695
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:08,109
Certainly. Show me a place
to take my shoes off.

696
00:57:08,353 --> 00:57:11,345
Dorothy, a lady never
admits her feet hurt.

697
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,501
Have you reservations?

698
00:57:14,713 --> 00:57:17,830
Yes. ln the name
of Mr. Augustus Esmond.

699
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:20,263
-This is Miss Shaw, l'm Miss Lee.
-Hi.

700
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:25,667
Oh, yes. We have been expecting you.
This way, please.

701
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,311
-Well!
-l thought we'd lose you in Paris.

702
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:38,546
-Are these the persons you spoke of?
-Yes.

703
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:42,712
Lady Piggie. l mean Beekman!
What a pleasant surprise.

704
00:57:42,913 --> 00:57:48,465
l dare say. You may proceed, Pritchard.
This person is Miss Lee.

705
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,222
l represent
the Suffolk lnsurance Company.

706
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:54,105
l never buy insurance.

707
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:58,631
Mr. Malone needs it in his business.
What is all this?

708
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:03,987
lf you return the tiara, l'm willing
to forget this squalid incident.

709
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:10,428
Allow me to clarify. Lady Beekman's
tiara has been reported as stolen.

710
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:15,263
-What's that got to do with us?
-lt's in your possession.

711
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:18,510
-Absolutely not!
-Let Lorelei talk for herself.

712
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:24,305
She'll do better than that.
She'll sue you for slander! Tell them.

713
00:58:24,553 --> 00:58:27,067
-We're waiting.
-None of your business.

714
00:58:27,273 --> 00:58:29,150
lt's very much our business.

715
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:34,422
Just tell them you haven't got it--
Oh, Lorelei, you didn't!

716
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:36,624
l did not steal the tiara.

717
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:41,503
-Then how is it in your possession?
-That's my affair.

718
00:58:41,713 --> 00:58:46,104
-That's one explanation.
-Lord Beekman knows. Ask him.

719
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:50,465
We've already done so.
He denied knowing anything about it...

720
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:53,307
...and departed for Africa.

721
00:58:53,553 --> 00:58:59,742
-Piggie wouldn't do that!
-Are you going to give back the tiara?

722
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:03,668
l wouldn't dream of it.
lt's mine. l'm keeping it.

723
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,831
That remains to be seen.
Come, Pritchard.

724
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:12,866
-You'll find that l mean business.
-Then why are you wearing that hat?

725
00:59:14,793 --> 00:59:16,909
-l want to talk.
-My mind's made up.

726
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:20,702
The simplest way out of this
is to give it back.

727
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:26,670
l do not care to converse with you.
We won't be in to him during our stay.

728
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:30,906
-l regret you will not stay here.
-What now?

729
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:34,828
Esmond canceled your reservation
and letter of credit.

730
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,627
-After hearing from you.
-That's right.

731
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:42,310
l don't believe it.
Mr. Esmond wouldn't do that. Did he?

732
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:47,024
Exactly. He refuses responsibility
for your bills.

733
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:52,227
-We've just spent all of our money.
-That's not our concern.

734
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:55,903
Let's get out of here.
l hear your plumbing is noisy.

735
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:59,423
lf you need help,
l'm at the Elysée Hotel.

736
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:02,101
You hold your breath till l call.

737
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:16,670
Mademoiselle?

738
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:25,066
Café.

739

When love goes wrong

740
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:34,666
Nothing goes right

741
01:00:34,873 --> 01:00:39,071
This one thing I know

742
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:44,309
When love goes wrong

743
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:47,909
A man takes flight

744
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:54,308
And women get uppity

745
01:00:55,313 --> 01:00:58,669
The sun don't beam

746
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:02,183
The moon don't shine

747
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:08,622
The tide don't ebb and flow

748
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:13,269
The clock won't strike

749
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:16,909
A match won't light

750
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:20,662
When love goes wrong

751
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:23,791
Nothing goes right

752
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:28,910
The blues all gather round you

753
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,950
Crazy, mademoiselle!

754
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:37,865
And day is dark as night

755
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:41,869
A man ain't fit...

756
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:45,065
...to live with

757
01:01:45,313 --> 01:01:50,433
And a woman's a sorry sight

758
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:56,745
When love goes wrong

759
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,905
Nothing goes right

760
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:05,705
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

761
01:02:05,873 --> 01:02:08,228
Do it, honey! Do it!

762
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:10,782
When love goes wrong

763
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:15,981
Nothing goes, nothing goes right

764
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:22,506
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

765
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:27,588
Bees don't buzz, fish don't bite
Clock won't strike, match won't light

766
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:31,987
When love goes wrong

767
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:35,464
Nothing goes right

768
01:02:38,873 --> 01:02:42,309
A woman's a fright, a terrible sight

769
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:46,512
Man goes out, gets high as a kite
Love is something you can't fight

770
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:48,988
You can't fight it, honey.

771
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:53,186
When love goes wrong, nothing

772
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:56,305
No bows, honey,
just eight bars and off.

773
01:02:56,553 --> 01:03:00,307
Nothing goes right

774
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:04,110
Just in time.

775
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:10,792
It's like we said
You're better off dead

776
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:16,346
When love has lost its glow

777
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:21,063
So take this down

778
01:03:21,313 --> 01:03:24,111

01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:26,342
-Right over there, monsieur.
-Thank you.

786
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:32,110
Hello. You remember
Mr. Esmond, don't you?

787
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:33,422
Perfectly.

788
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:37,706
Why not say hello?
He used to be a friend of ours.

789
01:04:37,913 --> 01:04:41,462
-Nice to see you again.
-Yes, indeed.

790

-You can come in. lf you don't mind?
-l don't mind if you don't mind.

793
01:04:53,713 --> 01:04:56,671
-Mr. Esmond?
-Thank you.

794
01:04:58,553 --> 01:05:01,021
Aren't you even gonna
say you're sorry?

795
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:07,263
l won't fall in love with a man who
won't trust me, no matter what l do.

796
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:10,869
""No matter what--""?
That's being unreasonable.

797
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:12,990
Well, goodbye, then.

798
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,229
How can l trust you
after all Father's found out?

800
01:05:16,673 --> 01:05:20,461
-We're ready to dress you.
-Be right there.

801
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:23,108
Lorelei, l--

802
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:25,907
Men like you have made me
the way l am.

803
01:05:26,113 --> 01:05:30,311
lf you loved me at all,
you'd feel sorry for my troubles...

804
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:36,065
...instead of holding them against me.
Don't say another word.

805
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:40,224
l wasn't gonna say anything.

806
01:05:40,953 --> 01:05:46,311
You have a tough time. lf you want
to get upset, watch her next number.

807
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:48,469
You mean....

808
01:05:49,673 --> 01:05:52,471
Oh, dear. Thank you.

809
01:07:06,873 --> 01:07:08,670
No!

There's a young man that Dorothy likes.
She's very fond of him.

986
01:20:13,113 --> 01:20:16,583
Dorothy would never speak
to this man again...

987
01:20:16,793 --> 01:20:20,866
...if he did anything
to hurt me, Lorelei.

988
01:20:21,073 --> 01:20:25,271
So l think this young man had
just better know that...

989
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:29,703
...Dorothy thinks
she's in love with him.

990
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:33,869
Mr. Esmond, l resign.
l just quit the case.

991
01:20:34,073 --> 01:20:35,586
Are you crazy?

992
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:39,672
But l like it that way.
Judge, l've changed my mind.

993
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:42,512
l haven't anything to say.

994
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,625
JUDGE:
This becomes more and more confusing.

995
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:50,861
But the solution is simple.
My decision is this:

996
01:20:51,073 --> 01:20:54,349
The property will be placed
in this court's custody...

997
01:20:54,553 --> 01:21:00,025
...until the owner can be established
by an affidavit from Lord Beekman.

998
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:04,272
Now, Miss Lee, you will
give me the tiara.

999
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:08,506
-But l can't.
JUDGE: lf you refuse, you go to prison.

1000
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:11,910
l just haven't got it.
lt was stolen.

1001
01:21:12,153 --> 01:21:15,668
l think l know where that thing is,
and who's got it.

1002
01:21:15,873 --> 01:21:18,990
JUDGE: Who are you?
-A private detective.

1003
01:21:19,193 --> 01:21:24,142
Give me two policemen and wait
half an hour. l can settle this.

1004
01:21:24,353 --> 01:21:26,821
Anything would be better than this.
Go with him.

1005
01:21:26,993 --> 01:21:32,590
(SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH)

1006
01:21:34,393 --> 01:21:36,065
There he is.

1007
01:21:37,913 --> 01:21:39,904
(SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH)

1008
01:21:40,073 --> 01:21:41,870
What's that?

1009
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:44,264
What's he saying?

1010
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:48,428
Speak English!
This is outrageous!

1011
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:50,828
l'm a British subject!

1012
01:21:51,033 --> 01:21:54,582
This is positively outrageous!
l demand a lawyer.

1013
01:21:54,753 --> 01:21:56,584
(SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH)

1014
01:21:56,753 --> 01:21:57,742
What?

1015
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:01,701
-What did you say?
-He says remove your hat.

1016
01:22:01,953 --> 01:22:05,070
Why doesn't he say so?
Send for the consulate.

1017
01:22:05,313 --> 01:22:07,668
-l'll take this.
-Give that back.

1018
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:12,901
This is Sir Francis Beekman.
And this is the missing tiara.

1019
01:22:13,113 --> 01:22:16,150
-That's mine!
-Miss Lee will be glad to return it.

1020
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:18,230
l certainly would.

1021
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:22,472
l believe His Honor asked
Miss Lee for the tiara.

1022
01:22:22,713 --> 01:22:26,467
-l say, that isn't--
-l wouldn't go into that, Mr. Finch.

1023
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:27,827
Finch?

1024
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:30,666
-Miss Lee.
-Thank you.

1025
01:22:33,193 --> 01:22:36,071
-Your Honor.
-Thank you.

1026
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:38,669
Thank you.

1027
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:43,225
-Monsieur Pritchard.
-Thank you. Your Lordship.

1028
01:22:43,433 --> 01:22:44,422
Thank you.

1029
01:22:45,273 --> 01:22:47,229
Case dismissed!

1030
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:50,542
Five minutes ago
you said you'd marry me.

1031
01:22:50,753 --> 01:22:55,304
-That's before Dorothy phoned.
-What made you change your mind?

1032
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:58,311
She just said everything's okay now.

1033
01:22:58,513 --> 01:23:02,950
l don't quite understand--
Oh, dear. Hello, Father.

1034
01:23:03,193 --> 01:23:04,626
Hello, son.

1035
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:09,270
l know why you're here, and l don't
care. l'll make her marry me.

1036
01:23:09,473 --> 01:23:11,384
That's wonderful.

1037
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:16,030
l presume this is the young lady?
A pretty girl. American?

1038
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:18,986
Yes, except on my parents' side.
They're lrish.

1039
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:24,267
l'm delighted. l've wanted to
see you married for a long time.

1040
01:23:24,473 --> 01:23:27,271
Anybody but that monster,
Lorelei Lee.

1041
01:23:27,473 --> 01:23:31,102
But, Mr. Esmond, l am Lorelei Lee!

1042
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:34,504
Pretty early to start teasing
your father-in-law.

1043
01:23:34,713 --> 01:23:38,547
-What's the matter, Father?
-Nothing. l can take a joke.

1044
01:23:38,753 --> 01:23:43,463
What joke? This is Lorelei.
This is nothing to joke about.

1045
01:23:43,713 --> 01:23:48,548
l don't have my driver's license
with me, but take my word for it.

1046
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:53,071
Look, that's l.
See my name?

1047
01:23:53,673 --> 01:23:55,186
FATHER: Oh....

1048
01:23:55,553 --> 01:23:57,987
l'm too old for this sort of thing.

1049
01:23:58,193 --> 01:24:00,946
-l don't understand.
-You don't understand?

1050
01:24:01,153 --> 01:24:05,226
How do you think l feel with
thousands of Lorelei Lees around me?

1051
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:08,231
But you're not marrying any of them!

1052
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:12,142
l love her. l love her very much.
l've never felt--

1053
01:24:12,353 --> 01:24:17,188
Oh, shut up! Young lady,
you don't fool me one bit.

1054
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:20,590
l'm not trying to.
But l bet l could.

1055
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:25,190
You might convince this jackass,
but you'll never convince me.

1056
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:30,228
-That's too bad. l do love him.
-Certainly. For his money.

1057
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,424
No! Honestly.

1058
01:24:32,713 --> 01:24:37,468
You expect me to believe that you
aren't marrying him for his money?

1059
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:41,029
-lt's true.
-Then why do you want to marry him?

1060
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:45,306
-l want to marry him for your money.
-There!

1061
01:24:46,633 --> 01:24:49,306
That's why we need his consent, silly.

1062
01:24:49,513 --> 01:24:53,870
We're getting down to brass tacks.
You admit you're after money.

1063
01:24:54,113 --> 01:24:57,503
No, l don't.
Aren't you funny?

1064
01:24:57,713 --> 01:25:01,945
Don't you know that a rich man
is like a pretty girl?

1065
01:25:02,193 --> 01:25:04,946
You don't marry her
just because she's pretty.

1066
01:25:05,153 --> 01:25:07,542
But, my goodness, doesn't it help?

1067
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:11,792
Would you want your daughter
to marry a poor man?

1068
01:25:11,993 --> 01:25:16,464
You'd want her to have the most
wonderful things in the world.

1069
01:25:16,673 --> 01:25:19,312
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?

1070
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:21,464
Well, l concede that--

1071
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:25,552
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid.

1072
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:29,945
l can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.

1073
01:25:30,153 --> 01:25:33,782
Except Gus.
He's interested in my brains.

1074
01:25:34,033 --> 01:25:38,743
-No, that much of a fool he's not.
-You've changed your mind?

1075
01:25:38,993 --> 01:25:44,545
-l just don't know what to tell you.
-Daddy?

1076
01:25:44,793 --> 01:25:47,546
Not you. l guess l mean ""Sonny.""

1077
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:51,069
Give me three minutes
alone with your father.

1078
01:25:51,273 --> 01:25:54,026
-Run along, darling.
-Yes, dear.

1079
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,747
Now, about what we were speaking.

1080
01:25:56,953 --> 01:26:01,105
There's a great deal to consider.
l just can't answer....

1081
01:26:11,873 --> 01:26:14,910
Please, take your places.

1082
01:26:27,993 --> 01:26:32,305
Remember, on your wedding day
it's all right to say yes.

1083
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:42,707
We're just two little girls
From Little Rock

1084
01:26:43,993 --> 01:26:50,182
And we lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

1085
01:26:51,433 --> 01:26:55,346
But at last we won the big crusade

1086
01:26:55,593 --> 01:27:01,031
Looks like we finally made the grade

1087
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:15,342
Square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape

1088
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:21,105
Diamonds
Diamonds

1089
01:27:21,273 --> 01:27:27,303
Diamonds are a girl's...
Diamonds are a girl's...

1090
01:27:27,473 --> 01:27:31,910
...best friend
