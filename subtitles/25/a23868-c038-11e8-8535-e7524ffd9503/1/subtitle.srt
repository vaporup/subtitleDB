1
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,953
There´s always a price to pay
when you hire an assassin -

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,998
from ten to hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

3
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,390
Recently, a mysterious killer
has appeared in Hong Kong.

4
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,438
He asks for no payment
for his services.

5
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,991
He eliminates his targets - all evil
men - because they deserve to die.

6
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,230
In the world of professional killers,

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,949
this vigilante is considered
to be the king of killers.

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,431
Others who live in fear know him
as the ´´Angel of Death´´

9
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,598
Check Zone A.

10
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,557
You check Zone B.

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,437
Make sure everything´s in order.

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,873
Follow me.

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,676
- Good evening, sir.
- All levels have been secured, sir.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,436
- Is the boss still in there?
- Yes, sir.

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,033
Stay alert.

16
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,798
Of all women, I find the Chinese
are the most exciting in bed.

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,838
How could they
be better than Japanese women?

18
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,549
Because their strong sense of moral
values makes them highly reserved.

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,394
I remember sleeping with them
during the war.

20
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,029
I´d hear their screams of pain,
begging me to stop,

21
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,714
but it just made me more excited.

22
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,519
Japanese women can do that too.

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,554
No, it´s not the same at all.

24
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,278
How I long for those days.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,393
Find out what´s happening!

26
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,674
Sasaki?

27
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,833
- What´s going on?
- We´re checking, don´t worry, sir.

28
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,070
- Check for intruders.
- Sir!

29
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,792
Some sake?

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,358
Something´s wrong with the monitor.
Check it out.

31
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,711
Sir, he´s out cold.
Someone must´ve broken in.

32
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,313
Check the surrounding monitors.

33
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,233
Shut all elevator power immediately!
Do you read me?

34
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,311
Control, do you read me?

35
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,433
Sasaki?

36
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,713
Shut up!

37
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,959
So, who hired you to kill me?

38
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,235
I´ll make you an offer.

39
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,717
I´ll pay you three times what he did.

40
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,955
You have no idea
who you´re dealing with.

41
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,993
If you kill me,
you´ll also end up dead.

42
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,959
You´ll be hunted down by professional
hitmen from all over the world.

43
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,715
Yes, and whoever kills you
will receive a huge reward.

44
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,194
They´ll all be after your head.
So if I were you, I´d just go.

45
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,838
Leave while you still can.

46
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,635
You stupid idiot! You´ve just signed
your own death warrant!

47
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,959
Excuse me.

48
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,797
- Ma´am, I...
- One minute.

49
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,996
But you gave me the wrong change.

50
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,232
It says there that these are on sale
for half this price.

51
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,316
Let me see. Hey, Jerry, you forgot
to remove the old tags again.

52
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,877
Can I have my money back?

53
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,473
I already punched it in.

54
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,597
Do me a favour,
go and get something else!

55
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,636
But I´ve got everything I need.

56
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,508
Can´t you see the queue?
You´re delaying the other customers!

57
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,394
Then give me my change.

58
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,588
- There!
- Thanks.

59
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,477
Hey, you cheat, move on.

60
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,397
Hello there.

61
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,716
..I walked behind him,
and called out.

62
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,509
He turned around and I shot him!
Right in the forehead!

63
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,114
His head exploded like a watermelon!

64
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,510
I left him there,
his brains splattered everywhere!

65
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,997
Shooting through the heart
is much cleaner and quicker.

66
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,914
Joey, don´t you have
another assignment for us yet?

67
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,911
We could do with the cash.

68
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,956
There´s one coming up,
and you´re all in.

69
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,030
- Fred, have you called your mom yet?
- No.

70
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,712
She´s your only family, right?

71
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,920
In that case, why don´t you come? You
could get lots of money to send her.

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,151
Why don´t you buy
a new pair of pants?

73
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,196
These are very comfortable.

74
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,719
All right, you two,
you´ll be coming with me to Macao.

75
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,109
Joey, can I use this a while?

76
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,516
You´ve got some nerve
freeloading off me like this!

77
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,957
- Joey, I haven´t called my mother...
- I don´t give a damn!

78
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,873
I gave you that assignment
to kill Mrs Chu...

79
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,837
and you repair her drainpipes!

80
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,629
She needed my help -
besides she reminded me of my mom.

81
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,918
What about that knife I gave you
you used to cut your target´s steak?

82
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,956
But he couldn´t even chew properly.

83
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,510
And you call yourself
a soldier of the Golden Triangle.

84
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,718
Some tough guy! Maybe you should
leave and stop wasting my time.

85
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,394
All I really need is one big hit.

86
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,075
- Not for just a few thousand...
- Like a hundred million?

87
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,516
- Are you kidding?
- Do I look like I´m kidding?

88
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,469
- A hundred million US dollars!
- Let me do it, boss. Come on!

89
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,074
Get serious!
These guys want first-class killers.

90
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,630
- I could be a first-class killer.
- Really.

91
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,157
You look more like first-class jerks
to me. Hell, forget about Macao.

92
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,516
- Hey, come on, boss.
- Wait up, wait up.

93
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,074
Joey, could you tell me
where I can sign up for that?

94
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,116
Please, help me.

95
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,156
You really want that job?

96
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,834
OK, go to the Tsukamoto Centre
tomorrow morning.

97
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,278
Someone might just notice
your rags and toss you a few cents.

98
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,119
Eiji, the fund manager´s here.
You´d better come and meet him.

99
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,190
Eiji, what is your problem?

100
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,719
I was wondering how
a great man such as my grandfather

101
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,998
could end up with such
a worthless son, the likes of you.

102
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,958
You´ve no right
to talk to me like that.

103
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,634
It was your father who was killed

104
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,996
and you´re not doing anything
to avenge his death.

105
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,071
He´s taken care of that.

106
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,477
Only because
you don´t have the guts to do it.

107
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,269
Useless people like you
will be the downfall of Japan.

108
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,919
You´re not even capable of running
your own father´s business.

109
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,958
Well, I´m in charge now.
I´ve inherited everything.

110
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,833
You don´t even have
a sense of honour.

111
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,798
That´s what grandfather and I
had in common.

112
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,189
Eiji, your grandfather´s ashes
are in there!

113
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,230
No! No!

114
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,436
These are my grandfather´s ashes.

115
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,717
Eat them and he shall live
inside you. Go on!

116
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,949
You´re mad!

117
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,355
You´re nothing but an old coward.

118
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,477
You don´t deserve
his ashes inside you.

119
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,999
No! Stop!

120
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,993
You really are mad!

121
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,075
The board will hear about this.
Let´s go! Come on! Come on!

122
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,835
Sorry, Father. I´m afraid
they won´t listen to you any longer.

123
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,471
I have Grandfather´s soul, so they
have no choice but to follow me now.

124
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,471
You´re all mad!

125
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,598
Phew, he stinks!

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,315
´´A Day in the Life
of a Professsional Killer.´´

127
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,472
Grandpa, that man is really smelly.

128
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,152
Quiet, now.

129
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,917
The woman who just came in
is Anita May.

130
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,629
She´s 33 years old and runs
a prestigious modelling agency.

131
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,439
No criminal record,
but according to Interpol,

132
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,751
she´s involved in
some of the biggest crimes in Europe.

133
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,435
She recruits top European hitmen
to assassinate political figures.

134
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,717
She probably gets her clients
from her modelling agency.

135
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,558
- This is coffee?
- Well, it´s decaff, sir.

136
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,599
What´s the point in drinking coffee
if it´s decaff? Forget it.

137
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,395
This is Chris Crado,
42 years old, runs a liquor business,

138
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,038
no criminal record, sir.

139
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,078
Aside from selling vodka,

140
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,039
he acts as an agent for Russian gangs
operating all over Asia.

141
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,829
Therefore he could easily get
in touch with Russian assassins.

142
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,515
So why have all these agents appeared
at the Tsukamoto Centre?

143
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
Aren´t they afraid
of being caught together?

144
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,756
It´s because they all want the
one hundred million dollar reward.

145
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,718
If you were a hitman,
you´d be here too.

146
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,236
- Something´s up, Captain.
- Zoom in, please.

147
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,071
Look, if you don´t have
an invitation, you´d better leave.

148
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,675
Just give me a chance.
I´m the man for the job.

149
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,320
What the hell are you talking about?

150
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,994
- Please...
- Get out of here...

151
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,798
I really need the money and...

152
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,032
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Please, let me go, sir.

153
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,997
Are you deaf? I said leave.

154
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,195
Stop! Hold it right there! Do you
morons have any idea who this man is?

155
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,669
He may stink and look like hell,

156
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,638
but he´s also the top hitman
in Mainland China!

157
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,032
- So you´re an assassin?
- I served at the Golden Triangle.

158
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,031
Great! Just play it by ear.

159
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,955
What? Do you know me?
Do you have any idea who I am? Well?

160
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,068
You want to see my invitation?
Well, all you have to do is ask.

161
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,517
Now, you listen. I want to speak
to your superior right away.

162
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,115
- I am the superior.
- Then you understand the problem.

163
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,952
Jerk, here!

164
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,349
I´ll take you in,
but you do exactly what I say.

165
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,632
Can you repeat that in Chinese?

166
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,029
And in Japanese, if you like.

167
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,916
Have you prepared
the bank draft, sir?

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,275
Five million dollars in a Swiss bank.

169
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,839
Thank you.

170
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,878
- Five million?
- That´s just for deposit.

171
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,197
Attention, please. My name is Martin,
I´m Mr Tsukamoto´s fund manager.

172
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,159
If you need a translator,
use the earpiece in front of you

173
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,754
and tune in
to the desired language channel.

174
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,513
You´re all aware of Mr Tsukamoto´s
recent assassination.

175
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,038
His will states that a reward
will be offered to avenge his death.

176
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,953
Please turn on the computers
in front of you.

177
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,955
Each of you has an account at
a Swiss bank with a balance of $5.

178
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,433
Please enter your four-digit private
code - your ID for your account.

179
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,954
Whoever completes the mission

180
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,512
will automatically receive the reward
into his or her account.

181
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,192
And for everyone´s convenience,

182
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,716
I´ve filed all the details regarding
the death in your computers.

183
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,112
You´ve all received the same
information to ensure a fair deal.

184
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,316
I´ll repeat the terms again.

185
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,154
The killer and the mastermind
are worth 50 million dollars each.

186
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,836
If they are the same person,
then he is worth 100 million dollars.

187
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,118
If there´s official evidence
that either one doesn´t exist

188
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,558
or is already dead, the full reward
is for the remaining target.

189
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,039
Ah, the right target. The right
target will be identified by us.

190
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,556
We form a special committee
set up by Mr Tsukamoto.

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,278
Regarding our professional details,

192
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,591
all information can be accessed
on your computer.

193
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,800
Lastly, I want to make this clear -
we do not encourage lawbreakers.

194
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,711
We won´t be held responsible

195
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,712
should you become involved
in any illegal activities -

196
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,199
you´ll also be disqualified.

197
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,635
- Police!
- This is a search warrant.

198
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,111
Everyone please remain in your seats
and take out your identification.

199
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,590
You´re all suspected of being
involved in international crimes.

200
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,831
Please cooperate,
if you don´t want any trouble.

201
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,436
I´d be more careful, if I were you.
We have two lawyers here, Officer.

202
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,999
What´s happening here?

203
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,038
We´re in the middle
of a legitimate business deal.

204
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,918
I´ll have my secretary
send you a report.

205
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,353
Great!

206
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
Why do you have
so many discount coupons?

207
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,352
- I collect them.
- And why so many coins?

208
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,032
He collects them also, so?

209
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,318
- And this knife?
- What about it? It´s for cooking.

210
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
- Can´t he speak?
- I´m his manager.

211
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,270
Everyone with talent needs a manager.

212
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,032
So what´s your talent?

213
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,951
He´s a great gymnast.

214
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,191
He´s also good at running,
although he needs more training.

215
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,714
His record´s
9.9 seconds for 100 metres.

216
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,158
Let´s go, men.

217
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,957
Aren´t we going to arrest them?

218
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,474
If they want to play with fire...

219
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,555
- Isn´t that Tsukamoto´s grandson?
- Yes, he´s joining the hunt.

220
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,517
Are family allowed take part?

221
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,959
Mr Tsukamoto, sir.

222
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,079
I don´t like being interrupted
before my meal. What do you want?

223
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,072
Actually, I also
have an appointment - a bridge game.

224
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,072
And I promised my friends
I wouldn´t be late.

225
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,832
You Chinese talk a lot.

226
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,638
If I were you, I´d get to the point.

227
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,192
Your mere presence
is starting to irritate my men.

228
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,958
All right.
I´ve gathered some new information.

229
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,952
If it´s about my grandfather´s death,
I already know everything.

230
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,316
Of course,
but something new has come up.

231
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,153
Since your grandfather
didn´t want the police involved,

232
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,835
we had to use all our influence
to avoid an autopsy.

233
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,070
But we had someone examine him.

234
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,720
And he discovered something
very interesting.

235
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,713
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

236
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,952
I´ll give you the information,
but I want something in return.

237
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,793
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, right?

238
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,233
And the others?

239
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,440
You´ll be first to get any news,
so long as you pay $100 each time.

240
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,833
Aren´t you the least bit
scared of me?

241
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,152
I am, but I´m more afraid
of living miserably. Right?

242
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,196
You can cash this cheque
any time of day.

243
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,073
I just hope
your information is worth it.

244
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,316
What we found in your grandfather´s
body was a military banknote,

245
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,072
dating from the Second World War.

246
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,957
We still haven´t decoded it,

247
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,237
but our computers
will fix that in no time.

248
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,596
- When?
- After I´ve cashed this cheque.

249
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,875
Your meal is ready, Master Eiji.

250
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,910
Remove the extra setting, he´s not
eating, he might ruin my appetite.

251
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,120
No problem,
I don´t eat sashimi anyway.

252
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,952
In fact, I hate it.

253
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,673
On that night,

254
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,435
most of the security cameras were
destroyed by Tsukomoto´s murderer.

255
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,514
But we do have some videos, recorded
days before the murder occurred.

256
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,354
They also gave us a video
recorded the night of the murder.

257
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,317
But although the killer is visible,

258
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,234
he can´t be identified
as his back is to the camera.

259
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,437
Bill, you´ve seen the tape,
what do you think?

260
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,080
I think
he´s been in the centre before.

261
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,517
He knew his way around and where
all the cameras were located.

262
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,071
So there´s no doubt he´d given
the place a thorough going over.

263
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,273
Maybe he got hold of the blueprints.

264
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,399
But most of the cameras were
installed under a month ago, sir.

265
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,233
The blueprints wouldn´t tell him
where they were.

266
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,595
How do we trace the killer, then?

267
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,592
Well, we could run his image
through the computer,

268
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,910
together with anyone
who has been there.

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,755
All right, get video tapes dating
back a month and start with that.

270
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,193
Yes, sir.

271
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,159
And Bill, don´t let anyone
into the computer room.

272
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,999
They used to be bigger.
What a rip off!

273
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,033
What are you looking at?
You pervert!

274
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,553
Get lost!

275
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,868
Take it easy.

276
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,315
He was staring
right down my cleavage!

277
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,196
So, you like my watch?

278
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,353
It´s a Rolex, 24 karat gold-plated
and diamond studded.

279
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,878
It´s to commemorate the reunification
of Hong Kong with Mainland China.

280
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,317
- Have it!
- I´ve never had a watch before.

281
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,231
Now, I have a Rolex.

282
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,870
Don´t get too excited, it´s a fake.

283
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,474
You don´t expect the real thing,
do you?

284
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,155
Even so, in Tsim Sha Tsui,
this would cost about $800!

285
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,152
This is the most expensive gift
I´ve ever received!

286
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,754
- You´re a Chinaman, all right.
- What?

287
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,231
It´s just that Mainland hitmen
charge between 40 and 50 thousand.

288
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,232
You get 80 thousand
with 10 thousand down payment.

289
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,629
But the reward was 100 million!

290
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,998
I´m your agent, right? I have to pay
for everything, meals, transportation

291
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,548
and I have to pay my informers.

292
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,950
Don´t you think your share
is just a little excessive?

293
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,191
I invested 5 million dollars
without even knowing you.

294
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,750
No-one would do that!
Or would you rather forget it?

295
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,115
How about we split 60-40?

296
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,875
- Not a chance!
- What about 70-30?

297
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,316
All right, 80-20
and I´ll take the down payment.

298
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,390
First of all, I just
want to make sure you can fight.

299
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,040
And you must do everything
I tell you.

300
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,395
Then tell me what you want.

301
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,995
- You know what...
- Hey, you! Enough of your noise!

302
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,354
You´ve got 30 seconds.

303
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,596
I´ll give you something
to shout about! Get lost!

304
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,511
You son-of-a-bitch!

305
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,038
15 seconds, Norman.

306
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,551
Sorry, I didn´t mean to...

307
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,878
Sorry, lady, excuse me.

308
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,988
You wouldn´t dare hit a woman!
Come on! Run away then!

309
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,158
- What?
- But she´s a lady.

310
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,313
You don´t hit ladies?
I´d better look for someone else.

311
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,958
Wait, Norman!

312
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,518
What you need
is a whole new wardrobe,

313
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,558
if you want to be taken seriously
as a professional.

314
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,269
There´s nothing more impressive
than a stylish killer.

315
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,358
- What´s the matter?
- This costs $19,000!

316
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,716
Well, if you dress expensive,
you look expensive.

317
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,438
That´s how it works.

318
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,277
I was wondering if you could help us.
You see, my friend here, ah...

319
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,079
he wants to try a new style.

320
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,716
The ideal material is polyester.

321
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,637
It´s soft and tightly knit,

322
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,792
so you won´t leave fibres
on the crime scene.

323
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,713
Long coats are good
for carrying weapons.

324
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,157
Black suits look smarter and slicker.
And as for the hair...

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,349
always use mousse to avoid leaving
hair or dandruff on the scene.

326
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,155
- What are they for?
- To make you look smarter.

327
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,074
I´ll be in touch.
Take this pager.

328
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,318
Where´s my down payment?

329
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,356
What about all these new clothes!

330
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,435
Listen, don´t follow me, all right?

331
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,158
You will call?

332
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,954
These clothes cost me $19,000,
of course I´ll call.

333
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,354
His name is Norman Lu,
alias Crocodile Lu.

334
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,396
His file´s about an inch thick -

335
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,712
theft, selling of porno tapes,
swindling and illegal gambling.

336
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,554
I´m sure he´s up to another scam,
acting as an agent.

337
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,200
He did invest $5
just like the others.

338
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,840
Maybe he´s cheating
the other agents, sir.

339
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,276
He may be a swindler
but he´s not that smart.

340
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,271
So, what´s he doing here?

341
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,635
Are there any answers
in your computer?

342
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,280
- No, sir.
- Let´s go, then.

343
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,798
Is there something wrong
with what I´m wearing?

344
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,030
Course not, Fred, you look great.

345
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,680
By the way, what´s today´s date?

346
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,197
- The fourteenth.
- Ah, fourteen! One and four.

347
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,469
I better find you a job
since you need some cash.

348
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,318
Order whatever you want.

349
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,599
Yeah, you´re looking for
an exterminator?

350
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,998
What´s the salary?

351
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,038
That´s all?

352
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,232
No thanks, we´re not interested, bye.

353
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,954
But, aren´t we
going after the killer?

354
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,591
We still have to work in the
meantime. We have to earn a living.

355
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,872
Go ahead and eat.

356
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,679
Someone told me
he´s in a retirement home.

357
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,312
- I heard he died a long time ago.
- Why didn´t you say so?

358
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,235
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Have any of you seen Mr Leung lately?

359
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,072
Ah, yes, Mr Leung!

360
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,075
Yes, do you know where he is?

361
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,438
Well, you should ask Mrs Leung
about that. She knows everything.

362
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,512
I bet! Thanks.

363
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,354
Wait! We were just kidding.
You´re looking for old man Leung?

364
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,793
That´s right.

365
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,829
- He´s been missing for a while.
- He hasn´t come for tea in ages.

366
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,951
Excuse me, enjoy your tea.

367
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,636
Now there´s a hard worker.
Did you see all the pagers he had?

368
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,271
- You ate all that?
- No, I left this for you.

369
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,433
How could you eat so much?
I´ll deal with you later.

370
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,919
What an appetite!

371
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,832
Jim, what´s new, a new target? Good!
You gave the job to someone else?

372
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,596
But I´ve got this guy, he´s just
come from America, he´s really slick.

373
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,629
How did I get him? He wanted to spend
some time in South East Asia,

374
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,191
so he came to Hong Kong to see
his old friend. 50 thousand´s fine.

375
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,718
Of course not, he comes out in a rash
if he doesn´t kill regularly.

376
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,439
Whoever gets him first,
gets the money?

377
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,670
OK, OK, count us in then.

378
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,996
Who´s the target? Yeah... Right...
OK, get the money ready, thanks.

379
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,119
What a pig!

380
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,158
I eat three meals in one
to save time.

381
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,471
More like three months of meals.
I think we´d better leave.

382
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,279
- Wait, want take away?
- Take away?

383
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,196
The terms of our business agreement
are as follows:

384
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,317
Sometimes you may be required
to maim a target.

385
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,520
8,000 for the left hand, 10,000 for a
leg, and 20% discount for both legs.

386
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,034
- And the right hand?
- That´s free.

387
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,192
- Why?
- It always gets in the way.

388
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,598
So it ends up as a freebie.

389
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,879
Why don´t you look around
for a while?

390
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,313
What about you?

391
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,598
I don´t know the target,
so l´ve got to find my informer.

392
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,312
- But there´s so many kids around.
- Want me to chase them away first?

393
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,958
Wait here.

394
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,274
- I want some candy.
- Give me a pink one.

395
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,716
Just hit the tile and you win, go on!

396
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,791
Aw, you missed!

397
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,030
I can do it, watch.

398
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,548
- Need some help?
- No thanks.

399
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,394
OK, if I lose your dollar,
I´ll give you five back.

400
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,913
Deal!

401
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,319
Try number two tile, I want Big Bird!

402
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,958
That one?

403
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,831
Hooray! I won Big Bird!

404
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,428
Here you are mister,
toss another coin!

405
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,238
- What number?
- Try number one.

406
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,150
- Here mister, try it again!
- All right, one at a time, kids.

407
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,993
That´s great, mister!

408
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,433
There you go.

409
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,156
A bunny! I won a bunny!

410
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,429
No, kids. Sorry but we´re closed,
come back tomorrow, OK?

411
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,830
- Sorry, kids. Did you have fun?
- Yeah!

412
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,838
An assassin who loves children,
isn´t that sweet?

413
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,429
I shouldn´t have underestimated
a man of your calibre.

414
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,033
What do you mean?

415
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,079
Your target´s just over there.
Do the job, I´ll be nearby.

416
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,912
Wait! Who´s the target?

417
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,358
I thought you knew.

418
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,431
- Where´d you get the toys?
- From that man.

419
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,559
The Father of that kid. The kid likes
you, that should make it easier.

420
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,156
Just go over there
and cut his heart out. Piece of cake!

421
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,268
Go on, it´s getting late.
Just think of the cash. Go on.

422
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,238
That´s right. Don´t let me down.

423
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,239
Think of the reward.

424
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,674
Hey, Fred, have you called your mom?

425
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,751
- Not for ages.
- Me neither.

426
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,513
I just shot him!
Right in the forehead!

427
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,398
His head exploded like a watermelon.

428
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,671
Get down!

429
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,435
- Fred!
- Leave the kid alone.

430
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,033
You want him yourself.

431
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,994
- Help me! Help me!
- Sorry, I can´t!

432
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,434
Not me! That guy!

433
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,515
You! Drop the gun! Drop it!

434
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,038
Freeze! I said freeze!

435
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,994
- Hands up!
- I didn´t do anything.

436
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,196
- OK, Norman, let´s start again...
- Captain Kwan.

437
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,669
What were you doing at the carnival?

438
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,159
Having fun.

439
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,550
Having fun?
Children have fun at carnivals.

440
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,029
Well, times are changing -

441
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,069
these days, men are even selling
women´s lingerie and wearing it too!

442
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,796
We found your fingerprints
on the dead man´s gun. Explain.

443
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,476
Your fingerprints are on my wallet.

444
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,315
If my fingerprints are on this desk,
does that mean this desk is mine?

445
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,757
About the deceased, he´s from your
home town, so you know him, right?

446
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,478
I didn´t know him.

447
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,429
All right - explain your relationship
with Norman Lu.

448
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,839
Norman´s my friend.

449
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,988
Not just a friend, a close friend.

450
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,390
You´re lying,
that Mainlander is a criminal!

451
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,550
Oh, I see, a criminal, huh?

452
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,156
Look, whoever you are, you have
no right to accuse an innocent man.

453
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,879
This is what we get for saving lives.

454
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,599
Where were your people
when it happened?

455
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,835
Captain,
someone´s bailing out Norman Lu.

456
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,309
- Who?
- His daughter and a lawyer.

457
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,034
This is my daughter,
who just happens to be a lawyer.

458
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,873
- Hi, honey.
- What is it this time?

459
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,598
Nothing to do with me.

460
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,310
Don´t lie, someone´s just died
and I´m sure you know something.

461
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,555
Can you bail my friend out too?

462
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,471
Just what kind of friend?

463
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,753
Excuse me.

464
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,911
This is my friend.

465
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,151
You´re improving -
no scars, no tattoos.

466
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,753
Everything´s arranged.

467
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,990
No problems, you´re free to leave.

468
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,519
- And this man?
- He needs to be bailed out too.

469
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,229
- No problem. I´ll take care of it.
- Thanks a lot.

470
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,276
David, I´ll join you.

471
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,949
- That´s your daughter?
- That´s right. Why do you ask?

472
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,756
What? She takes after
her mother, all right?

473
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,393
I´m warning you...

474
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,151
don´t even think about it.

475
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,238
Got that?

476
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,631
´´Police Station´´

477
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,270
Wait for me here while I get the car.

478
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,793
David, wait.

479
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,071
I never expected your daughter
to be a budding lawyer.

480
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,673
Life´s full of surprises.

481
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,638
I couldn´t help noticing
some tension there.

482
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,157
What? She´s just cool
and reserved like me.

483
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,198
We treat each other
in a mature fashion -

484
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,751
since we´re living in modern times -
not that you´d know about that.

485
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,398
No, I guess not.

486
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,190
The boss is looking for you.

487
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,318
- Thanks for saving my life.
- You´re welcome.

488
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,269
Here´s $5,000. My card´s in there -
if you need anything, just call.

489
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,918
- Wow, $5,000.
- Is it real? Sure looks real.

490
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,675
You should´ve killed that guy,
then you´d have got $15,000.

491
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,912
Here´s your $1,500. You think small.
You should´ve had a bigger share.

492
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,353
Nice going.

493
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,399
Your pager.

494
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,113
- Drop him off at the corner.
- OK.

495
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,154
- You can go now.
- How will we keep in touch?

496
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,596
I´ll find you.
Go on, get out of here.

497
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,753
Give me a call.

498
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,157
- I´m sorry.
- It´s OK. After all, we are family.

499
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,791
I wasn´t talking to you. David bails
you out whenever you´re in trouble.

500
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,713
- So? He is dating you.
- You´re embarrassing.

501
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,794
No, it´s not OK.
You´re always doing this to me.

502
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,233
What?

503
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,155
You´ve been in and out of jail
since I was a child.

504
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,117
I always felt so embarrassed.

505
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,716
I decided to study law
just so I could bail you out.

506
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,759
One time our teacher asked us
to write about our fathers.

507
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,673
I couldn´t write a single word,
you know why?

508
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,911
Because I couldn´t think
of one nice thing to say.

509
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,590
Come on, Kelly,
don´t embarrass me in front of David.

510
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,353
It´s OK, we´re almost family, sir.

511
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,915
- Stop that!
- Look, just drop me off over there.

512
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,113
Thanks David.

513
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,633
- Yeah? What is it?
- I´m sorry for being nasty.

514
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,879
Just think about what I´ve said.

515
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,873
Sir? Stay out of trouble...

516
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,233
Sure.

517
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,756
To hell with that dumb Mainlander.

518
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,832
I can make it without him.
I´m a survivor.

519
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,799
Hi, Jack. Right...
do you know where Mr Lu might be?

520
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,678
No, no news, huh?

521
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,389
Can you lend me $20,000?
I´ll be... Jack?

522
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,393
Hey!

523
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,232
Your fridge is broken.

524
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,438
- How did you find me?
- I followed you home.

525
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,351
Aren´t you the sly one.

526
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,034
You should´ve told me
you were coming.

527
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,475
Would you have let me in?

528
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,348
Don´t be ridiculous!
I did sense someone was in here.

529
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,874
You picked the lock, right?

530
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,520
No, I came in through the window.

531
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,558
Right! I was just about to say that.

532
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,830
- Yours?
- I decided to move in with you.

533
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,869
That´s great! I would have suggested
it myself, only I didn´t know how.

534
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,750
- Where should I sleep then?
- Through there.

535
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,718
Kelly used to sleep here.

536
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,590
Now she stays in the hostel,
so I turned it into a spare room.

537
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,639
- Smells nice.
- What do you expect? Get some rest.

538
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,598
W-w-what if I slept with you instead?

539
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,832
- No, I talk in my sleep.
- How do you know that?

540
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,319
My girlfriends tell me.

541
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,599
Besides, I might end up telling you
all my secrets. Just stay here.

542
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,233
I´m so glad he´s staying.

543
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,958
What´s wrong?

544
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,237
Should I sleep on the bed
or on the floor?

545
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,836
It doesn´t really matter,
sleep anywhere you like.

546
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,315
- Is it good?
- Very.

547
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,358
When you´re through,
I want you to read these.

548
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,955
Tells you all about how
to be a first class killer.

549
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,996
But I can´t understand English.

550
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,312
So what? - Just look at the pictures,
like you´re reading a Playboy mag.

551
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,719
Here, take a look.

552
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,839
It says here, when you´re in
a restaurant, you should sit sideways

553
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,354
so you can get at your gun.

554
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,908
But everyone would know
I was a killer.

555
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,798
Exactly:
´´How to be a well known killer.´´

556
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,156
A real killer only carries his gun
on a mission.

557
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,153
That´s in here too, see?

558
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,038
You´ll get all the pointers
you need in here.

559
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,032
Forget it. I already know
what´s written in there.

560
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,714
So you think
you know everything already.

561
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,873
All right, then show me.
How do you hold a gun?

562
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,952
- Where is it?
- Here, use the banana.

563
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,673
- But this isn´t a gun.
- Use your imagination.

564
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,356
- Bang!
- Is that how you´ve been trained?

565
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,953
Some soldier you are.

566
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,031
You should stand erect,
facing straight ahead.

567
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,998
Support your right hand,
hold your breath,

568
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,311
and then you fire
at your intended target...

569
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,591
You´re eating your gun! I can´t
believe you´re eating your gun!

570
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,433
It´s a banana, all right? Not a gun.

571
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,398
Here´s a gun.

572
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,155
- It´s rusty.
- No, it isn´t, it´s an antique.

573
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,550
It´s the first real gun
I ever had. Here.

574
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,036
Watch where you point that thing.

575
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,833
- Have you ever shot someone?
- Have you?

576
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,229
Hell, I´ve shot lots of people.

577
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,232
I was known as the lean,
mean killing machine.

578
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,757
Anything I could get my hands on
I turned into a weapon.

579
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,799
I could use practically anything.
I killed three people every two days.

580
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,438
I remember a time...

581
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,033
How´s it going?

582
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,753
We´ve already ruled out 50%
of those who´ve been in the building.

583
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,718
That leaves us
200 more tapes to scan.

584
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,638
Let´s leave the computer running.
We´re wasting time.

585
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,395
We´d better keep an eye on Eiji.
Come on.

586
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,398
Your father isn´t back yet.

587
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,234
- I´ll watch the car.
- I´ll get my things.

588
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,759
Why are you here?

589
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,435
Your father invited me.
He said you wouldn´t mind.

590
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,795
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

591
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,154
What about my closet?

592
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,879
I´d nowhere else to hang my clothes.

593
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,554
There´ll be trouble
if there´s anything missing.

594
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,793
Did you touch her?

595
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,277
No, I slept on the floor.
I never touched her.

596
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,319
I hope not,
she´s never slept with a man before.

597
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,231
So she´s a girl then?

598
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,438
What are you doing here?

599
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,913
David, could you put these
in the car, please?

600
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,474
Did you meet my father in prison?

601
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,798
Could you help me
bring my things down?

602
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,233
All right.

603
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,275
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

604
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,037
David, watch your step.

605
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,911
Wait!

606
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,919
See you.

607
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,633
Could we talk?

608
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,235
David, I´ll call you later.

609
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,069
Let´s go.

610
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,436
- Where to?
- Somewhere we can talk.

611
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,240
That sly bastard!

612
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,960
Hello? Hey, Martin, what´s up?

613
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,638
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

614
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,110
- Want some ice cream?
- You don´t mind?

615
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,872
Of course not.

616
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,836
You can buy one over there.

617
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,788
- Never mind.
- Sure?

618
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,353
Isn´t she great?
I used to do that when I was a girl.

619
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,991
I used to love skating then,
so my father promised to bring me.

620
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,548
But I knew he wouldn´t.

621
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,838
Finally I came alone
and I skated the whole daylong.

622
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,831
I didn´t want to leave.

623
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,072
The attendants had to call my father
at closing time.

624
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,638
I can even remember the argument
we had by those stairs.

625
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,757
- You know why he got mad?
- Cos you ran away?

626
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,353
That wasn´t it.

627
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,240
He said he never
promised me anything.

628
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,992
I was heartbroken.

629
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,390
Once I realised he never kept
his promises anyway,

630
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,040
I went up to him and said:

631
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,669
´´I will never, ever trust you again.´´

632
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,552
Give him another chance.

633
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,554
Come on,
I´ll teach you to skate.

634
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,553
Well?

635
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,433
Easy, isn´t it?

636
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,916
Come on, I´ll lead you.
Here. There you go.

637
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,432
So, you´re from the Mainland?

638
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,193
Yeah, I was a soldier back there.

639
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,398
My mom lives there and I told her
that when I´ve made it,

640
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,950
I´ll come back and build
a lovely big house for her.

641
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,828
But I don´t even have enough money
to build a toilet.

642
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,233
What´s so funny?

643
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,437
For someone who´s shy,
you talk a lot.

644
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,518
Well, since you told me
so much about yourself,

645
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,756
I thought I´d do the same.

646
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,877
You didn´t meet my dad in prison,
did you?

647
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,319
So what´s my father up to now?
Don´t lie to me now, I can tell.

648
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,956
Do you really want to know?

649
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,839
Is that why you wanted us to talk?

650
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,952
To be honest I´ve no idea what
his plans are. But he´s using me.

651
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,033
Let´s make a deal.

652
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,634
- What?
- Give me you finger.

653
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,631
From now on,

654
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,429
promise that you´ll tell me
everything my father is doing.

655
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,397
And I´ll give you a reward.

656
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,037
Let´s see you try alone.

657
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,553
Careful!

658
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,838
Why do you have so many coins?

659
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,911
Well, they´re useful.

660
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,551
Can I have them?

661
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,198
Come on, Fred.

662
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,793
´´Children in Need´´

663
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,309
They´ll be of far more use
to those in need.

664
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,879
What´s wrong?

665
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,352
All that money!

666
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,233
Let´s go.

667
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,353
All right, you maniac!

668
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,159
Where did you bring my daughter?
Talk!

669
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,389
Where did we go? I can´t remember.

670
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,996
Stop that! Remember what I said?
Keep your hands off!

671
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,711
We´re going out.
You´re lucky I still need you around.

672
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,313
Otherwise, you´d be out.

673
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,799
Where are we going?

674
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,713
Remember Martin, the fund manager?
He´s got a lead.

675
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,236
We´ll talk about it on the way.
Give me the key.

676
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,589
Great! You finally missed a shot!
So, what´s the lead?

677
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,389
- Relax. Where´s the money?
- Here: $200,000.

678
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,268
This is only just enough
for a month´s fuel.

679
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,999
- For what - a spaceship?
- A yacht.

680
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,513
So where were we?

681
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,319
Right, evidence
was found in Mr Tsukamoto´s body,

682
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,039
which we believe
was left by the murderer.

683
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,156
It could be a vital key.

684
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,789
- What is it?
- I´ll ask the questions. What is it?

685
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,678
It´s a Japanese banknote
from the Second World War.

686
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,718
The killer must have made
Mr Tsukamoto swallow it.

687
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,712
- So...
- Sorry, that´s all.

688
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,631
For $200,000! That´s highway robbery!

689
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,358
Call it what you like.

690
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,274
Before you came in I sold this
information to five other parties -

691
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,952
they paid me more.

692
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,555
- How much did the first party pay?
- Shut up!

693
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,269
- How much did they pay?
- None of your business.

694
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,318
But I told them about 72 hours ago.

695
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,311
That´s all you can tell us?

696
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,632
OK, although this is unconfirmed,
I think I know who the killer is.

697
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,472
For the past four years,

698
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,519
there´s been an assassin in Southeast
Asia, called the Angel of Death.

699
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,319
He´s more of a vigilante,
he works alone.

700
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,789
He´s suspected
of killing 17 people.

701
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,316
But these people were so evil,
they deserved to die.

702
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,593
Angel of Death?

703
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,037
The Bible says the Angel of Death
is God´s mercenary against evil.

704
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,318
His mission is to spread justice
by killing wrongdoers.

705
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,834
In short, he´s God´s own hitman.

706
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,629
Now I´ve told you all about him,
let´s call it quits, OK?

707
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,915
Let´s go.

708
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,229
Martin, who was the first buyer?

709
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,352
I can tell you have a focused mind.

710
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,716
Tsukamoto´s grandson. Excuse me.

711
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,391
Why did you ask that?

712
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,553
Well, Eiji found out first,
so we´ll just follow him.

713
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,635
Aren´t you the smart boy for once!

714
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,190
This is a stupid idea.

715
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,068
We´ve been tailing him for days
but we still haven´t found anything.

716
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,037
Just relax.

717
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,714
Right, I´ll do that. You keep watch.

718
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,913
I had the serial numbers on the note
regenerated by the computer.

719
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,709
In Hong Kong, all banknotes were
registered even during the war.

720
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,633
How else could we claim compensation
from your people?

721
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,278
Oh, I found the owner.

722
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,875
He´s an old man.
Here´s his personal file.

723
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,474
At least now,
you´re getting your money´s worth.

724
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,869
- Get the cars ready.
- Sir.

725
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,558
Look, here they come.

726
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,391
I don´t want him killed yet.
Bring him to me first.

727
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,360
He´s not home yet, come back later.

728
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,793
Go in!

729
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,719
May the word of God enlighten you.

730
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,279
Fred, come on. Hurry!

731
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,399
There´s no sign of him anywhere!

732
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,869
Search the entire building
immediately.

733
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,752
I´ll wait here.

734
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,513
Don´t shoot!

735
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,353
Don´t kill him!

736
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,793
Can´t you go any faster?
Put him in here!

737
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,353
Grab him!

738
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,552
Throw him to me!

739
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,559
They´re downstairs!

740
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,548
Out of the way! Please don´t die,
Mr Leung! I need you.

741
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,392
Fred, hurry, close the gate!

742
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,838
Don´t move! Get over there!

743
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,229
I like the Japanese.
Yamaha´s are great!

744
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,190
Are you all right? Say something!

745
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,633
I can´t breathe!

746
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,872
Hang on, Mr Leung.

747
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,830
Hang on, Fred. You´re doing fine.
We´ll wait upstairs.

748
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,592
Come on, Mr Leung.

749
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,678
Oh, dear!

750
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,358
Hey, Fred! Let´s go.

751
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,791
Mr Leung, tell them
all about it. Mr Leung!

752
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,509
Please don´t die on us.
We have to know the truth!

753
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,153
He´s dead!

754
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,949
What did he say before he died?

755
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,990
Well, what did he say?

756
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,719
He said... Piss off!

757
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,395
He was worth $50.
Did you know that?

758
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,632
No, they´re not worth it.

759
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,276
I´m assigning you to another case.

760
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,478
I want you and your team
to bust this Mainland gang.

761
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,516
No-one else can do it.

762
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,397
Not until after this case.

763
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,234
Look Kwan, you´ve got to follow
orders. I´m still the Chief.

764
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,392
You´ve been driving the department
crazy since this started.

765
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,916
It´s not just that,
an old man was also killed.

766
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,949
Hold on a second. You and I
both know that´s not how it happened.

767
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,955
He was already dead before he was
shot. He died of natural causes.

768
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,430
Our men interviewed the neighbours.
We´ve done all we can.

769
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,233
It´s a hopeless case.

770
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,553
Take my advice...

771
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,993
let it go.

772
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,436
- There´s something I must tell you.
- It´s about time.

773
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,756
I´m not really an assassin´s agent.

774
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,398
I know that!

775
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,119
I´m the one they´re after -
the Angel of Death!

776
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,792
I don´t believe you.

777
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,318
They may think
I´m the Angel of Death.

778
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,677
But I´m not actually him.

779
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,795
What are you talking about?
I´ve had enough of your lies.

780
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,596
This is how it happened.

781
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,150
One day, I read an ad... for a killer.

782
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,754
Just like that exterminator ad
the other day.

783
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,673
But the terms of the ad
were very strange.

784
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,672
So I figured he was new at this gig,

785
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,993
and since I needed money to pay the
bills, I called him up and we met.

786
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,674
That was Mr Leung, the old man.

787
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,799
Anyway, he wanted me to kill someone
for him -

788
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,919
a Japanese officer, who´d killed
his family during the war.

789
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,470
I thought it would be impossible
to find this guy.

790
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,348
But Leung said he was right here
in Hong Kong on business.

791
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,908
´´Hundreds Protest Fascist Leader
Tsukamoto´s Arrival in Hong Kong´´

792
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,515
I decided there could be money in it,
so I accepted.

793
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,354
But I never expected
that aside from being old and senile,

794
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,558
all he had was a box of old Japanese
banknotes from the war.

795
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,835
They have no value at all.

796
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,550
Then later on, he told the story
to someone at the antique shop.

797
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,030
He finally ended up selling
his banknotes for $2,000,

798
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,997
then he called me up again.

799
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,232
By then I felt so guilty
taking money from that old man,

800
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,678
that I just gave him my bank account
number and I said:

801
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,276
´´Deposit the money when you read
of Tsukamoto´s death in the papers.´´

802
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:53,190
But then Tsukamoto did get killed,
so the old man deposited the money.

803
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,511
What makes it worse is
that I wasn´t the one who killed him.

804
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,158
It was someone else.

805
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:05,268
I´ve been looking for Leung,
to tell him and to return his money.

806
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,636
Now it´s too late.

807
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,077
Why didn´t you hide? And what
about that $5 you deposited?

808
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,352
I took out a mortgage
on the apartment.

809
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,275
I had to know if they were on to me.
They found the old man.

810
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:28,117
Besides if I... If we find the killer
we could still end up with $100.

811
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,872
So it is the money.

812
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,313
Someone´s coming.

813
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,312
Papa, what are you doing?

814
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,960
There was a mouse,
I was trying to...

815
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,998
I think he´s got himself
into trouble again.

816
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,991
Were you in a fight?

817
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,197
Of course not, we were just
cleaning, right, Fred?

818
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,392
What happened to your face?

819
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,913
I came to get the rest of my things.

820
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,278
Great! It´s best you moved out.
The sooner the better, right?

821
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,513
Do you really hate me
that much, Papa?

822
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,513
What are you talking about?
You´re the one who wanted to move.

823
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,956
- Sir, has she told you?
- Yeah, she´s moving out.

824
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,235
No, it´s my father´s birthday
on Saturday.

825
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,958
We´re also celebrating
Kelly´s promotion.

826
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,838
We´ll understand
if you can´t make it.

827
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,712
Of course I´ll come.
I wouldn´t miss that.

828
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,155
- When is it?
- Saturday.

829
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,593
See you there?

830
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,433
See you on Saturday.

831
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,316
Don´t eat too much junk food.

832
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,719
´´Fred, she looks like you.
Look after her.´´

833
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,868
He withdrew $20, then $30...
It must be here somewhere...

834
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,238
Let´s scan forward...
Just a little more...

835
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,313
Here it is.

836
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,958
According to Leung´s bank account,

837
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,871
the day after
your grandfather´s death,

838
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,918
he withdrew $200,000
and deposited it in another account.

839
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,152
- Can you trace that account holder?
- I already did.

840
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,276
This is the man you´re after.

841
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,839
Him?

842
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,471
That´s the weather for today...

843
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,472
- Ready?
- Let´s watch the news first.

844
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,872
A fire broke out at a five storey
building in Wanchai, this afternoon.

845
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,353
The fire started at Unit 504 on the
5th floor of the Chiu Chow building.

846
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,953
What´s wrong?

847
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,792
..whether the fire was intentional...

848
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,668
- They´re on to me.
- How do you know?

849
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,990
That´s where I used to live.

850
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,199
We´d better get going.

851
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,513
My God! They´re here!

852
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,513
Move it!

853
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,756
Now they all think
I´m the Angel of Death!

854
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,233
They all want to find me
so they can kill me!

855
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,710
Maybe it´s best
if I just leave this place.

856
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,155
Just take a boat and split.

857
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,078
You´ve thought about killing me too,
right? So you can get the money?

858
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,798
Yes, I have.

859
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,715
But I´m no match for you.

860
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,157
You´re... you´re no killer, Fred.
You´re too nice.

861
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,953
- What´s that for?
- Just take it.

862
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:34,273
- If it´s some kind of deal...
- Will you relax? It´s a gift.

863
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,273
Do me one favour - watch over Kelly.

864
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,753
She´ll be working with the sharks,
she´ll need protection.

865
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,434
Just take it,
so I know you´ll look after her.

866
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,790
I´ll look after her anyway,
even without the watch.

867
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,908
I thought so.
You like her a lot, don´t you?

868
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,798
I can´t take this.

869
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,031
I don´t have any friends.

870
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,470
You´re the only one I´ve got.

871
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,552
So take it.

872
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,470
Now, go, get out of here. Go on!
Go on! Get out of here, will you?

873
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,993
What´s the message?

874
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,755
´´Kelly: Are you coming?
Your friends have arrived.´´

875
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,118
Is something wrong, sir?

876
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,677
I don´t feel well.

877
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,512
You! Off with those clothes!

878
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,393
- How long have you known my father?
- A few weeks now.

879
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,837
- You must be corrupt.
- What makes you say that?

880
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,469
A lot of my dad´s friends
are criminals, except for Fred.

881
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,516
Are you?

882
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,876
Well, why don´t you ask your father?
He´s here.

883
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,433
I wonder what he´s saying
to Kelly right now.

884
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,992
Maybe he´s also after me.
Keep him busy while I talk to Kelly.

885
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,640
How do I do that?

886
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,996
Talk to him.
Dance with him if you want.

887
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,035
You remember Captain Kwan, Fred.
Why don´t you two catch up?

888
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,395
Care to dance with your old man?

889
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,798
I haven´t seen this suit before.

890
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,474
- Do you like it?
- Not really.

891
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:52,076
- Why not?
- It doesn´t suit your size.

892
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,678
That´s the price I pay
for having a daughter as tall as you.

893
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,391
What brought you here, Captain?

894
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,678
Word is Norman´s the Angel of Death,
so everyone will be after him.

895
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,909
His daughter´s innocent.

896
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,073
I just want to make sure
they don´t use her as a hostage.

897
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,752
You´re the Angel of Death.

898
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,550
Only you know he´s innocent.

899
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,079
- You´re sure about that?
- Absolutely.

900
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,118
Then kill me now.
You´ll get a hundred million.

901
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:36,038
Even if I killed you,
I wouldn´t get the money.

902
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,310
You have a good head
on those shoulders.

903
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,792
Come with me.

904
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,949
- David.
- This will only take a moment.

905
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,955
I want you to meet
my girlfriend, Kelly.

906
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,917
- Hello.
- Kelly.

907
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,231
Uncle would like you
to work for his law firm.

908
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,191
You deserve to work
for a more prestigious company.

909
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,116
We don´t usually accept new lawyers,
but I owe David´s father a favour.

910
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,872
Stop it, you´re embarrassing me.

911
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,396
Excuse me, Uncle,
I´m really grateful for the offer,

912
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,517
but I enjoy my job
as public prosecutor.

913
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,559
It´s a good place to learn, right?
Don´t be offended.

914
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,753
Good evening, sir.

915
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,991
Dad, this is Mr Lu,
Kelly´s father.

916
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,277
- Glad to meet you.
- You don´t seem glad.

917
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,589
What is your line of business, sir?

918
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,193
Oh, different things.

919
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,989
He used to own a taxi company,
now he´s in freight.

920
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,594
Really, I´ve heard
that´s quite lucrative.

921
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,351
Actually, I have no business.

922
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,437
You know what I really do?

923
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,511
I cheat people out of money.

924
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,069
- Papa...
- Kelly, what´s the point of lying?

925
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:17,678
They may not know the truth today,
but sooner or later they will.

926
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,995
And I´ve given you enough pain.

927
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:28,515
I wasn´t a good father.
I´m sorry, I won´t bother you again.

928
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,439
I just hope that...
some day I´d see you...

929
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,355
as a brilliant lawyer
that I can be proud of.

930
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,871
Well, sir, don´t be alarmed.

931
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,430
Kelly has been against my work
from the start.

932
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,913
Gentlemen, thanks
for a wonderful evening.

933
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,513
I have to go.

934
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,079
Now you can arrest me.
I´m ready to go to jail.

935
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,993
You´d better look for
somewhere to hide.

936
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,638
Like where, Captain?

937
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,076
They won´t give up looking for him.
Let´s go.

938
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,429
- Where are we going?
- We´ll tell Martin the truth.

939
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,071
- What if he doesn´t believe us?
- If he doesn´t, you´re history.

940
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,116
Kelly, don´t worry. I can be
like a father to you from now on.

941
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,512
Thanks a lot, sir, but I´ve decided
to break up with David, anyway.

942
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,032
Let her go. Don´t be such a wimp.

943
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,273
Hello, Martin speaking.

944
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,828
Martin, it´s Fred.
Norman´s here with me.

945
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,433
Everyone´s been looking for him.

946
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,353
Have the money ready
before we reach your office.

947
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,557
I´m not in my office.
I´m at the Tsukamoto penthouse.

948
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,073
Is there anything wrong?

949
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,071
No, everything´s fine.

950
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,037
We´ll be there soon.

951
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,633
Do you still believe
they´re going to pay you?

952
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:18,555
Everyone´s after me. I´ll wind up
dead anyway, so we may as well go.

953
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:23,668
If you hadn´t been in charge of this
hunt, I´d have killed you long ago.

954
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,231
If you get the cash,
give half of it to my daughter.

955
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,880
I have to make it up to her.

956
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,997
So you made it?

957
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,275
So, he´s the Angel of Death?

958
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,909
As far as everyone´s concerned,
Norman Lu´s the man.

959
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,231
And if I kill him now,
I get the reward?

960
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,515
- Of course...
- Let him talk!

961
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:17,116
- Immediately!
- I don´t want to hear any more lies!

962
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,352
- In my experience...
- I can transfer it to your name now.

963
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,671
- You´re lying.
- Why would he do that?

964
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,718
Two keystrokes
and I´m connected to the Swiss bank.

965
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:32,157
The amount is entered in your account
and you input your code number.

966
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,992
That´s it, the money´s yours.

967
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,479
Then, I´ll do it.

968
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,880
Fred, why did you have to kill him?

969
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,317
I can´t transfer the money myself
because he´s in charge of the hunt!

970
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,275
It doesn´t really matter
who kills him. The reward is mine.

971
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,510
I told you we couldn´t trust them.

972
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,548
You were right.
Great foresight, Fred.

973
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,315
All right, game´s over!
We´re outta here! See you around!

974
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,152
What about your five million?

975
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,193
Give it back.

976
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,599
Give it to them!

977
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,993
- Where´s the Angel of Death?
- He´s coming.

978
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,308
He better be quick!

979
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,552
It´s the Angel of Death.

980
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,353
It´s him!

981
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,479
So, you´re the Angel of Death.
Now you´ll pay for my grandfather.

982
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,477
I´ll deal with the lady,
I can take her.

983
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,553
What a woman!

984
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,598
No, I´ll take him.

985
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,429
There, can´t get far now, can you?

986
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,759
Now, it´s my turn.

987
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,514
So, you want to get a little closer?

988
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,715
Wow, you should´ve been a gymnast!

989
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,839
- Are you all right?
- Hospital bills cost a fortune!

990
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,638
Don´t worry about the money.

991
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,792
You´ll get the hundred million,
once you´ve killed him.

992
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,598
Can you do it?

993
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,033
No, I can´t.

994
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,033
Wait!

995
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,236
Now you know too much about me.

996
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,678
Hold it right there.

997
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,475
You can´t just waste all that money.

998
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,599
- What do you mean?
- We have to make use of that money.

999
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,558
- It´s $100.
- What do you suggest?

1000
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,270
We have to invent a story - Eiji,
here, is the real Angel of Death.

1001
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,590
He killed his grandfather
for the money.

1002
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,433
The Captain found out...
oh, I´m sorry...

1003
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,433
He asked you to help out
so he could arrest Eiji.

1004
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,637
When Eiji fought back,
you had to kill him.

1005
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,836
As for the man...

1006
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,390
We´ll sort out the details later,
just give us the money.

1007
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,436
No problem, guys.

1008
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,476
Gentlemen, I carried out
your instructions -

1009
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,074
and invested your money
in Coca-Cola shares.

1010
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,436
Of course, I´d appreciate
20% of the annual profit.

1011
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,195
Now that you´re all millionaires,
you have nothing to worry about.

1012
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,556
Now I can buy my mom
a really big house.

1013
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,835
Buy her a skyscraper for God´s sake.

1014
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,956
I´m bringing Kelly skiing
in Switzerland.

1015
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,190
You´re lucky, I´ve lost my job.

1016
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,956
Well, I have this rich friend
who hires vigilantes for just causes,

1017
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,429
and he´ll pay $3 per target.

1018
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,115
Don´t tell me, I´m done
with that business, all right?

1019
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,431
If you change your mind,
tell me about it, OK?

1020
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,353
Thanks, Martin.
Can I talk to you in private?

1021
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,113
You can talk here, I´m his agent.

1022
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,557
I forgot to tell you.
I´ve got a new agent.

1023
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,993
You replaced me?

1024
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,076
There she is.

1025
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,038
So you´re the one
who took my place?

1026
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:19,112
I´ll be his lawyer from now on.

1027
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,351
You mean,
you´ll be handling all his assets?

1028
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,874
I´ll be handling your assets as well.

1029
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,873
You must be dreaming! I´d never
let anyone charge me commission!

1030
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,997
- I´d better retire.
- But you are retired.

1031
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,718
I mean as a vigilante.

1032
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:37,918
- As the Angel of Death?
- Yeah, you can take over.

1033
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,231
I´m afraid I´m not
a very good killer.

1034
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,675
That´s because
you´ve had the wrong targets.

1035
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,673
If they deserved to die,
I´m sure you could do it.

1036
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,231
Think of yourself as the new
vigilante... The new Angel of Death.

1037
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,914
Let´s make it three Angels of Death.

1038
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,070
All right. It´s a deal.
