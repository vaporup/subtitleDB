1
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:35,079
<i>I was 12 going on 13</i>
<i>the first time I saw a dead human being.</i>

2
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,594
<i>It happened in the summer of 1959...</i>

3
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,717
<i>... a long time ago...</i>

4
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:44,963
<i>... but only if you measure it</i>
<i>in terms of years.</i>

5
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:52,841
<i>I was living in a small town in Oregon</i>
<i>called Castle Rock.</i>

6
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:57,603
<i>There were only 1,281 people,</i>
<i>but to me it was the whole world.</i>

7
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,599
<i>It's the Bossman Bob Cormier.</i>
<i>It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.</i>

8
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:02,958
<i>It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.</i>

9
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:07,314
<i>Up the ladder with another platter.</i>
<i>It's Bobby Day with</i> Rockin' Robin...

10
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,598
<i>... it's boss.</i>

11
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,522
How do you know a Frenchman's been
in your backyard?

12
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:29,998
I'm French, okay.

13
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,996
Your garbage cans are empty
and your dog's pregnant.

14
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,840
Didn't I just say I was French?

15
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,960
- I knock.
- Shit.

16
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:39,593
Twenty-nine.

17
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:40,912
Twenty-two.

18
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,637
Piss up a rope.

19
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:48,353
Gordie's out, OI' Gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door.

20
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,843
Come on, man, deal.

21
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:54,763
<i>Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy</i>
<i>we hung around with.</i>

22
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,835
<i>He didn't have much of a chance in life.</i>

23
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,994
<i>His dad was given to fits of rage.</i>

24
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:02,679
<i>One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove</i>
<i>and almost burned it off.</i>

25
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,912
I knock.

26
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,442
You four-eyed pile of shit.

27
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,992
The <i>"</i>pile of shit<i>"</i> has 1,000 eyes.

28
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,114
What?

29
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:15,718
What's so funny?
I got thirty, what have you got?

30
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:16,953
Sixteen.

31
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,557
Go ahead, keep laughing.

32
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,555
You're down to your ride, pal.

33
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:23,761
<i>Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang</i>
<i>and my best friend.</i>

34
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:27,519
<i>He came from a bad family</i>
<i>and everyone just knew he'd turn out bad.</i>

35
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,243
<i>Including Chris.</i>

36
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,234
That's not the secret knock.

37
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,680
I forgot the secret knock. Let me in.

38
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:35,879
Vern.

39
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,640
Come on, you guys, open up.

40
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:42,679
Man, you guys are not going
to believe this. This is so boss.

41
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,035
Wait till you hear this.

42
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,553
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

43
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,795
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way
from my house.

44
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:54,074
<i>"</i>I ran all the way home<i>"</i>

45
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:56,035
Come on. Listen to me, this is boss.

46
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:58,354
<i>"</i>Just to say I'm sorry<i>"</i>

47
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,557
Okay, forget it.
I don't have to tell you nothin<i>'.</i>

48
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,874
Hold on, you guys. Hold on.
What is it, man?

49
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:06,114
Great, you won't believe this, sincerely.

50
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,035
<i>"</i>I ran all the way home<i>"</i>

51
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,439
Screw you guys. Forget it.

52
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:11,877
What is it?

53
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,443
Can you camp out tonight?

54
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:16,800
I mean, if you tell your folks
we're gonna tent out in my backfield?

55
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:17,919
I think so.

56
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:21,679
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak.
He's been drinking a lot lately.

57
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,915
You got to. Sincerely,
you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

58
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,232
Yeah, probably.

59
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,077
So what are you pissing and moaning
about Vern-O?

60
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,432
- I knock.
- What?

61
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,954
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

62
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,080
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

63
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,155
Make your draw, shitheap.

64
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,754
You guys want to go see a dead body?

65
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,956
I was under the porch digging, you know?

66
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,393
<i>We all understood</i>
<i>what Vern meant right away.</i>

67
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>At the beginning of the school year</i>
<i>he had buried a jar of pennies...</i>

68
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:54,957
<i>... underneath his house.</i>

69
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,604
<i>He drew a treasure map</i>
<i>so he could find them again.</i>

70
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:01,677
<i>A week later his mom cleaned out</i>
<i>his room and threw away the map.</i>

71
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:05,316
<i>Vern had been trying to find those pennies</i>
<i>for nine months...</i>

72
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,837
<i>... nine months, man.</i>

73
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:09,234
<i>You didn't know whether laugh or cry.</i>

74
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,442
Jesus, Billy, we gotta do something.

75
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:14,401
Why? Who cares?

76
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,283
- We saw him.
- So?

77
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:19,515
It's nothin' to us. The kid's dead
so it's nothin' to him, neither.

78
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:22,482
And who gives a shit if they ever find him?
I don't.

79
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,879
It's that kid they're talking about
on the radio.

80
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:29,161
Brocker or Brower or Flowers,
whatever his name is.

81
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,715
The train must have hit him.

82
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:33,637
Big fucking deal.

83
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,873
<i>We had all followed</i>
<i>the Ray Brower story closely...</i>

84
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,556
<i>... since he was a kid our age.</i>

85
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:42,432
<i>Three days before, he left to pick</i>
<i>blueberries and nobody'd seen him since.</i>

86
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,242
I think we should tell the cops.

87
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:47,396
You don't go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car.

88
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:50,362
They'll want to know how we got way out
on Back Harlow Road.

89
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,036
They know we don't got no car.

90
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,718
It's best we just keep quiet,
then they can't touch us.

91
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,954
But we could make an anonymous call.

92
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,523
They trace those calls stupid. I seen it
on <i>Highway Patrol</i> and on Dragnet.

93
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:03,233
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,072
I wish we never boosted
that goddamned Dodge.

95
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:07,876
I wish Ace had been with us.

96
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:10,353
- We could've said he was in his car.
- He wasn't!

97
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:13,163
- Are we gonna tell him?
- We're not going to tell nobody.

98
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:14,996
Nobody, never. You dig me?

99
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:16,917
I know the Back Harlow Road.

100
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:21,121
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.
The train tracks are right there.

101
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,876
Me and my dad fished out there.

102
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:26,036
If they had known you were under there,
they would've killed you.

103
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:29,958
Could he have gotten all the way from
Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

104
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:34,356
Sure. He probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way.

105
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,514
Yeah, right.

106
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,517
And then after dark, a train must have
come along and <i>"</i>el smako<i>."</i>

107
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:49,641
I bet you, if we find him,
we'll get our pictures in the paper.

108
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,396
We could even be on TV.

109
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,759
- Sure.
- We'll be heroes.

110
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,352
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

111
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:59,442
He's not going to care.
'Cause it's gonna be us that find him.

112
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:02,084
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan,
and the boosted the car.

113
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,314
They'll probably pin a medal on you.

114
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,077
You think so?

115
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,200
Sure.

116
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,436
What'll we tell our folks?

117
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,082
Exactly what you said.

118
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:14,037
We'll tell our folks
that we're tenting in your backfield.

119
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,274
You tell your folks
your sleeping at Teddy's.

120
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:19,043
Then we say we're going
to the drag races the next day.

121
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,115
We're rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night.

122
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,160
Man that's a plan and a half.

123
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:27,317
But, if we find the body in South Harlow,
they'll know we didn't go to the races.

124
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,473
We'll get hided.

125
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,043
Nobody will care...

126
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,763
...because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery...

127
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,482
...it won't make a difference.

128
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:36,959
My dad will hide me anyway,
but it's worth it.

129
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,035
- Shit, yeah.
- Let's do it. What do you say?

130
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,398
- All right.
- Gordie?

131
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:41,473
Sure.

132
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,633
Vern?

133
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,318
I don't know.

134
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,917
Come on, Vern-O.

135
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,754
- Okay.
- All right.

136
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,721
Too cool. Very cool.

137
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,836
<i>I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm,</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

138
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,561
<i>That summer at home,</i>
<i>I had become The Invisible Boy.</i>

139
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,478
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

140
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:13,553
Mom?

141
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,716
It's in Denny's room.

142
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:24,678
<i>In April, my older brother, Dennis,</i>
<i>had been killed in a jeep accident.</i>

143
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,398
<i>Four months had passed...</i>

144
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:30,716
<i>... but my parents still hadn't been able</i>
<i>to put the pieces back together again.</i>

145
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,116
<i>Gordie, I got something for you.</i>

146
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,236
This, my friend, is for you.

147
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,001
- This is your Yankee cap.
- No.

148
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:18,437
This is your Yankee cap.

149
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,118
It's a good luck cap.
Know how many fish we'll catch?

150
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,557
- How much?
- A bazillion.

151
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:26,000
A bazillion fish.
It looks good on you, too. Just like that.

152
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:30,442
- No. I'm going blind.
- Don't start with me. Give me a hug.

153
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,798
You found it.

154
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,198
You found it.

155
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,113
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?

156
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:49,877
Dad, they're okay.

157
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,359
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

158
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,363
Chris isn't a thief.

159
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,554
He stole the milk money at school.

160
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,641
He's a thief in my book.

161
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:19,873
<i>It was almost noon as we set out to find</i>
<i>the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.</i>

162
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:22,803
Right here's cool.

163
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:28,441
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure thing.

164
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,394
- You want to see something?
- What?

165
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,242
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

166
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:36,793
What is it?

167
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,953
- You've got to see this.
- What is it?

168
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:44,398
What is it?

169
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:52,237
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

170
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,075
Walking, talking Jesus!

171
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:59,035
- Where'd you get this?
- Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

172
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,637
It's a.45.

173
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,952
I can see that.

174
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:08,195
You got shells for it?

175
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,042
I took what was left in the box.

176
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:14,322
My dad'll think he used them himself
shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

177
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:18,236
- Is it loaded?
- Hello, no. What do you think I am?

178
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:20,919
Jesus!

179
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's get out of here. Come on.

180
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:27,836
Gordie did it. Gordon Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock.

181
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:28,879
Shut up.

182
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:32,161
Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?

183
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:37,641
You should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

184
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,682
- That was really fine.
- You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

185
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:43,039
I'm in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

186
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:47,163
- Shit, she thought it was firecrackers.
- I don't care. It was a mean trick.

187
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,875
I didn't know it was loaded.

188
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,600
- Honest.
- You swear?

189
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:55,832
I swear.

190
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,443
On your mother's name?

191
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,555
Even if she goes to hell for your lie?

192
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:02,123
I swear.

193
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:04,923
Pinky swear?

194
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,123
Pinky swear.

195
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,716
Girls, where you going?

196
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:19,154
- Come on, my brother gave me that!
- And now you're giving it to me.

197
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:20,438
Give it to me!

198
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:22,873
That's mine.

199
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,194
You're a real asshole, you know that?

200
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,399
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

201
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,803
Now, Christopher.

202
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:35,712
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

203
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,360
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

204
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,353
That's why I'll give him the opportunity
to take it back.

205
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,962
- Shit.
- Take it back, kid.

206
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:50,116
- Stop it, you're hurting him.
- You bastard! Let go, man.

207
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,673
- Stop it! Cut it out!
- Take it back, kid.

208
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:57,716
You big<i>...</i> Okay, I take it back.

209
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:02,434
There.

210
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,312
Now I feel a whole lot better about this.

211
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,723
How about you?

212
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:10,959
Good.

213
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:15,402
See you later girls.

214
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,081
Let's just forget them.

215
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:43,274
What do we need a pistol for anyway?

216
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,834
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

217
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,562
Or a garbage can.

218
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,477
I brought a comb.

219
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,163
What do we need a comb for?

220
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,678
If we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

221
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,755
- That's a lot of thinking, Vern.
- Thanks.

222
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,323
Two for flinching.

223
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:08,840
How far do you think it's gonna be?

224
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:13,957
If we follow the tracks all the way
into Harlow, it should be about 20 miles.

225
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,716
Sound about right to you?

226
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,716
It might even be 30.

227
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:20,275
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

228
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:23,360
- No way, that sucks.
- Why not?

229
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,953
We could go out to Route 7
to the Shiloh church...

230
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:29,400
...then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

231
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,519
That's pussy.

232
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,442
It's a long way.

233
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,398
Did your mother ever have any kids
that lived?

234
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,077
What do you mean?

235
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:06,517
We have to fill up at the junkyard.
My dad said it was a safe well.

236
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,997
- Not if Chopper's there.
- If he's there we'll send you in.

237
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:11,233
Very funny.

238
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,633
I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?

239
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:21,276
Did anybody bring anything?

240
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:24,080
Not me.

241
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:28,356
This is great. What are we supposed
to do? Eat our feet?

242
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,594
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

243
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:33,994
This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's.
Why didn't you bring something?

244
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,552
I have to think of everything?
I brought the comb.

245
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,238
What do you need a comb for?
You don't have any hair.

246
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:42,043
I brought it for you guys,
so you'd have a comb.

247
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:44,560
Let's see how much money we've got?

248
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:49,201
I got $1.02.

249
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,394
And 68 cents from Chris.

250
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,082
60 cents from Teddy.

251
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:03,316
7 cents, Vern?

252
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:06,080
I haven't found my pennies yet.

253
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,401
$2.37 cents, not bad.

254
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:12,076
Quidaciolu's is at the end of the road
by the junkyard.

255
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:14,155
I think we can get some stuff there.

256
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:15,313
Train coming.

257
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,318
Geronimo!

258
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,243
Come on, Teddy.

259
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:28,483
I'm gonna dodge it.

260
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,161
Get off the tracks. You're crazy.

261
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,394
Train dodge. Dig it?

262
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,835
Get the hell off the tracks.
You want to get yourself killed?

263
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,074
Just like the beach at Normandy.

264
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,121
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

265
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:08,601
I'm trying to save your life.

266
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,117
You want to kill yourself?

267
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:11,876
Is that what you want, goddamn it?

268
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,034
You tried to kill yourself.

269
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,876
I don't need no babysitter.

270
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:23,603
You do, too.

271
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,598
Skin it.

272
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,517
I could have dodged it.

273
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,524
Listen, you can dodge it on the way back.

274
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:39,799
Peace.

275
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,032
Skin it.

276
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:11,073
<i>About this time, Charlie and Billy</i>
<i>were playing mailbox baseball...</i>

277
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,075
<i>... with Ace and Eyeball.</i>

278
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,115
Shit on that. Goddamn it!

279
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:18,438
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

280
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:22,553
Why don't you tell me something
I don't know, asshole?

281
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,197
Billy, you're up.

282
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:26,479
You guys win.
I don't want to play no more.

283
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,963
You can't quit.

284
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:31,959
We only played three innings.
That'd be a non-official game.

285
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:34,082
Ace, me and<i>...</i>

286
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,201
What's with you homos?
You've been acting psycho all day.

287
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,593
What is it?

288
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:44,879
It's nothing, right?

289
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:47,958
Then if you don't mind,
I'd like to finish this game...

290
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,604
...before I start collecting
my social security, okay?

291
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,000
You're up, Billy. Move it.

292
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:55,200
All right, give me this fucking stick.

293
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,876
Let's play ball.

294
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:00,963
Foul ball.

295
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,762
Vern, it looks like
your mom's been out driving again.

296
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:20,000
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

297
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,443
Stand back, men!

298
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:25,835
Paratroopers, over the side!

299
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,198
<i>"No Trespassing" was enforced</i>
<i>by Milo Pressman, the junkman...</i>

300
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,637
<i>... and his dog, Chopper.</i>

301
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:35,399
<i>The most feared and least seen dog</i>
<i>in Castle Rock.</i>

302
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:39,040
<i>Legend had it that</i>
<i>Milo had trained Chopper not just to sic...</i>

303
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,434
<i>... but to sic specific parts</i>
<i>of the human anatomy.</i>

304
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:46,034
<i>Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled</i>
<i>the junkyard fence...</i>

305
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,878
<i>... might hear the dread cry:</i>
<i>"Chopper, sic balls!"</i>

306
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,798
<i>But right now neither the dread Chopper</i>
<i>nor Milo...</i>

307
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,556
<i>... was anywhere in sight.</i>

308
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,158
Teddy's crazy.

309
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,838
Come on, men, move it out!

310
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,521
He won't live to be 20, I bet.

311
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,398
Remember the time you saved him
in the tree?

312
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,914
I dream about that sometimes.

313
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:15,195
Except in the dream I miss him.
I just get a few hairs and down he goes.

314
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:16,439
It's weird.

315
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:18,078
That is weird.

316
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,958
But you didn't miss him.

317
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,239
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

318
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:25,124
Not even when
the ladies leave the seat down.

319
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:27,040
Race you.

320
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,684
- No, I don't think so.
- Over to the pump.

321
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:33,154
- I'm kind of tired. Go.
- You're a dead man, Lachance!

322
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,753
It looks like Lachance
has got him this time.

323
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,277
He's got Chambers beat.

324
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:39,753
But what's this?
Chambers is making his move.

325
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:42,199
Lachance is fading
and it's Chambers at the tape.

326
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,036
The crowd goes wild.

327
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:06,118
You guys been watching
<i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i> lately?

328
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,074
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

329
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:10,517
- You think so?
- I think so.

330
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,798
I think he's right.

331
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:16,674
I've been noticing that the A and the E
are starting to bend around the sides.

332
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,322
Annette's tits are great.

333
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,116
This is a really good time.

334
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,200
The most.

335
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,512
A blast.

336
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,915
<i>Vern didn't just mean being off limits</i>
<i>inside the junkyard...</i>

337
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,722
<i>... or fudging on our folks...</i>

338
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:34,513
<i>... or going on a hike up the tracks</i>
<i>to Harlow. He meant those things, but...</i>

339
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:38,074
<i>... it seems to me now it was more</i>
<i>and that we all knew it.</i>

340
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,234
<i>Everything was there and around us.</i>

341
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:44,033
<i>We knew exactly who we were</i>
<i>and exactly where we were going.</i>

342
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:45,843
<i>It was grand.</i>

343
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:52,602
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

344
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:54,597
What time is it?

345
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,277
It's a quarter after one.

346
00:21:57,364 --> 00:22:00,242
You'd better go get the food.
Junkyard opens at 3:00.

347
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:01,757
Chopper'll be here.

348
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,243
Sic balls.

349
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:06,553
You go. You can pick us up
on the way back.

350
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,555
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

351
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:11,522
- I'm staying right here.
- I'm not going.

352
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,683
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

353
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,039
Okay.

354
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:17,713
Odd man goes.

355
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,522
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

356
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,242
Flip or eat lead.

357
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,237
Four tails.

358
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:30,475
Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

359
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:33,522
- That doesn't mean anything.
- No, let's go again.

360
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:35,757
That's really bad.

361
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:40,122
Remember Clint Bracken and those guys
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

362
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:43,321
He said they flipped for beers
and they came up with a goocher...

363
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,235
...just before they got in the car.

364
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,713
And, bang! They all got totalled.

365
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,358
I don't like this. Sincerely.

366
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:54,158
Nobody believes that crap
about moons and goochers.

367
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:57,077
It's baby stuff. Now come on, flip again.

368
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:02,197
Are you going to flip or not?

369
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:04,115
We don't have all day.

370
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:09,362
You lose, Gordie.

371
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:11,793
Gordie loses.

372
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:14,318
Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

373
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:17,682
Does the word <i>"</i>retarded<i>"</i>
mean anything to you?

374
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:20,474
Go get the provisions, you morphadite.

375
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:23,032
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

376
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:25,081
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

377
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,240
Shut up.

378
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:29,714
I don't shut up, I grow up.
And when I look at you, I throw up.

379
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:34,442
Then your mother goes around the corner
and she licks it up.

380
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:40,672
<i>Finding new and disgusting ways</i>
<i>to degrade a friend's mother...</i>

381
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:42,914
<i>... was always held as high regard.</i>

382
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:57,440
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

383
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,678
Yes, sir.

384
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:02,920
Shame what happened to him.

385
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:06,875
The Bible says,
<i>"</i>In the midst of life we are in death<i>."</i>

386
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,796
Did you know that?

387
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,315
I lost a brother in Korea.

388
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,240
You look like your brother Denny.

389
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:17,996
People ever tell you that?

390
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,843
Sometimes.

391
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,358
I remember the year
he was All-Conference.

392
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,196
Quarterback, he played.

393
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,682
Boy, could he throw.

394
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:32,438
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

395
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,720
Could be some scouts
at the game tomorrow.

396
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,398
- I don't know, Pop.
- Dad, could I have the potatoes?

397
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:46,033
- That's what I hear, Son.
- Are you going to see Jane after the game?

398
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:47,637
I think she's a lovely girl.

399
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:51,512
- Dad, may I please have the potatoes?
- Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

400
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:55,677
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his life.

401
00:24:56,404 --> 00:25:00,158
- Dennis, when you're there tomorrow...
- Did you read the story Gordie wrote?

402
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:01,472
Gordie wrote a story.

403
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:03,919
- It was really good.
- What did you write, sweetheart?

404
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,758
That's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

405
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:11,154
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

406
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:12,763
I really liked it.

407
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:14,922
I thought it was great.

408
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:21,596
You play football?

409
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:25,081
Do you play football?

410
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:28,199
No.

411
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:30,157
What do you do?

412
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,757
I don't know.

413
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:37,002
Your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

414
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:43,960
There you go, kid. $1.50 of hamburger.

415
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:14,717
You, kid! What are you doing there!
Come over here!

416
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:18,843
You, come back here, goddamn it!
I'll sic my dog on you.

417
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,357
Run!

418
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:23,674
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

419
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:25,841
<i>Now he said: "Sic him, boy."</i>

420
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,882
<i>But what I heard was: "Chopper, sic balls."</i>

421
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,603
That's Chopper?

422
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,876
<i>Chopper was my first lesson in the vast</i>
<i>difference between myth and reality.</i>

423
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:52,798
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.

424
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:55,802
Come on, bite shit.

425
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:59,953
Sic balls, Choppie.

426
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:03,753
You kids stop teasing that dog!
You hear me? Stop teasing him!

427
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,723
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass,
teasing my dog like that!

428
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:09,398
Let's see you climb over this fence
and get me, fat ass!

429
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:10,997
Don't you call me that!

430
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,962
You little tin weasel
peckerwood loony's son!

431
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,118
What did you call me?

432
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:20,196
I know who you are,
you're Teddy Duchamp.

433
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:21,763
Your dad's a loony.

434
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,994
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

435
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:27,514
He took your ear and he put it to a stove
and he burnt it off.

436
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,319
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

437
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:34,682
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are...

438
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,675
...with a loony for a father.

439
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:39,756
You call my dad a loony again
and I'll kill you.

440
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,557
Loony, loony.

441
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:45,236
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

442
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:47,594
No, I'm gonna kill him!

443
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,834
You come on and try it, you little bastard.

444
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:53,354
He wants you to go over so he can beat
you up then take you to the cops.

445
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:56,163
You watch your mouth.
Let him do his own fighting.

446
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:59,520
Sure, you only outweigh him
by 500 pounds, fat ass.

447
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:00,923
I know your name.

448
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:04,196
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

449
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,237
And your fathers will get a call from me.

450
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,033
Except for the loony up in Togus.

451
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:13,877
I'm going to kill you. I'll show you.

452
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:16,558
- Get him away from...
- You foulmouthed whoremaster.

453
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:17,997
You son of a bitch!

454
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:19,398
You come back here.

455
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:20,633
Do you hear me?

456
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,760
Nobody ranks out my old man.

457
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,762
- My father stormed the beach...
- I said, <i>"</i>Come back here!<i>"</i>

458
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:28,961
- He stormed the beach, you faggot!
- Come back here.

459
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:40,081
We showed him.
Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

460
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:42,801
He ranked my old man.

461
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:46,519
<i>I wondered how he could care so much</i>
<i>for his dad who'd almost killed him...</i>

462
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:50,756
<i>... and I didn't care about my own</i>
<i>who hadn't touched me since I was three.</i>

463
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,755
<i>That was for eating bleach under the sink.</i>

464
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,755
He ranked my old man.

465
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:58,798
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit
like him says about your dad?

466
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:01,637
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

467
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:05,073
Do you think that pile of shit
was at Normandy?

468
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,233
Forget it, okay?

469
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,792
He knows nothin' about your old man.
He's shit.

470
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:11,842
Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

471
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,721
Forget it, all right?

472
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:45,041
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling
everybody's good time.

473
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:48,403
It's okay.

474
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:51,954
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

475
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:55,114
- You saying you want to go back?
- No.

476
00:29:56,404 --> 00:30:00,363
But going to see a dead kid,
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

477
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:07,356
If he's really bad, like all cut up
with blood and shit all over him...

478
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:09,036
...I might have nightmares.

479
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:12,483
All guts and eyeballs
ready to jump and grab...

480
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:14,520
Shut up, goddamn it!

481
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:15,872
I can't help it.

482
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:18,272
Sorry.

483
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,037
<i>It was only a quarter to three,</i>
<i>but it felt much later.</i>

484
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,759
<i>It was too hot and too much had happened.</i>

485
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:28,314
<i>We weren't even close to the Royal River.</i>

486
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:33,037
<i>We needed to get moving if we were</i>
<i>going to make some real miles before dark.</i>

487
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:42,076
Hold still, will you?

488
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:51,636
So what's with you
and this Connie Palermo chick?

489
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,043
I've been seeing her for over a month,
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

490
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:59,082
She's a Catholic. They're all like that.

491
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,957
You want to get laid
you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

492
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,797
A Jew's good.

493
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:06,798
<i>A KLAM newsbreak.</i>

494
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:09,603
<i>We interrupt to bring you an update</i>
<i>on the search for...</i>

495
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,242
<i>... 12 year-old Ray Brower.</i>

496
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:13,713
<i>The police have expanded their search</i>
<i>to Mutton...</i>

497
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,556
<i>... Durham and the outlying areas.</i>

498
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:17,236
When are they going to give up?

499
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:19,315
The kid's gone. They'll never find him.

500
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:21,281
Not where they're looking.

501
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:23,719
I was right,
they ain't never gonna find him.

502
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:26,841
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

503
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

504
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:32,873
Ten years from now a hunter's going to go
into the woods to take a leak...

505
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:35,080
...wind up pissing on his bones.

506
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,394
I bet you a $1,000
they find him before that.

507
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:39,440
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

508
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,197
- Well, asshole...
- What's the big deal?

509
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:45,083
- Who cares?
- Would you two just shut the fuck up.

510
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:48,835
If either one of you assholes had $2,000,
I'd kill you both.

511
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:51,482
<i>We're back here with The Bossman.</i>

512
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:53,873
<i>From the racks and stacks,</i>
<i>it's the best on wax.</i>

513
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,398
<i>It's the Cordettes, with</i> Lollipop.

514
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:22,723
I got some Winstons.

515
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:24,795
Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

516
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:26,795
One apiece, for after supper.

517
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:28,119
That's cool.

518
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:32,123
That's when a cigarette tastes best,
after supper.

519
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:33,114
Right.

520
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:41,717
Do you think I'm weird?

521
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:43,715
- Definitely.
- No, seriously.

522
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:45,839
Am I weird?

523
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,194
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

524
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,357
You ready for school?

525
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:01,279
Junior high.

526
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:04,557
You know what that means.

527
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:06,475
By next June we'll all be split up.

528
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:08,953
What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

529
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:12,081
'Cause it's not going to be like
grammar school, that's why.

530
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,440
You'll be taking college courses,
and me, Teddy, Vern we'll all be...

531
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:18,561
...in the shop courses
making ashtrays and birdhouses.

532
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:25,041
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.
Smart guys.

533
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:28,152
- Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
- No, man.

534
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:30,280
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

535
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,640
- I'm not going in with a lot of pussies.
- Then you're an asshole.

536
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:36,113
What's asshole with wanting
to be with your friends?

537
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:38,240
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.

538
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:41,953
You hang with us, you'll just be
another wise guy with shit for brains.

539
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:44,554
You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

540
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,839
- What are you, cracked?
- Why not?

541
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:50,082
The other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

542
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:51,995
You don't know nothin<i>'.</i>

543
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:53,876
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

544
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:57,877
Superman is a real guy.
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

545
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,876
Yeah, maybe you're right.

546
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,995
Would be a good fight, though.

547
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:09,239
You could be a real writer someday.

548
00:34:09,484 --> 00:34:11,679
Fuck writing! I don't to be a writer.

549
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:15,120
- It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
- That's your dad talking.

550
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:16,796
- Bullshit!
- Bulltrue!

551
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:19,842
I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't care about you.

552
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,678
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

553
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,002
You're just a kid, Gordie.

554
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,676
Gee thanks, Dad.

555
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,715
I wish to hell I was your dad.

556
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:40,521
You wouldn't be talking about taking
these stupid shop courses if I was.

557
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:45,596
It's like God gave you something, man,
all those stories that you can make up...

558
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,960
...and He said, <i>"</i>This is what we got
for you. Try not to lose it<i>."</i>

559
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:52,434
Kids lose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

560
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,994
If your parents are too fucked-up to do it,
then maybe I should.

561
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:59,042
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

562
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:02,434
By the time we get there
the kid won't even be dead anymore.

563
00:35:46,164 --> 00:35:48,883
Any of you guys know
when the next train is due?

564
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,714
We could go down to the Route 136 Bridge.

565
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:54,762
What? Are you crazy?
That's five miles down the river.

566
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:58,041
You walk five miles down the river,
you gotta walk five miles back.

567
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,523
That could take till dark.

568
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:02,994
We go across here, we can get
to the same place in 10 minutes.

569
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:05,958
But if a train comes, there's nowhere to go.

570
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,000
No, there isn't. You just jump.

571
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:10,434
- Teddy, it's a 100 feet.
- Yeah, Teddy.

572
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:13,755
You guys can go around if you want.

573
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,118
I'm crossing here.

574
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:17,559
And while you guys
are dragging your candyasses...

575
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:21,922
...half-way across the state and back,
I'll be waiting for you on the other side...

576
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:23,835
...relaxing with my thoughts.

577
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:27,682
You use your left hand
or your right hand for that?

578
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,438
You wish.

579
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,876
I lost the comb.

580
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:36,963
Forget it, Vern.

581
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,680
Train!

582
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:19,513
Shit!

583
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,041
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

584
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,921
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

585
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:26,792
Get up! Move it!

586
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:28,793
Shit, Vern!

587
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:32,003
- Get up, man!
- I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

588
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:35,916
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

589
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:37,679
Go.

590
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,238
- You've got to go faster!
- I can't, Gordie!

591
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:52,920
Run!

592
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:59,999
Run, Vern, run! Move your ass!

593
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,076
Run, goddamn it, run!

594
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:35,843
At least now we know
when the next train was due.

595
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:47,922
That was the all-time train dodge.
Too cool.

596
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:53,595
You were so scared you looked like
Abbott Costello when he saw the mummy.

597
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,356
I wasn't that scared.

598
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,401
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

599
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,715
Then you won't mind if we check
your underpants for Hershey squirts.

600
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:03,203
Go screw.

601
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,156
You'd better turn yours over.

602
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,155
This is the way I like to do it.

603
00:40:07,644 --> 00:40:08,633
Man!

604
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,123
You got any more, Gordie?

605
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:12,239
Sorry, Vern.

606
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:14,474
It's not funny. What am I supposed to eat?

607
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:17,522
- Why don't you cook your dick?
- It'd be a small meal.

608
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:23,362
Screw you guys, I got it.

609
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:39,840
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

610
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,920
I cherish these moments.

611
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,682
What? What did I say?

612
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,120
Gordie, why don't you tell us a story?

613
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,398
I don't know.

614
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,634
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Gordie.

615
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:02,354
None of your horror stories, okay?

616
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:05,681
I don't want to hear no horror stories.
I'm not up for that.

617
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:09,240
Tell us one about Sergeant Steel
and his battling leathernecks.

618
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:12,442
The one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

619
00:41:12,524 --> 00:41:14,401
It's about this pie-eating contest.

620
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:18,716
The main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody likes, named Davie Hogan.

621
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,517
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.

622
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:22,839
Good, Vern.

623
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:25,234
Go on.

624
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:29,673
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat.
Real fat.

625
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:34,402
He weighs close to 180,
but it's not his fault. It's his glands.

626
00:41:34,604 --> 00:41:36,913
My cousin's like that. Sincerely.

627
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:41,237
She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed
to be a <i>"</i>hyboid<i>"</i> gland or somethin<i>'.</i>

628
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:44,516
I don't know about any <i>"</i>hyboid<i>"</i> gland,
but what a blimp!

629
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:47,323
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

630
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,964
- And, you know, this one time...
- Shut up, Vern.

631
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,918
Right. Go on. It's a swell story.

632
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:58,718
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie,
they called him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

633
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:01,842
Even his little brother
and sister called him Lardass.

634
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:05,553
At school they put this sticker on his back
that says, <i>"</i>Wide Load<i>."</i>

635
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:09,319
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

636
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:11,680
But one day he gets an idea.

637
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:17,360
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.

638
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:21,559
<i>Is this thing on? Can you hear me?</i>

639
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:26,522
<i>The next contestant</i>
<i>in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat...</i>

640
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:28,162
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

641
00:42:36,244 --> 00:42:40,874
<i>And our celebrity contestant,</i>
<i>from KLAM in Portland...</i>

642
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:44,635
<i>... The Boss-man himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

643
00:42:48,804 --> 00:42:51,113
<i>From the racks and stacks</i>
<i>it's the best on wax...</i>

644
00:42:51,204 --> 00:42:55,083
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,</i>
<i>sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

645
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:56,517
<i>...it's...</i>
- Boss!

646
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:04,403
<i>Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat,</i>
<i>but one we expect...</i>

647
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:08,443
<i>... great things from in the future,</i>
<i>young Master David Hogan.</i>

648
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:16,995
- Are you all right, young man?
- Lardass how was your trip?

649
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:21,039
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

650
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:24,074
Don't even think about winning this.

651
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:26,756
Boy are you fat.

652
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:32,118
Don't pay attention to those fools,
Lardass. Davie.

653
00:43:44,484 --> 00:43:47,760
<i>And now,</i>
<i>the one you've all been waiting for.</i>

654
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:52,236
<i>The four-time champion,</i>
<i>our own Bill Travis.</i>

655
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,757
Listen I got $10 riding
on you myself, Billy Boy.

656
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,322
<i>All right. Are you ready?</i>

657
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,714
<i>Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.</i>

658
00:44:08,284 --> 00:44:09,433
<i>Drum roll.</i>

659
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:13,433
Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.

660
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:17,680
<i>Go.</i>

661
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:25,274
Done!

662
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:42,354
Done!

663
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:45,680
Done!

664
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:50,361
You better pace yourself,
if you want to hold out.

665
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:51,673
Come on, Lardass!

666
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,593
Lardass, Lardass!

667
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:07,956
What the audience didn't know, was
that Lardass wasn't interested in winning.

668
00:45:08,844 --> 00:45:10,596
What he wanted was revenge.

669
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,155
And right before he was introduced,
he'd gotten ready for it.

670
00:45:16,484 --> 00:45:18,395
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

671
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:30,275
<i>And our celebrity contestant</i>
<i>from KLAM in Portland...</i>

672
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:34,435
<i>... The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

673
00:45:38,364 --> 00:45:40,673
<i>From the racks and stacks</i>
<i>it's the best on wax...</i>

674
00:45:40,764 --> 00:45:44,677
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,</i>
<i>sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

675
00:45:44,764 --> 00:45:45,640
<i>... it's...</i>

676
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:46,794
Done.

677
00:45:49,524 --> 00:45:53,881
<i>Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began</i>
<i>to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.</i>

678
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:56,319
<i>He pretended he was eating cowflops...</i>

679
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,515
<i>... and rat guts in blueberry sauce.</i>

680
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:00,240
Done.

681
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:07,397
<i>Slowly, a sound started to build</i>
<i>in Lardass's stomach.</i>

682
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:10,959
<i>A strange and scary sound...</i>

683
00:46:11,324 --> 00:46:14,600
<i>... like a log truck coming</i>
<i>at you at 100 miles an hour.</i>

684
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:30,518
<i>Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...</i>

685
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:33,594
<i>... and before Bill Travis knew it...</i>

686
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:37,399
<i>... he was covered with five pies worth</i>
<i>of used blueberries.</i>

687
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:40,320
<i>The women in the audience screamed.</i>

688
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:44,916
<i>Bossman Bob Cormier took one look</i>
<i>at Bill Travis and barfed on Wiggins.</i>

689
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:49,233
<i>Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack</i>
<i>that was sitting next to him.</i>

690
00:46:49,324 --> 00:46:51,713
<i>Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits!</i>

691
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:54,440
But when the smell hit the crowd...

692
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:58,002
...that's when Lardass's plan
really started to work.

693
00:46:58,204 --> 00:46:59,922
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

694
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:01,676
<i>Kids barfed on their parents.</i>

695
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:03,402
<i>A fat lady barfed in her purse.</i>

696
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,395
<i>The Donelley twins barfed on each other.</i>

697
00:47:05,484 --> 00:47:10,274
<i>The Women's Auxiliary barfed all over</i>
<i>the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.</i>

698
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:13,960
And Lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he'd created.

699
00:47:14,804 --> 00:47:19,195
A complete and total barfarama.

700
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:29,554
- Too cool!
- That was the best, just the best.

701
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,717
Then what happened?

702
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:33,073
What do you mean?

703
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:34,836
I mean, what happened?

704
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:38,998
What do you mean, <i>"</i>What happened?<i>"</i>
That's the end.

705
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:43,641
How can that be the end? What kind of an
ending is that? What happens to Lardass?

706
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:44,998
I don't know.

707
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:48,361
Maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers.

708
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:51,158
Jesus, that ending sucks.

709
00:47:52,364 --> 00:47:55,117
Why don't you make it
so that Lardass goes home...

710
00:47:55,204 --> 00:47:56,637
...and he shoots his father.

711
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:59,113
Then he runs away
and he joins the Texas Rangers.

712
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:00,398
How about that?

713
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:01,803
I don't know.

714
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:03,836
Something good like that.

715
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:06,803
I like the ending. The barfing was good.

716
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:10,192
But there's one thing I didn't understand.

717
00:48:11,644 --> 00:48:14,397
Did Lardass have to pay
to get into the contest?

718
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:17,639
No, Vern, they just let him in.

719
00:48:19,164 --> 00:48:21,234
Great, great story.

720
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:23,964
It's a great story.
I just didn't like the ending.

721
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:26,922
Where's the radio?
Let's see if we can get some sounds.

722
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:27,880
Here.

723
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:37,756
<i>We talked into the night.</i>

724
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:41,474
<i>The kind of talk that seemed important</i>
<i>until you discover girls.</i>

725
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,719
All right.

726
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:46,837
Mickey's a Mouse. Donald's a duck.
Pluto's a dog.

727
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:49,038
What's Goofy?

728
00:48:49,684 --> 00:48:52,357
If I could only have one food
for the rest of my life?

729
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:54,400
That's easy. Pez.

730
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:57,722
Cherry flavoured Pez.
No question about it.

731
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:01,483
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

732
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:06,002
I knew the $64,000 Question was fixed.

733
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:09,076
There's no way anybody can know
that much about opera.

734
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:13,474
He can't be a dog.
He wears a hat and drives a car.

735
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:16,794
<i>Wagon Train</i> is a really cool show...

736
00:49:17,044 --> 00:49:20,116
...but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere?

737
00:49:20,444 --> 00:49:22,355
They just keep wagon training.

738
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,235
God, that's weird.

739
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,442
What the hell is Goofy?

740
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:33,843
<i>Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower,</i>
<i>but we were all thinking about him.</i>

741
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:41,198
Oh, my God.

742
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:42,837
It's the Brower kid.

743
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:45,154
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

744
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:49,714
I promise I won't hock
no more dirty books.

745
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:53,843
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.
I promise I'll eat my lima beans.

746
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:56,077
Two for flinching.

747
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:01,883
What is it, Chris?

748
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,517
Maybe it's coyotes.

749
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:06,761
Sounds like a woman screaming.

750
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:08,994
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

751
00:50:09,244 --> 00:50:10,472
Don't say that.

752
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:12,117
Teddy, sit down.

753
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:14,713
I'm gonna go look for it.
I want to see the ghost.

754
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:15,919
Don't say that.

755
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:18,996
I just want to see it!
I just want to see what he looks like.

756
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:20,802
Jesus H. Bald-headed Christ!

757
00:50:26,764 --> 00:50:28,755
Maybe we should stand guard.

758
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:31,322
That's a good idea.

759
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,838
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.

760
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:52,556
23:00 hours.
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

761
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:58,957
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.

762
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:02,238
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.

763
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:13,992
- Cut it out.
- I'm trying to sleep.

764
00:51:17,044 --> 00:51:19,114
The dogfaces rested easy...

765
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,764
...in the knowledge that
Corporal Teddy Duchamp...

766
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:24,882
...was protecting all that was dear to them.

767
00:52:55,404 --> 00:52:57,156
<i>It should have been you, Gordon.</i>

768
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,478
Are you okay?

769
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:05,763
You were dreaming.

770
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:18,439
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

771
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:24,803
I miss him, Chris.

772
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:26,803
I really miss him.

773
00:53:28,524 --> 00:53:29,434
I know.

774
00:53:33,364 --> 00:53:34,717
Go back to sleep.

775
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:17,476
Maybe you could go
into the college courses with me.

776
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:19,237
That'll be the day.

777
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:21,915
Why not? You're smart enough.

778
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:23,403
They won't let me.

779
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:26,763
What do you mean?

780
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,357
It's the way the people think
of my family in this town.

781
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:34,483
It's the way they think of me. I'm just one
of those low-life Chambers kids.

782
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:35,997
That's not true.

783
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:37,918
It is.

784
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:41,516
No one asked me if I took the milk money.

785
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:44,195
I just got a three-day vacation.

786
00:54:49,964 --> 00:54:51,238
Did you take it?

787
00:54:51,444 --> 00:54:53,878
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.

788
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:56,557
Teddy knew I took it.

789
00:54:57,284 --> 00:55:00,560
Everyone knew I took it.
Even Vern knew, I think.

790
00:55:05,204 --> 00:55:07,798
Maybe I was sorry,
and I tried to give it back.

791
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:10,002
You tried to give it back?

792
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:12,434
Maybe, just maybe.

793
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:17,995
Maybe I took it to Old Lady Simons
and told her, and the money was all there.

794
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:21,599
But I still got a three-day vacation,
because it never showed up.

795
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,079
And maybe the next week,
old Lady Simons...

796
00:55:24,164 --> 00:55:27,201
...had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school.

797
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,272
Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.

798
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:35,480
Let's just say that I stole the milk money,
but old Lady Simons stole it back from me.

799
00:55:35,844 --> 00:55:38,153
Just suppose that I told this story.

800
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:41,277
Me, Chris Chambers,
kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

801
00:55:41,364 --> 00:55:43,673
Do you think anyone
would have believed it?

802
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:44,355
No.

803
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:48,437
You think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags...

804
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,874
...from The View,
if they had taken the money?

805
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,317
- No way.
- Hell, no.

806
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,399
But, with me<i>...</i>

807
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:02,841
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time.

808
00:56:03,524 --> 00:56:05,958
Anyway, she saw her chance
and she took it.

809
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:09,842
I was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back.

810
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,282
I just never thought<i>...</i>

811
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:23,078
I never thought that a teacher<i>...</i>

812
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:27,479
Who gives a fuck anyway?

813
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,523
I just wish...

814
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:39,680
...that I could go someplace
where nobody knows me.

815
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,995
I guess I'm just a pussy.

816
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,601
No way, man.

817
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:41,915
<i>The freight woke up the other guys...</i>

818
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:46,236
<i>... and it was on the tip of my tongue</i>
<i>to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.</i>

819
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:49,638
<i>That was the one thing I kept to myself.</i>

820
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,682
<i>I've never spoken or written of it</i>
<i>until just now.</i>

821
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,484
How come you didn't get
some breakfast stuff like...

822
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,600
...Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

823
00:58:06,204 --> 00:58:11,119
Sorry. I guess a more experienced shopper
could've gotten more for your 7 cents.

824
00:58:12,564 --> 00:58:16,079
<i>With our stomachs rumbling,</i>
<i>we pressed on toward the Royal River.</i>

825
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:21,035
<i>The reality of Ray Brower was growing,</i>
<i>and kept us moving despite the heat.</i>

826
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:24,837
<i>For me, the idea</i>
<i>of seeing that kid's dead body...</i>

827
00:58:24,924 --> 00:58:27,233
<i>... was starting to become an obsession.</i>

828
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:40,561
Gentlemen, the Royal.

829
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:45,724
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

830
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:49,480
We cut across this field right here,
we'll be there in an hour.

831
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:52,919
I think we should stick to the tracks.

832
00:58:53,004 --> 00:58:54,881
I say we go across the field.

833
00:58:55,564 --> 00:58:56,474
Gordie?

834
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,042
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

835
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,276
Take no prisoners!

836
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:06,473
You guys, it's a lot safer if we<i>...</i>

837
00:59:08,284 --> 00:59:10,081
Come on, men. Let's take on the<i>...</i>

838
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:12,359
You don't know what's in those woods.

839
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:17,003
You guys, wait up for me!

840
00:59:25,924 --> 00:59:28,882
I gotta tell you something,
but swear on your mother's name...

841
00:59:28,964 --> 00:59:30,682
...that you won't tell anybody.

842
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:31,833
You got it, pal.

843
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:37,113
Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

844
00:59:37,524 --> 00:59:38,434
What about him?

845
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:42,080
I'll tell you something, but you must swear
on your mother's good name...

846
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:43,392
...you won't tell nobody.

847
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:47,757
<i>Billy and Charlie had managed to keep</i>
<i>their enormous secret for about 36 hours.</i>

848
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:50,000
<i>A personal record for both of them.</i>

849
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:53,918
<i>By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told</i>
<i>their secret to everybody in the gang.</i>

850
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:58,163
<i>I guess for those guys, protecting their</i>
<i>mother's good name wasn't a top priority.</i>

851
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,759
Ace, maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.

852
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:03,995
Maybe you could go without us?

853
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:07,916
You guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit.

854
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,323
I don't see your problem.

855
01:00:09,404 --> 01:00:12,840
We take a bunch of fishing gear,
so if a cop asks us what we're doing:

856
01:00:12,924 --> 01:00:17,634
<i>"</i>We're here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river. Look what we found<i>."</i>

857
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:19,919
Come on, man, we're gonna be famous.

858
01:00:20,044 --> 01:00:22,922
We'll be on every radio and TV show
in the country.

859
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:25,234
I still don't think we should go.

860
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:26,393
Okay.

861
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,274
You've stated your position clearly.

862
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:32,196
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

863
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:35,153
Get in the fucking car. Now!

864
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:36,518
Let's go, man.

865
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:52,717
- I hate this shortcut.
- <i>"</i>I hate this shortcut<i>."</i>

866
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:57,797
You flinched! Two for flinching.

867
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:03,037
But you flinched.

868
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:05,274
I know. Two for flinching.

869
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:26,835
How are we supposed to get across this?

870
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:29,438
- We use you as a raft.
- Very funny.

871
01:01:39,644 --> 01:01:42,204
It's not that deep. We can walk across.

872
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,678
I told you we should have stuck
to the tracks.

873
01:01:56,564 --> 01:01:59,601
Is it me,
or are you the world's biggest pussy?

874
01:02:00,444 --> 01:02:02,355
I suppose this is fun for you.

875
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:04,635
No, but this is.

876
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,192
Want some more?

877
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:11,599
- Stop it, come on!
- Act your age.

878
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:12,719
This is my age.

879
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:15,523
I'm in the prime of my youth,
and I'll only be young once.

880
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:18,357
But you're going to be stupid
for the rest of your life.

881
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:21,720
That's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant.

882
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,483
You die, Chambers!

883
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,563
Get him, Chambers!

884
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:33,395
- Vern's afraid he's gonna die!
- Teddy, you're gonna die!

885
01:02:36,844 --> 01:02:39,233
Where do you think
you're going, Lachance?

886
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,363
Come on, you guys.

887
01:02:42,044 --> 01:02:43,079
Pile on!

888
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:46,522
I don't want to do this.

889
01:02:48,084 --> 01:02:49,153
Get off!

890
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,993
- Sleeper hold.
- Stop it. I'm serious.

891
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:55,518
No one gets out of the sleeper hold.

892
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:59,643
- Vern, there's something on your neck.
- I'm not falling for that one, Lachance.

893
01:02:59,724 --> 01:03:01,521
No, there is something on your neck.

894
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,675
It's a leech. Leeches!

895
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:05,277
- Oh, my God!
- Leeches!

896
01:03:18,884 --> 01:03:20,158
Get them off!

897
01:03:20,324 --> 01:03:21,439
Lay off me!

898
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:26,401
- Gordie, there's some on your back.
- Get them off!

899
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:29,602
Are there any on mine?

900
01:03:50,484 --> 01:03:51,837
Oh, shit, Chris.

901
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:55,558
Oh, shit, man.

902
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:18,563
Are you okay?

903
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:21,843
Can you hear me?

904
01:04:22,804 --> 01:04:23,998
Are you there?

905
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:25,598
Maybe he's dead.

906
01:04:25,684 --> 01:04:27,834
He's not dead. He's still breathing, idiot.

907
01:04:27,924 --> 01:04:28,913
I don't know.

908
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,758
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

909
01:04:36,404 --> 01:04:38,838
I never met anybody who fainted before.

910
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,923
Maybe he made a bad mistake
and looked at your face.

911
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,403
Shut up, Teddy.

912
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:45,959
You okay?

913
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:48,757
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

914
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:56,396
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

915
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:59,157
Great, Chambers,
now you're turning pussy, too!

916
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:02,594
What's your problem?
He had a leech on his balls. He fainted.

917
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:03,833
Are you his mother?

918
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:05,721
- Eat shit.
- You eat shit.

919
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:09,433
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

920
01:05:10,044 --> 01:05:13,161
What a surprise! The king of the pussies
wants to go back, too.

921
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,360
- Stop calling me that.
- What, <i>"</i>pussy<i>"</i>? Pussy!

922
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,957
- Stop it!
- Pussy!

923
01:05:17,044 --> 01:05:18,602
You four-eyed psycho!

924
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,119
Get off me!

925
01:05:21,324 --> 01:05:24,316
Two for flinching.
Do I get two for flinching?

926
01:05:24,404 --> 01:05:25,598
You like it, Teddy?

927
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:28,437
- Come on, you guys. Break it up.
- Stop it!

928
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:38,917
I'm not going back.

929
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:45,919
- Idiot.
- Shut up! Retard.

930
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:54,559
<i>At the time, I didn't know why I needed</i>
<i>to see that body so badly.</i>

931
01:05:55,044 --> 01:05:58,275
<i>Even if no one had followed me,</i>
<i>I would have gone on alone.</i>

932
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:13,637
No way, Ace! Not this time, man.
No way!

933
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:16,158
- Go for it, Vince.
- You want to race?

934
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:28,721
Oh, my God, I got him.

935
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:33,200
You are history. History!

936
01:06:33,524 --> 01:06:35,719
- Fall back, Ace.
- Don't fuck around.

937
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:41,674
Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!

938
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,396
Shit, man! Shit!

939
01:06:59,844 --> 01:07:00,754
I won.

940
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,033
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.

941
01:07:14,604 --> 01:07:17,596
Coming though the woods,
I bet we saved over an hour.

942
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:25,035
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

943
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:29,954
The Brower kid must be
around here someplace.

944
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:32,319
Teddy and Vern
watch the left side of the tracks.

945
01:07:32,404 --> 01:07:34,474
- We'll take the right.
- All right.

946
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,520
There he is! I see him! Look!

947
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:51,674
Look over there! I see him!

948
01:07:54,724 --> 01:07:56,396
<i>None of us could breathe.</i>

949
01:07:56,964 --> 01:08:00,115
<i>Somewhere under those bushes</i>
<i>was the rest of Ray Brower.</i>

950
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:14,599
<i>The train had knocked Ray</i>
<i>out of his Keds...</i>

951
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:17,482
<i>... just like it had knocked the life</i>
<i>out of his body.</i>

952
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:18,519
Jesus.

953
01:08:20,724 --> 01:08:22,203
<i>The kid wasn't sick.</i>

954
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:24,402
<i>The kid wasn't sleeping.</i>

955
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:26,677
<i>The kid was dead.</i>

956
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:45,120
Let's look for some long branches.
We'll build him a stretcher.

957
01:08:57,844 --> 01:08:58,799
Gordie?

958
01:09:07,044 --> 01:09:08,716
Why did you have to die?

959
01:09:09,804 --> 01:09:11,362
What's the matter with Gordie?

960
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:12,479
Nothing.

961
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:15,363
You guys just go over there
and look for some branches?

962
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:16,115
Okay.

963
01:09:27,884 --> 01:09:29,795
Why did he have to die, Chris?

964
01:09:30,604 --> 01:09:33,641
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

965
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:37,118
I don't know.

966
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:40,999
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that.

967
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,644
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that, man.

968
01:09:45,164 --> 01:09:48,554
I'm no good. My dad said it. I'm no good.

969
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:50,203
He doesn't know you.

970
01:09:51,644 --> 01:09:52,713
He hates me.

971
01:09:52,804 --> 01:09:54,237
He doesn't hate you.

972
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:56,676
- He hates me.
- No.

973
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:58,516
He just doesn't know you.

974
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:01,836
He hates me. My dad hates me.

975
01:10:02,964 --> 01:10:05,842
He hates me. Oh, God.

976
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:30,872
You're gonna be a great writer someday.

977
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:36,597
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard-up for material.

978
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,723
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard-up?

979
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:00,320
Yeah.

980
01:11:03,684 --> 01:11:05,914
What the fuck do you know about this?

981
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:09,119
Son of a bitch! My little brother.

982
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:15,434
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

983
01:11:17,124 --> 01:11:18,523
You get away.

984
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:20,396
We found him. We got dibs.

985
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,602
We better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

986
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:28,399
We earned him. You guys came in a car.
That's not fair. He's ours.

987
01:11:28,524 --> 01:11:30,321
<i>"</i>That's not fair. He's ours<i>."</i>

988
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:32,323
Well, not anymore.

989
01:11:32,564 --> 01:11:35,601
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

990
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:37,635
We will. Don't you worry.

991
01:11:42,204 --> 01:11:44,843
Vern, you little son of a whore.

992
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:48,121
- You was under the porch.
- No, I swear it wasn't me.

993
01:11:48,444 --> 01:11:51,800
You keyhole-peeping bung.
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

994
01:11:58,244 --> 01:11:59,962
You guys have two choices.

995
01:12:01,204 --> 01:12:03,718
Either leave quietly and we take the body...

996
01:12:04,244 --> 01:12:06,917
...or you stay
and we beat the shit out of you.

997
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:08,837
And we take the body.

998
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,473
- Besides, me and Billy found him first.
- Vern told us how you found him.

999
01:12:12,564 --> 01:12:15,795
<i>"</i>Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car<i>."</i>

1000
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:19,963
<i>"</i>Billy, I think I just turned
my Fruit of the Looms into fudge factory<i>."</i>

1001
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,433
- That's it. Your ass is grass!
- Hold it.

1002
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:29,160
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.
This is your last chance.

1003
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,317
What do you say, kid?

1004
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:36,642
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

1005
01:12:41,164 --> 01:12:42,313
You're dead.

1006
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:44,563
Come on, let's split.

1007
01:12:45,004 --> 01:12:47,359
- They're not taking him.
- Come on, this is crazy.

1008
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:49,753
- They're not taking him.
- He's got a knife, man.

1009
01:12:50,644 --> 01:12:52,077
Ace, come on.

1010
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:59,160
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1011
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:00,438
No problem.

1012
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:16,756
You're not taking him.
Nobody's taking him.

1013
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:22,274
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

1014
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:26,158
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

1015
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:28,643
Don't move, Ace.

1016
01:13:30,604 --> 01:13:32,515
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1017
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:36,919
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1018
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:42,356
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

1019
01:13:46,284 --> 01:13:50,675
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

1020
01:13:57,244 --> 01:13:59,553
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1021
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,920
No, just you.

1022
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,241
We're gonna get you for this.

1023
01:14:14,644 --> 01:14:16,760
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1024
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:18,552
We will.

1025
01:14:30,764 --> 01:14:34,154
We're not going to forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

1026
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,522
This is big time, baby.

1027
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:54,556
<i>"</i>Suck my fat one<i>"</i>?

1028
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,518
Whoever told you,
you had a fat one, Lachance?

1029
01:15:00,004 --> 01:15:01,835
Biggest one in four counties.

1030
01:15:19,324 --> 01:15:20,996
Are we going to take him?

1031
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:22,154
No.

1032
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:26,036
But we came all this way?

1033
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:28,875
We're supposed to be heroes.

1034
01:15:30,404 --> 01:15:31,883
Not this way, Teddy.

1035
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:37,115
Chris, give me a hand.

1036
01:15:39,804 --> 01:15:41,601
<i>Ray Brower's body was found...</i>

1037
01:15:41,684 --> 01:15:44,642
<i>... but neither our gang</i>
<i>nor their gang got the credit.</i>

1038
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:48,952
<i>We decided that an anonymous phone call</i>
<i>was the best thing to do.</i>

1039
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:58,872
<i>We headed home. And although</i>
<i>many thoughts raced through our minds...</i>

1040
01:15:59,444 --> 01:16:01,036
<i>... we barely spoke.</i>

1041
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,363
<i>We walked all night</i>
<i>and made it back to Castle Rock...</i>

1042
01:16:07,444 --> 01:16:11,995
<i>... a little past 5:00 on Sunday morning,</i>
<i>the day before Labour Day.</i>

1043
01:16:13,244 --> 01:16:17,362
<i>We'd only been gone two days,</i>
<i>but somehow the town seemed different...</i>

1044
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:19,237
<i>... smaller.</i>

1045
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:38,563
See you in school.

1046
01:16:42,524 --> 01:16:44,162
See you in Junior High.

1047
01:16:57,684 --> 01:16:58,639
Penny.

1048
01:17:07,084 --> 01:17:10,963
I better get home, before my mom
puts me on the <i>"</i>10 Most Wanted List<i>."</i>

1049
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:23,322
No hard feelings, okay?

1050
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:25,353
No way, man.

1051
01:17:48,924 --> 01:17:52,075
<i>As time went on we saw less and less</i>
<i>of Teddy and Vern...</i>

1052
01:17:52,644 --> 01:17:56,239
<i>... until eventually they became</i>
<i>just two more faces in the halls.</i>

1053
01:17:56,364 --> 01:17:57,877
<i>It happens sometimes.</i>

1054
01:17:58,044 --> 01:18:01,559
<i>Friends come in and out of your life</i>
<i>like busboys in a restaurant.</i>

1055
01:18:02,084 --> 01:18:05,474
<i>I heard that Vern got married</i>
<i>out of high school, had four kids...</i>

1056
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:09,079
<i>... and is now the forklift operator</i>
<i>at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.</i>

1057
01:18:09,444 --> 01:18:13,483
<i>Teddy tried to get into the Army,</i>
<i>but his eyes and his ear kept him out.</i>

1058
01:18:13,724 --> 01:18:15,919
<i>Last I'd heard</i>
<i>he'd spent some time in jail...</i>

1059
01:18:16,004 --> 01:18:18,757
<i>... and was now doing odd jobs</i>
<i>around Castle Rock.</i>

1060
01:18:26,884 --> 01:18:29,762
I'm never gonna get out of this town,
am I, Gordie?

1061
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:33,474
You can do anything you want, man.

1062
01:18:36,604 --> 01:18:37,480
Sure.

1063
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,123
Give me some skin.

1064
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:57,193
I'll see you.

1065
01:18:57,684 --> 01:18:59,322
Not if I see you first.

1066
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:05,443
<i>Chris did get out.</i>

1067
01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:07,680
<i>He enrolled in the college courses with me.</i>

1068
01:19:07,764 --> 01:19:11,154
<i>And although it was hard,</i>
<i>he gutted it out like he always did.</i>

1069
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:14,242
<i>He went on to college</i>
<i>and eventually became a lawyer.</i>

1070
01:19:14,924 --> 01:19:17,518
<i>Last week,</i>
<i>he entered a fast-food restaurant.</i>

1071
01:19:17,924 --> 01:19:20,643
<i>Just ahead of him,</i>
<i>two men got into an argument.</i>

1072
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:22,282
<i>One of them pulled a knife.</i>

1073
01:19:22,364 --> 01:19:25,800
<i>Chris, who'd always made the best peace,</i>
<i>tried to break it up.</i>

1074
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:28,282
<i>He was stabbed in the throat.</i>

1075
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:30,036
<i>He died almost instantly.</i>

1076
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,156
Dad, can we go now?

1077
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:55,240
- You ready?
- We've been ready for an hour.

1078
01:19:58,404 --> 01:19:59,917
I'll be right there.

1079
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:02,081
He said that a half hour ago.

1080
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:05,076
My dad's weird.
He gets like that when he's writing.

1081
01:25:02,404 --> 01:25:03,996
