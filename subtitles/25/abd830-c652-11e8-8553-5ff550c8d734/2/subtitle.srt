1
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:05,799
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

2
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,795
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

3
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:14,272
I'm sure she did.

4
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,876
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

5
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,714
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,876
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

7
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:27,511
Ever?

8
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:29,580
Ever.

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,959
All right, I, uh...

10
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,353
Well, that must be it, then.

11
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:38,863
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,434
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

13
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,402
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,401
You make me laugh, smile.

15
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,908
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

16
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:58,850
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

17
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,722
I can't think of anything worse.

18
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,288
I understand, and I'm sorry.

19
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,986
That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

20
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:16,429
Just give me a minute.

21
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,633
Let me get my sweater.

22
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:26,474
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?

23
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:29,344
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

24
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:33,452
Well, here's to new beginnings.

25
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:40,616
Mm.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,822
You're disgusting.

27
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,592
You've already made that pretty clear.

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,297
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

29
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,428
your <i>Miss Myrna</i> column
on the rig the other day.

30
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,097
Really? You read them?

31
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,265
All of them.

32
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,609
Very informative, too.

33
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:00,578
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

34
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,148
Well, I do my homework.

35
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,917
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

36
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,383
Thank you.

37
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,723
I want to be a journalist.

38
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,961
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

39
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:23,069
I like that.

40
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,739
You're really smart. And pretty.

41
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:37,981
Skeeter.

42
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,151
I hope you get to write something
really good.

43
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,688
Something you believe in.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,094
Hello?

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,434
What? I'm coming!

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,011
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

47
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:14,110
Oh! You're trespassing!

48
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,222
It's Skeeter!

49
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:17,722
She put it in the newsletter.

50
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:19,086
Oh, my God.

51
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:23,890
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house."

52
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,090
Not commodes!

53
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,098
Why would she do this to me?

54
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,100
I don't know. I don't know, Hilly.

55
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,933
It's so embarrassing.

56
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,710
Oh, Lord.

57
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,249
I go potty, Mommy.

58
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:47,278
No! Mae Mobley!

59
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,480
You get off of that toilet!

60
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,457
- You will catch diseases, you hear me?
- Mommy!

61
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:55,619
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

62
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:13,472
You is kind, you is smart,

63
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,844
you is important.

64
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:29,285
<i>Don't shop for anything</i>
<i>on Capitol Street.</i>

65
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,333
<i>Let's let the merchants down on</i>
<i>Capitol Street feel the economic pinch.</i>

66
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,436
<i>Let me say this to you.</i>

67
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,300
<i>I had one merchant to call me,</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,104
<i>"I want you to know that I've</i>
<i>talked to my national office today,</i>

69
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:47,544
<i>and they want me to tell you that we</i>
<i>don't need nigger business."</i>

70
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,749
<i>These are stores that help to support</i>
<i>the White Citizens' Council,</i>

71
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:57,119
<i>the council that is dedicated to keeping</i>
<i>you and I second-class citizens.</i>

72
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,115
Mama!

73
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,487
Don't encourage them like that.

74
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,031
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

75
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,233
You understand?

76
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,013
How you doing, Miss Clark?

77
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:26,211
All right, Henry.

78
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:28,253
Thank you. How you doing?

79
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:33,357
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

80
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,927
That's good.

81
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,756
- Yeah.
- That's good.

82
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:46,805
What's going on out there, mister?

83
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:48,898
Coloured people off.

84
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:50,670
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

85
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:51,937
I'll get you close as I can.

86
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:53,704
What happened?

87
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,679
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

88
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,618
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

89
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,754
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

90
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:13,698
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

91
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,098
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

92
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:18,769
You have a good night.

93
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:21,169
Which way you going?

94
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:32,118
<i>We view this as a cold,</i>

95
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,244
<i>brutal, deliberate...</i>

96
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,655
<i>...killing in a savage,</i>
<i>uncivilised state.</i>

97
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:44,992
<i>There is no state with a record that</i>
<i>approaches that of Mississippi</i>

98
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:49,329
<i>in inhumanity, murder, brutality</i>

99
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,562
<i>and racial hatred.</i>

100
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:55,402
<i>It is absolutely at the bottom</i>
<i>of the list.</i>

101
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,003
<i>Fifteen minutes past midnight,</i>

102
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:01,944
<i>Evers got out of his car beside his home</i>
<i>in a Negro residential area.</i>

103
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:04,016
<i>In a vacant lot about 40 yards away,</i>

104
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:07,620
<i>a sniper fired a single shot from a</i>
<i>high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.</i>

105
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,121
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

106
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:11,884
- I'm OK.
- <i>The bullet hit him in the back,</i>

107
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:14,927
<i>crashed through his body,</i>
<i>through a window, into the house.</i>

108
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,553
<i>He died within an hour</i>
<i>at a Jackson hospital.</i>

109
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:20,031
<i>City detectives believe the fatal shot</i>
<i>was fired from...</i>

110
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,227
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

111
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,931
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

112
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:32,570
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,116
We living in hell. Trapped.

114
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,451
Our kids, trapped.

115
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:44,380
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

116
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,695
Good night.

117
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,198
Good night. Good night.

118
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,731
Oh. Good night, baby.

119
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,478
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

120
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,853
We're gonna be careful.

121
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:20,856
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

122
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:23,520
We ain't doing civil rights.

123
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:26,633
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

124
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,835
You're a fool, old woman.

125
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,439
A fool.

126
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:08,998
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed <i>Miss Myrna</i> 30 minutes ago.

127
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:10,600
Yes, sir.

128
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:12,336
Chop-chop.

129
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,013
Good Lord.

130
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:32,695
Miss Celia?

131
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,475
Miss Celia?

132
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,643
Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

133
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,085
You mess up your hair colouring again?

134
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,715
I helped you fix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

135
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,454
Was real pretty, remember?

136
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,831
Miss Celia.

137
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:09,800
I told you, go home!

138
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,310
I said get out!

139
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,764
Why is there so much blood?

140
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:55,247
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

141
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:00,247
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

142
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:05,022
Then I lost it a month later.

143
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,519
Johnny wants kids now.

144
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,830
What's he gonna do with me?

145
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,135
Well...

146
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,532
Mr Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

147
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,138
He doesn't know about the baby.

148
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,218
Or the two before.

149
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,440
Yule Mae Davis?

150
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,644
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

151
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:39,216
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

152
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,222
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

153
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:50,160
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

154
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,126
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

155
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:57,363
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

156
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,243
Just let me go!

157
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:06,275
Yule Mae, don't fight.

158
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:17,951
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

159
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,957
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and colour.

160
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,358
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

161
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,701
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

162
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:34,306
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

163
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,204
Oh, yes.

164
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,038
Just go sit down over there.

165
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:49,088
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

166
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:50,880
Now.

167
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,550
I'm gonna help with your stories.

168
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:27,257
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

169
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,324
We all are.

170
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,422
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

171
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:37,259
I used to take
a shortcut every day

172
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:40,134
when I went to work
at Dr Dixon's house.

173
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:43,868
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

174
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,878
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

175
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,609
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

176
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:58,053
Dr Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

177
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:01,425
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

178
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:07,061
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

179
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,563
He did.

180
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,763
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

181
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:17,134
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

182
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,509
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

183
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:25,918
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

184
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,787
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

185
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,481
Mean for sport.

186
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,558
Lord, I tried to find another job.

187
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:39,725
But in everybody's mind

188
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,269
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

189
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,770
Owned me.

190
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,310
<i>I leave early</i>
<i>this week for Thanksgiving.</i>

191
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,281
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

192
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,180
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

193
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,345
- <i>I'd better have it by then.</i>
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

194
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:05,014
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

195
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:07,991
You do not want it in the pile.

196
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,220
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:12,763
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

198
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,465
I understand.

199
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:25,907
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

200
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,105
I know, but I think we're on track.
We're doing quite well.

201
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:38,914
- It's so good.
- Mm-hm.

202
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,923
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

203
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:42,719
Aibileen?

204
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,825
Hey, Elizabeth!

205
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,333
It's me, Celia Foote.

206
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,896
I was in the neighbourhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

207
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:59,273
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

208
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,478
Get down! Get down! Get down!

209
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,586
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

210
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,586
Shh!

211
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:15,691
Hey!

212
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,887
Shh!

213
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,165
I brought a chocolate pie!

214
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,735
My maid, Minny, made it.

215
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,379
She's in the bushes.

216
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:02,905
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

217
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:14,620
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

218
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:17,884
Why, Minny?

219
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,896
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr Johnny.

220
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:25,965
Mad you married one of their mens.

221
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:30,702
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr Johnny had just broke up, too.

222
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,430
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

223
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:35,268
when they were still going steady.

224
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,501
Mm-hm.

225
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:41,944
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr Johnny, too.

226
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,307
No wonder!

227
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:52,486
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

228
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:56,022
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

229
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:59,131
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

230
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,533
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

231
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,970
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

232
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,703
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

233
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,009
That looks bad.

234
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,717
Let me take a look.

235
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,283
I got to get these peas on.

236
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,188
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

237
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:50,008
You know what I'd do if I were you?

238
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,845
I'd give it right back to him.

239
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:58,256
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

240
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:01,189
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

241
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,937
<i>From here, the members of the family...</i>

242
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,677
<i>...visitors from foreign countries</i>
<i>and others</i>

243
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,806
<i>will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.</i>

244
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,154
<i>Senator Edward Kennedy</i>
<i>getting out of the car.</i>

245
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:36,628
<i>Mrs Kennedy.</i>

246
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:39,956
<i>Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.</i>

247
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,227
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

248
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,131
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

249
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,851
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

250
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,852
What if people find out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

251
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,388
figure out who who?

252
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,495
Maybe we need us some insurance.

253
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:16,458
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

254
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:19,468
But we ain't got no choice.

255
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,964
Sorry.

256
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:26,978
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

257
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,609
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

258
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,080
Mmm.

259
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,181
Mm-mm-mm.

260
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:43,826
So...

261
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:48,499
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

262
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,531
Did they?

263
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:02,507
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

264
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:03,911
I'm glad you like it.

265
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,482
Mmm.

266
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,145
Oh.

267
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:14,226
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

268
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,850
Take me back?

269
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:22,131
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

270
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:25,033
That good vanilla from Mexico...

271
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:27,833
...and something else real special.

272
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,604
Mmm.

273
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:34,941
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

274
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,384
Mama can have a piece.

275
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:43,413
Cut her one.

276
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,556
Go get a plate.

277
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,725
Eat my shit.

278
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:58,369
What'd you say?

279
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:02,568
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

280
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,512
Have you lost your mind?

281
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:20,456
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

282
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,788
Did what?

283
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,910
And you didn't eat just one.

284
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,248
You had two slices!

285
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,097
Run, Minny, run!

286
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,266
You trying to get yourself killed?

287
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:11,343
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

288
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,144
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

289
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,318
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

290
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:24,251
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

291
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,126
I done ask God to forgive me.

292
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:33,998
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

293
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:40,803
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

294
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,071
We can't put that story in the book.

295
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,343
We ain't got no choice.

296
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:50,540
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

297
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,844
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

298
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,284
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

299
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:57,515
Right! But don't you see?

300
00:24:57,657 --> 00:25:00,990
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

301
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,891
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

302
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:06,631
No.

303
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:08,998
No, that's too dangerous.

304
00:25:13,373 --> 00:25:16,774
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

305
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:21,010
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

306
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:35,384
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10.00. See you then.

307
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,697
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

308
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,204
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

309
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:52,869
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

310
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:55,003
I'm absolutely thrilled.

311
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,440
Scandalous!

312
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:01,077
Thank you.

313
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,694
Hi!

314
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,367
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

315
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:24,705
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

316
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:28,376
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

317
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:29,641
and that's what she came up with?

318
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:32,478
Here.

319
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:45,591
Kiss me.

320
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:21,523
Everybody enjoying the evening?

321
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:29,365
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

322
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:36,411
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

323
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,984
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

324
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:45,549
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

325
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,358
Honey, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

326
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,226
I wish you'd try and eat something.

327
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,596
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

328
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:03,407
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

329
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,808
OK.

330
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:11,714
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

331
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,579
...Charlotte Phelan!

332
00:28:15,454 --> 00:28:17,217
Congrats, Miss Phelan.

333
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,551
Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

334
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,518
Now it's time for the baked goods.

335
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,632
Ooh, yummy, yummy!

336
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,031
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

337
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,037
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

338
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,298
Congratulations...

339
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:39,707
...Hilly Holbrook!

340
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:44,244
- Oh! Hilly.
- That's funny.

341
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:46,078
I didn't bid on anything.

342
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:49,780
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

343
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:51,219
Shh!

344
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,793
Congratulations, Hilly!

345
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:59,091
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

346
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,124
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

347
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:05,260
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

348
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,668
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

349
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:11,276
Wait. I want to talk...

350
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,809
Oh, no.

351
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm so sorry.

352
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,613
Come here, sweetheart.

353
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,549
Let me bring you back to your table.

354
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:26,447
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

355
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:31,322
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

356
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:33,159
I don't know what you're talking about.

357
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:34,891
You liar! Who did you tell?

358
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:37,333
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

359
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,166
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

360
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,764
Johnny never cheated on you.

361
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:46,168
At least not with me.

362
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:49,713
Oh, Johnny would never cheat on me.

363
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,283
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

364
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,523
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

365
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,990
Hey, that is enough.

366
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,584
Celia.

367
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:04,253
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

368
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:06,991
- Oh!
- Cel?

369
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,024
Oh!

370
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:13,969
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

371
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:18,137
Why don't we get back to the auction?

372
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,212
- Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.
- Celia!

373
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,840
It goes great with hot cocoa.

374
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,953
Oh, just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

375
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:35,357
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

376
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:37,962
You throw that pie away right now.

377
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:40,225
I spent good money on this pie.

378
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,964
I won it just for you.

379
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:45,230
You signed me up?

380
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:49,432
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

381
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:52,042
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

382
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:55,739
That my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

383
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:57,906
and that she ate Minny's shit.

384
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:00,178
Good night.

385
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:07,849
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

386
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:18,130
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

387
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:23,202
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

388
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,410
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

389
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:34,050
I can't do this to Johnny anymore.

390
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:38,753
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

391
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:42,690
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

392
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:46,956
Lord.

393
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,932
I reckon it's time you knew.

394
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,263
Sit down.

395
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:05,041
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

396
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,310
That you was making fun of her.

397
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,850
It's my fault she pounced on you.

398
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:18,387
If you leave Mr Johnny...

399
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:23,793
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

400
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:27,803
Then she done beaten me...

401
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:31,302
...and she done beat you.

402
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,877
Thank you for telling me that.

403
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:52,023
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

404
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,365
Mm-mm!

405
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,502
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

406
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:00,366
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

407
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:04,670
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

408
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,334
but other than that, we're done.

409
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:08,106
Which one you got left?

410
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,777
Uh, mine.

411
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,852
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

412
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:29,358
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

413
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,063
What happened?

414
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:33,603
Oh.

415
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:36,307
What happened?

416
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,141
She didn't give me a choice.

417
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,180
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

418
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:59,295
<i>Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed</i>
<i>president, came all the way down</i>

419
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:03,424
<i>from Washington, D.C.,</i>
<i>to our house for the ceremony.</i>

420
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:09,064
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

421
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,276
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

422
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:21,214
Yes, ma'am.

423
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:27,292
It's such an honour
that you came all this way.

424
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,060
That's all right.

425
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:44,570
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

426
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,740
We were expecting you next week.

427
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,678
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

428
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:52,783
Oh.

429
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,219
I'm entertaining.

430
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:57,755
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

431
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,692
Go on now.

432
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:09,356
I am sorry.

433
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:14,966
Rachel, what are you doing?

434
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:18,372
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

435
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:20,034
Going to the kitchen.

436
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:22,305
But I'm going to see my mama first.

437
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,513
Hello, Mama.

438
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,382
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

439
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:33,719
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

440
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:41,990
Get out of this house, Rachel.

441
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:48,505
You heard her. Go on, girl.

442
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:52,805
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

443
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,080
Charlotte.

444
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:02,420
Both of you.

445
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:05,216
Leave. Now.

446
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,726
Come on, Mama.

447
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:44,786
Come on now.

448
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,935
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:04,582
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

450
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:07,914
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

451
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:13,256
She did you the biggest favour of
your life. She taught me everything.

452
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:16,589
Well, you idolised her too much.
You always have.

453
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:18,890
I needed someone to look up to.

454
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,700
Well, I...

455
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,167
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

456
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,462
How could you not tell me all this?

457
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:04,133
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

458
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:07,006
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

459
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:08,773
I have to go find her. She needs me.

460
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,211
- Eugenia.
- What?

461
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:15,609
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

462
00:38:24,496 --> 00:38:25,963
When he got there...

463
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:31,560
...she had died.

464
00:38:47,686 --> 00:38:49,813
You broke her heart.

465
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

466
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:05,029
I'm sorry.

467
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,794
<i>They printed a few thousand copies</i>

468
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:06,295
<i>with the worst advance Miss Stein</i>
<i>had ever seen.</i>

469
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:09,093
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

470
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:15,538
<i>They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke</i>
<i>that money up and gave it to each of us.</i>

471
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:21,268
<i>Divided 13 ways,</i>
<i>that came to about $46 each.</i>

472
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,684
Y'all finish your homework.

473
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:36,521
Aibileen. Aibileen!

474
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,958
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

475
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:41,656
Look at it.

476
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,563
Look at it!

477
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:45,660
Minny, we're rich!

478
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:51,030
"She fired me
for using her inside toilet.

479
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:55,976
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

480
00:40:56,114 --> 00:41:00,312
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

481
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,685
I watched her eat..."

482
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,261
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

483
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:19,326
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

484
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:22,003
OK, Mama. I need to run.

485
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,975
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

486
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:30,707
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

487
00:41:31,183 --> 00:41:32,548
Quite scandalous.

488
00:41:33,852 --> 00:41:35,149
What book?

489
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,584
<i>What's it called again?</i>

490
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:37,755
Uh...

491
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:40,820
<i>The Help.</i> H-E-L-P.

492
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:09,918
There it is.

493
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,720
You told me to write something good.

494
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,060
- Something I believed in.
- It's not what I believe in.

495
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,067
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

496
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:28,562
Why would you do this to us?

497
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,133
I don't even know why you care.

498
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:34,142
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

499
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,745
Why go stir up trouble?

500
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,281
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

501
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,408
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

502
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:43,453
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

503
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:49,887
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

504
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,788
Stuart.

505
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:55,092
I think you're better off being alone.

506
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,806
Yeah.

507
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,748
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

508
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:49,787
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

509
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:52,219
"What you done put up in this?"

510
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,791
"She said, 'My shit."'

511
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:12,200
What's the matter, Hilly?

512
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:17,478
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Ouch! Stop hitting me!

513
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:22,213
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

514
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:24,788
It's not Jackson.

515
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,327
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

516
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,395
And Jolene, didn't your mama

517
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,555
leave Cora to you in her will?

518
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:37,657
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

519
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,532
The book is not about Jackson.

520
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,947
What the hell?

521
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,784
What are you doing here?

522
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,928
I've contacted my lawyer.

523
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:16,693
Hibbie Goodman? He's the best
libel attorney in the state.

524
00:46:16,868 --> 00:46:18,495
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

525
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:20,434
You can't prove anything.

526
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,939
Oh, I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

527
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:25,975
You don't know anything, Hilly.

528
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:27,635
Oh, I don't, do I?

529
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,340
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

530
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:34,384
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

531
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:38,488
Uh-huh.
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

532
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:41,854
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

533
00:46:41,993 --> 00:46:44,689
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

534
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:47,525
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

535
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:53,401
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

536
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:58,874
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

537
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,205
Don't give yourself away now.

538
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:03,307
That was not me!

539
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:06,377
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

540
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,611
She's going to be disgusted by you.

541
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,383
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

542
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:13,548
Oh, Mrs Phelan.

543
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:17,628
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

544
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,487
No, ma'am.

545
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:24,625
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

546
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:26,563
Oh.

547
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:28,195
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

548
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,331
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

549
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,172
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

550
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:41,915
Mrs Phelan, I came here...

551
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:44,578
In fact, I'm sure of it.

552
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:46,987
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

553
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,525
Go on.

554
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,755
Get off my property. Now!

555
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:57,097
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

556
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:15,716
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

557
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:17,812
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:36,532
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

559
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:38,803
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

560
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:43,038
Because we are going shopping.

561
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,407
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

562
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:49,144
representing the great state
of Mississippi

563
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:51,755
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

564
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,289
How do you know about New York?

565
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:56,258
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

566
00:49:03,935 --> 00:49:06,870
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

567
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:12,641
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

568
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,081
I can't leave you like this.

569
00:49:24,522 --> 00:49:27,685
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

570
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:30,317
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

571
00:49:30,462 --> 00:49:33,659
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

572
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:38,235
but I have decided not to die.

573
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:44,901
Oh, Mama.

574
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:46,805
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

575
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:49,209
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

576
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:51,815
but they wouldn't allow it.

577
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:58,545
I have never been more proud of you.

578
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:05,190
Thank you.

579
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,204
Mama.

580
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:44,892
Need some help with those?

581
00:50:47,038 --> 00:50:48,266
Minny.

582
00:50:48,406 --> 00:50:50,306
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

583
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:52,102
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

584
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:56,179
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

585
00:50:58,049 --> 00:50:59,744
You gonna put the stick down?

586
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:01,613
Uh-uh.

587
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:07,850
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

588
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,392
All of them.

589
00:51:12,163 --> 00:51:15,860
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

590
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,867
she started getting better.

591
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,802
So, you saved her life.

592
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:26,972
You knew I was here the whole time?

593
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:30,444
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

594
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:34,141
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

595
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,013
No.

596
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:42,023
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr Johnny.

597
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:45,026
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

598
00:51:53,004 --> 00:51:55,370
You just leave that.

599
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:57,372
Here you go.

600
00:51:58,343 --> 00:52:00,038
Let's head on up the house.

601
00:52:24,702 --> 00:52:25,828
What's this?

602
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:28,366
I cooked it all by myself.

603
00:52:28,506 --> 00:52:31,134
Yes, she did.
She was up all night.

604
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,837
I wanted to do something special.

605
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:38,207
I wanted to say thank you.

606
00:52:41,352 --> 00:52:42,376
So...

607
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:45,015
...I ain't losing my job?

608
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:50,688
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

609
00:52:50,828 --> 00:52:52,056
If you want it.

610
00:52:58,403 --> 00:53:00,530
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

611
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:12,245
- Please.
- Thank you.

612
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,188
Ooh.

613
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:19,789
You remember to check the thighs?

614
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:23,552
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

615
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:26,892
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

616
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,931
Looky here.

617
00:53:32,737 --> 00:53:35,763
<i>That table of food</i>
<i>gave Minny the strength she needed.</i>

618
00:53:36,908 --> 00:53:41,436
<i>She took her babies out from under Leroy</i>
<i>and never went back.</i>

619
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:48,611
What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

620
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:50,118
No, we ain't late.

621
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:52,781
Why ain't you singing?

622
00:53:52,924 --> 00:53:55,085
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

623
00:53:55,226 --> 00:53:56,454
Come on now, we late!

624
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:08,736
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

625
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:13,972
Come on down, Sister Clark!

626
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:16,073
Come on.

627
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:35,665
Come on.

628
00:54:38,436 --> 00:54:39,801
All right, all right.

629
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:46,604
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

630
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:51,644
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

631
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:55,145
Now...

632
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:58,882
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

633
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,020
so we all signed our own.

634
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:05,520
Thank you.

635
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:11,666
Come on, now. Come on.

636
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:53,143
Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

637
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,479
It's beautiful.

638
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:02,912
What's wrong?

639
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:11,594
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

640
00:56:12,196 --> 00:56:14,027
Congratulations!

641
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:17,760
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

642
00:56:17,902 --> 00:56:19,563
I can't just leave you two here

643
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:22,172
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

644
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:27,074
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

645
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:29,611
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

646
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,874
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

647
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:36,578
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

648
00:56:36,687 --> 00:56:38,120
Plus, your mama's getting better.

649
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:41,657
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

650
00:56:41,826 --> 00:56:43,760
You done burned every bridge there is.

651
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:46,386
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

652
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,760
Everybody know that.

653
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,336
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

654
00:56:54,305 --> 00:56:58,002
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

655
00:57:00,177 --> 00:57:01,974
And she's gonna take care of me.

656
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:16,215
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

657
00:57:29,774 --> 00:57:32,174
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

658
00:57:38,282 --> 00:57:39,340
Good morning.

659
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:44,987
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

660
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:47,249
It not polished good?

661
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:50,657
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

662
00:57:50,795 --> 00:57:55,494
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

663
00:57:56,801 --> 00:58:00,066
A fork and two spoons.

664
00:58:00,237 --> 00:58:03,798
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

665
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:07,001
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

666
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:11,611
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

667
00:58:12,683 --> 00:58:14,810
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

668
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:16,715
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

669
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:19,553
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

670
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:23,387
I ain't got no silver.

671
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:25,654
She says she doesn't have them.

672
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:30,396
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are fired, Aibileen.

673
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:33,697
And I'll be calling the police.

674
00:58:35,606 --> 00:58:38,404
Aibee, my throat hurts.

675
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:43,308
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

676
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,506
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

677
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:52,754
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

678
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,357
I'm OK.

679
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:06,761
I didn't steal no silver.

680
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:10,670
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

681
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:12,709
but I can send you for being a thief.

682
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:15,277
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

683
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,108
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

684
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,947
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

685
00:59:23,087 --> 00:59:25,783
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

686
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:29,622
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

687
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:36,629
Call the police, Elizabeth.

688
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:40,032
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

689
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:41,161
Aibileen, stop!

690
00:59:41,338 --> 00:59:43,397
You a godless woman.

691
00:59:45,409 --> 00:59:47,502
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

692
00:59:50,147 --> 00:59:51,512
Ain't you tired?

693
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:07,397
Aibileen, you have to go now.

694
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:24,447
Don't go, Aibee.

695
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:27,982
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

696
01:00:28,486 --> 01:00:32,547
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

697
01:00:32,723 --> 01:00:35,487
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

698
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:37,617
No, that's not the reason.

699
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:41,322
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

700
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:43,763
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

701
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:45,893
Baby. Baby.

702
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:49,431
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

703
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,701
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

704
01:00:51,842 --> 01:00:57,303
You is kind. You is smart.

705
01:00:57,448 --> 01:00:59,143
You is important.

706
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:01,183
That's right, Baby Girl.

707
01:01:06,357 --> 01:01:07,847
Don't go, Aibee.

708
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:09,220
I gots to, baby.

709
01:01:11,862 --> 01:01:13,830
You give my sweet girl a chance.

710
01:01:30,114 --> 01:01:32,378
<i>Mae Mobley was my last baby.</i>

711
01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:37,719
<i>In just ten minutes,</i>
<i>the only life I knew was done.</i>

712
01:01:37,855 --> 01:01:40,585
Aibee!

713
01:01:43,928 --> 01:01:46,055
<i>God says we need to love our enemies.</i>

714
01:01:46,197 --> 01:01:47,562
No!

715
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:50,831
<i>It hard to do.</i>

716
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:59,202
<i>But it can start by telling the truth.</i>

717
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:07,943
<i>No one had ever asked me</i>
<i>what it felt like to be me.</i>

718
01:02:11,288 --> 01:02:13,381
<i>Once I told the truth about that...</i>

719
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,054
<i>...I felt free.</i>

720
01:02:25,436 --> 01:02:28,564
<i>And I got to thinking</i>
<i>about all the people I know.</i>

721
01:02:30,574 --> 01:02:32,599
<i>And the things I seen and done.</i>

722
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:42,684
<i>My boy, Treelore, always said we going</i>
<i>to have a writer in the family one day.</i>

723
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,151
<i>I guess it's gonna be me.</i>
