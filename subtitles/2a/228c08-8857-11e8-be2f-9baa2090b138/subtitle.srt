1
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,230
...to stop me in my Super Cop Clobberer.

2
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,910
Anybody who'd try to stop him
has to be totally stupid.

3
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,913
Stupid? Hey, Muttley, come back.

4
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,880
And make it snappy.

5
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:19,103
...snow that fell over the whole weekend,
and the blizzard is called one of the worst.

6
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,371
As you can see,
one of the worst in that city's history.

7
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,812
They've not been too lucky in the Midwest.
As soon as they dig out...

8
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:29,477
...another storm hits and there is one
out west that might be in very soon.

9
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:32,621
We've been very lucky though.
Every time it snows...

10
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:36,590
- Your friend's out here.
- Friends, ha! I have no friends.

11
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:38,956
Oh, Big Bird, we came to see you drive.

12
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,863
It's a little too late now, isn't it?

13
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,691
Good morning, Louise.

14
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,535
He's dead, Chance.

15
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,697
The old man's dead.

16
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:52,665
I see.

17
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,566
He wasn't breathing...

18
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,809
...and he's cold as a fish.

19
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,712
I touched him, just to see.

20
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,278
Chance?

21
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,147
Then I...

22
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,620
...covered him up.
Pulled a sheet over his head.

23
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,063
Oh, Lord!

24
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,600
What a morning.

25
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,773
Yes, Louise.
It looks like it's going to snow.

26
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,871
Have you seen the garden?

27
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,439
- It feels just like it's going to snow...
- Wait a minute, boy.

28
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,479
Is that all you've got to say?

29
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:41,616
That old man is lying up there
dead as hell...

30
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,919
...and it just don't make
any difference to you.

31
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,867
Oh, Lord, Chance...

32
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,769
I'm sorry for yelling like I did.

33
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:08,978
No, sir. I just don't know
what I was expecting.

34
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:15,716
I suppose I better gather you up
some breakfast.

35
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:20,428
Yes, please. I'm very hungry, Louise.

36
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,397
I'll make you some eggs.

37
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:45,676
There are lots of animals in the barnyard.
Want to go with the rooster and see them?

38
00:07:57,326 --> 00:08:00,591
'Sealy Posturepedic morning'

39
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:04,292
Feeling so good it shows.
Because Posturepedic is designed...

40
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:08,326
...in cooperation with leading orthopedic
surgeons for no morning backache...

41
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,634
...from sleeping on a too-soft mattress.

42
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,674
'lt's a Sealy Posturepedic morning'

43
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,913
- Keep them in the shade, Alvin.
- Yes ma 'am, Miss Kettlepunch.

44
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,814
I won't have the horses
standing in the sun. You hear me?

45
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,510
- Stay in your seat.
- Yes, ma 'am.

46
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,256
- Keep your hat and gloves on.
- Yes, ma 'am.

47
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,554
- And your coat buttoned.
- Yes, ma 'am.

48
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:32,985
Yes, ma 'am.

49
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,530
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,477
Ain't you the gentleman this morning.

51
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,411
I'm going to go now, Chance.

52
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,049
Yes.

53
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,717
You're going to need somebody.

54
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,952
You ought to find yourself a lady, Chance.

55
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,562
Guess it ought to be an old lady.

56
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,395
You ain't going to do
a young one any good.

57
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,075
Not with that little thing of yours.

58
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,710
You're always going to be a little boy,
ain't you?

59
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,815
Goodbye, Chance.

60
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,030
Goodbye, Louise.

61
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,766
- Will you give me a tour?
- Gladly.

62
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,601
The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom.
That'll be stop number one.

63
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,675
He and my father used to ride together,
back in the '30s.

64
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,184
Before I was born.

65
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,416
You hear that?

66
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,415
It's a new car.

67
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,565
This morning, the President met
in the Oval Office with...

68
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:30,264
...foreign dignitaries and cultural exchange
students from the Republic of China.

69
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,369
He presented them with a statue
of the American eagle...

70
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,468
...our symbol of peace and freedom
throughout the world.

71
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,907
The President warmly encouraged
future trade relations...

72
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,745
Why, hello.

73
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,612
We thought we heard something.

74
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,451
I'm Thomas Franklin.

75
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,587
Hello, Thomas. I'm Chance, the gardener.

76
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:53,885
- The gardener?
- Yes.

77
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,695
Yes, of course.

78
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,057
Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.

79
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,366
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.

80
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:03,830
Yes.

81
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,173
Yes.

82
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,133
We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts.

83
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,972
The law firm handling the estate.

84
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,612
Yes, Thomas, I understand.

85
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,420
Are you waiting for someone?
An appointment?

86
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,920
Yes. Louise will bring me my lunch.

87
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:33,730
All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,
may I ask just what you're doing here?

88
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,798
I live here.

89
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,873
There is no mention of a gardener.

90
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,245
In fact, according to our inventories, there
hasn't been a man employed here since 1933.

91
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,315
Except for a Mr. Joe Saracini...

92
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,081
...a brick mason,
who did some repairs to a wall.

93
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:55,988
He was here for two and a half days
in 1952.

94
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,955
Yes. I remember Joe.

95
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,391
He was very fat, had short hair...

96
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,660
...and showed me pictures
from a funny little book.

97
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,304
- Some pictures?
- Yes.

98
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,574
Of men and women.

99
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:24,479
Just how long have you been living here,
Mr. Chance?

100
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,015
Ever since I can remember.

101
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,653
Ever since I was a child
I've worked in this garden.

102
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,787
Then you really are a gardener?

103
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,423
My roses.

104
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:46,237
We will need some proof
of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.

105
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:51,271
You have me, I'm here.

106
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,074
That's where Joe fixed the wall.

107
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,312
Are you related to the deceased
Mr. Chance?

108
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,593
I don't think so.

109
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:18,972
That's a nice car.
Do you drive it, Mr. Chance?

110
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,336
I've never been in an automobile.

111
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,846
You've never been in a car?

112
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,245
No.

113
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,012
I've never been allowed
outside of the house.

114
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:34,378
Ooh, you can call me Ray,
or you can call me Jay...

115
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,425
I used to listen to the radio.

116
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,794
Then the old man started giving me
television sets.

117
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:44,127
This one has a remote control.

118
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,992
Maybe there's another
gum machine someplace.

119
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,168
You see? This is my bed.

120
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,565
This is my bathroom.

121
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,845
This is my sink.

122
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,672
This is my toilet.

123
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,276
This is my bathtub.

124
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:11,092
Here is my closet.

125
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,656
You have a very handsome wardrobe,
Mr. Chance.

126
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:16,954
Yes.

127
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:21,134
I'm allowed to go to the attic
and wear any of the old man's clothes.

128
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,794
- They fit me very well, don't they?
- Yes.

129
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,737
It's amazing how those clothes
have come back into style.

130
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,606
Why is the bed like this?

131
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:33,540
I like to sleep with my head
facing the north.

132
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,406
I sleep better that way.

133
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:39,180
Yes, I've heard about that. Could you
show us something with your address?

134
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,552
But this is facing west.

135
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,127
- What is facing west?
- The bed.

136
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:53,566
I see.

137
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,835
Mr. Chance, I'd like to know
what sort of claim...

138
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,105
...you're planning to make
against the deceased's estate.

139
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,719
The garden is a healthy one, Thomas.

140
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:16,117
I have no claim.

141
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,258
I see. Would you be willing
to sign a paper to that effect?

142
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,492
I don't know how to sign, Thomas.

143
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:31,667
Very well, Mr. Chance,
I have no alternative but to inform you...

144
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,901
...that this house is now closed.

145
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:38,273
lf, indeed, you have resided here,
you have no legal right to remain.

146
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:42,909
You'll have to move out by,
let's say, noon tomorrow.

147
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,087
I don't understand 'move out'.

148
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,386
Call me, or have your attorney call me...

149
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,087
...if you change your mind about signing.

150
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,925
Come on, Sally, let's grab a bite.

151
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,797
What about medical records?

152
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,032
Could you give us the name
of your doctor or your dentist?

153
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,904
I have no doctor or dentist.

154
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,384
I see.

155
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:22,152
- Well, good day, Mr. Chance.
- Good day, Sally. Good day, Thomas.

156
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:24,900
Mr. Chance

157
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,803
Everyday in the week you're doing new things,
and everyday you read Washington Post to help.

158
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,997
Pardon me for intruding at a time like this,
but were you very close to Max?

159
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,498
Are you kidding? We were inseparable.

160
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:14,071
Jogger's knee and swimmer's...

161
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:18,744
We have tennis elbow, jogger's knee,
and simmer's...

162
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,971
And swimmer's what?

163
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,475
I'm sorry. All I can think of is trunks.

164
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:36,092
Jim's back was broken in three places,
his skull was fractured...

165
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,826
...and his chest crushed. He's a paraplegic.

166
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,734
But after a year in the hospital,
he went back to school...

167
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,466
...got his master's degree
and now looks to the future.

168
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,539
I get depressed, you know,
this kind of thing...

169
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,976
...and it's momentarily, momentary,
and it usually hits at night.

170
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,658
Excuse me.

171
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,426
I'm very hungry.
Could you give me some lunch?

172
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:37,597
It's an all-girl show, sir.
It's an all-girl show.

173
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,936
Come right in. It's an all-girl show.

174
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:03,553
Excuse me.

175
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,860
Could you please tell me
where I could find a garden to work in?

176
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,835
A garden? What are you growing, man?

177
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,067
There is much to be done
during the winter.

178
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,342
I should start the seeds for the spring
and work the soil.

179
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,343
Bullshit!

180
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,407
Who sent you here, boy?

181
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:23,047
Did that chicken-shit asshole Raphael
send you, boy?

182
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,308
No.

183
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,389
Mr. Thomas Franklin told me
I must leave the old man's house.

184
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,359
- He's dead, you know.
- Dead, my ass.

185
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:36,462
You tell that asshole,
if he got something to tell me...

186
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,829
...to get his ass down here himself.

187
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,867
Got that, boy?

188
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:48,974
TV changer, man.

189
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,581
What you got?

190
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,376
Now move, honky,
before I cut your white ass.

191
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,150
If I see Raphael,
I will give him your message.

192
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:02,813
- Do that.
- Good day.

193
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,944
Excuse me. That tree is very sick.
It needs care.

194
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:03,417
Yes, sir. I'll report it right away.

195
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:04,746
Thank you.

196
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,888
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

197
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,418
W-4.

198
00:26:56,765 --> 00:27:00,166
- I'm very sorry, sir, I didn't see you.
- Can't move. My leg.

199
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,897
This is terrible, sir.
I hope you're not badly injured.

200
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:06,536
No. I'm not badly injured.
But my leg is very sore.

201
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,236
- It's not broken, is it? Can you walk?
- I hope not.

202
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,906
- Perhaps I should call an ambulance.
-Well, let's have a look. Do you mind?

203
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,449
- No. I'd like to look.
- What's happened?

204
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,080
Oh, my goodness, your leg!

205
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:19,751
Yes.

206
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:23,021
It should be examined.
We could take you to a hospital.

207
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,356
- There's no need for the hospital.
- A doctor should look at that.

208
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,861
I insist. We'll take him to a hospital.

209
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:31,463
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Rand.
I never saw the man.

210
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,195
- It's really no one's fault, David.
- Thank you, ma'am.

211
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,236
I've never ridden in an automobile before.

212
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,279
I assure you, sir,
David is a very careful driver.

213
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,510
- I understand.
- Very good.

214
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,776
These situations can be so trying.

215
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:20,644
Everyone seems to make such a to-do
out of a simple little accident.

216
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,411
Is your leg feeling any better?

217
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:29,389
No, it isn't.

218
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,059
I see.

219
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:38,494
This is just like television,
only you can see much further.

220
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:43,902
Why don't you come to our house
and we could take care of you there?

221
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,774
Your house?

222
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,743
My husband has been very ill. The doctor
and the nurses are staying with us.

223
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
Hospitals can be so impersonal.

224
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,646
- I agree.
- Fine.

225
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,884
That'll save a lot of unnecessary fuss and
it'll be that much more pleasant for you.

226
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,424
We'll go right on home.

227
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,395
And Jeffrey, would you please call
and tell them we're on our way.

228
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,657
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,831
Would you care for a drink?

230
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,668
Oh, yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

231
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:32,611
Thank you. May I watch television, please?

232
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:36,353
Why, yes. Certainly.

233
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,491
And now, the piece of resistance...

234
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,996
May I ask your name?

235
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,140
Chance.

236
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,739
Chance?

237
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,652
Chance, the gardener.

238
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:14,127
Chauncey Gardiner?
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

239
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,959
Are you related to Basil
and Perdita Gardiner?

240
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:22,697
No, I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.

241
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,364
Well, they are such a wonderful couple.

242
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:28,836
My husband and I
are very good friends of theirs...

243
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:31,070
...and we often visit their island.

244
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,772
Thank you.

245
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,765
Did you lose something?

246
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:56,660
Yes, I lost my remote control.

247
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,000
I use it to change the channels.

248
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,083
I'm sorry.

249
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,616
You wouldn't think of driving
without your rear-view mirror...

250
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,820
...and yet some people still drive
without a fuzz buster.

251
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:52,985
When they unwrapped the chopsticks
to be used by the Chinese guests...

252
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,292
...the packages were clearly stamped
'Made in Taiwan. '

253
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:01,426
I know it's important to stay informed
of all the latest events, but...

254
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:05,569
...I find there's so much to assimilate
it can become quite muddling at times.

255
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,633
Until they placed the chopsticks around
the table. If the Chinese were upset...

256
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,043
'I even put that basketball
underneath my pillow

257
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,413
'Maybe that's why I can't sleep at night

258
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,054
'I need help, ladies and gentlemen

259
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,191
'I need someone to stand beside me

260
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:29,328
'I need someone to set a pit for me
at the free-throw diamond line

261
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,196
'Someone I can pass to

262
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,569
'Someone to hit the open line
on the given goal

263
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,904
'Some cheerleaders to help me out

264
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,877
'I want everybody in the whole stadium
to stand up and sing'

265
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:51,567
Ma'am.

266
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,241
Wilson, will you take Mr. Gardiner
to the third-floor guest suite?

267
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,283
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:59,182
I'll see you after Dr. Allenby
has a look at your leg.

269
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,352
Thank you. Yes... Yes.

270
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,878
I've never been in one of these before.

271
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,912
It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill.

272
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:33,843
I see.

273
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,991
Does it have a television?

274
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,591
No. But Mr. Rand does have one
with an electric motor.

275
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,767
That way he can get around by himself.

276
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,100
How long do we stay in here?

277
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:55,800
How long?

278
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:59,737
I don't know.
We'll see what the doctor says.

279
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:19,797
I've seen it done before,
in a film on television.

280
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,300
This won't hurt at all.

281
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,432
It did hurt.

282
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,800
Now, there's no apparent damage to the bone.

283
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,477
But just to be sure,
I have Wilson wheel you down for an x-ray.

284
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:31,945
X-ray?

285
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,981
By the way, Mr. Gardiner,
I'd like to ask you something straight out.

286
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,846
- Straight out?
- Yes, sir.

287
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:43,815
Are you planning on making
any sort of claim against the Rand's?

288
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,449
Claim.

289
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,094
That's what Thomas asked me.

290
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,964
Thomas? Oh, you can pull
your trousers up now if you like.

291
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,068
Who... Who's Thomas?

292
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,236
Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.

293
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,101
- An attorney?
- Yes.

294
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,671
Then you wish to handle this matter
through your attorneys?

295
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,580
There's no need for a claim.

296
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,646
I don't even know what they look like.

297
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,123
Well, then.

298
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,758
You caught me off guard there,
I must admit.

299
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:29,328
Thank you.

300
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:34,399
Now, the only thing we have
to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...

301
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:37,444
...which isn't serious,
but could cause trouble later on.

302
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,536
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

303
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,178
...would it be possible for you
to stay here for a day or two...

304
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,718
...so we could keep an eye on it?

305
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,753
Oh, yes, I could stay here.

306
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,685
- Does this house have a garden?
- Oh, why, yes. Many.

307
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,091
Good.

308
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,685
- Keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner.
- Yes.

309
00:36:56,497 --> 00:37:00,558
Mr. Wilson, please wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.

310
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,193
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

311
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:10,008
Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?

312
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,237
Ever wonder why?

313
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:25,548
Oh, I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?

314
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,889
No headaches?

315
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:30,264
No, it's been a fairly good day.

316
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:35,332
- Better than yours, so I've been told.
- Oh, you heard about it?

317
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,962
I may be a shut-in, but...

318
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:40,699
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

319
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:44,040
It was nothing, nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.

320
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:47,413
And Mr. Gardiner is a very reasonable man.

321
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:49,875
Reasonable.

322
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:53,519
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.

323
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,850
Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?

324
00:37:56,924 --> 00:38:00,360
Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.

325
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:02,424
Gardiner.

326
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,827
You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?

327
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:11,904
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.

328
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,564
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,774
I'll have them set another place.

330
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:41,100
My God, Eve, you'll freeze.

331
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,369
No. I just...

332
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:47,239
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

333
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:50,333
How's Mr. Gardiner?

334
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,138
Doesn't seem to be too serious.

335
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,614
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him.

336
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,753
So I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.

337
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:01,810
Here?

338
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:05,721
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?

339
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:10,789
No, not necessary, but helpful.

340
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,526
Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.

341
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,535
He is different, isn't he?

342
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,504
You know, he's very...

343
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:25,638
...intense.

344
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:27,705
Perhaps.

345
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,682
Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.

346
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,661
That's a very small room.

347
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:50,359
Yes, sir, I guess that's true.
Smallest room in the house.

348
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,770
Yes, I... I guess that's true.

349
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Mr. Gardiner

350
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:17,392
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital.

351
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:21,801
- Thank you.
- Can I help you to the table, Mr. Gardiner?

352
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:22,995
Thank you.

353
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,170
I feel very good in here.

354
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:30,442
That's the oxygen.

355
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,975
When I first got sick...

356
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:37,508
...I had this entire room glassed in...

357
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,652
...so they could pump in
some extra oxygen.

358
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,353
Keeps my spirits up.

359
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,124
You must be very ill.

360
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:53,000
Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner.
Aplastic anemia.

361
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,131
The bone marrow doesn't supply
enough red blood cells.

362
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:01,070
Not a damn thing they can do about it.

363
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:05,005
Ooh, they can keep me comfortable.

364
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,675
Prolong my life with steroid therapy...

365
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,578
...and these transfusions.

366
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,888
But what makes my blood boil...

367
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,859
...that is, what there is of it...

368
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:24,894
...is that this is usually...

369
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,626
...a young person's disease.

370
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,400
Here I am getting along in years...

371
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:35,533
...and I'm about to die
of a young person's disease.

372
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:43,612
I've never seen anything like this
on television.

373
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,810
Please, lie still, Mr. Gardiner.

374
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:51,389
You'll join us for dinner,
of course Mr. Gardiner.

375
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,753
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,293
I'm very hungry.

377
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,062
Yes, and so am l, my boy.

378
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,294
So am I.

379
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,934
Do you know Raphael?

380
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,476
No, sir. I don't believe I do.

381
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,243
Because I have a message for him.

382
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:19,543
Yes, sir?

383
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:23,211
A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.

384
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,593
Well... I still don't believe I know the man,
Mr. Gardiner. Now, please...

385
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:32,593
...lie still.

386
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,452
Is there anyone we could notify for you?

387
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:56,545
No.

388
00:42:57,424 --> 00:43:00,621
The old man died and Louise left.

389
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:05,397
Oh!
I'm... I'm very sorry.

390
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,000
Well...

391
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:13,434
Well, I do hope your injury won't prevent you
from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner.

392
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,005
Do you need a secretary?

393
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:20,109
No, thank you.

394
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,081
My house was shut down.

395
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:29,021
You mean...
You mean your business was shut down?

396
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,922
Yes.

397
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:34,317
Shut down and closed by the attorneys.

398
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:39,599
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I mean.

399
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:45,061
The businessman today is at the mercy
of kid-lawyers from the SEZ.

400
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,065
It's happening to everyone, I'm afraid.

401
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:51,510
The way things are going, they'll probably
legislate the medical profession...

402
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,512
...as we know it, right out of existence.

403
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,683
Yes. Right out of existence.

404
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:03,021
Yeah, it's a damn shame.

405
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,225
What are your plans now, Mr. Gardiner?

406
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:10,260
Or may I call you Chauncey?

407
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,991
Chauncey's fine.

408
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,471
So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?

409
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:27,866
Well... I...

410
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,350
I would like to work in your garden.

411
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:40,093
Ben, I know exactly what he means.
Isn't it wonderful...

412
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,690
...to be with the trees
and the flowers like that?

413
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:47,458
I never had much feel for it, myself.

414
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,227
I'm a very good gardener.

415
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:55,734
It's such a... a pleasant way
to forget one's troubles.

416
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:04,009
Now, isn't that what any businessman is?
A gardener.

417
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:06,152
He...

418
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,519
...works on...

419
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:10,822
...flinty soil...

420
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,556
...to make it productive...

421
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,189
...with the labor of his own hands.

422
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,126
He waters it...

423
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,093
...with the sweat of his own brow.

424
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:25,235
He makes a thing of value for his family...

425
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,169
...and for the community.

426
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:32,873
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...

427
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,581
...is a laborer in the vineyards.

428
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,813
I know exactly what you mean, Ben.

429
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:46,154
The garden that I left was such a place.

430
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,325
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...

431
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:55,964
...is the room upstairs.

432
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,430
Oh, come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.

433
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,372
You've got your health.

434
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:06,804
For God's sake, man, you can't let those
bastards get you down. You got to fight.

435
00:46:08,982 --> 00:46:12,543
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.

436
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,984
That's where I'm going, too damn soon.

437
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,892
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

438
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:34,772
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.

439
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,214
You know, Chauncey...

440
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:54,254
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...

441
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:57,120
...in your situation.

442
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:00,790
I've...

443
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:05,127
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.

444
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,306
They've been harassed long enough by...

445
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:13,103
...inflation, increased taxation...

446
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,671
...all sorts of indecencies.

447
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:20,717
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...

448
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:22,516
...of our basic freedoms...

449
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:26,960
...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.

450
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,431
I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.

451
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,332
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?

452
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:43,840
No, Ben.

453
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:48,481
Reluctant to speak.

454
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,115
Well... I can understand that.

455
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:58,323
After a man's lost everything...

456
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,283
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.

457
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:06,960
But, you work on the idea.

458
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:09,795
Water it.

459
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:11,832
Fertilize it.

460
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,033
I will, Ben. Yes.

461
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:20,446
I'm sure you'll sprout some thoughts
in a few days.

462
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:24,149
I will, Ben. Yes.

463
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:40,759
Sorry, sir.

464
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:45,905
I thought you were going to come out with
another jest about the elevator.

465
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:47,465
Excuse me.

466
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:58,008
Elevator.

467
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,085
Yes, sir.
Elevator.

468
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:06,427
Chauncey!

469
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,859
I just wanted you to know
how delighted I am...

470
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,559
...that you're staying with us
and how dreadful I feel about your leg.

471
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:14,759
Thank you, Eve.

472
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:20,503
You lifted Ben's spirits tonight
to such an extent, do you know that?

473
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,071
He liked you so much, Chauncey.
He really did.

474
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:29,546
Ben is very ill, Eve. I've seen that before.

475
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:31,808
I know.

476
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:34,686
He reminds me of the old man.

477
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,212
Oh, does he?

478
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,126
Eve, are you going to leave and close
this house when Ben dies?

479
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:51,168
Why, I... I... I don't think so.

480
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:55,099
Goodnight, Eve.

481
00:49:57,944 --> 00:49:59,241
Goodnight, Chauncey.

482
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,541
- 'Morning, Mr. Perkins.
- 'Morning, Mr. Riff.

483
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:30,667
- Nice to see you.
- Thank You.

484
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:34,510
We have an additional guest with us today,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

485
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:38,547
I see. Shall we set up the communications
in the usual place?

486
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,779
- Of course.
- Okay, let's go to work.

487
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:11,112
Would you like a car, sir?

488
00:51:13,086 --> 00:51:14,815
Yes, I would like a car.

489
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,045
Yes, sir.

490
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:17,515
Thank you.

491
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,422
Send up Number 7, please.

492
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,431
Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?

493
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:30,229
It's fine today, Robert.

494
00:51:30,303 --> 00:51:33,238
Oh, shame on you, Chauncey.
You should let me be the judge of that.

495
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,430
Please, sit in the chair.

496
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,611
I swear Chauncey, between you and Benjamin,
I've got my hands full.

497
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:45,313
Say, that is coming along.
The swelling's gone down considerably.

498
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:46,818
Your limousine, sir.

499
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,918
Fine. Thank you.

500
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,524
Are you going somewhere?

501
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:02,898
No.

502
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:12,502
Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.

503
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:16,377
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.

504
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:20,549
I know about
the President coming, Robert.

505
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,517
- You do, do you?
- Yes.

506
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:26,358
Ben would like me to meet the President.

507
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,590
- He would, would he?
- Yes.

508
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,361
How will I know
when it's 10:00, Robert?

509
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:40,890
Well...

510
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,636
...it's 9:10, now.

511
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:50,213
And if you don't see a clock...

512
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,918
...well, I'm sure
someone will have the time.

513
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,921
I understand.

514
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,249
I'm going to walk.

515
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:05,195
Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.

516
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,630
- You're meeting the President, aren't you?
- Yes.

517
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,927
I've watched him on television.

518
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:41,129
Oh, it's very precise, sir.

519
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:43,128
It's 10:00.

520
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:46,970
Thank you, Jim.

521
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,940
Mrs. Aubrey, the President is arriving.

522
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,944
Chauncey!

523
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:44,558
- Up and around this morning, are you?
- I like to walk, Ben.

524
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,666
Well, that's good news, my boy.

525
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:50,095
You look much better today, Ben.

526
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,204
It's all make-up.

527
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,075
I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.

528
00:54:57,644 --> 00:55:01,603
I didn't want the President to think I was
going to die while he was talking to me.

529
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:03,742
I see.

530
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:07,247
Yeah, nobody likes
a dying man, Chauncey.

531
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:10,446
Because nobody knows what death is.

532
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:15,087
You seem to be an exception, Chauncey.

533
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:20,494
That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.

534
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:24,301
You seem to be a truly peaceful man.

535
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,938
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

536
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:34,109
Nurse Teresa did a very good job there.

537
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:57,823
Mr. Rand, the President is arriving.

538
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:03,063
Just show the President into the library.
We'll be along in a few minutes.

539
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:08,638
An old habit that goes along with power:
Keep them waiting.

540
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,943
Not now, Arthur.

541
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:13,238
But, sir...

542
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:16,171
I'm going to meet the President...

543
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,980
...on my own two feet.

544
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,857
Chauncey!

545
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:25,385
Shall we go?

546
00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:27,423
That's a very good idea, Ben.

547
00:57:44,844 --> 00:57:49,008
When I was younger,
I had thoughts of public office.

548
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,780
But I found, Chauncey,
that...

549
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,919
...I was able to contribute more
as a private citizen.

550
00:57:57,123 --> 00:57:58,351
Of course my...

551
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:02,621
...wealth provided me
with considerable influence.

552
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,298
But I've tried, Chauncey,
believe me, I've tried...

553
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,364
...not to misuse that power.

554
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:15,436
It's extremely important Chauncey,
that we don't allow ourselves...

555
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:19,535
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...

556
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:22,675
...no matter how strong the temptation.

557
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:27,309
Oh, I've been labeled a kingmaker...

558
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,780
...but I've tried...

559
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:33,553
...to keep myself open
to the voice of the people.

560
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:37,359
And I've remained honest to myself.

561
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:39,858
That's the main thing.

562
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,561
- Good morning, Mr. Rand.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

563
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:04,319
Where the hell is he?

564
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:07,215
Mr. President.

565
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:09,786
Ben.

566
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,837
It's good to see you.
You look terrific.

567
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,212
Thank you, Mr. President.

568
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:34,344
Your visit has helped to raise my spirits.

569
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:37,519
Well, I've missed you, my friend.

570
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:41,254
Come, sit down.
Take a load off your feet.

571
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,054
Hello, Mr. President.

572
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,035
Hello.

573
00:59:50,405 --> 00:59:57,001
Mr. President, I want you to meet
my very dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

574
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:03,745
On television, Mr. President,
you look much smaller.

575
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:09,186
I must warn you that Chauncey's not a man
to bandy words.

576
01:00:10,423 --> 01:00:12,516
Oh? Really?

577
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:19,698
Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man who appreciates
discussing a frank discussion.

578
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:24,659
- Would you be seated?
- Yes, I will.

579
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,346
- Now Ben, I was wondering
if you had a chance...
- Yes?

580
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,350
- Did you happen to have a chance to go...
- Yes?

581
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:50,820
Ben, did you read my speech?

582
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:54,324
Overall, pretty good.

583
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:59,070
But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...

584
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:02,867
...to play around with temporary measures
at a time like this.

585
01:01:03,509 --> 01:01:05,033
Well, Ben, I mean...

586
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:07,006
I sympathize with you...

587
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,773
...and I know how difficult it is
to be straightforward.

588
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:13,952
But I'll tell you right now, Bobby...

589
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,098
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Riff. Secret Service.

590
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:35,372
Good. Of course.

591
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:40,444
What you're saying, Ben, is that...

592
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:45,176
...you don't think I should take the chance.
- Absolutely not.

593
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:57,419
Mr. Gardiner, do you agree with Ben, or do
you think we can stimulate growth through...

594
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:00,427
...temporary incentives?

595
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:14,945
As long as the roots are not severed...

596
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:17,312
...all is well.

597
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,779
And all will be well...

598
01:02:20,753 --> 01:02:22,118
...in the garden.

599
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,591
- In the garden?
- Yes.

600
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,363
In a garden, growth has its season.

601
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,302
First come spring and summer...

602
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:48,038
...but then we have...

603
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,880
...fall and winter.

604
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:55,283
And then we get spring and summer again.

605
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,823
- Spring and summer?
- Yes.

606
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:07,691
- And fall and winter?
- Yes.

607
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:19,671
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...

608
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:24,371
...is that we welcome the inevitable...

609
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,412
...seasons of nature...

610
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,014
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.

611
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,458
Yes.

612
01:03:33,092 --> 01:03:35,253
There will be growth in the spring.

613
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,102
Oh Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that is one of
the most refreshing and optimistic statements...

614
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:47,365
...I've heard in a very very long time.

615
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:52,634
I admire your good solid sense.

616
01:03:53,312 --> 01:03:55,872
It's precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill.

617
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:02,954
I must be going.

618
01:04:03,556 --> 01:04:06,525
- This visit has been most enlightening.
- Yes, it has.

619
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,890
And Ben, thank you
for your time and thought.

620
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:13,431
Oh, nonsense.

621
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:16,664
Thank you for taking time out
with a dying man.

622
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,703
No, I won't have any of that.

623
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:21,997
Why don't you listen to your friend,
Chauncey, here?

624
01:04:22,074 --> 01:04:24,406
This is a time to think of life.

625
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,611
That's right, Mr. President.

626
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,314
Now, you take care, Ben.

627
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,321
And you take care, too, Bobby.

628
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:41,784
Chauncey.

629
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:43,753
Bobby.

630
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:03,773
He's a decent fellow, isn't he?
The President.

631
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:07,608
Yes. I'm glad he came, Ben.

632
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:15,119
Kaufman, I'll need some information
on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.

633
01:05:15,194 --> 01:05:18,186
- Gardiner, yes, sir.
- And I'd like it sometime today.

634
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,896
No problem, Chief.

635
01:05:35,247 --> 01:05:36,441
You know, Chauncey...

636
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:41,249
...you don't play games with words...

637
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:44,115
...to protect yourself.

638
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:46,925
No, you're direct.

639
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:53,295
Do you remember what I was talking
to you about last night?

640
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,329
- No, Ben.
- Oh, sure you do.

641
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,606
My plan for a financial assistance
to businessmen.

642
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:10,508
I think you're just the man to take charge
of an institution like that.

643
01:06:14,286 --> 01:06:15,583
I understand, Ben.

644
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:25,656
Chauncey, I know you're not a man
to act on the spur of the moment...

645
01:06:26,832 --> 01:06:29,960
...so don't feel that you have to rush
into a decision.

646
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,066
Thank you, Ben.

647
01:06:37,476 --> 01:06:40,775
Now, Chauncey,
I'm afraid I must excuse myself.

648
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,742
I'm awfully tired.

649
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,293
I'm sorry you're so sick, Ben.

650
01:07:32,998 --> 01:07:35,933
We have 60,000
tulip bulbs up there, Chauncey.

651
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,463
It is so glorious when they bloom.

652
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:41,870
Of course, the roses are my favorites.

653
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,100
We have 20,000 rose bushes.

654
01:07:46,378 --> 01:07:49,472
And over here,
we plant something different every year.

655
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,050
I haven't quite decided
what we'll plant this year.

656
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,145
And that's the gardener's house.

657
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:05,226
And this is the greenhouse.

658
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:10,633
I like to watch the young plants grow.

659
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,663
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Yes.

660
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:18,137
Young plants do much better
if a person helps them.

661
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:26,811
You know, Chauncey...

662
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:31,855
...Ben told me that the President
was very taken with you this morning.

663
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:43,861
Chauncey, last night you mentioned
an old man that died.

664
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:47,933
You must've been very close to him.

665
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:49,201
I was. Yes.

666
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:51,936
I'm sorry.

667
01:08:56,148 --> 01:09:00,175
You mentioned also
that Louise had gone, also.

668
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,511
Were you very close to Louise?

669
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:05,957
Yes, I liked Louise very much.

670
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,026
She was his maid.

671
01:09:09,662 --> 01:09:12,523
- Oh! Oh, his maid.
- Yes.

672
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,792
Oh, I see. I see.

673
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,804
So stupid of me. I thought maybe
she was perhaps someone...

674
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:24,070
...you were romantically involved with
or maybe a sister.

675
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:25,675
No.

676
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:29,342
She used to bring me my meals.

677
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:31,377
She was very kind to me.

678
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:43,285
Chauncey Gardiner, Mr. Rand's close friend
and advisor, was at the meeting this morning.

679
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:49,557
I found Mr. Gardiner to have a feeling
for this country that we need more of.

680
01:09:51,537 --> 01:09:54,734
To quote Mr. Gardiner,
a most intuitive man:

681
01:09:56,308 --> 01:10:00,608
'As long as the roots of industry remain
firmly planted in the national soil...

682
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:04,747
'...the economic prospects
are undoubtedly sunny. '

683
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:10,911
- What is it?
- Doctor.

684
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:13,854
Decoral. Five milligrams.

685
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:15,989
- Now I know that many of you...
- Put your arms up.

686
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:18,557
Put your arms up. Ben!

687
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:21,427
I think you'd better leave, Eve.

688
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,262
- Will he be okay?
- He'll be fine.

689
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,098
Yeah, we got you, Ben.
We  got you.

690
01:10:27,172 --> 01:10:28,833
Come on, Chauncey.

691
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:32,701
But I have decided
there are no temporary stopgaps.

692
01:10:34,346 --> 01:10:37,645
So I'm going to rethink my position
and find another solution.

693
01:10:38,918 --> 01:10:40,886
You'll be very pleased to know that your...

694
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,113
...founder and Chairman of the Board...

695
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:46,385
...Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand,
agrees with me on this...

696
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:48,286
...for once.

697
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:56,901
Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable
chill and storms of autumn and winter.

698
01:10:57,069 --> 01:11:00,334
Instead, let us anticipate
the rapid growth of springtime.

699
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,401
Let us await the rewards of summer.

700
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,470
As in a garden of the earth,
let us learn to accept...

701
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:10,207
...and appreciate the times
when the trees are bare...

702
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,545
...as well as the times
when we pick the fruit.

703
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:22,591
Chauncey, I'm just so very grateful
that you're here with us.

704
01:11:23,996 --> 01:11:25,463
So am l, Eve.

705
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:29,631
It's been an exhausting day for Ben.

706
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,167
He's resting now,
and there's no cause for alarm.

707
01:11:33,306 --> 01:11:36,565
Oh, Mr. Gardiner,
I have a telephone call for you.

708
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,709
Telephone call?

709
01:11:41,313 --> 01:11:45,443
Yes. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor
of the Washington Post.

710
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,246
Would you care to take it, sir?

711
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:54,323
Yes.

712
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,627
In my office.

713
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,806
Go! Go Chauncey, I'll be just fine.

714
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,202
Yes, you'll be fine, Eve.

715
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:29,487
He's such a kind and sensitive man.

716
01:12:30,562 --> 01:12:31,824
Don't you think?

717
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,205
- He's not there.
- Not there?

718
01:12:52,518 --> 01:12:54,349
Mr. Courtney, are you there?

719
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:57,120
Oh yes, he's there.

720
01:13:03,228 --> 01:13:05,059
Where is he? There or here?

721
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:07,688
He's on both lines.

722
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:20,901
Are you there?

723
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,347
Yes, I'm here.

724
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,440
Hello, Mr. Gardiner.

725
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:29,645
I saw the President's speech
at the Financial Institute today.

726
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:31,279
Would you care to comment...

727
01:13:31,924 --> 01:13:35,382
...on the meeting between Mr. Rand
and the President and yourself?

728
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:39,761
Yes. It was very nice meeting...

729
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,257
...the President.

730
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:44,631
What we'd like to know are some facts.

731
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,465
Such as, what is the exact relationship
between yourself and the...

732
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:51,205
...First American Financial Corporation?

733
01:13:51,477 --> 01:13:53,775
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.

734
01:13:54,646 --> 01:13:59,208
Well, yes, sir. But Mr. Rand is ill,
so I'm taking the liberty of asking you.

735
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,553
What? Say that again.

736
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:11,124
I said that since Mr. Rand is ill,
I'm taking the liberty of asking you.

737
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:13,329
Yes, you are.

738
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,066
You should ask Mr. Rand that.

739
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,867
Of course.

740
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,697
Just one quick question, Mr. Gardiner...

741
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,214
Will you hold a minute, please?

742
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:42,754
Mr. Gardiner, I have the producer
of The Gary Burns Show on the line.

743
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:46,188
Oh yes, I have watched that show.

744
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:50,429
Of course. They would like you to appear
on the show tonight.

745
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:53,198
The Vice President was scheduled,
but he had to cancel.

746
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:56,337
They asked if you would be interested.

747
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,135
Yes. I've been on television.

748
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:00,243
Fine.

749
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:04,307
Hello, Mr. Hull? Mr. Gardiner has agreed
to do the show.

750
01:15:04,783 --> 01:15:06,478
He's been on television.

751
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:12,022
Yes. The show will be taped,
and then shown at 10:00...

752
01:15:12,858 --> 01:15:14,348
...but he's to be there...

753
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,596
What do you mean, he's got
no background? That's impossible.

754
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:33,774
I quoted the man on national television.
He's a very well-known man.

755
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:35,506
We're well aware of that, sir...

756
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:38,049
He's a close friend and advisor
of Benjamin Rand.

757
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:41,278
For Christ's sakes,
we've got volumes of data on Rand.

758
01:15:41,353 --> 01:15:43,617
I plan to contact Mr. Rand the minute...

759
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,213
I do not want Ben disturbed.

760
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:49,452
We have other ways of gathering
information than to trouble a dying man.

761
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:53,794
Use any agencies that are necessary to get
a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner.

762
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:58,165
Have it in my office, tomorrow at 7:00.

763
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,670
- I've got to take a leak.
- Right, Chief.

764
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:11,710
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, your position in the
financial community carries a lot of weight.

765
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:16,343
But what caught Gary's interest
was your down to earth philosophy.

766
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:18,213
I see.

767
01:16:20,892 --> 01:16:24,851
Do you realize more people
will be watching you tonight...

768
01:16:25,197 --> 01:16:28,928
...than all those that have seen
theatre plays in the last 40 years?

769
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,627
- Yes?
- Yes.

770
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:32,902
Why?

771
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,402
Hell, I don't know.

772
01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:39,235
Good.

773
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:41,542
- This way.
- Thank you.

774
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,349
Gardiner's laconic.
He plays his cards very close to the chest...

775
01:16:47,452 --> 01:16:50,512
...and the scuttlebutt is
he's a strong candidate for a seat...

776
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:52,887
...on the board of First American Financial.

777
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,222
Kinney, what have you come up with
on his background?

778
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:56,283
Nothing.

779
01:16:56,962 --> 01:16:58,327
Ah yeah,
yeah, skip the levity.

780
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:02,094
I know it's ridiculous, but there is no
information of any sort about Gardiner.

781
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:04,466
We have no material on him.

782
01:17:05,904 --> 01:17:07,064
Zilch.

783
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:13,478
Here. I want your shoulders to go
right on this pad.

784
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:17,338
Now, wait, you have to put your head
in the hole first.

785
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:19,213
Head in the hole.

786
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:23,152
That's right. Okay. Stretch your legs out,
push your body...

787
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:25,303
Thought you might need this
about now, Mr. Gardiner.

788
01:17:25,303 --> 01:17:27,385
It gets pretty hot underneath these lights.

789
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:29,359
Thank you. I'm very thirsty.

790
01:17:31,097 --> 01:17:35,360
Oh, now, if Gary wants to interrupt you,
or ask you a question...

791
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:39,762
...he'll lift his left forefinger
to his left eyebrow. All right?

792
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:43,970
- I understand.
- Good.

793
01:17:44,276 --> 01:17:46,039
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

794
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,713
- Nurse Teresa did Ben's make-up.
- Really?

795
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:58,949
- Did she do a good job?
- Yes, it looked just like this.

796
01:18:00,726 --> 01:18:02,717
- Looks like you're up, Mr. Gardiner.
- I am?

797
01:18:03,395 --> 01:18:06,387
- Gary's ready for you now.
- Yes.

798
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,430
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

799
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:11,764
This way.

800
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,800
Mr. Gardiner

801
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,636
Well, how very nice to have you
with us this evening, Mr. Gardiner.

802
01:18:52,711 --> 01:18:53,803
Hello, Gary.

803
01:18:54,946 --> 01:18:57,881
This is Miss Annie Lawson.
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

804
01:18:57,949 --> 01:18:59,849
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hello.

805
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:03,457
- Mr. Gardiner
- Oh yes. Yes.

806
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:05,000
Well...

807
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:09,188
I'd like very much to thank you
for joining us on such short notice...

808
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:11,762
...and filling in for the Vice President.

809
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:13,594
Yes... Yes.

810
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:19,268
It's always somewhat surprising
to find men like yourself...

811
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:22,033
...working so intimately
with the President, and yet...

812
01:19:22,474 --> 01:19:26,069
...somehow managing to remain
relatively unknown.

813
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:29,446
Yes, it is surprising.

814
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:31,283
Yes.

815
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,880
Yes, of course.

816
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:35,687
Well...

817
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:39,516
Your anonymity is certainly likely
to be a thing of the past from now on.

818
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,000
Oh!

819
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:42,591
Good.

820
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:44,330
Well...

821
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,455
I assume, since the President quoted you...

822
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:51,502
...that you're inclined to agree
with his view of the economy.

823
01:19:57,809 --> 01:19:58,969
Which view?

824
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:11,415
The President compared the economy
of this country to a garden and he stated...

825
01:20:11,523 --> 01:20:15,186
...that after a period of decline,
a time of growth would naturally follow.

826
01:20:17,596 --> 01:20:18,460
Yes.

827
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,130
It is possible...

828
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,034
...for everything...

829
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:25,936
...to grow strong.

830
01:20:27,105 --> 01:20:29,039
And there is plenty of room...

831
01:20:29,441 --> 01:20:32,433
...for new trees and new flowers...

832
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:34,338
...of all kinds.

833
01:20:40,552 --> 01:20:42,213
So, you're saying, Mr. Gardiner...

834
01:20:42,354 --> 01:20:45,687
...this is just another
season in the garden, so to speak.

835
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:47,884
Yes. Yes.

836
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,697
A garden needs a lot of care
and a lot of love.

837
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,365
And if you give your garden...

838
01:20:55,901 --> 01:20:58,335
...a lot of love, things grow.

839
01:20:59,037 --> 01:21:01,938
But first, some things must wither.

840
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:05,405
Some trees die...

841
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:08,776
- It's that gardener.
- Yeah. Chauncey Gardiner.

842
01:21:09,548 --> 01:21:11,539
No, he's a real gardener.

843
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:16,213
He does talk like one.
But I think he's brilliant.

844
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:26,196
That is very interesting indeed, Mr. Gardiner,
but what about the bad seasons?

845
01:21:27,232 --> 01:21:30,133
Doesn't a country need
to have someone in charge...

846
01:21:30,235 --> 01:21:32,726
...who can see it through
these periods of crisis?

847
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:37,537
A leader, capable of guiding us through
the bad seasons, as well as the good?

848
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,133
- Yes.
- The bastard means it.

849
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:41,734
Oh, yes.

850
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,748
We need a very good gardener.

851
01:21:46,017 --> 01:21:48,645
And I do agree with the President...

852
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,455
...that the garden needs a lot of care.

853
01:21:53,224 --> 01:21:54,851
It is a good garden.

854
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:57,286
Its trees are healthy...

855
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:12,342
I realize this might be an extremely difficult
question for you to answer, Mr. Gardiner, but...

856
01:22:13,144 --> 01:22:15,772
...do you feel that we have...

857
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:20,183
...in your words,
a very good gardener in office...

858
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:21,578
...at this time?

859
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:23,610
- Jesus!
- Oh yes!

860
01:22:25,991 --> 01:22:28,687
Yes, some plants...

861
01:22:29,427 --> 01:22:31,054
...do well in the sun...

862
01:22:31,896 --> 01:22:34,831
...and others grow better in the shade.

863
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:38,728
Sounds as if we need
a lot of gardening here.

864
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,569
We certainly do.

865
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:42,007
Yes.

866
01:22:42,307 --> 01:22:45,242
It's for sure a white man's world
in America.

867
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:52,478
I raised that boy
since he was the size of a piss ant...

868
01:22:53,918 --> 01:22:57,718
...and I'll say right now he never learned
to read and write.

869
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,482
No, sir.

870
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,121
He had no brains at all.

871
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:05,890
Stuffed with rice pudding
between the ears.

872
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:11,797
Short-changed by the Lord
and dumb as a jackass.

873
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,770
Look at him now.

874
01:23:17,008 --> 01:23:20,409
Yes, sir, all you got to be is white,
in America...

875
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,603
...to get whatever you want.

876
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:28,482
Gobbledygook!

877
01:23:29,154 --> 01:23:32,817
What sort of gardener would you be,
Mr. Gardiner?

878
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:38,523
- I am a very serious gardener.
- Oh, I'm sure you are, Mr. Gardiner.

879
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:40,190
- I'm sure you are.
- Remarkable.

880
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:47,301
You're fond of him, too, aren't you?

881
01:23:55,847 --> 01:23:57,041
That's good.

882
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,619
That's good.

883
01:24:08,393 --> 01:24:10,554
May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

884
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:14,056
Bravo, sir.
Outstanding! Outstanding!

885
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:25,765
Okay, Sally, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

886
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:28,167
Okay.

887
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:38,849
I won't be long. I've just got to talk to her
about this gardener.

888
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:40,784
Goodnight.

889
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:44,586
- Look, Johanna...
- I said, goodnight.

890
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,575
Chauncey...

891
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,342
Tomorrow night...

892
01:25:00,678 --> 01:25:02,805
...Senator Rowley's widow...

893
01:25:04,215 --> 01:25:08,379
...is holding a reception
for the Soviet ambassador.

894
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:14,416
It's pretty obvious that Robert here
is not going to allow me to attend.

895
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,220
So, you'd be doing me a great favor...

896
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:22,661
...if you would attend in my place,
and escort Eve.

897
01:25:25,003 --> 01:25:25,867
Yes, Ben.

898
01:25:27,272 --> 01:25:29,365
I would love to escort Eve.

899
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:35,471
You and Eve should create quite a stir.

900
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:41,275
I can already hear the gossip.

901
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:49,187
Oh Chauncey...
You have the gift of being natural.

902
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:52,496
That's a great talent, my boy.

903
01:25:53,032 --> 01:25:56,728
Oh, I hope the entire
country was listening.

904
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:58,428
The entire country.

905
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:08,706
Darling, what's wrong?

906
01:26:09,147 --> 01:26:10,136
I can't.

907
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:13,774
I just can't, right now.

908
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,258
I'm sorry, dearest. I just...

909
01:26:23,695 --> 01:26:24,923
I just can't.

910
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:38,167
We'll fix up one of Ben's for you.
Sophie insists on black tie.

911
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:39,977
I see.

912
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:48,280
- Chauncey?
- Yes?

913
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,614
I don't have very many friends.

914
01:26:55,493 --> 01:26:57,188
And Ben's friends are...

915
01:26:58,029 --> 01:27:00,588
...oh, quite a bit older than I am.

916
01:27:01,366 --> 01:27:02,594
Quite a bit.

917
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,415
Goodnight, Chauncey.

918
01:27:28,293 --> 01:27:29,385
Goodnight, Eve.

919
01:27:51,883 --> 01:27:56,183
He was very clever, keeping it at a third
grade level, that's what they understand.

920
01:27:56,254 --> 01:28:00,953
Yeah? Well, I don't understand
why he was in Jennings' house.

921
01:28:01,759 --> 01:28:04,887
What was up his sleeve
when he pulled that stunt with us?

922
01:28:04,963 --> 01:28:07,625
What was he doing? And why?

923
01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:11,702
Who knows? Maybe the government
had something to do with it.

924
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:15,432
You know, Sally...

925
01:28:16,407 --> 01:28:17,897
...he made a fool out of me.

926
01:28:18,843 --> 01:28:21,107
- And you know what that means, don't you?
- No.

927
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:25,081
Any political future I had
is right down the toilet.

928
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,418
Jesus, the thought of spending
the rest of my life as an attorney...

929
01:28:29,654 --> 01:28:30,678
Well...

930
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:34,018
...that is really a downer. And, Christ...

931
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:38,626
...Sally, I almost forgot. Johanna is starting
to think something's going on.

932
01:28:38,696 --> 01:28:41,062
Sid, be reasonable.
I have been everywhere.

933
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:43,760
- There is no place left to look.
- Try again.

934
01:28:44,502 --> 01:28:47,699
Sure, try again. Where?
There's nothing.

935
01:28:48,306 --> 01:28:50,399
It's like Gardiner never existed.

936
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:52,235
Try again.

937
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,309
Sid, it's useless.

938
01:28:54,812 --> 01:28:56,336
I said, try again.

939
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,745
Up yours, Sid.
You try again. I quit.

940
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:19,593
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

941
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,699
- Sir, we were unable to come up...
- It's not what I requested.

942
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,038
...before Mr. Gardiner appeared
at the Rand's.

943
01:29:25,209 --> 01:29:28,235
- This information is back a day and a half.
- Right, Chief.

944
01:29:28,379 --> 01:29:31,542
- I want the standard file, you know that.
- Right, Chief.

945
01:29:32,683 --> 01:29:34,241
Well, where is it?

946
01:29:35,486 --> 01:29:36,714
Right, Chief.

947
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:39,251
Kaufman, what the hell
are you talking about?

948
01:29:39,323 --> 01:29:43,555
The Bureau has some data, sir,
but it's... it's not pertinent.

949
01:29:44,495 --> 01:29:46,929
- Well, I'd like to hear that data.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:29:48,232 --> 01:29:49,426
His suits...

951
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:52,629
...were made by a New York tailor,
handmade...

952
01:29:52,737 --> 01:29:54,102
...in 1928.

953
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:59,335
The tailor went out of business
in 1933 and later...

954
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,002
...took his own life.

955
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,510
His underwear, all of the finest cloth...

956
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:09,615
...the factory was destroyed by fire in 1948.

957
01:30:10,221 --> 01:30:12,052
This man carries no identification.

958
01:30:12,757 --> 01:30:16,989
No driver's license, no wallet,
no credit cards.

959
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,863
Computers have analyzed his...

960
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:25,258
- Miss Davis.
...vocal characteristics.

961
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,836
I'd like my eggs poached
this morning, please.

962
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:31,397
But they cannot determine
his ethnic background.

963
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:34,744
'lt's a beautiful day in this neighborhood

964
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,144
'A beautiful day for a neighbor

965
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:40,446
'Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?'

966
01:30:41,552 --> 01:30:42,644
Come in.

967
01:30:50,844 --> 01:30:51,391
Chauncey?

968
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:55,631
Have you read the newspapers?

969
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,024
I don't read papers, Eve.

970
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:02,229
You're described as one of the architects
of the President's speech last night.

971
01:31:02,306 --> 01:31:06,538
And your comments on the television show
are side-by-side quoted at the President's.

972
01:31:07,538 --> 01:31:08,347
Oh!

973
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:12,345
- I like the President very much. He's a nice man.
- Isn't he?

974
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,383
You're very nice, too.

975
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,886
Hi, neighbor.
There's somebody at the door.

976
01:31:27,632 --> 01:31:30,829
Let's see who that special person is.
It's Mr. McFeeland.

977
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:45,245
You don't mind my being here like...

978
01:31:46,517 --> 01:31:47,506
...this?

979
01:31:48,019 --> 01:31:49,149
No, Eve.

980
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:51,613
I like you to be here.

981
01:31:54,859 --> 01:31:55,848
You do?

982
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,876
I'd like to sing about something
even more special.

983
01:32:17,415 --> 01:32:19,246
And that something is you.

984
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:23,185
'You are my friend, you are special

985
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:25,288
'You are my friend

986
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,649
'You're special to me

987
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,552
'You are the only one like you

988
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:37,123
'You are my friend, I like you

989
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,632
'In the daytime, in the nighttime

990
01:32:42,506 --> 01:32:46,499
'Any time that you feel is the right time

991
01:32:47,178 --> 01:32:50,375
'For a friendship with me, you see

992
01:32:51,115 --> 01:32:54,278
'F-R-l-E-N-D

993
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:57,453
'Special. You are my friend

994
01:32:58,756 --> 01:33:01,088
'You're special to me'

995
01:33:36,888 --> 01:33:39,394
Oh... oh...

996
01:33:40,394 --> 01:33:41,899
Oh, Chauncey!

997
01:33:42,099 --> 01:33:43,566
Thank you.

998
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:45,725
Oh, I'm so grateful, Chauncey.

999
01:33:48,973 --> 01:33:50,463
I would've just...

1000
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:54,544
...opened up
at the slightest touch.

1001
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,606
I would've just opened up. You know?
You know that.

1002
01:34:00,751 --> 01:34:02,548
But you're so strong...

1003
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,985
...that I can trust myself with you.

1004
01:34:08,025 --> 01:34:10,016
I'm glad you didn't open, Eve.

1005
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,786
Well, a long time ago,
people didn't have television...

1006
01:34:42,727 --> 01:34:45,890
...but they still liked to look
at interesting pictures.

1007
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,055
And they would put pictures like these...

1008
01:34:49,533 --> 01:34:51,558
- Thank you.
...in a special viewer.

1009
01:34:52,169 --> 01:34:56,833
They would look at them very carefully.
I'll show you another one.

1010
01:35:04,181 --> 01:35:05,910
They looked like cards.

1011
01:35:06,217 --> 01:35:08,685
Flash cards for schools or something.

1012
01:35:09,253 --> 01:35:13,349
But they're really photographs.
Take a careful look at them.

1013
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:17,151
The interesting thing about them,
is that they're two.

1014
01:35:17,595 --> 01:35:18,653
- What?
- Two.

1015
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,064
And they look very much alike.

1016
01:35:21,866 --> 01:35:23,561
Here, I'll show you another one.

1017
01:35:26,604 --> 01:35:28,435
Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.

1018
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:35,801
Is Mr. Franklin in?

1019
01:35:36,914 --> 01:35:39,382
Certainly. This is Dr. Robert Allenby.

1020
01:35:40,384 --> 01:35:43,615
Would you tell Mr. Franklin
that I'd like to speak to him?

1021
01:35:44,054 --> 01:35:46,614
It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

1022
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:11,714
Mr. Gardiner, what was your reaction to the
Post's editorial on the President's speech?

1023
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:14,607
I did not read that.

1024
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:19,619
- But, sir, you must've at least glanced at it.
- I did not glance at it.

1025
01:36:19,723 --> 01:36:23,215
Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times spoke
of your 'peculiar brand of optimism.'

1026
01:36:23,294 --> 01:36:27,162
- What was your reaction to that?
- I do not know what it means.

1027
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:31,630
Sorry to persist, sir,
but it would be of great interest to me...

1028
01:36:31,735 --> 01:36:34,101
...to know just what newspapers
you do read.

1029
01:36:35,473 --> 01:36:38,033
I do not read papers. I watch TV.

1030
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:39,626
Do you mean Mr. Gardiner,

1031
01:36:39,726 --> 01:36:44,510
that you find television's coverage of the
news superior to that of the newspapers'?

1032
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:46,877
I like to watch TV.

1033
01:36:47,451 --> 01:36:48,543
Thank you, Mr. Gardiner.

1034
01:36:49,487 --> 01:36:50,818
You're welcome.

1035
01:36:51,656 --> 01:36:56,256
Well, few men in public life have the courage
not to read the newspapers.

1036
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:00,754
None, that this reporter has met,
had the guts to admit it.

1037
01:37:04,635 --> 01:37:08,104
Chauncey, I've never seen anyone
handle the press the way you do.

1038
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,070
You're so cool and detached.

1039
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,000
Thank you, Eve.

1040
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,912
- Eve!
- Sophia!

1041
01:37:15,012 --> 01:37:17,412
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1042
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:20,541
I'm very well.
I'd like you to meet Chauncey Gardiner.

1043
01:37:21,151 --> 01:37:22,584
Hello, Vladimir.

1044
01:37:22,786 --> 01:37:25,016
And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

1045
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,324
- Natasha.
- Hello, Natasha.

1046
01:37:28,459 --> 01:37:30,950
- Very nice meeting you.
- And you.

1047
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:35,297
You must sit with us, my friends.
We have much to discuss.

1048
01:37:35,366 --> 01:37:36,000
I agree.

1049
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:40,267
Eve, let's let the men talk.
Would you two excuse us for a moment?

1050
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:44,731
Regretfully, we shall yield
the pleasure of your company to others.

1051
01:37:45,509 --> 01:37:47,272
I shall yield, too, Eve.

1052
01:37:48,245 --> 01:37:50,770
Yes.
Well, you have a nice chat.

1053
01:37:54,418 --> 01:37:59,219
Shouldn't we, Mr. Gardiner, get together
more often to exchange our thoughts?

1054
01:37:59,924 --> 01:38:02,518
It's strictly at the rumor stage now, Lyman.

1055
01:38:03,193 --> 01:38:07,391
- But there's something in the wind.
- Something rather big in the wind, I'd say.

1056
01:38:07,464 --> 01:38:11,525
So whose files were destroyed?
The CIA's or the FBI's?

1057
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:13,464
I don't know.

1058
01:38:14,171 --> 01:38:18,130
You may find, my friend,
that we are not so far from each other.

1059
01:38:18,409 --> 01:38:19,637
Not so far.

1060
01:38:21,745 --> 01:38:23,872
We are not so far from each other.

1061
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:26,439
Our chairs are almost touching.

1062
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,344
Bravo.

1063
01:38:31,455 --> 01:38:34,288
Our chairs are indeed almost touching.

1064
01:38:34,758 --> 01:38:37,591
And we want to remain seated on them,
correct?

1065
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,097
We don't want them snatched out
from under us, am I right?

1066
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,601
Because, if one goes, the other goes.

1067
01:38:45,135 --> 01:38:47,865
And then boom-boom and boom-boom.

1068
01:38:49,607 --> 01:38:53,566
What is it about his background
that they're trying to cover up?

1069
01:38:54,144 --> 01:38:58,444
A criminal record? A membership
in a subversive organization?

1070
01:38:58,582 --> 01:39:00,106
Homosexual, perhaps.

1071
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:03,380
He told me that he had been living there
since he was a child...

1072
01:39:03,487 --> 01:39:05,250
...working as a gardener.

1073
01:39:05,589 --> 01:39:09,047
He showed us a room in the garage,
where he said he stayed, and...

1074
01:39:09,159 --> 01:39:13,152
...well, I didn't really believe him,
of course, but why the act?

1075
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:19,626
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

1076
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:23,506
...do you, by any chance,
enjoy Krylov's fables?

1077
01:39:24,575 --> 01:39:27,510
Now, I ask you that
because there is something...

1078
01:39:28,579 --> 01:39:31,173
...there is something
Krylovian about you.

1079
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:35,847
Do you think so?

1080
01:39:37,421 --> 01:39:39,855
I believe that you know Krylov.

1081
01:39:51,935 --> 01:39:55,200
So, you know your Krylov in Russian,
do you?

1082
01:39:55,606 --> 01:39:58,837
Mr. Gardiner, I must confess,
I had suspected as much all along.

1083
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,512
Excuse me, but would you tell me
your name again?

1084
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,675
A dash of American humor.

1085
01:40:09,953 --> 01:40:11,420
Vladimir Skrapinov.

1086
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:14,451
That's a very nice name.

1087
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:18,592
And yours, Chauncey Gardiner.

1088
01:40:32,376 --> 01:40:37,211
He must have been involved
on some major financial level...

1089
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:38,578
...with the deceased.

1090
01:40:38,649 --> 01:40:40,412
- With who?
- Mr. Jennings.

1091
01:40:41,652 --> 01:40:46,055
But our firm has no record
of any such transactions.

1092
01:40:48,692 --> 01:40:52,719
Chauncey, you had the Russian ambassador
eating right out of your hand. You know that?

1093
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:56,061
I didn't know you spoke Russian.
It's incredible.

1094
01:40:56,567 --> 01:40:59,161
It is extremely useful
to speak Russian today.

1095
01:40:59,436 --> 01:41:03,133
- Are you proficient in other languages?
- He's so modest, Ambassador Gaufridi.

1096
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:06,100
He just never advertises
his accomplishments.

1097
01:41:12,883 --> 01:41:15,147
Maybe you should talk to somebody,
darling.

1098
01:41:15,219 --> 01:41:16,049
No.

1099
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:22,525
No, that wouldn't do any good.

1100
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:29,725
Hello, Ronald. How are you?

1101
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:33,096
- Just fine.
- Good. I am fine, too.

1102
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:36,306
- Good. Good...
- Yes. Good. We're fine.

1103
01:41:36,373 --> 01:41:37,499
Yeah, fine.

1104
01:41:38,942 --> 01:41:42,673
My editors and I have been wondering
if you'd consider writing a book for us.

1105
01:41:42,746 --> 01:41:46,238
Something about your political philosophy.
What do you say?

1106
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:49,952
- I can't write.
- Of course not. Who can, nowadays?

1107
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,353
I have trouble writing a postcard
to my children.

1108
01:41:53,457 --> 01:41:56,017
Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.

1109
01:41:56,126 --> 01:41:59,823
I'll provide you with the very best
ghost writer, proofreaders...

1110
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:02,664
- I can't read.
- Of course, you can't.

1111
01:42:03,167 --> 01:42:04,930
No one has the time.

1112
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:07,629
We glance at things, we watch television.

1113
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,240
I like to watch TV.

1114
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:15,171
I'm sure you do. No one reads.

1115
01:42:16,446 --> 01:42:19,040
He's very, very sexy.

1116
01:42:19,516 --> 01:42:22,144
Don't leave me alone with him for too long.

1117
01:42:24,054 --> 01:42:26,488
You say, he showed you his garden.

1118
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:29,457
Well, he said it was his.
He walked us through it.

1119
01:42:30,694 --> 01:42:31,683
I see.

1120
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,561
Mr. Franklin, I must ask you
and Ms. Hayes...

1121
01:42:36,633 --> 01:42:40,296
...to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner
strictly to yourselves.

1122
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,669
There's no telling
what he could have been involved in.

1123
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,641
It may be an extremely confidential matter.

1124
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,574
- Please, not a word.
- Of course, Doctor. I understand.

1125
01:42:50,681 --> 01:42:51,579
Fine.

1126
01:42:52,115 --> 01:42:55,209
- Thank you very much.
- Certainly. Glad to be of help.

1127
01:43:03,493 --> 01:43:05,358
Well, I heard he speaks eight languages.

1128
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:09,092
And on top of everything else,
holds a degree in medicine as well as law.

1129
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:10,531
Isn't that true, Eve?

1130
01:43:11,068 --> 01:43:14,196
I don't know, Senator,
but it wouldn't surprise me.

1131
01:43:14,805 --> 01:43:16,432
He's very attractive.

1132
01:43:17,174 --> 01:43:18,198
Isn't he?

1133
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:22,343
You know, I've never met anyone like you
in Washington before.

1134
01:43:23,013 --> 01:43:25,038
Yes, I've been here all my life.

1135
01:43:25,148 --> 01:43:26,137
Really?

1136
01:43:26,216 --> 01:43:29,549
And where have you been all my life?

1137
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:34,853
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

1138
01:43:37,194 --> 01:43:39,526
...have you ever had sex with a man?

1139
01:43:44,735 --> 01:43:47,363
No. I don't think so.

1140
01:43:49,706 --> 01:43:51,697
We could go upstairs right now.

1141
01:43:53,777 --> 01:43:55,677
Is there a TV upstairs?

1142
01:43:58,382 --> 01:43:59,781
I like to watch.

1143
01:44:00,517 --> 01:44:02,644
You like to watch?

1144
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:03,952
Yes.

1145
01:44:05,022 --> 01:44:07,547
You wait right here. I'll go get Warren.

1146
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:17,595
Is it me?

1147
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:22,202
- Is it something I've done?
- No, sweetheart, it's not...

1148
01:44:24,474 --> 01:44:25,634
No, it's...

1149
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,738
It's not you.

1150
01:44:31,114 --> 01:44:33,639
This never happened
when you were a senator.

1151
01:44:34,184 --> 01:44:36,550
It's not that, it's just that I...

1152
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:42,925
- Yeah, Kaufman, what is it?
- The CIA or the FBI...

1153
01:44:43,193 --> 01:44:45,855
...destroyed Gardiner's files.
- What? Why?

1154
01:44:47,898 --> 01:44:50,731
- Neither agency will admit to a thing.
- All right.

1155
01:44:51,802 --> 01:44:54,930
Get Baldwin and Honeycutt over here.
I'll be right down.

1156
01:45:17,294 --> 01:45:18,955
I feel so close to you, Chauncey.

1157
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:22,198
I feel safe.

1158
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:28,868
Ben understands my feelings for you,
by the way, and he accepts them.

1159
01:45:32,209 --> 01:45:33,836
Ben is very wise.

1160
01:45:45,555 --> 01:45:48,854
Or thirdly, the man's files
have been destroyed.

1161
01:45:51,228 --> 01:45:54,595
- Now, I'd like some answers.
- Gardiner's not a foreign agent.

1162
01:45:54,664 --> 01:45:57,098
There are now 16 countries
investigating the man.

1163
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:02,572
I see.

1164
01:46:03,573 --> 01:46:05,473
What about the third question?

1165
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:08,102
Is it possible to erase all traces of a man?

1166
01:46:08,311 --> 01:46:09,835
Highly unlikely, sir.

1167
01:46:10,013 --> 01:46:12,948
In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel...

1168
01:46:14,084 --> 01:46:17,315
...that the only one
capable of pulling this off...

1169
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:20,018
...would be an ex-FBI man.

1170
01:46:23,427 --> 01:46:25,952
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.

1171
01:46:28,098 --> 01:46:30,931
What do the boys around Intelligence feel?

1172
01:46:33,937 --> 01:46:37,236
Well, Mr. President,
they don't quite know...

1173
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,707
It's very difficult...

1174
01:46:47,117 --> 01:46:49,278
...for me to say goodnight to you, Chauncey.

1175
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:52,381
It's very hard...

1176
01:46:54,458 --> 01:46:56,153
...for me to leave you.

1177
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:59,428
It's very hard for me, too, Eve.

1178
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:20,246
No.

1179
01:47:21,551 --> 01:47:24,019
Sell all 750,000 shares...

1180
01:47:25,755 --> 01:47:27,086
...of CCT.

1181
01:47:30,393 --> 01:47:31,519
Let's see.

1182
01:47:37,968 --> 01:47:40,493
Sell a million shares of Inland Oil.

1183
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:44,068
Or Mrs. Aubrey...

1184
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:49,603
...have 30,000 shares of Standard...

1185
01:47:51,014 --> 01:47:53,414
...transferred into your account.

1186
01:47:55,452 --> 01:47:56,749
That's for you.

1187
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:58,727
Ben

1188
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,200
Robert

1189
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:07,660
I was just cleaning up some loose ends.

1190
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:11,833
Getting rid of the dead wood, so...

1191
01:48:13,036 --> 01:48:15,129
...so Eve wouldn't have to cope with it.

1192
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:25,079
Ben, I'd like to talk to you about Chauncey.

1193
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:29,091
Chauncey...

1194
01:48:34,191 --> 01:48:35,453
You know, Robert...

1195
01:48:37,394 --> 01:48:39,589
...there's something about him, that...

1196
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:41,863
...that I trust.

1197
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,462
He makes me feel good.

1198
01:48:49,506 --> 01:48:51,269
Since he's been around...

1199
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:56,105
...the thought of dying...

1200
01:48:57,681 --> 01:48:59,672
...has been much easier for me.

1201
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:49,922
Chauncey!
I couldn't stand it.

1202
01:50:46,589 --> 01:50:47,783
What is it?

1203
01:50:49,326 --> 01:50:50,588
Chauncey, what's wrong?

1204
01:50:58,802 --> 01:51:00,235
What's the matter, Chauncey?

1205
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:07,369
I don't know what you like. I'm sorry.

1206
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:08,943
I like to watch, Eve.

1207
01:51:11,047 --> 01:51:13,242
What do you mean, you like to watch?

1208
01:51:14,517 --> 01:51:16,109
I like to watch.

1209
01:51:30,633 --> 01:51:31,759
You mean...

1210
01:51:32,836 --> 01:51:34,827
...me, you like to watch me...

1211
01:51:36,206 --> 01:51:37,264
...do it.

1212
01:51:38,308 --> 01:51:39,605
It's very good, Eve.

1213
01:51:50,754 --> 01:51:53,587
No, thanks. I never touch the stuff, never.

1214
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,315
A cigar, then?

1215
01:51:56,459 --> 01:51:58,518
I'll have one of those. Thanks.

1216
01:52:00,063 --> 01:52:01,553
Thanks very much.

1217
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:05,858
- Sit down, Rico.
- Yeah, thanks.

1218
01:52:14,344 --> 01:52:15,868
Now listen, Rico...

1219
01:52:17,247 --> 01:52:21,047
...I'm going to talk to you, but
you're not going to hear a word I say, see?

1220
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:27,415
This is inside dope and if it gets out,
it'll be just too bad for somebody.

1221
01:52:27,557 --> 01:52:28,717
You know me.

1222
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:33,451
All right. Get this.
Pete Montana 's through.

1223
01:52:39,636 --> 01:52:42,537
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.

1224
01:52:44,808 --> 01:52:49,074
Suppose I were to tell you that,
from now on, you are Pete Montana.

1225
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:53,571
That you were to take over his territory
in addition to your own.

1226
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:56,015
Will you shake on it?

1227
01:52:56,152 --> 01:52:59,610
One of the first things you should know
about me, my darling...

1228
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:02,650
...is that I'm a little shy.

1229
01:53:03,326 --> 01:53:04,850
All right, it's set.

1230
01:53:06,596 --> 01:53:09,793
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico.
When I get you planted...

1231
01:53:10,233 --> 01:53:13,430
- ...I'll expect plenty of service.
- You'll sure get it.

1232
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:17,335
Permit me then to drink to the new boss
of the North Side.

1233
01:53:17,974 --> 01:53:19,100
Thank you.

1234
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,068
You look great, boss.

1235
01:53:22,412 --> 01:53:23,674
Feels terrible.

1236
01:53:23,746 --> 01:53:27,273
There ain't none of us ever been
invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.

1237
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,910
And nobody ever crashed a gate
except Pete Montana.

1238
01:53:29,986 --> 01:53:32,784
If you think I'm going out in this harness,
you're crazy.

1239
01:53:32,856 --> 01:53:34,619
You look fine, Boss.

1240
01:53:58,281 --> 01:54:00,613
- Hello, Big Boy.
- Hello, Rico.

1241
01:54:12,028 --> 01:54:14,553
Wow, you're rather late up tonight,
aren't you?

1242
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:20,331
This next exercise is trying to...

1243
01:54:21,037 --> 01:54:24,871
...sort of explore and with any explorer,
go slowly.

1244
01:54:29,412 --> 01:54:32,677
Knee to the chest
and experimenting with the weight...

1245
01:54:33,917 --> 01:54:37,910
...and going at this slowly.
Please, nobody leaping up.

1246
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:44,487
Chauncey, where did you go?

1247
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:23,224
Don't be frightened of it. It's important
to know that you, yes, you could roll over.

1248
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,812
We're going to cut down the CVP line.

1249
01:55:43,486 --> 01:55:44,350
No.

1250
01:55:46,656 --> 01:55:48,624
No more shots.

1251
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:52,820
No more.

1252
01:55:55,498 --> 01:55:56,795
It's not good, Ben.

1253
01:55:59,669 --> 01:56:00,693
I know.

1254
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:03,700
I know.

1255
01:56:22,525 --> 01:56:24,288
You uncoil my wants...

1256
01:56:26,462 --> 01:56:28,327
...desire flows within me.

1257
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,697
And when you watch me, my passion...

1258
01:56:33,269 --> 01:56:35,100
...it dissolves the desire.

1259
01:56:36,906 --> 01:56:38,271
You set me free, Chauncey.

1260
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:45,575
And I reveal myself to myself
and I am drenched...

1261
01:56:46,482 --> 01:56:47,744
...and purged.

1262
01:56:51,688 --> 01:56:53,383
Mr. Rand would like to see you.

1263
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:56,654
I would like to see Ben.

1264
01:57:17,554 --> 01:57:18,300
Chauncey...

1265
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,082
Yes, Ben?

1266
01:57:24,387 --> 01:57:26,184
Are you going to die now?

1267
01:57:28,691 --> 01:57:29,988
I think I'm...

1268
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:33,060
...going to surrender the...

1269
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:35,722
...horn of plenty...

1270
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,591
...for the horn of Gabriel.

1271
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:47,108
Give me your hand.

1272
01:57:49,345 --> 01:57:51,074
Let me feel your strength.

1273
01:57:55,774 --> 01:57:56,721
Chauncey.

1274
01:57:59,021 --> 01:58:01,080
I hope that you'll stay here...

1275
01:58:03,192 --> 01:58:04,420
...with Eve.

1276
01:58:05,361 --> 01:58:06,760
Take care of her.

1277
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:10,765
She cares for you.

1278
01:58:13,035 --> 01:58:14,127
Watch...

1279
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:16,536
...over her.

1280
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:20,570
She's a delicate flower.

1281
01:58:21,911 --> 01:58:23,037
A flower.

1282
01:58:23,913 --> 01:58:24,777
Yes, Ben.

1283
01:58:28,885 --> 01:58:29,977
There's...

1284
01:58:37,293 --> 01:58:38,920
...so much left to do.

1285
01:58:42,331 --> 01:58:45,892
I've spoken to them, my associates.

1286
01:58:48,137 --> 01:58:49,502
They're eager...

1287
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,206
...very eager, to meet you.

1288
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,542
Tell Eve...

1289
01:59:26,943 --> 01:59:28,069
He's gone, Chauncey.

1290
01:59:33,115 --> 01:59:34,605
Yes, I know, Robert.

1291
01:59:36,485 --> 01:59:38,248
I've seen this before.

1292
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:41,356
It happens to old people.

1293
01:59:58,908 --> 02:00:00,637
Will you be leaving now, Robert?

1294
02:00:06,082 --> 02:00:07,811
Yes, in a day or two.

1295
02:00:08,918 --> 02:00:09,782
Yes.

1296
02:00:11,087 --> 02:00:12,452
Eve is staying.

1297
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:16,183
She said she will not close up the house.

1298
02:00:20,529 --> 02:00:23,987
You've become quite a close friend
of Eve's, haven't you...

1299
02:00:25,101 --> 02:00:26,090
...Chance?

1300
02:00:27,737 --> 02:00:29,901
Yes. Yes...

1301
02:00:30,642 --> 02:00:36,973
I... I love Eve very much, Robert

1302
02:00:39,015 --> 02:00:41,848
And you really are a gardener, aren't you?

1303
02:00:43,519 --> 02:00:44,645
I am...

1304
02:00:46,789 --> 02:00:48,086
...a gardener.

1305
02:00:56,034 --> 02:01:02,027
Well, I'll go and tell Eve about Ben.

1306
02:01:14,583 --> 02:01:15,845
I understand.

1307
02:01:23,993 --> 02:01:25,290
I understand.

1308
02:01:27,964 --> 02:01:30,831
I know that Ben said:
'Keep it small and quiet.'

1309
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:34,028
And I don't want to go
against Ben's wishes.

1310
02:01:36,105 --> 02:01:40,098
But I thought it would be good,
while our friends are carrying Ben to his...

1311
02:01:40,977 --> 02:01:42,774
...last resting place...

1312
02:01:44,447 --> 02:01:46,278
...to read from his quotes.

1313
02:01:48,117 --> 02:01:50,483
'I have no use for those on welfare...

1314
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:53,754
'...no patience whatsoever.

1315
02:01:54,857 --> 02:01:57,382
'But if I am to be honest with myself...

1316
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,756
'...I must admit that they have
no use for me, either.

1317
02:02:04,767 --> 02:02:08,635
'I do not regret having political differences
with men that I respect.

1318
02:02:11,474 --> 02:02:13,203
'I do regret, however...

1319
02:02:16,178 --> 02:02:18,078
'...that our philosophies...

1320
02:02:20,182 --> 02:02:21,706
'...kept us apart. '

1321
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:28,249
Yes, I agree. Except he's so boring.
What about Max?

1322
02:02:28,324 --> 02:02:30,986
- He could never take an election.
- Correct.

1323
02:02:31,093 --> 02:02:33,926
The people of this country
need to be awakened.

1324
02:02:35,097 --> 02:02:38,260
What about Lawson?
He's charismatic, exciting.

1325
02:02:38,834 --> 02:02:42,531
He's a bit too exciting, I'm afraid.
If they start bringing up things about...

1326
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:45,438
Gentlemen, time is running out.
We must come to a decision.

1327
02:02:50,946 --> 02:02:52,880
'I have heard the word 'sir'...

1328
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:56,417
'...more often...

1329
02:02:57,186 --> 02:02:59,552
'...than I have heard the word 'friend'.

1330
02:03:00,656 --> 02:03:02,123
'But I suppose...

1331
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:06,026
'...there are other rewards for wealth.

1332
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,757
'I have met with kings.

1333
02:03:11,333 --> 02:03:12,925
'During these conferences...

1334
02:03:13,302 --> 02:03:17,705
'...I have suppressed bizarre thoughts:
Could I beat him in a foot race?

1335
02:03:18,641 --> 02:03:21,007
'Could I throw a ball further than he?

1336
02:03:22,378 --> 02:03:26,246
'No matter what our faade,
we are all children. '

1337
02:03:26,782 --> 02:03:28,682
What about Chauncey Gardiner?

1338
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:31,753
What do we know of the man?
Absolutely nothing.

1339
02:03:32,288 --> 02:03:34,279
We don't have an inkling of his past.

1340
02:03:34,356 --> 02:03:38,554
Correct. That could be an asset.
A man's past cripples him.

1341
02:03:39,895 --> 02:03:43,023
His background turns into a swamp
and invites scrutiny.

1342
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:47,795
Up until this time, he hasn't said anything
that could be held against him.

1343
02:03:48,104 --> 02:03:52,131
And the mail and telephone response
from his appearance on that Burns Show...

1344
02:03:52,241 --> 02:03:54,573
...was the highest they've ever had.

1345
02:03:55,111 --> 02:03:56,009
And?

1346
02:03:57,346 --> 02:03:59,541
And it was 95 percent pro.

1347
02:04:00,182 --> 02:04:02,207
I'm certainly open to the idea.

1348
02:04:02,284 --> 02:04:06,550
It would be absolute lunacy
to support the President for another term.

1349
02:04:07,089 --> 02:04:10,650
That is exactly why I agree
with Ben's final wishes.

1350
02:04:13,195 --> 02:04:15,925
'I was born into a position
of extreme wealth.

1351
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:24,170
'I have spent many sleepless nights...

1352
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,801
'...thinking about extreme power.

1353
02:04:37,052 --> 02:04:38,576
'I've lived a lot...

1354
02:04:39,355 --> 02:04:40,788
'...trembled a lot...

1355
02:04:41,524 --> 02:04:45,290
'...was surrounded by little men

1356
02:04:45,794 --> 02:04:47,125
'...and exit naked...

1357
02:04:47,229 --> 02:04:50,221
'...and that no accountant
can audit life in our favor. '

1358
02:04:51,367 --> 02:04:55,497
I do believe, gentlemen,
if we want to hold on to the Presidency...

1359
02:04:56,338 --> 02:05:00,832
...our one and only chance
is Chauncey Gardiner.

1360
02:05:06,248 --> 02:05:08,648
'When I was a boy, I was told...

1361
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:14,789
'...that the Lord fashioned us
from his own image.

1362

to manufacture mirrors.

'Tranquility.

'All the aims I have pursued...

02:05:57,499 --> 02:05:59,296
'...will soon be realized.

02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:06,232
'Life...

'...is a state of mind. '

1370
02:06:23,859 --> 02:06:25,121
I understand.

1371
02:06:27,863 --> 02:06:30,957
Is it all clear now, boys?
Can you read that?

1372
02:06:36,405 --> 02:06:38,566
What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

1373
02:06:39,908 --> 02:06:41,933
'Now, get this, honky...'

1374

Sorry, carry on.

1375
02:06:50,252 --> 02:06:51,219
Okay.

1376
02:06:55,858 --> 02:06:56,847
All set.

1377
02:06:58,594 --> 02:07:00,858
What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

1398
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:46,424
It's slightly long...

1399
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:50,061
...but I will try to remember it.

1400
