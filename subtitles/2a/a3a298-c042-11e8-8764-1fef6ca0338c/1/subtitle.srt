1
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,340
Would you sacrifice your youth...

2
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,008
...for your love?

3
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,412
Do you?

4
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,778
It all began on ICQ

5
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,922
LEMON COFFEE, where are you?

6
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,668
We miss you!

7
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:31,375
LEMON COFFEE, go for it!

8
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,454
Cyber sex with me? Ooh...

9
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,330
Yes, come on baby, I'm a Thai girl

10
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,136
Why is a hot babe at home eating pizza alone?

11
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,970
Very sunny out...

12
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,986
Do you like the sun?

13
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,788
No, I hate it!

14
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,410
Only the sick will spread their germs

15
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,946
My garden

16
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,315
My big house

17
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,743
Hi, LEMON COFFEE
guess which one is me?

18
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,645
The cutest one of course

19
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,380
The sunshine here will kill all the germs

20
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,682
I'll tell you something personal!

21
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,290
I've neglected a lot in my life...

22
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,794
...like the people around me

23
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,929
Since I've been in a wheelchair...

24
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,259
...I see life from a different angle

25
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,027
It's actually a clearer angle

26
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,900
Have you noticed that...

27
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,973
...every flower and every leaf is different?

28
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,538
Have you noticed that

29
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,804
...everyone has a good side?

30
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,105
Now I cherish

31
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,011
everything around me

32
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,081
You are always online

33
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,814
Don't you have anything else to do?

34
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,082
Come to Koh Samui if you have time

35
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,157
I have a resort called "Coconut Villa"

36
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,329
I guarantee you...

37
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,530
You'll have a great time here

38
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,343
Stop! Stop...

39
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,003
Stop!

40
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,550
Miss, are you okay?

41
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,892
That was the first time I saw
Mr. And Mrs. Bond

42
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,596
Not until later...

43
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,802
...do I understand why Mr. Bond is
so strange

44
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,107
That's more handsome!

45
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,272
Go...

46
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,408
Thank you

47
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,415
A bet

48
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,245
whether the first customer is
LEMON COFFEE?

49
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,285
So what if it is?

50
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,747
If it is, you give me massage

51
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,060
If not, I'll give you a massage

52
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,285
Deal!

53
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,362
Let's make it official, lest you forget

54
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,376
Sawadeekup! Welcome to Coconut Villa!

55
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,812
Thank you

56
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,680
- What's up?
- I don't know

57
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,486
It must be her

58
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,223
Sawadeekup! Welcome!

59
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,832
You're our first customer today

60
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,033
You'll receive a complimentary drink
but please check in first

61
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,773
The girl doesn't smile

62
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,777
Like the way you were

63
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,743
This is your bungalow, very nice room

64
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,290
We have Full moon party

65
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,789
Half moon party and Black moon party

66
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,426
That means we'll have party every night

67
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,288
I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here

68
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,701
Thank you

69
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,719
You know lots of girls on ICQ

70
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,391
...are actually boys!

71
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,018
Really?

72
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,396
You think this LEMON COFFEE is
a girl or boy?

73
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,559
LEMON COFFEE?

74
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,460
I heard a cool and pretty girl arrived
today and...

75
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,865
...she takes coffee with lemon

76
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,239
Coincidence?

77
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,245
Where is Lek?

78
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,286
What is it?

79
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,684
So? Are you buying tonight?

80
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,291
Don't worry

81
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,391
I'll buy!

82
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,336
Hey girl, for you!

83
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,737
Thank you!

84
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,837
And this, for you!

85
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,347
No... No... No

86
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,545
Don't ever stand under a coconut tree
at dusk

87
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,482
Be careful

88
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,865
Do you think that's LEMON COFFEE?

89
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,467
I'll tell you later

90
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,332
Don't look. She's looking over

91
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,472
Not bad looking!

92
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,838
She's cool, man

93
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,776
Don't scare her. Go back to work...

94
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,777
Lek

95
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,755
You said you were good with women?

96
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,149
Of course

97
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,957
Let's have a bet

98
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,752
What on?

99
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,493
If the girl doesn't smile within 24 hours

100
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,701
You'll give me 50% off

101
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,432
What if she smiles?

102
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,606
If she does...

103
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,863
You'll give me 60% off

104
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,272
You serious?

105
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,978
Sure, why not?!

106
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,842
Let's make it clear...

107
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,413
She has to laugh, not smile

108
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,847
A sad smile...

109
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,214
...won't count

110
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,485
- Laugh?
- Yes

111
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,291
- Start the clock.
- OK

112
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,233
Are you LEMON COFFEE?

113
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,094
Lek?

114
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,115
Fragile

115
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,724
This is LEMON COFFEE?

116
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,425
I can't believe you came

117
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,804
I'm Ching Wai. Call me Ching

118
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,943
I'm Lek. That means little

119
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,445
I thought you were lying. I didn't know...

120
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,609
...that I was really handicapped

121
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,715
Don't be sorry. I'm fine with it

122
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,217
I didn't lie. I am really happy

123
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,991
Probably more content than you are!

124
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,398
How long have you not smiled?

125
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,200
Two years, almost

126
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,167
No wonder you look uncomfortable

127
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,698
Really?

128
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,878
Did my video clip work?

129
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
The file was infected with a virus

130
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,848
No way! What virus?

131
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,144
I Love You

132
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,248
Chan Rak Tur

133
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,584
What does it mean?

134
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,087
It means "I love you"

135
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,527
If you are infected, you're ruined

136
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,499
Stay longer, you'll get better

137
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,876
Sounds awful!

138
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,956
Pretty good

139
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,358
No way!

140
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,399
You should sing and laugh from the heart

141
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,535
He didn't!

142
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,729
You can?

143
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,028
Of course

144
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,807
If you laugh loudly three times...

145
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,238
I'll sing for you

146
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,215
That was the first time I saw him

147
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:58,282
Who knew he was telling the truth on ICQ

148
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,091
It surprised me that...

149
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,556
...even tough he was wheelchair-bound
he could still laugh so hard

150
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,528
I talked to him for a long time

151
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,229
He loosened up

152
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,305
I haven't felt that way in a long time

153
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,372
I had the best post-computer sleep...

154
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,909
...that night in two years

155
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,051
The other people here are also cool

156
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,049
Everyone is laid back

157
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,450
Nothing seems to get to them

158
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:33,886
Actually

159
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,560
I would love to be like them

160
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,155
I think I came to the right place

161
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,593
Hello!

162
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,235
Mr. And Mrs. Bond bought you this drink

163
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,639
Please thank your boss for me

164
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,407
You mean Mr. And Mrs. Bond?

165
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,608
- They are regulars here
- Really?

166
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,380
They've been coming here every year
for the past 20 years

167
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,139
Mr. And Mrs. Bond

168
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,376
please dance for us!

169
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,052
Sure!

170
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,186
So early?

171
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,414
It's already lunch time

172
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,963
When will someone dance with me?

173
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,100
May I dance with you?

174
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,769
Sure!

175
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,112
Honey, the girl is sitting alone

176
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,907
Why isn't Lek here?

177
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,419
He needs some time

178
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,246
Especially the young

179
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,583
You think they behave like us?

180
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,153
It'd be great if we were 30 years younger

181
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,796
You're so greedy!

182
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,229
You're much younger than I am

183
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,399
If I'm gone...

184
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,506
Stop! Let's dance!

185
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,013
You never know!

186
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,078
If I go first...

187
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,306
Stop! Let's dance!

188
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,380
OK

189
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,234
Didn't pay the bill?

190
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,834
Of course I did!

191
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,671
Business is slow...

192
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,534
...this time of year

193
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,538
Too noisy if it was crowded

194
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,041
Right, B289 the fewer customers the better

195
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,907
Otherwise, you'll have to close down

196
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,071
Why?

197
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,181
You always buy them drinks!

198
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,646
Please...

199
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,790
We're in business, man!

200
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,050
It's alright. I don't mind!

201
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,451
- Hi!
- Hello

202
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,390
Have a seat!

203
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,825
No, please continue!

204
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,790
It's alright, have a seat!

205
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,129
Allow me...

206
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,232
This is Brother Wing, the manager here

207
00:18:59,404 --> 00:18:59,961
Hi

208
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,729
This is Ching from Hong Kong

209
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,435
You're a smooth operator!

210
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,705
Why didn't you introduce me earlier?

211
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,944
She is a guest here. Arrived yesterday

212
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,912
Excuse me...

213
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,380
I have an appointment. I'll let you talk

214
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,984
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be

215
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,889
What's up?

216
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,787
Too much internet?
Want to get some sun?

217
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,519
Your computer in the lobby is infected

218
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,664
It's just a blackout

219
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,991
Small island problems!

220
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,804
How can I help?

221
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,304
You're here on vacation

222
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,537
You can work for me

223
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,902
You're hiring?

224
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,974
Just kidding

225
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,445
Small business... we can't afford it!

226
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,685
Everyone here has multiple
responsibilities

227
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,022
Let me take you out

228
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,626
Remember, don't walk under
the Coconut trees at dusk

229
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,923
Very risky

230
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,834
See!

231
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,559
Told you so!

232
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,738
God is so nice to us!

233
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,474
We don't have to climb up for it!

234
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,376
You're lucky to live in a paradise!

235
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,740
Trouble-free!

236
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,810
Really?

237
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,914
You don't have beaches in Hong Kong?

238
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,481
No sunsets?

239
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,090
Or you just don't look for them!

240
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,219
The wind blows the bottles here
this time of year

241
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,262
Northerners write their miseries down and

242
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,365
put them in bottles...

243
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,070
...thinking the water will wash
the problems away

244
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,039
It doesn't matter where you are only
what you believe in

245
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,539
You can't run away from problems

246
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,910
They follow you everywhere

247
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,717
Does it really work?

248
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,787
I think so. Try it

249
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,216
Together!

250
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,436
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir

251
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,573
Dr. Lai

252
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,385
Get me a bigger boat
I want to sail further

253
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,145
Sure

254
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,451
Alone again?

255
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,654
How come no one from your hospital

256
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,449
comes with you?

257
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,621
They don't see the fun in work!

258
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,289
How are you?
Have you been doing physical therapy?

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,489
Of course!

260
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,503
Let me rephrase...

261
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,968
Have you overdone the therapy?

262
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,272
I'll be careful

263
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,937
That... LEMON COFFEE...

264
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,374
Is she pretty?

265
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,187
Please, she's only next door now!

266
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,821
Why talk on ICQ?

267
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,024
Invite her to your room

268
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,589
Silly!

269
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,926
We're all nosy people

270
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,369
Dr. Lai, why work so hard?

271
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,096
You dive everyday!

272
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,938
I want to gather some microorganism...

273
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,275
...that's flowing in from the Indian ocean

274
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,578
These microorganisms stimulate our
nervous systems

275
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,875
If we inject them into you
you may recover!

276
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,249
There is a Chinese saying...

277
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,321
Heal a heart problem with a heart
medicine. What does it mean?

278
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,118
Psychological counseling?

279
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,962
That girl is depressed

280
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,997
I'm talking about serious things...

281
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,105
...that concern your legs!

282
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,865
You are talking about a girl?

283
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,171
I really want to help her

284
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,874
Do you have the "I love you" virus?

285
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,116
Let me give you a check up!

286
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,279
Brat!

287
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,022
Hurry...

288
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,196
Higher... come on...

289
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,895
That is guaranteed to wipe out depression!

290
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,801
I want to play!

291
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,476
You are not a kid anymore!

292
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,204
I want to try

293
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,073
Really?

294
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,549
Chang, not too high!

295
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,621
Got it!

296
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,560
Higher!

297
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,524
Coming...

298
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,999
Higher!

299
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,170
Be careful!

300
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,746
Chang! Stop! Stop...

301
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,027
You...

302
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,397
Drink it!

303
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,059
It was an accident... you didn't intend it

304
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,065
I killed my two best friends

305
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,702
I can't!

306
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,012
I can't forget about them

307
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,620
I see them when I close my eyes

308
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,189
Everyone here knows my story

309
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,824
A couple of years ago, at the intersection...

310
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,895
...a truck knocked me down and broke
my spine

311
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,097
The driver called in the middle of the night

312
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,433
He wanted me to sue him

313
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,943
He said he'd feel better if he went to jail

314
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,310
I asked him why he hit me

315
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,220
He said the brakes failed

316
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,791
I said then it wasn't his fault

317
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,963
Later...

318
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,758
I told him I got to know myself better

319
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,536
I didn't realize I was spoilt and
bad-tempered

320
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,569
Because I lost some things
I learnt to value life

321
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:26,376
One always grows when faced...

322
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,279
...with adversities

323
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,584
The best thing was...

324
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,452
I learnt to forgive

325
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,695
Try it. Forgive yourself!

326
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,032
The doctor said I will never...

327
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,640
...stand again

328
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,703
I say...

329
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,743
1...

330
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,346
2...

331
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,147
Even if it's for 2 seconds...

332
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,720
I have to prove that nothing is impossible

333
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,556
You have legs

334
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,895
If you want to stand
you have to do it yourself

335
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,381
I made it

336
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,711
Try it

337
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,546
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

338
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,257
We've been waiting for ages for our food

339
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,323
We're really hungry

340
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,154
Seriously? I'm sorry. Be my guest, okay?

341
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,126
That's really nice of you.
Thank you very much!

342
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,423
What about us?

343
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,662
No problem, on the house

344
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,370
Brother Wing, my treat tonight!

345
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,938
Let's eat!

346
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,470
What's wrong?

347
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,504
Not enough here

348
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,272
What the hell?

349
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,143
I'm the boss! They won't let me eat

350
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,577
I'll join you!

351
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,786
Please excuse us

352
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,719
We have to discuss some private matters

353
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,054
- Really?
- Yes!

354
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,239
Troublemakers!

355
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,805
Let's eat!

356
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,938
Please!

357
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,648
This one too. Thai pineapple

358
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,418
The snacks here are famous

359
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,023
Very popular

360
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,118
Look!

361
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,529
And this one

362
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,156
Smells great!

363
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,956
The grill is great!

364
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,604
- What is it?
- It hurts!

365
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,739
Are you alright?

366
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,739
- It got in my eye.
- Let me see...

367
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:06,876
It's alright

368
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:07,806
Wash it with water

369
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,478
- It'll be fine.
- Let me see

370
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,171
Thanks...

371
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,416
I'm alright

372
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,063
This is for you

373
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,203
Where did you get it? Did you buy it?

374
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,605
No, I made it

375
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,639
I'll play it for you!

376
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,707
Look, hold it here and blow!

377
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,985
Try it

378
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,931
Blow into this hole

379
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,128
No, the mouth goes...

380
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,940
Give me some time! I can do it!

381
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,877
Some time?

382
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,106
10 years or 20?

383
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,577
I can do it!

384
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,146
If you try

385
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,927
Lek is a very charming guy

386
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,931
Like you used to be!

387
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,842
I'll cook you Chinese food

388
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,348
Are you bored? Go and chat with Lek!

389
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,607
There isn't that much to say...

390
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,112
How can that be?

391
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,582
Mr. Bond and I chat about everything!

392
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,448
How did you meet him?

393
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,783
We met right here

394
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,116
There weren't so many tourists then

395
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,258
No one knew about this place

396
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,189
- Really?
- Yes!

397
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,829
I had a boyfriend then

398
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,937
We had a fight.
I thought he would come for me

399
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,108
But he didn't

400
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,708
He didn't care anymore

401
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,878
So I picked up Mr. Bond here

402
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,013
I didn't know we were so compatible

403
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,876
He is 20 years older than me

404
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,020
My mother was furious

405
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,951
You hit on him?

406
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,853
Yes, he talked to all the girls...

407
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,618
...but me!

408
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,421
I was quite attractive

409
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,825
So I confronted him with it

410
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,058
And he said...

411
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,499
The first thing one says to one's future
wife is very important

412
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,071
...and I haven't thought of
what to say yet

413
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,901
Now I know

414
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,111
It was just a line

415
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,011
Luckily, I was good judge of character

416
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,118
He is a very nice man

417
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,753
You're amazing!

418
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,718
Who knows what the future holds!

419
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,188
Do what makes you happy

420
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,428
Don't think that I am old-fashioned

421
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,632
I'm very open-minded!

422
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,193
Lek is a good man

423
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,364
But...

424
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,134
...sympathy is not enough

425
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,968
If you like him, you must take the good
with the bad

426
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,305
Simple philosophy

427
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,049
Mr. Bond, be careful!

428
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,386
If Mrs. Bond knew you were drinking
she'd kick your ass

429
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:48,361
Silly, she can't sleep without me!

430
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,691
Good for you!

431
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,034
Are you two holding hands yet?

432
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,943
You're so aggressive!

433
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,003
Let's have a bet

434
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,042
Again?

435
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,183
If you can't hold her hand in 24 hours

436
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,154
The rent goes back up to 70% off

437
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,021
Mr. Bond

438
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,651
I think you are fooling the world

439
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,898
You claim to have Parkinson's but
your math is so good

440
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,024
I don't know why

441
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,868
Money turns my mind on

442
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,674
Honestly, do you like her?

443
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,145
Honestly...

444
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,574
I really want to help her

445
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,576
You can't fool me

446
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,252
You like her

447
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,452
Listen...

448
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,156
...you can't help someone half-heartedly

449
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,395
You must go all the way

450
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,477
Up ahead

451
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,175
This is it!

452
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,191
I've been keeping something from you

453
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,318
What is it?

454
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,388
I have a wife

455
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,026
Let me introduce you

456
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,137
Isn't it pretty?

457
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,040
I haven't taken it out for a long time!

458
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,408
Do you want to drive it?

459
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,480
You can do it!

460
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,159
If I can do it, so can you!

461
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:45,770
Relax, you'll break the steering wheel!

462
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,101
I haven't driven in a while!

463
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,237
It's alright. I'm here

464
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,472
Step on it!

465
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,028
Look at that!

466
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,371
What are you doing?

467
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,916
I only said to look

468
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,142
Don't take it...

469
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,479
Jackfruits are really sweet!

470
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,120
Come on... we'll get caught!

471
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,659
Hurry up!

472
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,893
You...

473
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,230
Hold on! It's like a safari!

474
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,435
Go!

475
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,005
What is it?

476
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,539
Stop!

477
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,613
Are you alright? What is it?

478
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,448
Lek, what is it?

479
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,316
My hand...

480
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,525
I can't move my hand

481
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,095
Go to the hospital!

482
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,910
How is he?

483
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,605
His spine is fragile

484
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,211
Some vertebras are dislocated

485
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,544
It may affect his upper body too

486
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,886
Why did you take him on a safari ride?

487
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,580
You knew his spine was fragile

488
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,158
Calm down

489
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,795
I gave him anesthetics. He's still out

490
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,360
You can go and see him

491
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,438
What are we going to do?

492
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,848
Miss Wai

493
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,252
I didn't know

494
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,461
I warned him to be careful

495
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,391
I'm worried he moves too much

496
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,068
He made me smile again

497
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,361
Please save him!

498
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,539
Don't worry, he's very tough

499
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,808
I was here when he had the accident

500
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,743
It was 6 or 7 years ago

501
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,178
I'll try my best. He has a chance

502
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,348
Nerves can now be connected

503
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,021
I've been searching for a specific
microorganism...

504
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,281
...to regenerate nerves

505
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,684
I've found it

506
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,561
I first need a body to cultivate these cells

507
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,286
When it's ready
remove it and inject it into the patient

508
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,590
I'll be the body!

509
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,565
There are a lot of legal procedures for
this kind of experiment

510
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,696
Who will know?
I'll sign whatever is necessary

511
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,842
I swear I won't say a word
as long as you save him

512
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,272
It isn't that simple

513
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,503
Calm down

514
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:01,361
Lek...

515
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,724
It's me!

516
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,865
It's me!

517
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,112
They gave me a lot of anesthetics

518
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,090
I'm very dizzy!

519
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,893
Rest, you'll be fine

520
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,158
I'm fine

521
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,729
Go out and enjoy yourself!

522
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,873
Without you?

523
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:51,414
I didn't mean to spoil your holiday

524
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,274
Don't say that

525
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,184
I didn't see you just now...

526
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,587
I thought you didn't want to see me

527
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:04,861
Silly

528
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,224
Rest up

529
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,795
No!

530
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:18,368
I'm afraid I won't see you again

531
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,171
Where's Dr. Lai?

532
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,378
He just gone!

533
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,754
Stop!

534
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,990
Dr. Lai...

535
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,159
I don't care how dangerous it is.
I have to try

536
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,557
Calm down
the experiment hasn't been proven

537
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,560
If things go wrong, you may die

538
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,259
I don't care. I've lost two good friends

539
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,969
I don't want to lose Lek

540
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,166
Please, I beg you!

541
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,336
Isn't Lek your good friend too?

542
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,234
Don't you want to help him?
Don't give up!

543
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,946
Dr. Lai, please

544
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,149
If anything happens to him
I'll feel responsible forever

545
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,415
Please...

546
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,299
Welcome home!

547
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,400
Thank you...

548
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,059
Let me help you!

549
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,431
- Chang, hammer.
- What?

550
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,609
Help! It hurts...

551
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,043
Be careful!

552
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,116
Your toes moved!

553
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,909
There is sensation!

554
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:50,813
Really?

555
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,180
Can you feel it?

556
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,050
His foot has sensation!

557
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,349
That's great, man!

558
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,258
Look

559
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,797
Really!

560
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:32,127
1 ` 2 ` 3 ` 4 ` 5

561
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,958
6 ~ 7 ~ 8...

562
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,443
I want to dance!

563
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,043
Me too!

564
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:55,825
Ching

565
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,093
Ching

566
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,601
Where's Ching?

567
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:09,938
I haven't seen her

568
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,656
I've looked at the reports.
Something went wrong

569
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,929
How do you feel?

570
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,328
Older

571
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,166
Not only in appearance

572
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,068
my reflex is slower

573
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,569
Will I die soon?

574
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,945
I'm not sure

575
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,075
I'm sorry

576
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,455
Don't worry. I don't regret it

577
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,220
I don't blame you

578
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,460
- What about Lek?
- Don't tell him

579
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,330
I don't want him to know

580
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,600
I don't want him to be upset

581
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,360
Ching!

582
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,856
Ching...

583
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,358
Ching, where are you?

584
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,792
Ching...

585
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,335
- Where are you?
- Ching...

586
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,267
Have you seen her?

587
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,940
Have you seen her?

588
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,246
No

589
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,708
Thanks

590
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,562
I swim here every morning!

591
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,162
No one came out

592
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,176
Ching's clothes!

593
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,908
Lek! Lek... Ching...

594
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,380
Lek! Come back... Ching...

595
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:06,049
Lek! Come back! Let me go!

596
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,157
Ching... Lek! No...

597
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:14,428
Ching! Ching...

598
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,758
Hey, Ching?

599
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,401
Dr. Lai, how does it look?

600
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,403
Please be calm, it doesn't look good

601
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,267
You should prepare yourself

602
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,913
Ching... Ching?

603
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,512
I'm here

604
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,819
How is Lek?

605
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,448
He's very depressed

606
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,888
Why don't you just tell him!

607
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,830
I'd rather he forget me...

608
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,902
He's given up and just stays in
his wheelchair

609
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,465
Why?

610
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,372
You know why

611
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,636
I don't want to force you. You decide!

612
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:29,521
I'm Ching's older sister
I'm coming to Koh Samui...

613
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,139
Honey, what are you writing?

614
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,148
Let me see, come on!

615
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,823
Ching...

616
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,293
Long time no see. You've grown older!

617
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,964
She is not Ching!

618
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,637
She looks... She is not?

619
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,039
I'm sorry

620
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,210
You are...

621
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,616
I'm Ching's sister, Sim Wai

622
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,546
Did you get my e-mail?

623
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,046
How are you? I'm Lek

624
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,656
I'm sorry, we tried our best

625
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,360
We couldn't find her

626
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,563
Don't worry, she's okay

627
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,295
She asked me to pick up her stuff

628
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,026
Really? That's good!

629
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,329
Come and sit down

630
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,435
- Have a seat.
- Thanks

631
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,835
It's typical of my sister

632
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,010
Disappearing suddenly

633
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,374
It's not the first time

634
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,951
Really? She didn't look the type!

635
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,985
What did I do wrong?

636
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,216
I don't know

637
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,155
Maybe she met another guy...

638
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,989
Or went somewhere else!

639
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,392
Typical

640
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,491
My husband recognizes you

641
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,370
I came back...

642
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,279
...to prepare for death

643
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,679
Don't say that!

644
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:16,491
Actually, we're in the same boat

645
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:21,385
The doctor said I only have a few months left

646
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,466
But it doesn't matter

647
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,297
I've had a rewarding life

648
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,638
Seize the day and enjoy the rest of
your life!

649
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,676
Follow your desires!

650
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,709
Will you keep my secret?

651
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,311
On one condition

652
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,785
If I go first, you take care of Mr. Bond

653
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,657
Vice versa

654
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,856
If I go first, you take care of Lek

655
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,192
Deal!

656
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,494
These two men...

657
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,603
...are so lucky to have us

658
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,324
Give me some more time!

659
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,321
No way!

660
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:24,685
We have some more customers coming!

661
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,086
A little more time!

662
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,261
No customers, no money!

663
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:28,191
Bullshit!

664
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,398
Take all the liquor!

665
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,655
Where is Lek?

666
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,161
He said to let them take whatever
they want

667
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,037
What's the problem?

668
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,675
Nothing... minor problem

669
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,138
It won't affect you!

670
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,412
They took everything and
it won't affect us?

671
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,875
Tell him I've bought the resort

672
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,142
I'll pay the debts

673
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,013
Say it or else they won't leave

674
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,553
You want to make a bigger scene?

675
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,400
He doesn't care

676
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,035
When will he get the money?

677
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,238
I'll get the cash next week

678
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:13,906
Cash!

679
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,354
Thinking about my sister?

680
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,052
You two look alike

681
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,159
She's prettier

682
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,791
Ching said you could stand...

683
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,435
Why stay in the wheelchair?

684
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,770
She mentioned me?

685
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,939
She's grateful you made her smile

686
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,337
I know you miss her

687
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,774
But you can't give up

688
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,050
Do you want the place close down?

689
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,648
I feel responsible

690
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,954
Nothing... I mean...

691
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,157
I didn't teach her well

692
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,791
Our parents died early and left us
big money...

693
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,029
I didn't teach her right

694
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,606
I want to help you because you were
good to my sister

695
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,269
If you have financial problems...

696
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,379
I can handle it

697
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,816
Do you know where she is?

698
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,717
Forget her!

699
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,453
Even if she was here...

700
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,989
...she wouldn't want to see
a miserable man

701
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,299
They all care about you

702
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,540
You have to cheer up and smile again

703
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,207
How could you be like this?

704
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,214
Lifeless, humorless

705
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,852
From now on, everything goes back to
the way it was

706
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,216
Come on, let's start

707
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,218
What?

708
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,692
She is right. We can't act like this!

709
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,388
Come on, let's get moving!

710
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,727
She is Ching

711
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,256
No, she is not

712
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,863
No? Yes!

713
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,361
Whatever you say...

714
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:07,910
Be careful!

715
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,888
There are lots of hawkers

716
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,221
The food here is great

717
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,553
Have you been here?

718
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,290
Yes, ages ago

719
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,333
No way! It just opened!

720
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,796
- Really?
- Really!

721
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,704
I love grilled chicken!

722
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:31,974
How much?

723
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,804
40 Baht

724
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,508
Don't go too close. It'll pop

725
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,118
Hello

726
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,352
- How much?
- 10 Baht... 10 Baht...

727
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,195
So expensive!

728
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,865
Have you ever seen such a bouncy
old woman?

729
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,627
Yes, you!

730
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,041
She's young at heart

731
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,004
She's an old temptress!

732
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,138
We can print the "Coconut Villa" logo
on the souvenirs...

733
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,813
...like T-Shirts, caps

734
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,073
We can sell some arts and crafts here too

735
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,352
We need to renovate here

736
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,922
Can we take out the windows?

737
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,284
Why?

738
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,357
The place will be bigger and cooler!

739
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,856
Cooler? I like it!

740
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,823
The words have to be painted again

741
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,595
You're responsible for the local tour
and water sports

742
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,031
You should think of some new attractions

743
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,900
Sim, this is a place to rest

744
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,006
The customers like the peace here

745
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,109
That's why they return every year

746
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,604
How long are you staying anyway?

747
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,849
You want to retire here?

748
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,212
It is a great place for retirement

749
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,311
But a better place for dying

750
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,424
Excuse her, she doesn't mean it

751
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,307
Isn't it better with the lights on?

752
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,204
Come on, let's clean up

753
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:50,844
Watch out!

754
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,612
Are you alright?

755
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,513
I'm fine...

756
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:00,477
Are you okay, Lek?

757
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,281
Are you alright?

758
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,617
I'm fine...

759
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,686
Are you hurt?

760
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:09,228
You can walk. You just don't want to

761
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,725
I can't

762
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,731
Try it, you can

763
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,237
Come on

764
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,167
Hold me

765
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,211
Nice and easy...

766
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,144
Keep going

767
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,811
I can't...

768
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,249
It's alright

769
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,957
Hold onto me

770
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,332
You can do it

771
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,554
Come on

772
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,584
Again

773
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,296
Thanks

774
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:24,704
What are you doing?

775
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:26,706
Slut!

776
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,843
I think that old woman likes Lek

777
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,716
No way!

778
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,884
What do you know? I'm a woman

779
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,814
I can tell right away

780
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,681
She melts when she sees Lek

781
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,414
Lek was with her sister

782
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,284
How can she do that?

783
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,552
Mr. And Mrs. Bond

784
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,753
you guys are elders...

785
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,056
What do you think?

786
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,096
Yes!

787
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,602
It's their business, not yours!

788
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,204
Nosy people!

789
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,944
He's getting old

790
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,771
But he is right

791
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,905
What does it have to do with you?

792
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,392
Talking to the sea again?

793
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:23,487
No, it doesn't talk back

794
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,933
Why not talk to me?

795
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,227
I talk back

796
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:32,696
They are too harsh on Sim

797
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,603
Because they care about you

798
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,869
What do you think of her then?

799
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,077
A nice person

800
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:42,644
Do you like her?

801
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,882
I don't...

802
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,815
That's fine

803
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,082
Don't fall in love with her...

804
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,988
...just because she looks like Ching

805
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,621
They aren't the same person

806
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,228
Don't worry. I understand

807
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:00,832
Good for you

808
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:04,539
Whatever you do, just be clear what it is

809
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,614
Mr. Bond, are you reading someone
else's letter?

810
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,119
Ching, Come on. Let's read it

811
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,483
I'm not Ching!

812
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,859
You can't fool me!

813
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,529
You think I'm that silly?

814
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,232
Don't! Drink from mine!

815
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,265
What's written in there?

816
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:42,001
Secrets of the human heart

817
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,540
I have a secret

818
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:45,905
What is it?

819
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,043
I can't just tell anyone

820
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,787
Don't tell me

821
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,218
I'm bad at keeping secrets

822
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:57,785
I know

823
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,028
I hope I'll be happy like you
when I get old

824
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,988
To begin happiness when you're old
may be too late, girl!

825
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,165
Do I look like a girl?

826
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:07,561
How old do I look?

827
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,128
Not old!

828
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,508
I would pursue you if I was 20 years
younger

829
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:14,902
Really?

830
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,841
Mr. Bond
I really envy you and Mrs. Bond

831
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,078
You remain so good to each other

832
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,447
You can do that too

833
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,454
You see me always making bets?

834
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:33,253
Don't think I'm swindling people

835
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,191
I just enjoy the experience

836
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,626
Even if I lose, I am still very happy

837
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,199
You think too much, Ching

838
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,631
Relax

839
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,339
If you really like Lek...

840
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,132
...ignore what others think

841
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:48,673
Do you know who am I?

842
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,004
You think I forgot?

843
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,216
You're Ching's sister, Sim!

844
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,684
Mr. Bond, if I have a secret to confess...

845
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,650
...should I tell my boyfriend?

846
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,190
Sometimes, you have to be honest

847
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,828
Some things you must keep to yourself

848
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,837
Bangkok Bank

849
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,469
Thanks, Sim!

850
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,304
When everything is done.
I'll pay you back

851
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:26,872
Don't mention it!

852
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,416
Let me give you some shares...

853
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,747
Friends should help each other, right?

854
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,058
Walk with an old woman

855
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,090
Sure

856
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,696
- Not bad.
- Too passe

857
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,370
It looks good!

858
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,575
Try this

859
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,040
Really?

860
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,805
Pretty nice, try it

861
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,109
It looks good

862
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,583
Let's go up and see

863
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,832
Wow, let's go up!

864
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,038
Slowly

865
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:04,438
Alright

866
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,443
My legs are getting stronger

867
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,280
Good. Soon, you won't need crutches!

868
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,146
Let's go up!

869
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,519
Are you tired?

870
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,772
Enough

871
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,244
Not good

872
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:44,244
How old do you think she is?

873
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,780
This one for you

874
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,646
Thanks

875
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,516
- 60
- No way?

876
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,055
Yes!

877
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,352
I don't think so. She must be rich

878
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,654
Rich?

879
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,591
Yes, like a widow

880
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,402
Her boyfriend is cute though.
What a shame!

881
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,876
Do you think he is a gigolo?

882
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,141
That would be cool!

883
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,038
You stupid!

884
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,612
He is on crutches. How can he perform?

885
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,010
A handicapped gigolo is a novelty

886
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,811
What?

887
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,746
You are just jealous of the rich folks

888
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,924
Not even

889
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,557
I would hire a normal one!

890
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,455
Let's go!

891
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,780
She's awake

892
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,620
Are you alright?

893
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,561
Lek, get the nurse for me

894
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:01,888
I'll take a look at your friend

895
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,088
Alright

896
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,356
Take it easy

897
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,640
You're sure you don't want to tell?

898
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,742
I'm sure

899
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,106
I want to leave him a good memory
of me

900
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,442
Why did you come back then?

901
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,879
I couldn't let him go

902
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,687
Another day with him is one more day
with him

903
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,762
Do you think he will reject you?

904
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,192
I don't want anyone to laugh at him

905
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,299
I look like his mother

906
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:43,261
He can find a new girl

907
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:48,740
There was a girl who got 70% of
her skin burnt off

908
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:52,304
Her boyfriend stayed with her
for an entire month

909
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,142
When she woke up...

910
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,008
...she found her face disfigured

911
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,279
But still
I got a wedding invitation from her

912
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,681
If the bride believed in what you
believe in...

913
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,722
...there would be no wedding at all

914
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:10,354
I know this is hard for you

915
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,293
But why not give it a try?

916
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,395
Because...

917
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,334
...the bride was not dying

918
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:37,549
Some women are not meant to have
weddings

919
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:40,359
What are you going to do?

920
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,932
Lek is the one who needs help

921
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,966
Don't worry, he'll be fine

922
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,908
Thanks

923
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,613
I promise you I'll take care of him

924
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:03,641
Promise me
do whatever he asks you to do

925
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,099
I'll see you off

926
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,294
No need

927
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:25,631
Are you going back to Hong Kong?

928
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,205
I don't know

929
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,707
I'll decide when I get to the airport

930
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,705
Lek...

931
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,609
...she won't come back

932
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:40,213
Don't wait for her. Find another girl!

933
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:48,394
Take care of the resort

934
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,457
Goodbye

935
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,761
What's wrong?

936
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,132
Something...

937
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:37,609
Every problem has a solution!

938
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,508
You won't understand

939
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,576
What?

940
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,344
Maybe I can help!

941
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:52,557
No

942
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:56,528
You're up to something?

943
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,839
Hi, how's business?

944
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,413
- Can I play?
- Okay

945
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,772
Dr. Lai, are you with Lek?

946
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,305
Yes, haven't you left?

947
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,270
Do you want to speak with him?

948
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,643
No

949
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,709
Please don't hang up

950
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,420
I want to hear his voice

951
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,452
Alright

952
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:23,471
Everything is over

953
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,145
Nothing matters anymore

954
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,142
The only question is...

955
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:32,716
...how much time I have left

956
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,806
Thank you all for coming today

957
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,511
We'll have a moment's silence

958
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,719
Mrs. Bond, don't worry

959
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,791
We'll take care of Mr. Bond

960
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,260
My wife?

961
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:23,766
Yes!

962
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,364
She's asleep

963
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,632
Really? This early?

964
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,275
We haven't had lunch yet!

965
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:35,949
Some things I don't remember

966
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:37,677
Yes...

967
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,448
I made a bet with her...

968
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,126
...to see who would die first

969
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,026
She's dead?

970
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,030
I lost

971
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:57,460
Just as well. If I went first...

972
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,401
...she'd be lonely

973
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,636
It's useless now. Chuck it

974
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,674
It's alright

975
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,712
Now, there's a handsome guy!

976
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,554
Alright, I'm leaving! Bye!

977
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,544
May 25th, 11 o'clock

978
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,610
Lemon Coffee arrives

979
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,646
she does not smile

980
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,248
I knew Sim was Ching right
from the beginning

981
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:55,354
no one believed me!

982
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:00,795
Ching saved Lek by doing an experiment

983
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:05,539
He recovered but she aged rapidly

984
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,108
He changed me

985
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,743
He brought me to the light

986
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,144
from the dark

987
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,307
I never thought I would trade my youth
to save a man

988
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,449
Never thought of the consequences

989
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:22,388
They say Scorpio women are very selfish

990
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:26,521
I don't want him to see my face so I left

991
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,592
I missed him, so I came back

992
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,462
I have something to tell Lek

993
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,461
But you have to keep the secret

994
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,870
Sure

995
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:42,474
You know how forgetful I am

996
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,506
Promise!

997
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:44,769
Yes!

998
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:50,182
Lek, I'm Ching

999
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,580
I've been back for a long time

1000
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,248
Mr. Bond!

1001
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,655
Mr. Bond!

1002
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,153
Was Ching really back?

1003
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,391
I said it a million times.
No one believed me

1004
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,329
Don't bother me!

1005
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:10,400
I believe! I believe!

1006
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:13,664
Are Sim and Ching the same person?

1007
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:14,966
I don't know!

1008
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,800
Hey, I'm fishing here!

1009
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:19,104
Tell me where she is now

1010
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,208
Where?

1011
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:26,711
If I tell you, will you forget my rent?

1012
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,389
I've never asked you for rent!

1013
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,989
Why don't I give you my resort?

1014
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,057
I don't want it. I have a house

1015
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,621
What? Sim takes care of my house

1016
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,032
She gave me money too!

1017
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,830
Sim is very nice

1018
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,063
Your house... Where is it?

1019
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:46,199
On that island

1020
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:49,941
It's very cheap. I've had it for a long time

1021
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:21,505
Ching!

1022
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:22,935
Wait for me!

1023
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,605
Ching! Don't go!

1024
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,716
Ching... open up! Ching!

1025
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,017
You've got the wrong person!

1026
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,416
I know everything

1027
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:36,919
Would you open up?

1028
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:40,190
Go! I don't want to see you!

1029
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,587
I don't care how others see us

1030
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,388
I don't care how much time is left...

1031
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,324
...as long as we're together

1032
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:49,035
My recovery is meaningless without you!

1033
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,040
You did it for me, I know!

1034
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,435
Please let me be with you!

1035
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:01,205
I don't want your sympathy!

1036
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:04,278
I only want to be with you

1037
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,720
I don't want you to see me die!

1038
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,651
I don't want to!

1039
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,484
I'm staying whether you like it or not

1040
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:15,153
What's the point?

1041
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,432
You know we have no future!

1042
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,565
I don't want you to get hurt!

1043
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,802
Don't do this! Please, go!

1044
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,665
You already know that?

1045
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:35,498
Whatever you did to Ching
I want you to do it one more time

1046
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,372
No! Never!

1047
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,077
I wanted to help you
I never thought Ching would...

1048
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,410
How can I do it again?

1049
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,086
You wanted to save me...

1050
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,282
...and make me happy

1051
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:53,154
I can walk now but I am not happy!

1052
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,457
The experiment was a failure

1053
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,555
It won't succeed in the near future

1054
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,197
You can't risk it

1055
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:02,001
My life was almost taken away anyway

1056
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,098
But you're okay now

1057
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,372
Are you sure I am fully recovered?

1058
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,736
And there'll be no side effects?

1059
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:27,089
Dr. Lai, you don't want...

1060
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,852
...me to live with regrets, do you?

1061
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:31,227
You have to help me

1062
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,833
I want to catch up to her

1063
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,156
Ching!

1064
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,733
Don't go...

1065
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,733
Why did you...
