1
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:06,197
If you don't get a pay rise,
it could mean exploitation.

2
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:11,324
Exploitation makes you feel worthless
and that can lead to suicide.

3
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,319
Suicide means you're gone.
What do you think so far?

4
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:17,080
The missing reporters
are valuable employees.

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,397
I am your boss Laughton's old friend.

6
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:23,036
Stupid conjecture may lead
to your job disappearing!

7
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,605
I'm sorry, I just wanted to get
some background information on them.

8
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,525
Trying to put pressure on me.
I've a job to do.

9
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,641
Divide this.

10
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:41,844
- Miss Yang.
- Miss Yang.

11
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:44,920
You're going to see the boat people
trying to sell...

12
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,964
It's so hot.

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,404
Let me tell you something nice.
Watching them makes me very happy.

14
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,045
They want us...

15
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,596
Right. Tell Tong
to drive us around tomorrow.

16
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,007
You tell him.

17
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:59,601
He's your man. You tell him.

18
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:01,279
Have you finished?

19
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,005
He hopes we'll go easy on him.

20
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,476
But we've never been hard on him.

21
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:09,527
Hey, Tong,
take Mr Wong sightseeing tomorrow.

22
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,087
What about a boat trip?

23
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:15,764
Whatever! Just don't be seen.

24
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:20,520
Have you finished?
We've got business to discuss.

25
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,397
- Call Inspector Ho for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:34,485
Tomorrow we'll take a drive
to the Peak, and then the Gardens.

27
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:37,002
Don't forget the camera.
We'll have...

28
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,636
Don't walk about like that,
you're making me ill.

29
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,127
I want to.

30
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,322
Now don't forget.

31
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:47,956
The boat people who we left
asked us to entertain...

32
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:49,685
Mr Kuo, please.

33
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,880
Boss, the telephone.

34
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:59,078
You're using my shoe as an ashtray?

35
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:04,038
Mr Wong wants me to get
Chief Inspector Ho.

36
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:08,484
Where can I find
an Inspector Ho for him?

37
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:15,040
- What's wrong?
- I thought you'd fixed everything.

38
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:18,321
- Is that my call?
- Yes.

39
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:12,596
Fixed.

40
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,766
I'll go clean the car.

41
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:29,480
- Are Filipino maids popular here?
- It's becoming fashionable.

42
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,956
They're hard to come by.

43
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:40,487
There is so little money.
Why should they have first choice?

44
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,844
Fei, you can take it, but we can't.

45
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:47,840
You've helped us for so many years.
We won't forget it, will we?

46
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,839
You can have anything you want.
Just say the word.

47
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,804
I thank you for your goodwill.

48
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:56,243
Have faith in me.
Better days are ahead. Let's go.

49
00:03:58,527 --> 00:03:59,482
Let's go.

50
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,047
Where's Snake Ming?

51
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:04,119
He left without saying
where he was going.

52
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,118
- Have they found Wong?
- Not yet.

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,243
Who did you call?

54
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,636
My cousin,
he works for the shipping company.

55
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,605
He's checking the passenger list.

56
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,681
- Inspector.
- Where did you go?

57
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,076
The Five Continents Hotel,
Luk Kwok Hotel...

58
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,444
Is our Mr Wong at the Five Continents
or Luk Kwok?

59
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,995
- Neither.
- Then why did you go there?

60
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,362
Then later I found out
he was at King's.

61
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,245
Then why did you go
to the other places?

62
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:30,239
- I've got it.
- Got what?

63
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,525
Wong's already here,
so I'll check the hotel.

64
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,998
Who told you to check on Wong?
Find the reporters for me.

65
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:39,558
Why do I have to do everything?

66
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:59,116
I've never lied in my life.

67
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm really scared.

68
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,757
We mustn't disappoint them.

69
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:21,487
Uncle, you're more than an hour late.
Tiger means business.

70
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,404
Do you think Tiger will trick us?

71
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,763
- Our boys will be watching.
- I have to get my lucky rose.

72
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:34,840
- Tiger's been waiting all morning.
- We'll invite him for lunch.

73
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:37,565
He wants to see you now.

74
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,036
I must get my rose first.

75
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,922
Boss.

76
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,007
A couple of Tiger's stooges.

77
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,203
They've got some nerve,
walking in here.

78
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,002
What's up?

79
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,716
- Our boss doesn't like waiting.
- So I'll invite him for dinner.

80
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,956
Freeze!

81
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,357
- Stay there!
- Come with us, Tiger's orders.

82
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,527
Look, guys... this is our turf.

83
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,926
I'll go with them.
You and the boys...

84
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:14,995
You dare make trouble here?
Tie them up!

85
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,686
I'll buy my rose,
then I'll see your boss.

86
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:19,757
Let's go.

87
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,560
Tiger will get you for this.

88
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,846
So you're planning
to issue stocks here?

89
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:28,406
That's the idea.

90
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,205
The door! When?

91
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,281
Very soon, I hope.

92
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,083
Gentlemen.

93
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,763
We're associates of Mr Wong's.
Is he in?

94
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:44,083
- Mr Wong is not here right now.
- We were told he was in his suite.

95
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,199
He's breakfasting right now.

96
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,085
- We're good friends of his.
- Long time associates.

97
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,643
Just the man. These are
Mr Wong's business associates.

98
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,446
- What now?
- I don't do anything illegal.

99
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,360
That's kidnapping.

100
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,915
- Close the door.
- How many have you tied up now?

101
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,243
You own a steel foundry as well?

102
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,839
Good morning, good morning.

103
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,406
You're very early today.

104
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,603
Mr Wong, is everything
to your liking?

105
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,245
Fine, very comfortable.

106
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,959
Mr Wong likes it here.

107
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:27,517
- Is everything OK, cousins?
- Of course.

108
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,598
Fresh roses. They're lovely.

109
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,277
A rose to bring you luck.

110
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,847
Why do you give him a rose?

111
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:37,440
Tradition, it's a family custom.

112
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,995
- A tradition.
- A family tradition.

113
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,727
- Wait! Come back down!
- Not so loud.

114
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,321
Inspector Ho is coming up
with two others.

115
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,875
Mr Kuo, an urgent call for you.

116
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,366
I'll take it there.

117
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:56,121
Inspector Ho is on his way up.

118
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,879
He's already in the lift.

119
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:00,757
What do we do now?

120
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,079
Cousin. Cousin.

121
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,402
He's calling you.

122
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,081
- You forgot our business deal.
- Today?

123
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,361
They're on the phone.

124
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:15,208
I'd completely forgotten about it.

125
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,999
He's so busy.

126
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,920
Give me some clothes.

127
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:24,646
Inspector Ho's on his way up.

128
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,557
This way. Take this.

129
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:29,717
And this.

130
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:39,039
Go on, follow him. Inside.

131
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,920
Mr Wong, sir.

132
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,962
Tell them I'll be home by noon.

133
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,606
Mr Wong, I'd recognise you anywhere.

134
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,767
You are sharp.
You must be the famous Inspector Ho.

135
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,566
At your service, sir.

136
00:08:56,647 --> 00:09:00,163
Have you been that busy
you couldn't come to the dock?

137
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,284
Oh, but I was. Let me explain.

138
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,437
Come with me. I'm on my way out.

139
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:07,203
- Butler, that's all.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:12,802
- Who are they?
- My assistants.

141
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:16,239
They've gone.

142
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,320
That's that taken care of!

143
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,959
Tiger is on our backs
and you're still prancing about!

144
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:35,642
It may not bother you,
but it bothers me.

145
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,956
You taught me to how to dress,

146
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:43,200
how to walk, how to talk,
how to negotiate, how to fight.

147
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,643
You treat me like a puppet.
Aren't you bothered about that?

148
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:48,002
He's right. The car.

149
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,160
- That's what you should be doing.
- That's what you think.

150
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:54,637
- What do you think you should do?
- What I'm doing right now.

151
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,719
- This makes you happy?
- Do I look happy?

152
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,721
- Continue with what you're doing.
- I will.

153
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,924
- Go on, then.
- I would if I knew what I was doing.

154
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:07,959
Imported goods are excellent here.

155
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,277
- Have you got any currency?
- Not yet.

156
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:12,484
- I'll lend you some.
- How kind.

157
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,365
- When are you floating your company?
- Soon.

158
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,440
He's worth a fortune.
He even owns a goldmine.

159
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,245
And the shipyard and the steelworks.

160
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,445
Go and find the reporters.
I'll handle this.

161
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,201
Mr Wong, how much
are the shares worth?

162
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:29,927
One dollar.
$2.80 once they're floated.

163
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,838
Double your selling price?

164
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,919
- There are no outside buyers.
- Can I buy some?

165
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
You're not an outsider, nephew.

166
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,718
Nephew, I'm one of them.

167
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:48,878
Inspector Ho, Chairman of
the planning committee, police club.

168
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:53,518
That's the police club.
I'm in charge of fundraising.

169
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:57,681
Nephew, your charitable deeds
are praiseworthy indeed.

170
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,646
- Very good, very good.
- Thank you.

171
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,766
Are you all right?

172
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:13,837
I'm just sighing.

173
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:17,807
It's no use sighing.
You must enjoy life.

174
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,039
I'm sighing
because the club needs $80,000,

175
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,960
but we've only raised $15,000
in 3 years.

176
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:27,199
That's only about $60,000
short of the target.

177
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:31,280
After the stocks are issued,
I'll see what I can do to help.

178
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:33,404
Mr Wong... I'm sorry.

179
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,240
I know all it takes
is one word from you.

180
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,401
You're so clumsy.

181
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,956
My son will treat Belle well.

182
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:53,801
How can I say no to you?

183
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:58,039
Thank you for being my guide
for the day.

184
00:11:58,128 --> 00:11:59,481
It's nothing.

185
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:03,038
Make a note of what I bought.
I'll pay you back soon.

186
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,686
Consider it a deposit.

187
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,917
Deposit?

188
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,963
You promised to sell me some shares.

189
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:12,677
- Of course! Take these to my room.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,679
Shall we sign the papers upstairs?

191
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:19,761
No, let's say your office tomorrow.
The shares will be ready then.

192
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:20,883
Fine.

193
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,878
Mr Wong, I'll accompany you
to your room.

194
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,798
- There's no need.
- I insist.

195
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,561
I'd really like a cup of coffee
right now.

196
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,526
- Let's have a coffee, then.
- Fine.

197
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,277
- No coffee?
- I'd better go back to my room.

198
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,517
Back to your room.

199
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,963
Why don't you call the station?

200
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:49,677
- Call the station?
- In case they're looking for you.

201
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,281
- It's all right.
- Call to please me, then.

202
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,886
- I will.
- I'll wait here.

203
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,362
- I'll go to the ladies.
- I'll come.

204
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,279
- No, you go to your mother.
- OK.

205
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,167
- Why is he tagging along?
- He wants to.

206
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,477
- Don't let him.
- I'm doing my best.

207
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,396
Luming, let's go.

208
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:17,362
- What's up?
- Inspector Ho. Sort him out.

209
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,566
I'll be back soon.

210
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,642
Kwong-On Bank, please.

211
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,879
Uncle, why are you here?

212
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:30,802
Admiring the lights.

213
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,798
Inspector Ho, Inspector Ho.

214
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,405
- You?
- There's a fight outside.

215
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,285
Can't you see I'm busy?

216
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,244
But you are the inspector.

217
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,159
Don't you lecture me. Yes?

218
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,682
Kwong-On Bank? Go away!

219
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,167
Sorry, not you.

220
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:48,124
- They're still here. Are you busy?
- No.

221
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,641
Then join me.

222
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:54,442
Why is he here?

223
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:55,847
Think of something.

224
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,124
I couldn't find you earlier.

225
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:02,078
I have something to say.
Where's Chen Wah?

226
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,999
He's just gone to the restroom.

227
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,766
We can't leave yet. Come, come.

228
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,566
Sit down and speak slowly.

229
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,637
I've no time.

230
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,240
Floating in three months!

231
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:14,003
They didn't sell as well
as they thought? Thank you.

232
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,560
- Excuse me.
- One moment. Yes, sir?

233
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,603
- Is Mr Wong living here?
- Yes.

234
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:21,642
Is that...?

235
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,365
He's over there.

236
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,047
- A friend of yours?
- A small business matter.

237
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,276
Hey!

238
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,286
Nothing. I'm rich!

239
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:39,518
Finished work already?
Mr Kao has an easy life.

240
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,882
- Sit down for a chat.
- I'm still busy.

241
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:47,996
Inspector Ho? Is your eye better?

242
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,964
- Who are you?
- I hit you in the eye.

243
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,164
- You're confessing?
- Not exactly, I want your other eye.

244
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,917
Go, I'll chase you
to the ends of the Earth.

245
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,365
Stop, I'll get you!

246
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:02,597
What's the matter?

247
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:04,007
What's the matter?

248
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:08,276
I think the gangsters are fighting.
I'll take my leave of you.

249
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:10,085
Have dinner with us tonight.

250
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,486
We'll be there.

251
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,518
I'm not going to talk business
any more. I'll stay and have tea.

252
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:20,441
- Don't bring them here for tea.
- It's difficult to control them.

253
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:23,200
- You'd better stay here.
- Sit down again?

254
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,959
Take them to the room.

255
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:30,078
I'd prefer to stay
and have tea and stay for dinner too.

256
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,361
All right.

257
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,119
Mr Kuo, the press.

258
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,276
- How did they get in?
- Bribery, I suppose.

259
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,359
And that's why I came to Hong Kong.

260
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,484
Is that so?
A photo, if you don't mind?

261
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,762
Fine, fine.

262
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,566
- Mr Wong.
- Chen Wah, I'm glad you're here.

263
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,798
Come, let's have a group photo.
Everybody join in.

264
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:54,638
- A photo, Dad?
- This way.

265
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,719
Good. Altogether. Altogether.

266
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,404
Ready, set...

267
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,682
Thank you.

268
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,125
Auntie, come and sit down.

269
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:11,806
- A moment. What paper are you with?
- The Sun.

270
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,003
- When will it be published?
- Tomorrow.

271
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,357
Get the flower, then we can go.

272
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:28,045
- Good luck.
- You're very busy.

273
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:31,119
- Do you really believe that?
- It's not a matter of belief.

274
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,562
Why haven't you introduced
your friend?

275
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,115
Why does he hide behind you?

276
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,962
He's shy. You must excuse me now.

277
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:43,199
- Chen Wah, I want to say something.
- What is it?

278
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:47,758
Madam Kao has consented
to a Shanghai wedding.

279
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:52,682
In Shanghai! Congratulations!

280
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,840
Madam Kao, thank you
for your hospitality

281
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,838
and consent to this marriage.

282
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,485
You're very kind.

283
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:02,401
My trip is so brief
and I've missed so many people.

284
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:06,799
I suggest an engagement party
with all the Hong Kong dignitaries

285
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,161
and your friends.

286
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,080
What do you think?

287
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:13,523
- Chen Wah, what do you think?
- Me? I've no objection.

288
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,159
Then it's settled.

289
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,682
Good idea.
Kill two birds with one stone.

290
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,486
Mr Wong, please, excuse me.

291
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:25,446
Chen Wah, for an engagement in Hong
Kong, all the VIPs must be invited.

292
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,085
All right. You take care of it.

293
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,759
Did you get that?

294
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:35,441
Western style is more grand.
Eastern style is more relaxed.

295
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:38,042
Do your Chinese friends
outnumber foreign friends?

296
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,357
We have more Chinese
than foreign friends.

297
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:45,120
Cousin, cousin.

298
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,766
He's calling you.

299
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:50,602
Sorry, shall we discuss
the guest list?

300
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,518
Luming, come here.

301
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,598
We need to talk about it.

302
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,200
- Sorry.
- No, no, go.

303
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,243
Sit for a while.

304
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,799
Madam Kao, any other ideas?

305
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,160
Lots of foreign friends?

306
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:12,360
How are we to get VIPs to attend?

307
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:15,838
Nothing is impossible to you.

308
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,679
Thanks for the confidence.

309
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:21,204
Mr Wong is making such a big fuss
about everything.

310
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,279
It's all your fault.

311
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,482
Simple, you said.

312
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,163
Just get a suite, buy some
new clothes, a little make-up.

313
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:30,124
It's one thing after another.

314
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:35,043
Kidnapping reporters and businessmen.
Beating up police. This is a mess.

315
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,244
But you just said you were happy.

316
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:38,396
Shut up!

317
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,762
You started all this. Fix it!

318
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:46,762
It's a bit late to start blaming me.
You helped Madam Kao as well.

319
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,884
- Helping people is a good thing.
- Correct.

320
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:53,562
- But you must know your limits!
- You're just making it worse!

321
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,956
You are all right.
It's me that's wrong.

322
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,118
This is not a mistake.

323
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,883
It is. I have too much sympathy,
but not enough ability.

324
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,641
Trying to help Madam Kao
perform miracles.

325
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:09,119
You're right. I don't measure up.

326
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:15,485
Please tell her we've done all
we can. I've no more to give.

327
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:16,602
At this stage?

328
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,076
- When should I tell her?
- You'll ruin the marriage.

329
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,284
- Imagine we never helped her.
- That's rich.

330
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,882
Yes, I'm getting out now.

331
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,243
I won't tell her, I'm not so cruel.

332
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:27,602
- You...
- I won't.

333
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:28,677
- Tell her.
- No.

334
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,087
I'll tell her, then.

335
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:34,477
Uncle.

336
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:39,165
Auntie, Dad.

337
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,840
- We're not interrupting?
- Not at all.

338
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:47,195
- What's the matter?
- Mum says you're very kind.

339
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:51,886
You are very big hearted, so...

340
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:55,923
So, we'd like you to be godfather
to our first baby.

341
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,362
- Godfather?
- You wouldn't refuse us?

342
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,566
We won't keep you any longer.

343
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,161
Auntie.

344
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:06,835
Bye-bye, Uncle.

345
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:22,683
Godfather, what an idea.

346
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:26,598
Get all the bosses
and their women to pose as VIPs.

347
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,883
Why are you staring?
Is it a bad idea?

348
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,436
It's a good idea.
But they won't look the part.

349
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,517
Dress them up.

350
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:39,075
- I'll teach them etiquette.
- I'll do make-up.

351
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:41,887
- Go to work. I'll make some calls.
- Let's go.

352
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:43,446
Do you know what you're doing?

353
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:47,283
- What's up?
- He tried to run away.

354
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:48,402
Run away?

355
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:52,321
I can't cope. I just want to go home.

356
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:58,158
- How are you going to get there?
- By boat or train.

357
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,965
What about in a wheelchair?

358
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,603
I'm not going. I have work to do.

359
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:09,286
Let's go.

360
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,638
Everyone's assignment
is written here.

361
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:14,606
This is yours, remember it.
This is yours.

362
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,757
Take it easy.

363
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:19,920
I might be pregnant
and have to have an abortion.

364
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:23,364
You don't even know
who the father is. Stop fidgeting.

365
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:27,123
Please, you're ladies now.
You must be civil to each other.

366
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,357
She's always bad mouthing others.

367
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,837
She already has a gut,
and she's still eating.

368
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,043
Breathe in.

369
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,561
What are you looking at?

370
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,802
Straighten up. Remember your lines.

371
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,759
People! People!

372
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:50,003
Tong gave each of you
a piece of paper with your part.

373
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,999
Your name and what to say.

374
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:58,276
Remember your lines. Speak Mandarin.
Mr Wong is from Shanghai.

375
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,121
Don't start yet.

376
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,998
Just remember your part
and act like ladies and gentlemen.

377
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:11,840
Why should we?
He might be more vulgar than I am.

378
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,441
Who are you?

379
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,007
The Secretary of Education.

380
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:17,682
Education?
How could he be more vulgar than you?

381
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,281
- Why?
- That's why.

382
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,995
Your face doesn't fit the part.
Who's the Chief Warden?

383
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:28,397
Who's got that paper?

384
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:31,923
You're the Chief Warden.
Why didn't you reply?

385
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:34,158
I don't know. I can't read.

386
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:35,999
Can't read?! What do you mean?

387
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,967
All right, you be the warden
and you be the secretary.

388
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,161
- You must be crazy!
- What's the matter?

389
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,806
He felt me up.

390
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,196
Help me out here, be civilised.

391
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:50,402
It was all a mistake.

392
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:55,280
- Bastard, molesting my bird!
- You dare to hit me?

393
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:57,880
Don't fight!

394
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,639
Let me go!

395
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:00,843
Stop it!

396
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,325
Stop acting like this!

397
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:08,326
Stop fighting!

398
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,677
Listen to me! Stop fighting!

399
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,286
Listen to me.

400
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:25,404
Aren't you tired
of all this fighting and killing?

401
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,276
This may be your only chance
in life to do a good deed.

402
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,043
You might not understand
why you have to help Madam Kao.

403
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:39,040
Just think - when you're old
and your children ask,

404
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:42,722
"Dad, what are your proudest
achievements in your life?"

405
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:44,605
What should you say?

406
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,838
Do you tell them you were a gangster,

407
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,237
opening brothels, casinos,
racketeering...

408
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,727
Does this make you proud?

409
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:56,840
This may be the only thing
you can tell them.

410
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:01,523
- Do you understand?
- No!

411
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,887
Tong, Tong!

412
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,639
I'm here!

413
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,482
I told you they weren't to carry guns.

414
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:09,602
I did tell them.

415
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:12,406
Ask who else is carrying a gun!

416
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,478
Who's still got a gun?

417
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,682
Me!

418
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:21,364
Take all their guns away!

419
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:23,438
I told you not to and you still did.

420
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,042
"The Ritz"

421
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,000
Here's $5,000 from the Ho's
and $5,000 from me.

422
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:46,839
That's not too greedy, is it?

423
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:51,045
That's not greedy.
I'll give you the shares.

424
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:52,924
- Do you need to count it?
- No need.

425
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,840
Thank you.
When did the two reporters leave?

426
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,521
I went back to work.
I don't know when they left.

427
00:24:58,607 --> 00:24:59,562
Sign here.

428
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,241
Mr Wong. Will there be anything else?

429
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:05,365
I'm going to a party tonight.

430
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:08,678
- Who's that?
- Mr Wong, the Shanghai magnate.

431
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,440
- He's the multi-millionaire, Mr Wong?
- Yes.

432
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:13,677
Thank you.

433
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:18,284
Thank you, Mr Wong.
Thanks for looking out for me.

434
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:20,802
No need. You've been most attentive.

435
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,276
If we don't look out for each other,
who will?

436
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,199
How much did we spend last time?

437
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:27,404
- Don't worry about it.
- I insist!

438
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,642
Here's $2,000 for your trouble.

439
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,400
- So much money?
- Keep it.

440
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:36,883
It's chicken feed to me,
but it's a quite a bundle to you.

441
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:42,285
Remember, once the shares hit
two dollars, sell them.

442
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:44,085
- Double?
- Don't be too greedy.

443
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:46,401
I'll be rich.

444
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:49,962
I can't believe this bunch of paper
is so valuable.

445
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,924
It's only paper.

446
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,646
Remember, these shares
are in high demand.

447
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,878
Don't tell anyone I gave them to you.

448
00:25:56,968 --> 00:26:00,199
Remember, once they've doubled,
sell immediately.

449
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,160
I'm leaving now.

450
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:04,195
30,000 shares?

451
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,883
Mr Wong. Mr Wong, sir.

452
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:12,324
What about the police club?

453
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:15,047
Oh, that?

454
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:19,156
It's a good thing
I have one cheque left.

455
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:22,523
Thanks very much, sir.
Spending more money.

456
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,446
There.

457
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:26,677
$80,000?

458
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,325
That's too much!

459
00:26:28,408 --> 00:26:32,036
- It's only $65,000.
- That was my last cheque.

460
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:34,687
The next time I'm in town,
I'll write you another.

461
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,087
I'll rip this one up.

462
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,317
No need, I'll give you the change.

463
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:42,116
Change?
Where are you going to get $15,000?

464
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,561
I have it.

465
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:45,047
Can you keep a secret?

466
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:47,357
I've got some evidence money.

467
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:50,955
I'll get it for you.

468
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,357
Mr Wong, there's $13,000.

469
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:02,197
Add my $2,000, that makes $15,000.

470
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,801
Nephew, you are so clever.

471
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:10,165
Thank you on behalf of the Ho's,
the police and myself.

472
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:11,999
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,637
Such small things,
unworthy of mention.

474
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,436
Let go.

475
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,360
Till we meet again.

476
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,360
Mr Wong, let me see you out.

477
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:26,766
There's no need.
Look after your shares.

478
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,405
Don't let anybody see them.

479
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:30,686
Remember, double.

480
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,722
Double.

481
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,081
Lucky me.

482
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:54,802
Hey, you, stop!

483
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:57,601
Me? What's the matter?

484
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:01,803
Don't move.
Watch him and don't let him go.

485
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,958
I'm a friend of Inspector Ho.

486
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:06,516
Some friend! Great! Watch him.

487
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:08,316
So that's that.

488
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,442
Chief Inspector Ho.

489
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,681
What have you been doing?

490
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:16,316
There are so many missing persons
and you haven't found any!

491
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:17,682
We've got some leads.

492
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:22,319
The gang who's doing the kidnapping
is different from the extortion gang.

493
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,959
- What's the difference?
- Well...

494
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:26,606
Commandant.

495
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:27,882
Chief Inspector.

496
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,436
- Why didn't you knock?
- It's very urgent.

497
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:34,601
This discussion is very urgent.
We haven't received any ransom notes.

498
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:37,441
Fool! Even HQ has heard about this.

499
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:42,840
Find all the missing persons in three
days or one of us gets fired. See?

500
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:46,918
Get the car ready!

501
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:50,839
- Damn him!
- Chief Inspector!

502
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:52,959
Did you send men to the Ritz?

503
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:54,639
I did so, sir!

504
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:58,965
- Remember, you are responsible.
- Understood, sir.

505
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:00,003
Idiot!

506
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,120
It's me.

507
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,085
- You come in without knocking again?
- It's very urgent.

508
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,682
Urgent? Where have you been all day?

509
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,646
- I went to King's Hotel.
- I didn't tell you to go there.

510
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:15,003
But I found something out
about Mr Wong.

511
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,875
I tell you do one thing, you do
another. You disobey my orders.

512
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:22,199
- Hear me out first.
- You don't respect my authority.

513
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,243
But...

514
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,718
Why did you disobey my orders?
Don't you know my boss is after me?

515
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,276
- I know...
- Then why don't you go after them?

516
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,485
I am about to be fired -
and the rest of you, too.

517
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,603
Nobody is looking out for me.

518
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,246
Why are you here?

519
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,280
Obstructing justice.

520
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:41,164
That's a capital offence!

521
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,158
- Is that true?
- He's crazy.

522
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:46,239
Any leads on the missing persons?

523
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,842
- No, but we found Mr Wong...
- Nothing?

524
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:52,159
After all this time?

525
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:56,036
Idiot! And your mother
asked me to promote you!

526
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:01,155
Promote you to the heavens. What's
this about Mr Wong, then? Speak!

527
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:04,285
I found out he's not
one of Shanghai's ten richest men.

528
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:09,043
He isn't. I suppose you are.
Do you look the part?

529
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:12,563
Just say who he is. Go on! Go on!

530
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:14,923
"Bastard!"

531
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,965
Not only is he
one of Shanghai's richest men,

532
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:21,084
but he's one of the richest men
in all China!

533
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:25,641
Well done, well done,
that's very good indeed.

534
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,003
I don't need you to tell me that!
Get out!

535
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:30,967
"I must get away."

536
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:32,727
Chief Inspector.

537
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:35,481
- You still didn't knock?
- Can I take some holiday?

538
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,843
- Holiday?
- Mother is sick.

539
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,360
- Is you father sick, too?
- No.

540
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:42,008
Get out! Don't ever come back!

541
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:49,283
- You look down. Was it that bad?
- I'm going on holiday.

542
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:52,325
Be smart, like me.
I've got some new leads.

543
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:55,682
Work hard and you'll get there.

544
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:59,123
Mr Wong, you're still here?

545
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:04,682
- I'll just see him off.
- Take Mr Wong back to the hotel.

546
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:08,362
I will, I will. I'll take him
wherever he wants to go.

547
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:11,883
Bye-bye, Mr Wong. Walk carefully.

548
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,246
Where are you taking me?

549
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:17,160
I know where I'm going.
I don't know about you.

550
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:21,004
Chief Inspector!

551
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:27,085
- Why does nobody knock any more?
- Sorry Chief.

552
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,637
I saw Kuo's men with guns
at the Ritz. Something's up.

553
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:32,002
Who are they?

554
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:37,199
Thieves, criminals,
all those on our wanted list.

555
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,442
Then why did you leave?

556
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:43,200
Get some men over there
and arrest them!

557
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:45,280
I'll get the warrant.

558
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:50,078
Why are you standing there?
Give me my hat.

559
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:56,048
What are you all staring at?
Follow us.

560
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:58,566
And that's the truth?

561
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:02,561
Yes. Apparently,
their people are at the Ritz.

562
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:04,445
What about the two boys we sent?

563
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,847
No news whatsoever.

564
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:09,762
It backs up what I said.
Kuo did take two of your men.

565
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,440
Why are you doing this?

566
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,517
I just want the killings to stop.

567
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:19,200
One, two, three, bow.

568
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:20,879
That was great.

569
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:23,801
This is a dress rehearsal.
Luming will be Wong.

570
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,838
Make an effort.

571
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,922
I'm Mr Wong. And you are?

572
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:34,125
I'm Miss Foxy,
the Rotary Chair person.

573
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:41,643
You're Miss Fox, the Rotary Chair
person. What is this Foxy?

574
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,002
That was my Mandarin.

575
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,361
Stick to Cantonese.

576
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:49,722
- I'm Mr Wong, and you are?
- I'm the Governor of Hong Kong.

577
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:55,801
You're not the Governor, you're
the Minister for Transportation.

578
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,526
I want to be Governor.

579
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:59,200
Why?

580
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:03,326
If he's Police Commissioner,
I've got to be Governor.

581
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:05,045
I must be Governor.

582
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,879
Don't take it so seriously.

583
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,959
I must outrank him. I'm the Governor.

584
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:13,521
He insists on being Governor.

585
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,438
Fine! Let him be Governor, then.

586
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,484
- Run through it again.
- One more time. Please, cooperate.

587
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,683
Boss, Mrs Shun wants to see you.

588
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,526
Once again. One, two, three and bow.

589
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:32,558
Boss, the police
have surrounded the place.

590
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:34,205
- Right outside?
- Yes.

591
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,762
What is it?

592
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,802
- The police have us surrounded.
- Police? How come?

593
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:55,119
They're waiting for Inspector Ho
to come with a warrant.

594
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,802
He must think
we're starting a gang war.

595
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:01,197
We can't leave and Madam Kao
is waiting. It's nearly time.

596
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,437
Oh, dear,
we'll be found out for sure.

597
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:04,927
This is bad.

598
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,406
The poor woman.

599
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:08,444
- What shall we do?
- Search me.

600
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:11,325
- What shall we do?
- He's the boss.

601
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,364
Come on, think!

602
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:14,517
What shall we do?

603
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:17,280
I'll go to the courthouse
to get Inspector Ho.

604
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:19,757
- You can't go out. What can you do?
- I don't know.

605
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:21,405
We'll have to play it by ear.

606
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,366
I'll go out the back way.

607
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:35,600
- What are you doing?
- The drinks.

608
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:38,043
Forget that. Go up and practise.

609
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:42,761
Tell Uncle I'm going to court.
I'll contact him when I meet Ho.

610
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,360
Tell him to wait for me.

611
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:49,721
Move on.

612
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,045
What are you doing there?

613
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,602
- What should we do?
- Ring Fei.

614
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:09,919
Push harder.

615
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,563
The boys must be looking for me.
Thanks.

616
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:16,807
He's gone to the courthouse
to get Ho.

617
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,039
- All set?
- Yeah, we know what to do.

618
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:26,717
What's that?

619
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:32,039
They found the bodies of your men.
Kuo had them killed.

620
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:37,245
He killed my men?
Where is he? What's he up to?

621
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:39,477
He's gone to get Inspector Ho.

622
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:41,642
For what purpose?

623
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:45,003
Maybe he's working with the police.

624
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:48,766
Damn it! Let's go!

625
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:01,083
I've got to leave now.
I'll look your boss up after this.

626
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:09,360
- What now?
- I'm hungry.

627
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,165
- Me, too.
- Let's go.

628
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,844
I can't find him anywhere.

629
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:22,004
There he is. Let's go!

630
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,880
- My leg!
- My hand!

631
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,758
- You broke my pots! Pay up...
- Damn you!

632
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:14,036
Hold it! Don't run!

633
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:03,758
We've got you now.

634
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,883
Get ready.
The guests will be here soon.

635
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:09,038
Make sure there are enough drinks.

636
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:12,119
I'll see to it. Relax.

637
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:14,802
Problems?

638
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:19,325
No, they're rehearsing the entrance.
There's plenty of time. Don't worry.

639
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:28,042
- Where is he?
- Up there.

640
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,923
- Get him down.
- Bring him down.

641
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,960
Tiger, sorry
for not having tea with you.

642
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,204
Damn it! I liked you.

643
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:53,482
I promise to have tea with you,
but you've got to let me go now.

644
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,637
It's very urgent.

645
00:39:54,727 --> 00:40:00,120
Let you go? I sent two boys
to invite you to tea.

646
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:05,679
- You killed them. Why?
- I didn't. I set them free.

647
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,040
Where's my gun?

648
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:14,441
Didn't you hear what I said? I didn't
kill them. They'll be back soon.

649
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:19,120
Brother Fei, tell him
I didn't kill them.

650
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,005
But you did.
The bodies have been found.

651
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,839
That's impossible.

652
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:28,522
Tiger, don't believe him. He's evil.
He's making fools of us both.

653
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:32,726
He never liked me anyway.
They'll be back soon, believe me.

654
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,605
Where are they, then?

655
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:40,043
- They must be on their way back.
- To avenge their deaths?

656
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,846
Damn it, don't string me along!

657
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:44,886
Tiger, believe me.
I didn't kill them!

658
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:46,481
Tiger! Tiger!

659
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:50,923
Can you kill me later? I've got
urgent business to attend to.

660
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:53,124
Shut up! I'll kill you now.

661
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,686
Here they are.

662
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,357
I told you I didn't kill them.

663
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:05,245
- Why aren't you two dead already?
- Not yet. He saved us.

664
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:07,967
- He set us free.
- Damn it, you scared me.

665
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,607
Tiger, I told you
I didn't lie to you.

666
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,521
So, you creep,
you want to be the boss?

667
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:18,919
Tiger, I did it for you.
I would make a much better boss.

668
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:22,079
There's no way you could be better!
Release him!

669
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,521
Take it easy!

670
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:27,919
Tiger, I hope you understand.
I did this for your own good.

671
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:32,365
From now on,
keep out of our family affairs.

672
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:37,521
Your family affairs! No problem.
I got him. Stop him if you can.

673
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,839
- Tiger, I will certainly have tea with you.
- Ok.

674
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:48,039
Brother Fei, as you pointed out,
this is a family affair.

675
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:49,401
Let's go and sort it out.

676
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,557
I've got urgent business, excuse me.

677
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:56,806
Don't think
you're going to leave here alive.

678
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:01,840
Tiger.

679
00:42:01,927 --> 00:42:06,125
I won't interfere, but rules are
rules. I'll keep the guns for you.

680
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:15,002
Canton kid, have no fear.
I'll make sure there's no foul play.

681
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,683
But I might be dead by then.

682
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:23,638
Get him and the factory is yours.

683
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:25,995
Get him!

684
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:31,283
Out of the way!

685
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,520
Brother, you're good.

686
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:46,520
Stop. I've got to go.
Can we finish this later?

687
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,757
Grab him.

688
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:13,882
He's over there!

689
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:53,241
Pull the rope.

690
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,320
Thank you, Buddha!

691
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,235
Don't jump!

692
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:48,797
I told you not to.

693
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:01,965
Stop fighting!

694
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,886
Don't go away. It's your turn now.

695
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,007
You were great.

696
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:22,682
Brother Chen Wah.

697
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:26,521
You've done one thing right,
the factory hands are behind you.

698
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:29,725
You can have the factory
and we can be family again.

699
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:33,645
- Thank you, Chen Wah.
- I've got to go now.

700
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:36,561
Canton kid, I really admire you.

701
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,561
Your family affair is settled.
We've done our bit. Let's be friends.

702
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:42,127
I don't have time.

703
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:47,839
Still thinking of the beating
I gave you? Hit me back, then.

704
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,280
Go on, don't be afraid.

705
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:56,325
- Stand back!
- Don't move!

706
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,637
Great fistwork.

707
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:04,325
Canton kid, you fight really well.
Now, go on, slap me.

708
00:49:16,607 --> 00:49:18,643
Good friends we shall be.

709
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:21,241
Friend, I've got to go now,
urgent business.

710
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:24,285
If anything happens, count me in.

711
00:49:24,368 --> 00:49:25,561
Count your ass.

712
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:27,205
What's the hurry?

713
00:49:27,288 --> 00:49:28,846
Shandong man, lend me your car.

714
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:32,124
- What?
- I'm borrowing your car.

715
00:49:34,968 --> 00:49:37,322
- How was that?
- Perfect, just right.

716
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:42,003
Chief Inspector, you're wanted.

717
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,405
Inspector Ho.

718
00:49:44,968 --> 00:49:46,878
Go out and keep watch.

719
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:49,686
Inspector, take your men away.
Inspector, please...

720
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,087
How did you get out?

721
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:52,601
- Inspector...
- Stand up!

722
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:56,646
Inspector Ho, please, remove them.
We're doing a good thing at the Ritz.

723
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,763
Putting you lot away
is the good thing.

724
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:04,480
What are you doing here?
I told you to find the missing men.

725
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:05,842
Sir...

726
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:08,487
The Attorney General
just chewed my ass!

727
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:12,083
From now on, your only job
is to find the missing persons

728
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,646
or you'll go missing!

729
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:17,485
I know the whereabouts
of the missing persons.

730
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,999
- Who's this?
- The owner of the Ritz.

731
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,043
Is that true?

732
00:50:22,128 --> 00:50:24,322
Four reporters, two businessmen,
right?

733
00:50:24,408 --> 00:50:27,002
Yes, this is why I brought him
to see you.

734
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:28,236
Follow me.

735
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:30,196
You too.

736
00:50:34,328 --> 00:50:38,206
The missing persons' case is most
urgent, we must deal with it first.

737
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,240
Order them to search the Ritz.

738
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:44,445
No, they're getting ready
for Madam Kao's party.

739
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:45,677
It's an order.

740
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:47,723
The missing are not in the Ritz.

741
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:49,035
Where are they?

742
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:53,120
Free my friends and I'll tell you.
First let me make a call.

743
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:56,438
- I can't...
- If I don't, they won't free them.

744
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,200
Things could get ugly.

745
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,677
- All right, make your call.
- Thank you.

746
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:07,597
- Hello?
- Luming.

747
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:10,521
- Tell Uncle to release them.
- The reporters?

748
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:14,886
Tell Madam Kao we can't come.
Tell the brothers it's all off.

749
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:20,159
What now? What now?

750
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:24,002
One more time. Make it better.

751
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:28,485
There's no need.
Everything's cancelled.

752
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:34,886
- Why did you kidnap them?
- To keep the secret.

753
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,686
- The secret of your crimes?
- Hold your tongue!

754
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,156
- What secret?
- A lady's secret.

755
00:51:40,248 --> 00:51:41,965
What has she to do with you?

756
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:45,357
Nothing, really.
I just buy a rose from her every day.

757
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,235
I know nobody will believe me.

758
00:51:49,328 --> 00:51:52,877
We believe you, but we don't
understand the kidnapping.

759
00:51:52,968 --> 00:51:56,004
That's exactly why.
You won't understand.

760
00:51:56,088 --> 00:51:59,842
You see, her daughter has a rich
boyfriend, they've just graduated.

761
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:01,406
They're getting married here.

762
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:04,206
This scared the mother,
so she lied about her background.

763
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,723
She's got a heart of gold
and would never lie.

764
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,277
When I arrived in Hong Kong,
she told me to be careful.

765
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:15,963
A conman had already taken my last cent.
I bought a rose for luck.

766
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:22,123
You ladies will understand the love
between a mother and her daughter.

767
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,562
So I kidnapped the men,
but they're OK.

768
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:28,526
I just wanted to help
keep her secret.

769
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:34,562
- You don't understand, do you?
- Not a word.

770
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:37,286
We don't know what you're saying.

771
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:40,320
All right, I'll speak more slowly.

772
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:44,924
There once was a young flower girl.
No, an old flower lady.

773
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:46,679
She has a daughter, and...

774
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,963
Dad, the guest...

775
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:58,636
Sorry, I'll see to Madam Kao.

776
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:02,879
Why aren't the guests here yet?

777
00:53:04,408 --> 00:53:08,844
The car behind us broke down
and caused an almighty traffic jam.

778
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:11,158
That's why. They're on their way.

779
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:20,165
Sorry, we did our best.

780
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:28,444
I know what I must do.

781
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,878
How do we get out of this mess?

782
00:53:31,968 --> 00:53:33,719
Did you say something?

783
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:42,285
Mr and Mrs Kao,
what's this all about?

784
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:44,043
I think...

785
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:45,960
by now...

786
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,922
you must have realised
something was wrong.

787
00:53:50,008 --> 00:53:51,281
Mum, what's happened?

788
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,165
Everything has a solution.

789
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:57,844
I know you came to Hong Kong
to look into Belle's background.

790
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:01,477
You have good reasons for doing so.

791
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:06,847
Guests or no guests,
we can still have a good time.

792
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,883
Let's go out for some food.

793
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:11,884
- Come on.
- Let me finish.

794
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:14,883
Mr Wong.

795
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,320
I hope you appreciate the fact...

796
00:54:21,088 --> 00:54:23,362
that Belle is extremely
important to me.

797
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,523
To make things easier for her...

798
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:30,121
I've done things
I never dreamed of doing.

799
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:34,284
Mum, don't be like that.

800
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:37,165
Tell us everything.
We'll sort it out.

801
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:41,762
I understand now.

802
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:45,477
Whatever you do...

803
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:49,244
you get what you deserve
in this life.

804
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,160
Madam, if it's about the guests,
sorry for the trouble.

805
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:55,205
I didn't realise it would upset you.

806
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:56,322
It's not that.

807
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:00,167
I wish...

808
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:07,725
my being Madam Kao...

809
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:12,039
If what you're saying has nothing
to do with the wedding,

810
00:55:12,128 --> 00:55:14,004
there's no need to say it.

811
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:17,239
Mum, I want you to know
I love Belle whatever happens.

812
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:21,764
That makes it even more important
for me to say it.

813
00:55:22,328 --> 00:55:24,319
I want you all to know...

814
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,683
I want you all to understand...

815
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:34,285
Music, music!

816
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,956
- I am not...
- The guests are here!

00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:52,565

We meet again.

Postmaster General and Mrs Nitton.

832
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:36,718
Why are you dressed like that?

833
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:39,003
The Attorney General lent it to me.

834
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:40,646
How did you get them to come?

835
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:43,116
I told them we'd be finished
without them.

836

What a happy night.

841
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:14,316
You finally did something good
on your own.

842
00:57:14,408 --> 00:57:19,401
I wanted to do it, like everyone
else, but I didn't have the guts.

843
00:57:20,727 --> 00:57:22,365
Why are you crying?

844
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:24,959
I'm going to the toilet.

845
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,601
Stop crying,
you'll ruin your make-up.

846
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,124
Do I look ugly?

847
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:14,996
Quick! The ship's about to sail.

848
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:22,362
"Former Chief Inspector Wanted
for Embezzlement of Police Funds"

849
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:30,481
You bastard!

00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:34,677
Come and see me in Malaysia,
if you dare!

851
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,445
You finally did a good deed.

852
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,802
You played your part.

853
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,362
Come back any time!

854
