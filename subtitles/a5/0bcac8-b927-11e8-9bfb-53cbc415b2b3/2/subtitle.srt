1
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:11,355
Ning!

2
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,963
Why are you so speedy?

3
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:18,555
It's faster coming down!

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,792
Are you alright?

5
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,136
Do you like this picture?
Give it to you.

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,235
The picture?

7
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,212
How do you get this?

8
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:34,407
My father asked to draw it a year ago.

9
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:38,410
Just found it 2 days before.

10
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,051
That's me!

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,291
Keep it as seeing me.

12
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,996
You sound like we'll never meet again.

13
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,798
Yes!
I'll marry the old monster,

14
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,197
in 3 days time.

15
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,790
You're not willing to.

16
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,532
Go away if you want to.

17
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,341
Let me go.
It's dawn.

18
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:06,878
It's better, then we can go.

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,175
Let me off.

20
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,447
I won't, if you don't go with me.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,912
Release me!

22
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:18,316
Tsing!

23
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,358
You beggar, how can you save me?

24
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,562
Don't daydream.

25
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:23,756
You want my money.

26
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:25,899
I see so many of your kind.

27
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:26,888
I won't be tricked.

28
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,295
How can you say this?

29
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,364
If you don't go,
I'll ask someone to fetch you.

30
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:37,370
Ok, I go!

31
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:40,902
Take care!

32
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,500
Mister!

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,094
I can't find the picture!

34
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:06,473
I saw the girl.

35
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,041
Forget her.
She died a year ago!

36
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,633
It's pouring, go and find a shelter!

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,609
Don't curse her.

38
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,847
Keep by my side.
You're totally wet!

39
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,916
Don't superstitions!

40
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,611
Don't go away!

41
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:22,850
Who's shouting?

42
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,461
I'm not a wanted convict.

43
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:30,597
Grab the shouting one.

44
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:31,932
You won't get fund.

45
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,422
Get him first.

46
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:37,630
The world is so cool.

47
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:43,605
The bearded man is a killer.

48
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,438
Is she dangerous?

49
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,646
Help me get on my feet.

50
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,917
Beware,
don't let my new gown get wet.

51
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,009
You can't afford it.

52
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,955
I'm coming to save you.

53
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,048
My mom will punish me,
I wet my clothes.

54
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,958
The way of life

55
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:08,197
The way...

56
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,666
The spoken "way" is not "way"

57
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,131
Of heaven and earth,

58
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,703
Of humang and swards

59
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:21,715
Of evil and good,

60
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:22,883
This way, that way, every which way

61
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,377
Say that their way, is the only way

62
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,882
Bah. Tehah, hah!

63
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,254
All bullshit,

64
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:36,361
This way, that way, is still not the way

65
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,999
Ha! Ha!

66
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,166
The way of flowers and tea, Ha!

67
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,334
Of life and death,

68
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,469
Of density and intensity,

69
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:43,703
Of light and heat,

70
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:44,838
Of evil spirits

71
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,006
Of people committing crimes

72
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,275
Of bad ones in power! Ha!

73
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,477
I find my own way

74
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:54,174
I seek

75
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,412
My way!

76
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,791
Leaving?

77
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,673
Tsing...!

78
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,850
Tsing...!

79
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,658
So windy!

80
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,058
Ning!

81
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,171
What happened to your eyes?

82
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:52,406
The fool punches on me!

83
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,373
Who?

84
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:54,571
Kneel down!

85
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,009
What are you doing?

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,572
It's pouring!

87
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,683
It doesn't matter, I always get wet.

88
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,647
Let's go on to the temple.

89
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,024
You are in danger.

90
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,559
That bearded guy is a killer

91
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,651
Come in first.

92
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,890
I'm coming back to tell you.

93
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,633
It's dripping.

94
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,101
Come!

95
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,164
Are you back to rescue me?

96
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,569
I miss you!

97
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,513
The seller said the girl died already.

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,157
Don't mention this now.

99
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:56,864
Don't forget, I'll get married in days.

100
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:13,946
Dawn, please do not come

101
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:18,591
Let the dream-like night

102
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:22,295
last forever.

103
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:26,332
Let this moment of truth

104
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:30,132
follow this moving love

105
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:37,772
and command the soul to come in.

106
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:47,654
Please ask dawn not to come ever again.

107
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:51,825
This romantic feeling now,

108
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:55,462
puts me out of this world

109
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:59,532
The warmth in that breeze

110
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:03,803
sends love through the cold rains.

111
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:10,504
Quietly let this
fervent love break through

112
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:14,669
Do not let the red sun

113
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,082
put us apart

114
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:24,754
This langourous night

115
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:28,128
do not change

116
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:36,536
Please command dawn
not to show itself again

117
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:41,034
The dream we are in now

118
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,565
can never happen again

119
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,302
It's also in the picture.

120
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:48,048
Give it back to me.

121
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,446
It sounds beautiful.

122
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,348
Give it back to me.

123
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,889
You run so fast?

124
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:56,981
Go!

125
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,028
Why you get up set?

126
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,826
It's important to you.

127
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't mean this.

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,792
Tell you the truth.
I'm not a human.

129
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't say that.

130
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,109
I'm not, if you don't.

131
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,835
I'll take responsibility
for the thing we did.

132
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,478
Don't follow me!

133
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,713
Go to find the bearded guy.

134
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,882
He's a murderer, I'll get killed.

135
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,293
You'll die!

136
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,555
Tsing!

137
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,265
Tsing!

138
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,236
Don't follow me.

139
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,134
You can't go!

140
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,367
Where's Tsing?

141
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,755
Tsing?

142
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:19,229
I'm not coming for you.

143
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,792
Heaven and earth are limit-less.

144
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:54,232
The bearded guy killed your sister.
Let's report.

145
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,442
I can't go with you.

146
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,739
I don't care,
I must get you out here.

147
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,456
Tsing!

148
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,560
Tsing's gone?

149
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,812
Court!

150
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,124
Someone is coming to pay you money.

151
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:45,992
Yes.

152
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,482
Did you get money?

153
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:48,928
Not yet!

154
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:49,826
Master not yet arrives.

155
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,033
Clean your teeth.

156
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,022
Wash your face, Master.

157
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,303
Master!

158
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,707
Disturbing me at this hour!

159
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:02,308
Beat him up!

160
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,010
Double.

161
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,546
Stop, I'll forget everything

162
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,047
Did you get the money?

163
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,615
Yes, of course.

164
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:10,850
Nonsense?

165
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,851
Beat!

166
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,454
I saw the murderer Liu!

167
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,352
Liu?

168
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,590
Who's he?

169
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,693
He's a wanted convict.

170
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,786
But we got him 3 hours ago!

171
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm a money mind.

172
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,002
You're worse than me!

173
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:32,605
Want to take my money?

174
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:35,408
Beat you to death.

175
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,807
- Beat! I really saw him.
- Did you?

176
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,514
Who's in the jail?

177
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,615
Yes, it's Liu?

178
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:45,084
It's guilty.
Beat!

179
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,320
I think you get the wrong person!

180
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,188
We always get the wrong person!

181
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,123
Really?

182
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,112
Yes!

183
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,726
Get Liu!

184
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,556
Get Liu!

185
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,567
If he's really Liu,
then it's not a good business.

186
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,002
Don't plead guilty.
Beat!

187
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:03,900
Yes!

188
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,366
Beat!

189
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,932
Why are you still hitting?

190
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,398
Stop it!

191
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:12,870
Killer!

192
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,409
Liu...

193
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,672
Liu?

194
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,409
No robbing. I'm poor!

195
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,777
Mr. Chiu!

196
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:24,755
Yen?

197
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,283
Yen?

198
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,284
Deduct your payroll.

199
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:31,364
You don't know Yen?

200
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,066
He's so famous...

201
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,369
in 26 Provinces.

202
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,637
He hates greedy Master.

203
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:39,639
I'm not involved.

204
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,134
Swordsman Yen,
are you coming to grab me?

205
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,171
I don't care the case.
I'm coming to see my brother.

206
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,114
Don't listen to him.
He ain't my brother.

207
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,604
Hold it! Maybe it's wrong.

208
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:52,378
Your honour, Liu is here.

209
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,645
Master, Liu is in jail.

210
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,159
Take him away! No fund!

211
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,027
Go away!

212
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:01,823
Yes.

213
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,394
Go away!

214
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,401
You've to protect me.
He's a murderer.

215
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,435
Nonsense!

216
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,904
It's so complicated.

217
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:14,373
Triple the price.

218
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:15,441
Right!

219
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,309
Who's the killer?

220
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,376
That's him!

221
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:20,368
I'm not a murderer!

222
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,742
I'm tired.

223
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:26,419
What's happening?

224
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,910
It's serious.
Add some more!

225
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:34,127
Listen!
No dead body, no case.

226
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,329
We are making up.

227
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,511
You're wasting our energy!

228
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,224
Pay double!

229
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,001
Stupid fool!

230
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,799
Be smart and pay it.

231
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,108
I want to, but I don't have any.

232
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,277
You can go and rob.

233
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,779
Your honour, let's cancel the case.

234
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,948
He's so generous.

235
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,583
Quickly pay and cancel the case.

236
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,419
Where's the spot of the murder?

237
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,320
Speak up!

238
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,412
Lan Ro Temple.

239
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,766
The one who died is not a human being.

240
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,004
I saw you chop off that woman's head.

241
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,403
Not a woman, a ghost.

242
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:20,961
Ghost?

243
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,110
Anything not linked with human
is not my concern.

244
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,011
Right!

245
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,308
Then I don't charge you.

246
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,080
Let's adjourn without charge...

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,672
Adjourned without charge...

248
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,879
I know that woman.

249
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,259
Her family lives behind that Temple.

250
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,353
It's now deserted.
Behind it is the grave.

251
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,623
Grave?

252
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,268
Because of the chaotic situation,

253
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,003
the people in town have all left.

254
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:56,097
The haunted sound at night,

255
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,132
are made by those stray ghost.

256
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:05,345
Ghost? I don't believe it!

257
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,879
If you don't believe,
I'll take you to see them.

258
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:35,539
See for yourself!

259
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,367
You believe it now?

260
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,106
If she was a ghost,
why didn't she kill me?

261
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:07,173
May be you still have some use.

262
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,913
What use?

263
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,475
Only a ghost can tell.

264
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,886
Ghosts use each other like people.

265
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,616
Get out of here before it gets dark.

266
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:21,482
And you?

267
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:26,657
I'm staying.
The mundane world is too complicated.

268
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:32,100
It's simpler to get along with ghosts.

269
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:33,764
I'm staying.

270
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,171
Go now!

271
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,972
I've thought it over.
You'd better stay.

272
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,347
Stay?
Those female ghosts may hurt me.

273
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,645
So much the better.

274
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,443
I can wipe them out all.

275
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,042
If they come to you,
ring this bell,

276
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:26,421
and I'll come to your rescue

277
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,763
You want to use me to kill Tsing?

278
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,856
Yes, they get fed up with me and...

279
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,131
won't to tolerate me anymore

280
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,395
This one is powerful.

281
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:41,471
Can you cope with them?

282
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,741
Sure,
evil can't conquer good.

283
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:54,275
Hold the Sutra.

284
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:57,890
What language is that?

285
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,058
Sanskrit.

286
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,855
Remember,
concentration invites buddhism.

287
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,123
What's the first line?

288
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:06,456
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

289
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,465
You know Sanskrit?

290
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:12,729
No,
but I know this principle.

291
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,141
Remember to ring the bell,
when you see the evil.

292
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:26,410
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

293
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,321
Don't keep reciting that!

294
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,516
The evil may not appear then

295
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,517
Who's it?

296
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:37,177
Say it, or I'll open the door.

297
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,238
Why are you returning?

298
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,535
The old woman knows it!

299
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,295
Are you a ghost?

300
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,467
Yes!

301
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:00,179
Did you kill those men in that temple?

302
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,168
I had no choice.

303
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,446
I had to do it under the circumstances.

304
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,488
Keep away...

305
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:10,682
Keep away, or I'll be nasty.

306
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:12,513
Did you hurt yourself?

307
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,497
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

308
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,304
Why don't you believe me?

309
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,544
Have I ever hurt you?

310
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:32,533
A ghost is evil.

311
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:36,148
You are a ghost.
How can I trust you?

312
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,446
But some men are more scareful than ghosts.

313
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,749
They are more harmful.

314
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:47,916
Some ghosts are unable to vent their grievances

315
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,126
That's why I'm wondering

316
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,821
In fact, some ghosts are better than men.

317
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,925
Why did you kill then?

318
00:20:58,404 --> 00:20:59,803
That old woman forced me to

319
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,406
She's a 1000-year old tree monster.

320
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,842
I'm from a good family,

321
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,777
but I was murdered.

322
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,082
My father buried me under that old tree.

323
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:15,209
He was also killed later.

324
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,323
Then that old woman
controlled my body and...

325
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,314
used me to lure men
to absord their elements.

326
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:24,056
She's now selling me to that old monster.

327
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:25,991
Stop!

328
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,992
Hsiao Tsing!

329
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,971
Why don't you ring the bell?

330
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,677
Are you still afraid of me?

331
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:51,156
No,
I must deliver you out of that old woman.

332
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,054
Really?

333
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:53,292
After tomorrow,

334
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,996
take my ashes to a family before dusk,

335
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:59,298
and I'll have a chance of reincarnation.

336
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,390
Rest assured.

337
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,300
I'll unearth it early tomorrow,

338
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,166
and deliver it.

339
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:11,832
Bad! Go quick!

340
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,511
That Taoist will fix you!

341
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,685
That old woman told me to hurt you!

342
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,676
He may come to kill you.
Go now!

343
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,726
Don't worry! We are blessed.

344
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:30,629
I have magic.

345
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:33,899
Damn Taoist, you fooled me...

346
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,491
It won't work.

347
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,563
Why doesn't it work?

348
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:41,273
What's this?

349
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:42,365
That old woman's tongue.

350
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,217
Ning Tsai-shen!

351
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,309
Tsing!

352
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:55,776
Ning Tsai-shen!

353
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,781
What's this?

354
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:04,926
Tsing!

355
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,476
Shut your mouth or the tongue may get in!

356
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,418
This way!

357
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,971
Tsing!

358
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,063
Leave me alone.

359
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:23,797
Ning Tsai-shen!

360
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:32,075
Follow the cloth,
don't ever look back.

361
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,220
Tsing! I...

362
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,209
Go?

363
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:46,192
Ning Tsai-shen...

364
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:52,125
Tsing!

365
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,699
Ning Tsai-shen!

366
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,468
Tsing!

367
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:05,372
Old woman!

368
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,506
It's you?

369
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:28,700
Who else, if not me?

370
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,010
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come?

371
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,808
Why didn't you ring the bell

372
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,879
How dare you take away my meat?

373
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,686
I don't mind your killing those bad ones.

374
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:47,226
But this scholar who is so pure,

375
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,024
but weak and good for nothing.

376
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:51,685
What else of goodness do you have?

377
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,932
Don't compliment me!

378
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,230
I can't convince her without bluffing.

379
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,864
Killing him means not giving me any face.

380
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:01,640
What about your killing my maid?

381
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,039
That's not giving me any face either?

382
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,213
Damn old woman,
let's not talk about face.

383
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,948
Well, let's fight it out!

384
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,848
Let's see who is stronger.

385
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,322
Her tongue is longer than yours.

386
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:18,220
Go away!

387
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:28,863
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

388
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,400
Blessing sword!

389
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,518
No scruples in Heaven or on Earth.

390
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,362
Tsing!

391
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,351
Ning Tsai-shen!

392
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:01,421
Keep away!

393
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:03,995
Hit!

394
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,904
Don't kill her, Tsing!

395
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,297
Bastard! Come back quick!

396
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:31,025
Help that Taoist fight with the old woman.

397
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,025
Where?

398
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,971
Anywhere will do!

399
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:39,767
What if I hit?

400
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:43,701
My bottom!

401
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:52,875
She's coming again!

402
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,130
Run!
Don't mope over there!

403
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,133
Tsing!

404
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:26,706
Watch out!

405
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,652
I want your lives.

406
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,724
I chop!

407
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,308
Tsing!

408
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:54,301
Tsing...

409
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:57,149
Are you mad? You know she's harmful.

410
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:58,283
Why do you follow her?

411
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:00,183
She was forced. Don't misunderstand.

412
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,877
There's a boundary between men and ghosts.

413
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,658
Men should keep away from ghost's affairs.

414
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,460
We shouldn't get involved.

415
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,655
I've broken her century-old magic.

416
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,732
She's powerful,

417
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:15,934
but can only wreak havoc in a century.

418
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:17,026
If there's nothing happened.

419
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,968
Don't interfere her matters.

420
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,203
I've to keep my promise.

421
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:30,649
I must bring her ashes back to her birth place,

422
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,446
so that she can be reincarnated.

423
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:39,024
Swordsman,
I know you don't want to get involved.

424
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,892
There's lots of high landers
on the way to the town.

425
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,689
I can't make it without your help.

426
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:49,359
Swordsman Yen, I beg you.

427
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,403
Help me bringing her ashes back.

428
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:52,904
Give her a chance.

429
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,339
Please!

430
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:55,533
On your feet!

431
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:02,505
I hide up,

432
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,913
because I hate to go
with those face and mean person.

433
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:08,587
So I hide in this temple.

434
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:10,077
I pretend to be a ghost in front of a man,

435
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,684
and a human in front of a ghost,

436
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,616
and now I don't know if I'm a man or a ghost.

437
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,419
I'm not a swordsman.

438
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,066
Ridiculous!

439
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,534
What so funny!

440
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,436
I don't want to be a man.

441
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,336
But Tsing wants to reincarnation.

442
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,040
Don't say that!

443
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,837
The most important is to get out here.

444
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,948
I don't understand all those nonsense!

445
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,540
Alright, I promise you!

446
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:58,494
I find it!

447
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:08,914
Why so much?

448
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:09,981
How strange!

449
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:10,970
Which one?

450
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,142
No time to sort out now.
Take them away!

451
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:18,845
Where should we put the Sutra?

452
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:20,825
In the satchel!

453
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:22,725
No,
keep it to make the spirits follow us.

454
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:38,109
Follow me closely!

455
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,778
I can't, you're riding too fast!

456
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:41,575
We're in rush.

457
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,724
Swordsman Yen, there is something wrong!
Why are we still at the same old place?

458
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:53,892
Must have to do with those evil spirits.

459
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:54,993
What then?

460
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,284
We must get out of here before it's dark.

461
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:15,639
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

462
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,380
Follow me.

463
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,012
Someone's celebrating!

464
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:48,001
Inn keeper!

465
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,048
Why is it deserted?

466
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,037
All gone to hell!

467
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,042
What?

468
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,540
What are you doing?

469
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,811
We want to stay the night.

470
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,048
Follow me!

471
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,659
You can go!

472
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,625
Don't come out!

473
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,847
Tsing, come out if you're among them.

474
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:33,984
Master, looking for me?

475
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:39,687
Master, looking for us?

476
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:43,568
No sign of Tsing.
Maybe the wrong ashes!

477
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,638
Get back your things and vanish.

478
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:47,872
Don't wreak havoc anymore.

479
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,466
Thank you!

480
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,401
Vanish.

481
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,638
Last chance.

482
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,217
Now this is the last.

483
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,515
Tsing, come out, if it's you!

484
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:05,490
Come out!

485
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,482
Master, looking for me?

486
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:14,857
A male! No chance!

487
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,933
Why do you keep calling me?

488
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:21,497
It's the waiter.

489
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:24,809
You scare me!

490
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,679
Damn!
Why did you appear so abruptly?

491
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,668
Get out!

492
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:40,492
Tsing!

493
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,686
Ning Tsai-shen!

494
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,686
Tsing!

495
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,594
Thank you for serving my life!

496
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,798
Well...!
Stand up!

497
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,003
Don't be formal. We're friends.

498
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,615
You're wasting the time!

499
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:05,913
I'll replace 2 horses for the journey tomorrow.

500
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,952
What a pair of lovers!

501
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,350
That's his style!

502
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:36,107
It's frosty all over the lake.

503
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:45,982
Time flies like which goes grey.

504
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,026
Facing the moon alone,
I need companion.

505
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,759
Lovebirds fare better than fairies.

506
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,072
This picture will be the only thing I left.

507
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:02,471
I'll keep it forever.

508
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:06,811
We must at the town tomorrow evening,

509
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,211
if not I couldn't reincarnation.

510
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,009
You should be happy for me.

511
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,508
What a chance for you.

512
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,062
But we must part before dawn,

513
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:25,461
and forever.

514
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:29,393
Heavens! Don't ever get dark

515
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,331
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

516
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:39,932
Evil in the air!

517
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:46,177
Blood bun?

518
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:54,556
A ghost wedding.

519
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:59,230
Stop moping!
This inn is haunted.

520
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,720
Pack up and get out of here.

521
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:03,890
I go and get the golden pagoda.

522
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,225
Hurry up!

523
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:10,708
Oh, I forgot the painting!

524
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,606
Get it when day breaks.

525
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,838
Ning Tsai-shen!

526
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:16,481
Today's a good day in hell.

527
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,049
They must've got Tsing back.

528
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:19,250
Old Evil is coming to collect the bride.

529
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,741
Scholar,
it seems we've to storm hell!

530
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,955
We must rescue Tsing.

531
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:26,724
Hold it!
We must rescue her before the incense burns out.

532
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,116
We can't go back when the day breaks.

533
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:30,082
Remember, close your eyes!

534
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,193
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

535
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,579
Can I open my eyes now?

536
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,773
You must, if you want to find her.

537
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:12,561
Tsing's inside.

538
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:13,935
Tsing!

539
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:15,962
Ning Tsai-shen!

540
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:17,666
Tsing!

541
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:22,847
Why can't I get hold of her?

542
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,215
Ning Tsai-shen!

543
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:26,084
Tsing! Tsing!

544
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,419
In the mundane world men can't see ghosts.
In hell ghosts can't see men.

545
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,511
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

546
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,212
Tsing can see you now.
Go now.

547
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,527
They're going to hell!

548
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,305
Go!

549
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,706
Tsing!

550
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,008
What now?

551
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:50,906
Go into hiding

552
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,483
Go and rescue Tsing at once.

553
00:38:58,483 --> 00:38:59,350
Me?

554
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,146
Let's go!

555
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:01,941
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

556
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:05,652
Heaven and Earth are limitless.

557
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,837
Here I am!

558
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:21,439
Don't mind, run!

559
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,428
I'm here to help you.

560
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:24,105
I cut it for you.

561
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:33,673
Run!

562
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:42,484
The magic powers!

563
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:47,191
Swordsman Yen, watch out!

564
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,311
You go first, I'll stay behind.

565
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:43,779
Find another exit.

566
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,541
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Mi.

567
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:17,855
Swordsman Yen!

568
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:18,823
Why have you come back?

569
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:19,824
We can't get out of here!

570
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:20,620
Old Evil has blocked the exit.

571
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,592
You can't get out of here.

572
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:27,289
Help me get an arrow.

573
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,091
Full the bow.

574
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:31,395
Let loose!

575
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:36,698
Bad, we're not his match.

576
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,386
Pull at him.
This is 1000-year old Evil.

577
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:49,683
He may drain your soul away.

578
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:52,778
Swordsman Yen!

579
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:09,398
Concentrate!

580
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,141
Recite!
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

581
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,311
Lord Black, please let them go.

582
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:23,421
Break the golden pagoda
and be my companion.

583
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,616
Tsing, don't be taken in.

584
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:28,586
Concentrate!
Recite!

585
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:32,691
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

586
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:36,460
Don't!

587
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:43,701
I'll rescue you!

588
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,022
Tsing!

589
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:15,633
Yen Che-hsia, Ning Tsai-shen I'll take your lives.

590
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:23,135
Don't!

591
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,847
What's this? The sutra?

592
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:34,392
You'd enough.

593
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:35,586
I've to get rid of your damn evil.

594
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:56,672
Damn old Evil!

595
00:43:57,582 --> 00:43:58,674
Swordsman Yen!

596
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:01,311
The way's clear!
Help Swordsman Yen out!

597
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,216
Swordsman Yen!

598
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:30,343
Swordsman Yen, we're back to earth.

599
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:33,384
Bad, it's dawn.

600
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:34,476
Tsing's not yet here.

601
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:36,783
Help her out.

602
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:45,728
Swordsman Yen, lead a hand!

603
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:55,761
Tsing!

604
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,009
Keep her from the sunshine,

605
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:00,603
or she may evaporate
and can't be reincarnated.

606
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:08,315
Tsing,
come back to the golden pagoda!

607
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:17,689
The sun is rising, I've to go!

608
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:23,196
Tsing, be a good human being.

609
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:27,271
I'll remember you always.

610
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:30,172
Can't see you once before we apart.

611
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,031
Take care!

612
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,639
She's gone!

613
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:50,994
I want to be together,

614
00:45:52,396 --> 00:46:00,895
till eternity.

615
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:08,375
Tsing, I'll take you back.

616
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,437
Wonder if she has been reincarnated.

617
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:40,273
In there times,
an unlucky man may fare worse than a ghost.

618
00:46:46,017 --> 00:46:47,385
Ahead.

619
00:46:47,385 --> 00:46:48,477
Let's go.

620
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:55,317
The path of life

621
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,288
Are dreams, like the length of the path

622
00:47:00,264 --> 00:47:03,300
The storm on the way

623
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,999
Pass by as you go along

624
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:11,842
In the world

625
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:16,313
How many ways can one dream?

626
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:21,519
Looking for dream-like love

627
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,922
And the path goes on

628
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:33,823
Life is what dreams
and desires are made of

629
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:37,735
Somewhere in the dream

630
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:42,138
There are traces of tears

631
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:46,210
Where to go to?

632
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,010
To find where my heart wants to go

633
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:55,820
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

634
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:00,314
And the path and I go on
