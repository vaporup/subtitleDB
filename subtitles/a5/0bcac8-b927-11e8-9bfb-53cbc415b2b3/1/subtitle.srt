1
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:45,282
The path of life...

2
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:49,047
...are dreams,
like the length of the path

3
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,655
The storm on the way...

4
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:57,356
...pass by as you go along

5
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,895
In the world...

6
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:04,832
...how many ways can one dream?

7
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:10,141
Looking for dream-like love...

8
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:15,041
...and the path goes on

9
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,544
Life is what...

10
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:22,688
...dreams and desires are made of

11
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:26,091
Somewhere in the dream...

12
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:30,392
...there are traces of tears

13
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:34,126
Where to go to?

14
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:38,063
To find where my heart wants to go

15
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:43,507
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

16
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,577
and the path and I go on

17
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:23,580
It suddenly rains and suddenly shines

18
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,282
Please have a pity on us travellers!

19
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,772
Stop!

20
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,569
Run!

21
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,220
Have mercy, sir!
Take it back!

22
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,211
How dare you steal my money?
Damn you!

23
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,415
- Stop!
- Stop!

24
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,814
Is it wanted convict?

25
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,554
Go away!

26
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,219
Stop! Stop!

27
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:16,531
Is it him?

28
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,161
Doesn't look like him! Go.

29
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,666
Thank you!

30
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:28,876
Don't go!

31
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,552
If you are not wanted, stay away!

32
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,543
Stay away, go!

33
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:39,716
Stop!

34
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,193
Not him!

35
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,091
Tell him to leave!

36
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,858
Stop!

37
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,501
Stop!

38
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:52,436
Who's screaming?

39
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:53,670
Over there!

40
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,971
Stop!

41
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,139
Stop!

42
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,231
There's a wanted convict!

43
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,870
Who told you to stop?

44
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,680
Pilgrimage? How hilarious!

45
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,552
You have all my money!

46
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:09,486
Don't advantage from me!

47
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,855
Don't say that, I don't need it!

48
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,254
You may need it sooner or later!

49
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:15,752
Thank you!

50
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,061
Want a room, Sir?

51
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,629
Get the luggage for him.

52
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:20,831
There's a nice room.

53
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,822
Sorry,
but I'm a collector from Tsi Pao Chu.

54
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,322
Collector?

55
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:26,868
Without rules!

56
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,839
Why is it a different man each time?

57
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,207
The ex-collector was killed
on his way home.

58
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,107
Why don't you just do me a favour.

59
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:34,210
Since you might get killed with the money?

60
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,411
Stop collecting.

61
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,606
You must be joking.

62
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:47,824
Can I see the counterfoll?
It's the new rule.

63
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,960
New rule? Show me!

64
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,161
Sorry, no!

65
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,562
What kind of a record is that?

66
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,898
It's in such a mess.

67
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,267
I can't return without the collection.

68
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,359
Sorry to bother you.

69
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,971
I owe you nothing.

70
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,405
Your book shows it.

71
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:05,203
Don't deny it
or I'll take you to court.

72
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,317
Inn keeper, where can I
spend a night without paying

73
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,487
Go to the Lan Ro Temple!

74
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,832
Old lady, I didn't lie to you.

75
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:30,527
Where's Lan Ro Temple, please?

76
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:35,472
Lan Ro Temple?!
3 1/2 miles to the East.

77
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,667
Where there is a spocky temple!

78
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:40,839
Thank you!

79
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:46,776
Sorry! Excuse me!

80
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,216
Old lady, are you going
to buy it or not?

81
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,737
Well done!

82
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:14,836
Master, you've good taste,
make an offer!

83
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,874
I don't even have money
for travel expenses.

84
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,986
Good taste, but no means,
what's the use?

85
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,321
What are you doing?

86
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:27,023
I'm taking your measurement
for your coffin!

87
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:27,657
Thank you!

88
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:31,461
Remember,
there are wolves in the woods.

89
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:33,258
You may come upon them when it's dark.

90
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:34,886
Stop...

91
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,481
The fire cannot go out.

92
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:25,675
If it does,
I can't get out of the forest.

93
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,549
Lan Ro Temple.

94
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,897
Anybody in?

95
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:06,816
Have you finished?

96
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:10,809
Hsia-hou, we're fought
for 7 years and you're always lost

97
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,390
But you're quite persevering

98
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,187
You follow me wherever I go.

99
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,395
You've been in the Temple for a fornight

100
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,430
and you've improved your swordsmanship!

101
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,366
But you've wasted your youth too.

102
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:26,669
You're ambitious, but not aggressive.

103
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,874
For the sake of the title,
you've become biased

104
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,510
You're petulant but not concentrated enough.

105
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,000
Your blows are violent but ineffective.

106
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,650
You've to cool down
if not you can win lust.

107
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,552
I'm here to duel with you,

108
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,621
not to listen to your sermon

109
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,323
Yes, he's right!

110
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:50,727
He's not your match.
You shouldn't have

111
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:51,921
said that to disgrace him.

112
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:55,398
He's right too.

113
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:56,490
You shouldn't have followed him.

114
00:12:56,966 --> 00:13:00,537
Lay down your swords
and touch him with love.

115
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:03,206
The universe is limitless
and love is eternal.

116
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:07,177
Love conquers the world.

117
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,974
Love is the most powerful weapon!

118
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,005
Because you said too much!

119
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,308
I'm not trying to follow you

120
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,426
Your clothing is torn.

121
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,594
Hell with your love!

122
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,029
The kind of love you need,

123
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,223
you should find in a whorehouse.

124
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:28,898
I'm trying to find a place.

125
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:29,796
It's not convenient!

126
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,463
Why not?

127
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:33,536
Are you bold or not?

128
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:34,771
Yes!

129
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:35,669
Look over there!

130
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,378
I just shout, you then hide up.

131
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:43,880
If there's a real tiger,

132
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,472
where should you hide?

133
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,643
What?
It really has a tiger?

134
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:49,583
No!

135
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,048
But we've something even
more scareful than a tiger.

136
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,791
Do you always keep so close while talking?

137
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,282
I've had breath
and this will keep you away.

138
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,687
Get out of here!

139
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,721
Your love can't save you.

140
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,533
Yes!

141
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,329
Me too!

142
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,843
Hsia-hou, you're ambitious but,

143
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:39,379
after death, you're still a nobody.

144
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,677
I won't expose your body
in the wilderness.

145
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,990
You never change,
you fight even when dead.

146
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:56,690
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

147
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,262
It's lucky that water isn't deep.

148
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,661
Otherwise I'll get wet.

149
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,591
That monster's out again!

150
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,491
Shit! Is he still be there?

151
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:21,744
I meant no harm.

152
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,041
I'll throw it away if you're afraid!

153
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:36,180
What's it?

154
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,084
Where's my veil?

155
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,326
Veil? I'll find up for you!

156
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:47,729
It's deep!

157
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,399
Come up quick!

158
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:54,565
Come up!

159
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:56,874
Thank you!

160
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,006
It's too dark, I can't see.

161
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,082
I'll find it up early tomorrow.

162
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:07,214
This water is both deep and cold!

163
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:11,327
Your hands are colder than mine.

164
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,624
Because you're warmer.

165
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,262
You're sick, you look so pale.

166
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,268
Go to see doctor.

167
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:23,999
I need your warmth.

168
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:27,443
I'm not willing to push you.

169
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:29,712
If not, I'll spit on you.

170
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:30,906
It hurts.

171
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:36,752
I shouldn't have pushed you.

172
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:37,844
It's cold.

173
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,946
I'm wet,
you'll feel colder lying on me.

174
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:43,893
Do you feel painful or cold?

175
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,594
Hold me and take me inside.

176
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,492
Holding you?

177
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:50,989
I can't, you're too heavy!

178
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,160
I need some help...

179
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:07,915
You look nice,
but you're in the wrong place.

180
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,380
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have died for nothing.

181
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:20,722
Why am I still in water?

182
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:29,529
Miss, you forgot your lute!

183
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:13,006
Why are you following me?

184
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:20,022
Why are you leaving?

185
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,191
A villain!
I must run for my life!

186
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,591
Who?
I can't see it!

187
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:01,797
Stepping you to death.

188
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,196
Let's go.

189
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,125
Snake!

190
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,202
Where's the snake?

191
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:17,639
Don't shout!

192
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:20,073
The villain just passes by.

193
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,785
Which one?

194
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:24,787
The bearded one
on the East of Lan Ro Temple.

195
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:26,482
If he discovered us, we'd be killed!

196
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,689
The one living opposite me?

197
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,954
I could tell that he no good

198
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,634
You're too dangerous!
On your own I'll take you back.

199
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:41,036
No, my family won't permit this.

200
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:41,937
They're very strict.

201
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:43,906
Miss,

202
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,141
let me lure him away then!

203
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,836
Run when he tries to get hold of me!

204
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:51,137
Don't let him see you.

205
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,951
Here's your lute, Miss!

206
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:08,221
What's your name?

207
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:09,562
Ning Tsai-shen!

208
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:14,503
What's yours?

209
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,595
Nieh Hsiao Tsing!

210
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:17,335
Nieh Hsiao Tsing!

211
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,497
Tomorrow night...

212
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,109
Tomorrow night I'll come to see you.

213
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:32,505
Stop running!

214
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,008
It's dangerous.

215
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:47,620
Stop!
You can't get away!

216
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:07,149
If you think you can scream,
I can scream too!

217
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:11,020
Damn Taoist,
both of us want shelter here.

218
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,055
Actually,
all the men I killed deserve it.

219
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:14,955
Why have you been annoying me?

220
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,582
I'm not.

221
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,062
I'm hiding in this hellish place

222
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,359
to stay away from hatred
the fighting in the world.

223
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:25,100
We've the common objective
to annihilate criminals

224
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,268
for the good of mankind.

225
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:28,237
We're in fact are fellowmen.

226
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:31,638
Fellowmen? Nonsense!

227
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,814
You're hurting me too.

228
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:40,716
One day, you'll be in big trouble,

229
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:41,910
then I'll finish you off.

230
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:57,800
You're a good man.
Don't come to me anymore.

231
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,698
Hsiao Tsing!

232
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:04,657
The big beard

233
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,271
Man of love,

234
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:24,181
Did you come upon anything last night?

235
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:27,344
I've touched everything in the house.

236
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:30,550
Did you see anything eerie?

237
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:33,386
Including you?

238
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,156
Idiot!

239
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,438
I'm serious. Why are you joking?

240
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,247
Who knows, if you're

241
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:53,449
serious or not?

242
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:54,850
You're always joking?

243
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,148
Get out of this place.
It's haunted.

244
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:00,880
Show me the ghost if you can.

245
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,759
Stupid fool.
Do you think you can see a ghost that easy?

246
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,093
Then they must not be a ghost.

247
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:06,788
They won't show up in the day.

248
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,064
Big beard, don't scare me.

249
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:11,055
Tell them to come at night,
if not in the day.

250
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,105
Don't regret it.

251
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:20,506
Why don't you believe me?

252
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:25,645
If I see you at night,
I'll throw you out.

253
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,939
Come on, do that!

254
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:32,380
No, I'll kill you.

255
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:37,955
There's no better way to help him.

256
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,352
Hope that can save his life.

257
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,022
Ghost? He must be kidding.

258
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:47,293
Where's my lower portion?

259
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:55,003
Damn big beard!
Where have you put it?

260
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:59,677
Your lower portion?
Isn't it connected to your upper portion?

261
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:01,216
Don't talk nonsense!

262
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:02,384
Take it!

263
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:04,181
He's incoherent.
No point in helping him.

264
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,628
It's illegible anyway,
I'll fill it in myself.

265
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:17,352
Have you really lived in Lan Ro Temple?

266
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:18,444
It clearly shows 70 taels.

267
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:23,455
Pay up.

268
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:25,582
Take it.

269
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,255
Thank you.

270
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,197
Inn keeper!

271
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,431
You scared me.
What do you want?

272
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:37,131
I was scared too.

273
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:39,768
Excuse me, excuse me...

274
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,481
Hsiao Tsing!

275
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,658
Hsiao Tsing!

276
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:35,888
Can you hear me?

277
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,131
Stop.

278
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,133
Did you hear me, stop!

279
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:43,602
Don't go!

280
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:46,772
Who said that? Who did?

281
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,204
Let me see who's a wanted convict.

282
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:55,546
Don't you listen I said stop?

283
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,520
That man of taste is here again.

284
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,971
Boss!

285
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,305
Why are you here again?

286
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:18,902
Boss, where's that painting
"The girl washing hair"?

287
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:25,676
I'll get it for you at once.

288
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,214
Boss, what are you doing?

289
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:34,489
Why's it missing?
No one has ever asked for it.

290
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:35,757
Well, come again tomorrow.

291
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,659
I promise I'll find it for you.

292
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:38,558
Well, I'll come again tomorrow.

293
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:53,534
How could all 3 lanterns be blown out?

294
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,602
When the wolf comes,
see how I'd cope with you.

295
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:02,450
Can't you see the Yellow River's water,

296
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,820
keeps flowing into the sea
without returning?

297
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,122
Can't you see the mourning of those,

298
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,457
with grey hair before the mirror?

299
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,358
Don't face the moonlight without a drink.

300
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:15,297
Can't you see the Yellow River's water,

301
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,598
keeps flowing into the sea
without returning?

302
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:18,088
Can't you see the mourning of those,

303
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:19,935
with grey hair before the mirror?

304
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:22,804
Don't face the moonlight without a drink.

305
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:24,704
Give and spend and God will send.

306
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,241
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

307
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:27,175
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

308
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:28,076
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

309
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:29,711
Understand the bible,
and you have the sword for ten years

310
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,413
Then you've the credits.
I scare to leak out

311
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:32,209
If you stay, then I'll go.

312
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:34,106
I can hardly breath.

313
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,145
Why is there no wolf?

314
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,050
The wolf'ss coming!

315
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:47,181
Nieh Hsiao Tsing...

316
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:57,559
Hsiao Tsing...

317
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:08,836
Open the door, Hsiao Tsing!

318
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:11,313
Why are you here?

319
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:12,447
I came because I heard the lute sounds.

320
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:13,345
Come in quick!

321
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:17,385
You can't come here.

322
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,487
I'm leaving tomorrow,
I must say goodbye!

323
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,388
Tomorrow?

324
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:22,824
Yes, but I'll try to come to see you.

325
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:23,722
Don't!

326
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:25,593
Someone's coming!

327
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:26,728
She has a sharp nose.

328
00:38:26,728 --> 00:38:28,525
Hide under the water,
and she can't smell you.

329
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:31,154
In the water again?

330
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,340
Sister Tsing!

331
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:50,407
I know the matron's waiting impatiently.

332
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:52,483
I'll go out after I've made up.

333
00:38:58,326 --> 00:38:59,418
Tramp!

334
00:39:03,064 --> 00:39:05,467
You're hiding a man!

335
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:06,559
I am not!

336
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:07,799
Don't deny it!

337
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:10,029
Here's the proof!

338
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,729
See for yourself.

339
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:15,708
Why have you written such stuff?

340
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,802
You obviously do that
in defiance of my order.

341
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,475
I must punish you.

342
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:22,805
You bitch!

343
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:25,351
Don't forget the ordeal you suffered!

344
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,387
Do as I tell you
or I'll destroy your ashes,

345
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:30,583
and you'll evaporate like thin air.

346
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:38,366
Tonight...

347
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,163
get me a living being...

348
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:42,592
to increase my vitality,

349
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:44,230
and lengthen my span of life

350
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,275
You'll be forgiven

351
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:48,469
for this first offence.

352
00:39:49,577 --> 00:39:51,477
Bring medicine for your sister.

353
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:53,236
Yes.

354
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:03,124
You've been betrothed the Lord Black.

355
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:04,819
In three days you'll be his wife!

356
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:08,229
He's a bit old.

357
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:10,398
But he's not good-natured.

358
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:11,366
When he flares up,

359
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,867
even we can't control him.

360
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:13,902
After you marry him,

361
00:40:13,902 --> 00:40:14,891
you'll never return.

362
00:40:15,837 --> 00:40:16,805
Hsiao Tsing!

363
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:17,772
Yes!

364
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:18,864
Try it on.

365
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,002
Your bridal dress.

366
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:27,006
Come here and have a look.

367
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:51,197
Seems there's some sort of smell.

368
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:53,303
The smell of a living man.

369
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:58,543
My dress is torn.

370
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:00,673
Why are you so careless?

371
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:03,084
I must wash my hand!

372
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:04,176
Ching, let me help you.

373
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:05,854
Thank you!

374
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:06,843
Don't mention it.

375
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:08,990
Why are you doing that?

376
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,888
Sorry.

377
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,494
Don't keep offending her.

378
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:13,392
I didn't mean to.

379
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:14,960
You haven't cleaned up yet.

380
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:18,190
You did it on purpose, I give up.

381
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:20,859
Take it off so I can mend it

382
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:03,111
Tsing, what are you doing?

383
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:06,512
I must take a bath before going out!

384
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:11,279
If not I can't get you a living.

385
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:13,686
Good girl.

386
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:15,917
Ching, learn from her.

387
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:21,118
I won't let you down tonight

388
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,497
Come!

389
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:35,264
Hurry up!

390
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:52,658
3 days later after I get married,

391
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:54,818
this room will be yours.

392
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:10,300
Dress up! I won't look at you!

393
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:14,649
Come!

394
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:15,783
You...

395
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:16,875
Go!

396
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:19,020
I've a lot to tell you!

397
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,214
Go to the temple first!

398
00:43:21,055 --> 00:43:22,257
I'll wait you there!

399
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:23,246
Yes!
