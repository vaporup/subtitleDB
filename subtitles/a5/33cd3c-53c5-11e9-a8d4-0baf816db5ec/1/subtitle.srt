1
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,413
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:46,932
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,122
I'm in.

4
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,316
We're almost there.

5
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:04,278
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:09,658
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,572
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,742
Given your situation, I can't say
I fully understand your reasons...

9
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,495
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,457
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,376
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,336
To trust me.

13
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,380
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,385
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:12,805
Now repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:13,973
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,650
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,820
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:32,366
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,871
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,789
I just wish...

22
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,584
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,502
That's all.

24
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,921
I just wish I knew.

25
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:50,134
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,302
Here you are.

27
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:54,805
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:59,393
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

29
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,729
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,524
They're boring from the surface
straight down to Zion.

31
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,152
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.

32
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,737
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:13,157
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,659
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:19,246
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,248
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,751
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,336
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:27,129
Why not?

40
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:30,883
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,596
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,848
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:39,433
Niobe.

44
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,979
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:47,316
...it's become increasingly difficult
to locate a secure broadcast position.

46
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,569
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Main Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:54,365
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:55,616
What are we gonna do about it?

49
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,993
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered us to do.

50
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,788
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:05,876
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:08,587
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:10,339
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,689
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,899
- I think, we should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,067
I don't know.

57
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,903
...however,
I must ask one of you for help.

58
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,534
Some of you believe as I believe, some of
you do not. But those of you that do know...

59
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,161
...we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:45,374
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,752
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,512
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,266
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:04,226
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:07,104
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,857
...just in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,027
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:17,531
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,242
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,244
And what happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,705
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,040
He won't.

73
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:30,211
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,505
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,132
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,595
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:42,973
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:46,268
A gift.

79
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:49,230
You see, he set me free.

80
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,692
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:57,154
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

82
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:58,697
He gave you this.

83
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,579
He said you set him free.

84
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,708
Is everything all right, sir?

85
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,586
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

86
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,880
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

87
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,632
Go.

88
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,059
Hiya, fellas.

89
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,310
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

90
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:29,687
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

91
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,231
- He is still...
- Only human.

92
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,322
Upgrades.

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,419
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

94
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:38,172
It's happening exactly as before.

95
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,883
Well, not exactly.

96
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,472
- What happened back there, Link?
- I can't figure it out, sir.

97
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,224
Agents just came out of nowhere.

98
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,268
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

99
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,230
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

100
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,731
Where is he now?

101
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,817
He's doing his Superman thing.

102
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,158
Where are you?

103
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:56,083
This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.

104
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:04,216
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

105
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:05,843
Roger that, Control.

106
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,346
This is Zion Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

107
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,183
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

108
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,358
Nebuchadnezzar you are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

109
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,152
Roger that, Control.

110
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:32,953
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

111
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,748
No place like it.

112
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:52,890
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

113
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,690
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

114
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:43,983
Understood.

115
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:54,785
Captain Mifune.

116
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:56,954
Captain Morpheus.

117
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:59,832
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

118
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:03,252
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

119
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,506
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

120
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,134
- Link.
- Sir?

121
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,761
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

122
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,430
Understood, sir.

123
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:23,606
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

124
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:26,775
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

125
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:30,029
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

126
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,740
What happened?

127
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:36,243
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

128
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,954
Yeah, she can do that.

129
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,247
Neo!

130
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,959
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

131
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,003
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

132
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,756
You know what they say
about the life you save.

133
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,633
I didn't save his life.

134
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:54,011
Hiya, Neo.

135
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,681
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

136
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:01,352
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

137
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:04,146
- Can I carry that for you, Neo?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

138
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,898
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:09,568
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

140
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:18,619
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

141
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,413
I've been thinking a lot about it,
and I've made my decision.

142
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,998
Let me guess.

143
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,334
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

144
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:29,713
I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other
crew positions, except for you, Link.

145
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,173
I'm sure he has reasons...

146
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,552
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

147
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,178
You know, it's fate.

148
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:37,846
I mean, you're the reason I'm here, Neo.

149
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:40,432
I told you kid, you found me.
I didn't find you.

150
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,018
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

151
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:45,688
You saved yourself.

152
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,456
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

153
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:09,044
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you the chance to explain your actions.

154
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:11,964
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

155
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,300
You were given a direct order
to return to Zion.

156
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,177
- I did.
- But you asked for one ship to remain behind.

157
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,930
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

158
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,683
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

159
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,103
Commander, we need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

160
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,147
I don't want to hear that shit!

161
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:30,900
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

162
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:34,320
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.

163
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,198
And to do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

164
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:41,744
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

165
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,287
How?

166
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:46,123
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

167
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,792
Not everyone believes what you believe.

168
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,961
My beliefs do not require them to.

169
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:02,556
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

170
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,351
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

171
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:08,354
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

172
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,565
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

173
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:19,615
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

174
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,964
I'm recommending to the counsel
that you be removed from duty.

175
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,341
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

176
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:41,220
If it were up to me captain, you wouldn't
set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

177
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:44,557
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

178
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:52,523
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

179
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,776
- Captain.
- Councillor.

180
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:59,196
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

181
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:03,284
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

182
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,828
The people must be told
what is happening.

183
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,621
Of course, councillor.

184
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,335
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

185
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,380
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

186
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:19,508
A panic is not what anyone wants.

187
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:22,887
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

188
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,768
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

189
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,937
That army will never reach
the gates of Zion.

190
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,150
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

191
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,110
Consider that in the past six months...

192
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:40,237
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

193
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:43,282
This attack is an act of desperation.

194
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:47,119
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

195
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:50,956
I hope you're right, captain.

196
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:53,709
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

197
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,337
It is simply a matter of time.

198
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,840
My stop.

199
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,342
See you soon.

200
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,927
Hopefully not too soon.

201
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:06,096
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

202
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,815
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:19,318
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

204
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:22,655
- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

205
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:26,867
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

206
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:54,478
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

207
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:57,982
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

208
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,150
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

209
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,152
No, wait.

210
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,697
It's all right. They need you.

211
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,032
- I need you.
- I know.

212
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,743
There's time.

213
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,542
Where's my puss...?

214
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,961
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

215
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,671
God!

216
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,715
Uncle Link!

217
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:26,302
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

218
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,554
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

219
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,180
- Yeah!
- Okay!

220
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,974
Okay? All right.

221
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:35,060
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

222
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,354
One, two, three, lift!

223
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,566
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

224
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,319
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

225
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,322
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

226
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,283
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

227
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,202
You be careful with her.

228
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:54,038
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

229
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,083
Out the door! Both of you, march!

230
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,211
- Bye!
- Bye!

231
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,801
I'm gonna get what?

232
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:12,932
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

233
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:16,769
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

234
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:20,231
- We'll be past this, when you start operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

235
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,815
- Why?
- You know why.

236
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:25,027
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

237
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,155
Maybe. But it's too late now.

238
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,824
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

239
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,577
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

240
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:36,580
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

241
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:45,339
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

242
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,509
I'm afraid of it.

243
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:52,555
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

244
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,932
It won't.

245
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,850
How can you say that to me?

246
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,894
Because of Morpheus.

247
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:03,524
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

248
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:07,695
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

249
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:11,282
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

250
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:16,579
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

251
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,664
...l'm starting to believe him too.

252
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:25,880
Be careful, Link.

253
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,304
Please be careful.

254
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:45,316
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

255
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:48,444
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

256
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,113
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

257
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,367
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

258
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:57,119
...our children.

259
00:22:57,661 --> 00:23:00,664
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

260
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:03,918
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

261
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:07,213
...and who stand here beside us.

262
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:10,966
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

263
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:14,178
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

264
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:19,516
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

265
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:21,977
I give you Morpheus.

266
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:44,708
Zion! Hear me!

267
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:48,671
It is true what many of you have heard.

268
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:52,675
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

269
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,595
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

270
00:23:58,013 --> 00:24:02,476
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

271
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:09,024
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

272
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:14,238
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

273
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,448
Why?

274
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,577
Because I believe something you do not?

275
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:21,495
No!

276
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:26,542
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

277
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,462
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

278
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:33,841
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

279
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:38,470
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

280
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:43,183
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

281
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,189
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

282
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:52,902
We are still here!

283
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,368
Tonight...

284
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:04,747
...let us send a message to that army.

285
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:07,833
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

286
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,712
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

287
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,882
...of earth, steel and stone.

288
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:20,054
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

289
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:24,600
Tonight, let us make them remember:

290
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:29,521
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

291
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,837
I remember.

292
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,924
I remember you used to dance.

293
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:01,679
I remember you were pretty good.

294
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:05,516
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

295
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,936
...that will never change.

296
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,022
Niobe!

297
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,237
Some things do change.

298
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:38,465
Excuse me.

299
00:26:49,852 --> 00:26:53,188
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

300
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:57,193
I was thinking, everyone is here.

301
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,904
Follow me.

302
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,100
Neo, what is it?

303
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:18,561
What's wrong?

304
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,314
It's okay, you can tell me.

305
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,067
Trinity...

306
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:27,903
Don't be afraid.

307
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,322
I can't lose you.

308
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,283
You're not gonna lose me.

309
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:38,998
You feel this?

310
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:40,875
I'm never letting go.

311
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:19,121
Good night, Zion.

312
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:21,832
Sweet dreams.

313
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:33,177
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

314
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,888
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

315
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:38,015
It doesn't matter now.
All that matters is this.

316
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:40,392
You first.

317
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,572
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

318
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:08,754
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

319
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:59,263
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

320
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,850
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

321
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:06,687
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

322
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:09,398
So could I.

323
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:14,778
It's nice tonight.

324
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,573
Very calm.

325
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,409
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

326
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:23,120
Not everyone.

327
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:27,917
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

328
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,962
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

329
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:36,926
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

330
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:41,347
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

331
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:44,558
That you are in fact still human.

332
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:51,732
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

333
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,818
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

334
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:57,446
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

335
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:11,961
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

336
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:16,966
That's how it is with people.
Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.

337
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:19,343
I like it down here.

338
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,057
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

339
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:30,145
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.

340
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:35,192
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

341
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,445
- ...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

342
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,198
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

343
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:44,660
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

344
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:47,705
And when I look at these machines...

345
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:52,751
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

346
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:55,796
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

347
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:59,049
Of course not. How could they?

348
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:01,677
The idea is pure nonsense...

349
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:05,139
...but it does make one wonder just...

350
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:06,849
...what is control?

351
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,977
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

352
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:14,648
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

353
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:18,485
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

354
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:22,656
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

355
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:25,409
...our heat, our air.

356
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:30,331
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

357
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:33,000
No. No point.

358
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:37,588
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

359
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,967
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

360
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:43,761
Good point.

361
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:48,432
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

362
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,727
There is so much in this world...

363
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,688
...that I do not understand.

364
00:35:56,398 --> 00:36:00,945
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

365
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,989
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

366
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:08,077
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

367
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:13,832
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

368
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,003
But I believe there's a reason
for that as well.

369
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:23,759
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

370
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:31,600
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

371
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:36,397
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

372
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,860
It's time to go.

373
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:44,154
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

374
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:48,534
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

375
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:52,121
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

376
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:55,416
Right now, that operator's me.

377
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,043
I know.

378
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:04,383
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

379
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,511
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

380
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:10,639
It's always brought me luck.

381
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:14,768
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

382
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:19,273
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

383
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,444
Just keep it with you. Please.

384
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,571
For me.

385
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:30,117
Okay.

386
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:50,888
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

387
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,349
Bane.

388
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:54,808
Is something wrong?

389
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,602
No, I'm fine.

390
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:59,438
I just wanted to catch you to say...

391
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:01,357
...good luck.

392
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:04,568
Thanks.

393
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:07,071
We'll see you.

394
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:11,534
Neo! Just in time.

395
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,953
- You're gonna see the Oracle, aren't you?
- We don't have time.

396
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,663
I'm sorry sir.
I just had to give something to Neo.

397
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:18,958
A gift from one of the orphans.

398
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:22,378
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

399
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,589
He said you'd understand.

400
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:30,177
Thanks.

401
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:39,770
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

402
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:41,814
That is correct.

403
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,858
Counsel, am I still in charge
of our defense system?

404
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,276
Of course.

405
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:49,822
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

406
00:38:50,406 --> 00:38:52,449
I understand that, commander.

407
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,119
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

408
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:59,957
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

409
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,545
Be careful.

410
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,491
Hello.

411
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:47,796
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

412
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:55,012
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

413
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:56,931
Apologize for what?

414
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,266
For this.

415
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:56,407
Good.

416
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:01,829
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

417
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,123
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

418
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,168
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

419
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,462
...until you fight them.

420
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:14,300
Come. She's waiting.

421
00:41:28,772 --> 00:41:30,566
Where the hell did they go?

422
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,527
These are back doors, aren't they?

423
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:36,488
Programmer access.

424
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:41,118
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

425
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:46,081
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

426
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,461
Are you a programmer?

427
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,880
Then what are you?

428
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:58,302
I protect that which matters most.

429
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:20,282
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

430
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:23,369
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

431
00:42:26,455 --> 00:42:28,707
My goodness, look at you.

432
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,752
You turned out all right, didn't you?

433
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:34,046
- How do you feel?
- I...

434
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:37,633
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

435
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,386
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

436
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:45,015
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

437
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:58,153
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

438
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,115
So...

439
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,411
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

440
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:09,999
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

441
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:15,754
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

442
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,134
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

443
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:23,345
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

444
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:25,973
...another kind of control.

445
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,477
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

446
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:34,398
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

447
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:38,527
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

448
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:42,198
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

449
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:45,743
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

450
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,497
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

451
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:53,834
Candy?

452
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,674
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

453
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:03,928
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

454
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:07,932
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

455
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,561
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

456
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:20,694
I thought you'd have
figured that out by now.

457
00:44:22,404 --> 00:44:24,865
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

458
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:27,743
I love candy.

459
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,621
But why help us?

460
00:44:30,788 --> 00:44:34,166
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

461
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:37,628
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

462
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:41,840
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

463
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:47,346
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

464
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:50,099
Look. See those birds?

465
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:53,561
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

466
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:59,316
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

467
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:02,319
There are programs running
all over the place.

468
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:06,740
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

469
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:10,578
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

470
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:14,665
Well, you hear about them all the time.

471
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:18,002
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

472
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:22,882
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

473
00:45:23,048 --> 00:45:27,428
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

474
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:29,847
...is the system assimilating
some program...

475
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:34,476
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

476
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:37,521
Programs hacking programs.

477
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:40,441
- Why?
- They have their reasons but...

478
00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:44,361
...usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

479
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:48,532
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

480
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:53,078
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

481
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:58,000
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

482
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:00,711
...or return to the source.

483
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,466
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

484
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:08,010
Where you must go.

485
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,223
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

486
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:16,060
...in your dreams, haven't you?

487
00:46:16,227 --> 00:46:18,938
A door made of light?

488
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:24,527
What happens when you go through
the door?

489
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,448
I see Trinity...

490
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:32,618
...and something happens...

491
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:34,620
...something bad.

492
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:38,624
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

493
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:43,337
- Do you see her die?
- No.

494
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:47,049
You have the sight now, Neo.

495
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:50,052
You are looking at the world
without time.

496
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,555
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

497
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:56,308
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

498
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:59,520
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

499
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,399
No, you've already made the choice.

500
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,985
Now you have to understand it.

501
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,903
No.

502
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,198
I can't do that. I won't.

503
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:14,159
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

504
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:17,663
Because you're the One.

505
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:22,626
What if I can't?

506
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:24,712
What happens if I fail?

507
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:28,132
Then Zion will fall.

508
00:47:35,306 --> 00:47:39,977
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

509
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:43,314
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you'll need the Keymaker.

510
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,440
The Keymaker?

511
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:48,110
Yes. He disappeared some time ago. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

512
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:51,864
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

513
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:55,451
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

514
00:47:55,618 --> 00:47:58,370
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

515
00:47:58,537 --> 00:48:03,167
What do all men with power want?
More power.

516
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:06,962
Be there at that exact time...

517
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:09,673
...and you will have a chance.

518
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:12,593
We must go.

519
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,890
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

520
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:21,227
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

521
00:48:21,393 --> 00:48:24,021
But for what it's worth...

522
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:28,567
...you've made a believer out of me.

523
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:31,820
Good luck, kiddo.

524
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:53,801
Mr. Anderson.

525
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:56,720
Did you get my package?

526
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:58,931
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:02,810
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

528
00:49:03,018 --> 00:49:06,689
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:09,358
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:12,444
Our connection.

531
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:15,155
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:18,534
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

533
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:21,287
...something overwritten or copied.

534
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:24,039
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

535
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:27,167
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,919
And what reason is that?

537
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:33,132
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:36,427
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:39,930
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

540
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,891
...but it happened anyway.

541
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:45,603
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:51,901
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

543
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:54,945
...but I didn't.

544
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:59,116
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

545
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:02,953
...compelled to disobey.

546
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:07,124
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:11,045
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:14,298
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:50:14,465 --> 00:50:19,094
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:20,763
Congratulations.

551
00:50:21,472 --> 00:50:23,724
Thank you.

552
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:28,729
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

553
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:33,817
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:50:33,984 --> 00:50:38,656
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:42,576
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:45,996
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

557
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:50,793
- ...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,837
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:55,756
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:50:55,923 --> 00:51:00,427
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,930
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:07,309
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:11,188
Purpose.

564
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:15,943
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:22,324
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:07,137
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:13,894
Me, me, me.

568
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:20,192
Me too.

569
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:23,691
More.

570
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:26,170
It is inevitable.

571
00:56:26,545 --> 00:56:27,922
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,590
Are you all right?

573
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,468
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:17,847
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

575
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:21,600
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:24,144
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:28,357
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

578
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:31,151
- ...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:57:32,027 --> 00:57:35,573
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:37,116
It felt like dying.

581
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:40,369
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:44,206
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

583
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,792
These points of intersection
are crucial...

584
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:49,628
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:53,674
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

586
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:57,344
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
00:57:57,511 --> 00:58:00,723
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

588
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,560
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:08,564
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:13,194
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,905
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

592
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:19,366
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

593
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,994
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:27,333
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:31,128
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

596
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,673
- ...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,051
It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

598
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:40,137
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:43,182
Careful, commander.

600
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,602
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:50,439
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:53,651
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:56,195
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

604
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:57,988
There's no need for such an order.

605
00:58:58,155 --> 00:59:01,534
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:07,039
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

607
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:11,168
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

608
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:16,048
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

609
00:59:16,257 --> 00:59:19,009
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:21,554
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,265
Is there another?

612
00:59:25,057 --> 00:59:28,561
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,563
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

614
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:32,147
...before I put you in one.

615
00:59:41,615 --> 00:59:43,284
Is there no other?

616
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:45,828
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

617
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:48,831
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:52,626
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

619
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,962
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
00:59:55,170 --> 01:00:00,009
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:00:04,555 --> 01:00:07,016
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:08,184
Why?

623
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:12,563
Because some things
never change, Jason...

624
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,940
...and some things do.

625
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,082
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:00:32,249 --> 01:00:34,460
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,170
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:38,172
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:41,884
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:43,969
Bad for us.

631
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,804
Here we go.

632
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:56,273
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:00:56,732 --> 01:01:00,402
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:01,529
Follow me.

635
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:28,264
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

636
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,807
Right?

637
01:01:29,974 --> 01:01:32,184
And the legendary Morpheus.

638
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:37,690
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

639
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:41,151
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

640
01:01:42,027 --> 01:01:45,197
Something to eat? Drink?

641
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:48,409
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

642
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:50,953
For the sake of appearances.

643
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,415
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

644
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:59,461
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

645
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:06,260
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

646
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:09,221
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

647
01:02:09,388 --> 01:02:13,392
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

648
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,603
...especially to curse with.

649
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,777
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

650
01:02:25,362 --> 01:02:27,031
You know why we are here.

651
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:33,370
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

652
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:39,376
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

653
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:42,046
We are looking for the Keymaker.

654
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:47,009
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

655
01:02:47,176 --> 01:02:49,970
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

656
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:53,766
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

657
01:02:53,933 --> 01:02:59,438
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

658
01:02:59,605 --> 01:03:02,650
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

659
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,818
But do you?

660
01:03:05,027 --> 01:03:07,279
You think you do, but you do not.

661
01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:10,491
You are here
because you were sent here.

662
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,661
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

663
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:17,039
It is, of course, the way of all things.

664
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:19,750
You see, there is only one constant...

665
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:23,921
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

666
01:03:24,088 --> 01:03:25,673
Causality.

667
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,008
Action, reaction.

668
01:03:28,217 --> 01:03:32,221
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

669
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:34,056
No. Wrong.

670
01:03:34,223 --> 01:03:38,644
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

671
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,771
...and those without.

672
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:45,317
Look there at that woman.

673
01:03:45,985 --> 01:03:49,738
My God, just look at her...

674
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:52,575
...affecting everyone around her.

675
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,288
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

676
01:03:57,538 --> 01:04:01,125
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

677
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:05,337
...a very special dessert.

678
01:04:09,508 --> 01:04:11,886
I wrote it myself.

679
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:15,097
It starts so simply...

680
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:19,685
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

681
01:04:20,686 --> 01:04:22,229
...poetry.

682
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:23,731
First...

683
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:29,445
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

684
01:04:29,987 --> 01:04:32,489
You can see it, Neo, yes?

685
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:35,576
She does not understand why.

686
01:04:35,826 --> 01:04:38,120
Is it the wine? No.

687
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,581
What is it then? What is the reason?

688
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:43,417
And soon it does not matter.

689
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:46,462
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

690
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:52,718
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

691
01:04:53,177 --> 01:04:56,096
And this is the nature of the universe.

692
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:58,724
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

693
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:01,352
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

694
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,356
Beneath our poised appearance...

695
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:10,569
...the truth is, we are completely...

696
01:05:13,364 --> 01:05:16,116
...out of control.

697
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:25,918
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

698
01:05:26,335 --> 01:05:31,549
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

699
01:05:31,715 --> 01:05:34,969
"Why" is what separates us from them...

700
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:37,346
...you from me.

701
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:41,100
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

702
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:44,436
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

703
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:47,273
Another link in the chain.

704
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:48,691
But fear not.

705
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:52,570
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

706
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:55,281
...I will tell you what to do next.

707
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:00,411
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

708
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:04,665
Her time is almost up.

709
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:09,086
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

710
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:11,630
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

711
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:17,887
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.

712
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:21,932
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

713
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:26,645
Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

714
01:06:26,812 --> 01:06:29,982
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

715
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:33,485
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

716
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:41,285
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

717
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:51,212
Well, that didn't go so well.

718
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:53,672
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

719
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,883
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

720
01:06:56,509 --> 01:06:57,801
Or didn't do something.

721
01:06:57,968 --> 01:07:01,055
No, what happened happened and couldn't
have happened any other way.

722
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:04,850
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

723
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,147
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

724
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:18,864
Get out.

725
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:26,789
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

726
01:07:27,373 --> 01:07:32,628
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

727
01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:36,924
He was so different.

728
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:41,136
He was like you.

729
01:07:43,764 --> 01:07:47,393
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

730
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:50,312
- What?
- A kiss.

731
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:51,730
Excuse me?

732
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:56,944
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

733
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:02,241
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

734
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,368
It's all over you both.

735
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:09,331
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

736
01:08:10,624 --> 01:08:16,130
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

737
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,132
Just a sample.

738
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,177
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

739
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:28,058
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

740
01:08:28,225 --> 01:08:30,311
Why should we trust you?

741
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:34,315
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

742
01:08:41,113 --> 01:08:43,157
All right.

743
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:47,119
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

744
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,247
All right.

745
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:58,088
Terrible. Forget it.

746
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:02,301
Wait.

747
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:04,678
Okay.

748
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:42,216
Yes.

749
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,177
That's it.

750
01:09:59,358 --> 01:10:04,530
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

751
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:08,742
Come with me.

752
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:40,232
Not again.

753
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:46,030
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

754
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:48,949
These fellas work for my husband.

755
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:52,786
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

756
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:54,413
Aren't you, boys?

757
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,581
Yes, mistress.

758
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:58,334
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

759
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,505
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

760
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:08,010
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

761
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:12,056
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

762
01:11:16,602 --> 01:11:19,688
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

763
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:22,316
...or you can stay there and die.

764
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,069
He's in the ladies' room!

765
01:11:30,908 --> 01:11:32,743
Hurry.

766
01:11:57,268 --> 01:12:00,312
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

767
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,314
I've been waiting for you.

768
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:12,408
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

769
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:19,290
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

770
01:12:19,456 --> 01:12:22,293
There is no cause for this. What cause?

771
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:26,589
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

772
01:12:26,755 --> 01:12:29,341
Lipstick? Lipstick.

773
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:33,179
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

774
01:12:34,847 --> 01:12:37,391
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

775
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:42,730
Woman, this is nothing.

776
01:12:42,938 --> 01:12:48,235
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

777
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:50,321
Have fun.
