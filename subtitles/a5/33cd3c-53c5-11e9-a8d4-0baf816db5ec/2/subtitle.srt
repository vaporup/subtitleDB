1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
All right.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,029
All right.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,950
Let us find out where this goes.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,870
You two, get the Keymaker.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,029
That's a nice trick.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,420
I cannot go back.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,870
I'll handle them.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,230
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,029
Okay, you have some skill.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,029
Kill him.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,710
You see? He's just a man.

12
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,550
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

13
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,430
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

14
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,590
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

15
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:39,220
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

16
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,980
Close it, quick!

17
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,019
Could we move along?

18
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,940
Run!

19
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,459
Step away from the door.

20
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,569
We owe you for that.

21
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:23,859
Just like new.

22
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,539
Drop your weapon.

23
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,459
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

24
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,099
He can handle himself.

25
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,099
Get in back.

26
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,340
Shit.

27
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,260
- Operator.
- Link, where am I?

28
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,859
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

29
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,340
- Really?
- Yes, It'll take me a while to get an exit.

30
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:24,809
- Oh Shit!
- What?

31
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,590
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

32
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:30,980
- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

33
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,580
- Operator.
- Get us out of here, Link.

34
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,380
- That won't be easy, sir.
- I know. We're inside the core network.

35
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,059
Yes, sir. The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.

36
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,220
- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,980
- Fine, we'll make it.
- Sir, I think I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

38
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,300
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

39
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,340
Hold on!

40
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,050
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.

41
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,860
Are you watching this, Link?

42
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,500
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

43
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,380
Any suggestions?

44
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,100
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

45
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,980
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

46
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,740
- Got it.
- Sir, are you sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

47
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,450
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?

48
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,940
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

49
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,490
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

50
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,740
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

51
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,420
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

52
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,460
Then let us hope...

53
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,940
...that I was wrong.

54
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,380
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

55
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,100
We've been sent to bring you in.

56
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,220
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

57
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,300
- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.

58
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,380
Repeat, they're approaching the...

59
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,460
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

60
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,419
Shots fired.

61
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,740
Move!

62
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:46,300
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

63
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,380
Trinity.

64
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:33,849
Get him out of here.

65
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:39,340
Come on!

66
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,099
Crush him.

67
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:27,330
Morpheus.

68
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,939
He's okay. Keep moving.

69
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,619
Let's go.

70
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,219
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

71
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,619
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

72
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,139
Wait.

73
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,859
Cancel that.

74
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,139
You are handy.

75
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,139
Jump on.

76
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,369
She means nothing.

77
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,539
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

78
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,899
One-Adam- 12, please respond.

79
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,739
Get down.

80
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,939
Gotcha.

81
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,699
She's good.

82
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,099
You are no longer necessary.

83
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:51,049
We do only what we're meant to do.

84
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:56,059
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

85
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,779
Go kick his ass.

86
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,419
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

87
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,539
What is that?

88
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,939
Yes! Yes!

89
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,340
Sir, we have confirmation from the Icarus.

90
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:34,179
The first two ships
are in position for counterattack.

91
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:35,409
Good.

92
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,369
Any change?

93
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,179
Looks like, they hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

94
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:43,340
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

95
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,939
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

96
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,299
Yes, sir.

97
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,739
There is a building.

98
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,340
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

99
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,340
...and no stair can reach.

100
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:35,820
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.

101
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:38,219
Hidden places.

102
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,020
But one door is special.

103
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,300
One door leads to the source.

104
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,540
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

105
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:01,020
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

106
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,830
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

107
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,859
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

108
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,259
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

109
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,340
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

110
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:18,219
But you'd have to take out a whole city block
to kill the power of a building like that.

111
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:21,929
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

112
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:25,099
There is a power station.

113
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,419
It must be destroyed.

114
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,739
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

115
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,929
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

116
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,820
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

117
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,340
What do you need us for?

118
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,580
Neo could take them both out
easier than we could.

119
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:45,419
- There's no time.
- Why?

120
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,580
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

121
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,939
But another connection
must first be made.

122
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:55,419
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.

123
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,099
Just over five minutes.

124
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,419
That is the length and breadth
of the window.

125
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,780
Only the One can open the door...

126
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,780
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

127
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:07,499
How do you know all this?

128
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,609
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

129
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:18,060
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

130
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,060
Neo, I know something's wrong.

131
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,659
You don't have to tell me.

132
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,419
I just want you to know that I'm here.

133
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,219
All must be done as one.

134
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,379
Can't hurt.

135
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,780
If one fails...

136
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,179
...all fail.

137
00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:00,179
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

138
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:04,619
At midnight, we will strike.

139
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:06,259
Hey!

140
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,209
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

141
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:22,099
Okay, they're inside.

142
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,649
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

143
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,300
Oh, shit.

144
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:36,780
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

145
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,300
Tonight is not an accident.

146
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,499
There are no accidents.

147
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,659
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

148
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,179
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

149
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:58,699
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

150
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,259
I see purpose.

151
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:09,939
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

152
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:14,899
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

153
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,259
...the very meaning of our lives.

154
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,419
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

155
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,820
I promise you, if I can, I will.

156
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,300
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

157
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,139
...no matter what...

158
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,540
...to stay out of the Matrix?

159
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,300
Why?

160
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:46,219
Please.

161
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:49,499
All right.

162
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:55,090
What is it, Niobe?

163
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:59,219
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

164
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:02,540
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

165
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:06,540
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

166
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:09,459
But how would that be different
from any other day?

167
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:24,780
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

168
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,820
Death can come for us at any time...

169
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,060
...in any place.

170
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,060
Incoming. Incoming!

171
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,499
Incoming!

172
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,540
Now consider the alternative.

173
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:48,099
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

174
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,499
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

175
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:56,300
Isn't that worth fighting for?

176
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:59,899
Isn't that worth dying for?

177
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,300
- Time?
- Three minutes.

178
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:04,530
Almost there.

179
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,099
It is done.

180
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,489
Find the others.

181
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,739
I got Niobe right there.
They're already out of the station.

182
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:32,469
- What about Soren?
- There.

183
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:34,379
They're still inside, but...

184
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:36,209
They're not moving.

185
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,219
That's it, let's go.

186
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,020
Call Neo now.

187
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,540
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

188
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:18,859
Everything is still operational.
The emergency system is already rerouting power.

189
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,379
Jesus.

190
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,419
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

191
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,459
The hell it is.

192
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,459
What are you...? Trinity!

193
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,540
I will not stand here and do nothing.
I will not wait here to watch them die.

194
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,780
Trinity, we're talking
less than five minutes here.

195
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:43,330
In five minutes,
I'll tear that whole goddam building down.

196
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:46,899
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

197
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:51,979
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

198
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,489
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

199
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,580
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow some wings.

200
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,419
- Operator.
- I'm in.

201
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,659
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

202
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:27,219
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

203
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:32,540
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

204
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:35,499
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

205
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:40,939
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

206
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,669
I want exactly what you want.

207
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,820
I want everything.

208
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,649
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

209
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,540
Go ahead, shoot.

210
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:55,780
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

211
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:10,179
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

212
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,979
Hold it right there, little lady.

213
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,659
If you can't beat us...

214
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,580
Join us.

215
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:28,699
Morpheus!

216
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:44,739
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

217
00:30:57,869 --> 00:30:58,899
One minute.

218
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,770
Come on.

219
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,739
Come on.

220
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,099
Please.

221
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,099
Kill them.

222
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:33,649
They're in.

223
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,699
I don't believe it.

224
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:52,659
It was meant to be.

225
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,979
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

226
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,540
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

227
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,859
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

228
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,340
Hello, Neo.

229
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,489
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

230
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:18,139
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

231
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:22,379
You have many questions. And though the
process has altered your consciousness...

232
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,459
...you remain irrevocably human.

233
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:28,060
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

234
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:32,340
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

235
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,050
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

236
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:38,459
Why am I here?

237
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:42,379
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

238
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,780
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

239
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:48,859
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

240
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,739
...l've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

241
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:56,179
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

242
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,739
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

243
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:03,179
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

244
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:07,129
...which has led you, inexorably...

245
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,259
...here.

246
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,340
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

247
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,129
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

248
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,820
Others? How many?
What others?

249
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,369
The Matrix is older than you know.

250
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,379
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

251
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,699
In which case, this is the sixth version.

252
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:31,219
Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

253
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,780
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

254
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,169
Either no one told me...

255
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,219
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

256
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,540
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

257
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,979
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

258
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,259
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

259
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,139
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

260
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,340
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

261
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,979
Choice.

262
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:01,899
The problem is choice.

263
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:26,699
The first Matrix I designed
was quite naturally perfect, a work of art.

264
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,619
Flawless, sublime.

265
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,139
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

266
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,090
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

267
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,459
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human being.

268
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:41,459
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

269
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:45,459
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

270
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:49,739
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

271
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,659
I have since come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

272
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,780
...because it required a lesser mind.

273
00:35:55,949 --> 00:36:01,659
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

274
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,300
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

275
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:11,060
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

276
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:16,939
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

277
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,739
- The Oracle.
- Please.

278
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,259
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution
whereby nearly 99 percent of all test subjects...

279
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:27,179
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

280
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:31,300
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

281
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:34,739
While this answer functioned,
it was obviously fundamentally flawed...

282
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,739
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

283
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:41,499
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system itself.

284
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,820
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

285
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:49,899
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

286
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,780
This is about Zion.

287
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:55,739
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

288
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:00,139
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

289
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,409
Bullshit.

290
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,619
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

291
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:11,009
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

292
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:15,020
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

293
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,449
The function of the One...

294
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:33,099
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a temporary dissemination of the code you carry...

295
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,899
...reinserting the prime program.

296
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,300
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

297
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:42,580
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

298
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:47,099
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

299
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,499
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

300
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:52,129
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

301
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,340
...will alternately result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

302
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:00,580
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

303
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:04,820
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

304
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,659
However the relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

305
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,259
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

306
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,899
It is interesting reading your reactions.

307
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:24,580
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

308
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:29,020
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

309
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:32,619
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

310
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,020
While the others experience this
in a general way...

311
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:38,020
...your experience is far more specific...

312
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,100
...vis-à-vis love.

313
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,620
Trinity!

314
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,980
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

315
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,330
No.

316
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,980
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

317
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,100
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

318
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,100
...as both beginning and end.

319
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,859
There are two doors.

320
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,100
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

321
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:14,700
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

322
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,060
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

323
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,580
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

324
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,660
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

325
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:31,850
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

326
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,460
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

327
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:42,859
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

328
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,620
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

329
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,330
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

330
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,660
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

331
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,180
We won't.

332
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,420
We got a serious situation, sir.

333
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,900
Oh, no.

334
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:12,500
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

335
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,780
Holy shit, he caught her.

336
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,900
Neo, I had to.

337
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,740
I know.

338
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,020
The bullet is still inside.

339
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,180
Trinity...

340
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,980
...don't you quit on me now.

341
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,250
I'm sorry.

342
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,700
Trinity.

343
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,140
Trinity...

344
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,020
...I know you can hear me.

345
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,220
I'm not letting go.

346
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,940
I can't.

347
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,220
I love you too damn much.

348
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,970
I can't take this.

349
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,540
I guess this makes us even.

350
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,580
I don't understand it.

351
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,620
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

352
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,700
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

353
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,580
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

354
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,900
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

355
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,859
- What?
- How do you know that?

356
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,260
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

357
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,940
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

358
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:37,780
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

359
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,900
The prophecy was a lie.

360
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,940
The One was never meant
to end anything.

361
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:49,020
It was all another system of control.

362
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,140
I don't believe that.

363
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,700
But you said it yourself.

364
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,700
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

365
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:06,980
I'm sorry.

366
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,379
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

367
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,580
...I swear to you it's the truth.

368
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,260
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

369
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,530
Oh, no!

370
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,700
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

371
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,379
It's a bomb.

372
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,620
We have to get out of here. Now.

373
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,620
I have dreamed a dream...

374
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:22,780
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

375
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,540
Here they come.

376
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,420
Let's go, Morpheus.

377
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,700
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

378
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,980
- Come on!
- Something's different.

379
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,060
What?

380
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,140
I can feel them.

381
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,660
Neo!

382
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,020
- What happened?
- I don't know.

383
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,900
It's the Hammer.

384
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:49,700
He's in some kind of coma...

385
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,020
...but his vitals are stable.

386
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,020
What about you?

387
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,220
I'm fine.

388
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,660
You could use some rest.

389
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,580
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

390
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,900
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

391
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,820
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

392
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,620
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

393
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,140
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

394
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,900
...until someone screwed it up.

395
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,580
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

396
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,420
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

397
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,660
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

398
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,540
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

399
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,060
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

400
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,900
Who?

401
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,609
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

402
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,980
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

403
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,220
You found one?

404
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,540
Only one.
