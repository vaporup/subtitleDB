1
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:11,182
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,519
Spring

3
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,853
Wake up.

4
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,538
- Master!
- Yes, my boy?

5
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,741
Where do you want to go?

6
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,414
- I want to pick herbs for medicine.
- Then let us go.

7
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,560
Come along.

8
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm going to pick herbs now, Master.

9
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,649
Watch out for snakes.

10
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,072
- Wait for me, Master.
- Yes.

11
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,123
I've picked a lot of herbs, Master.

12
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,685
- Really? You've picked a lot?
- Yes.

13
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,696
Careful!

14
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,047
Stop! Throw this away, my child.

15
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,723
Why? It looks the same.

16
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,462
Even though it looks the same,
this is a deadly plant.

17
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,621
The other one can save lives.

18
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,797
It still looks the same. How can I know?

19
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,967
Look closely.

20
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,338
Here at the tip you can see a white line.

21
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,077
If you ate this plant, you'd die.

22
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,048
You mustn't pick this sort of plant next time.

23
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,515
- Is this one all right to eat?
- Yes, this one is good.

24
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,808
Master, there is a stone on my back.
Please take it off.

25
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,418
Does it torment you?

26
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,120
Yes, Master.

27
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,424
Didn't you also do it to the fish?

28
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,359
Yes, Master.

29
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,228
- Didn't you also do it to the frog?
- Yes, Master.

30
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,499
Didn't you also do it to the snake?

31
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,094
Yes, Master.

32
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,698
Stand up!

33
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,807
Walk around!

34
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,418
I can't walk. It's too heavy.

35
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:50,523
How do you think the fish,
the frog and the snake endured it?

36
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,364
It was wrong to do it.

37
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,567
Go and find all the animals
and release them from the stones.

38
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,565
Then I will release you too.

39
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,866
But if any of the animals, the fish,
the frog or the snake is dead …

40
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,248
you will carry the stone in your heart …

41
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,814
for the rest of your life.

42
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,078
Summer

43
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,172
My daughter is sick.

44
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,914
This tree is over 300 years old.

45
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,721
You will become as healthy as this tree.

46
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,657
Greetings.

47
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,786
Come in.

48
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,946
Will she recover, Wise One?

49
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,379
I believe that her soul is suffering.

50
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:26,417
When she finds peace in her soul,
her body will return to health.

51
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,825
Please take care of her.

52
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,926
Excuse me.

53
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,690
You are not allowed to sit on that.

54
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,968
The master will be angry with you.

55
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,350
Why are you praying all of a sudden?
You usually never pray at this hour.

56
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,713
Would you like to come along?

57
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,081
Softly!

58
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,846
It must be prepared with a true heart.

59
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,107
Drink!

60
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,169
It will clear your head.

61
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,959
The boat is floating away!

62
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,821
Stop it!

63
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,878
Have you recovered now?

64
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,216
Yes, I have completely recovered.

65
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,584
Strange.

66
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,583
When I can't see you, I go insane.

67
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,426
What is wrong with me?

68
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,727
Cold! It's cold!

69
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,491
What shall I do?

70
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,899
I did wrong, Master. Forgive me.

71
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,642
That happens by itself. It is just nature.

72
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,613
Are you still sick?

73
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,585
No.

74
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,484
Then it was the right medicine.

75
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,064
Now that you have recovered,
you can leave this place.

76
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,463
No, Master! She can't!

77
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,226
Lust awakens the desire to possess.

78
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,665
And that awakens the intent to murder.

79
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,603
Get in.

80
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,523
Fall

81
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:52,972
That was tiring, huh?

82
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:36,057
Man, 30, Flees After Murdering Wife

83
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,551
You have grown a lot!

84
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,924
Get in!

85
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:54,614
So?

86
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,992
Have you led a happy life up till now?

87
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,590
Tell me something interesting
about your life.

88
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,892
The world of men has grown agonizing
for you, hasn't it?

89
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:11,469
Leave me alone, Master.
Can you not see that I am suffering?

90
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,599
What causes you to suffer?

91
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,970
My only sin was to love.
I wanted nothing except her.

92
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,041
So?

93
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,347
She went with another man.

94
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,744
Ah, that was it.

95
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,155
How can that be?
She said that she'd love only me.

96
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,948
- And then?
- I couldn't bear it anymore.

97
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,024
Didn't you know beforehand
how the world of men is?

98
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:37,923
Sometimes we have to let go
of things we like.

99
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:41,134
What you like, others will also like!

100
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,467
But still, how could she do that?

101
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,107
The bitch!

102
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:50,510
- Is it so unbearable for you?
- Yes!

103
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:31,324
Shut

104
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,260
Young fool!

105
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,986
Young fool!

106
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,400
Though you can so easily kill …

107
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,669
you yourself cannot be easily killed.

108
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,932
Carve out all of these characters
with the knife.

109
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:03,074
And while you cut out each one …

110
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,108
drive out the anger from your heart.

111
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,303
Holy one!

112
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,645
Holy one!

113
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,411
We've come to investigate something.

114
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,834
- Drop the knife!
- Otherwise I'll shoot!

115
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,710
What are you doing? Continue cutting!

116
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,697
Prajñāpāramitā Sutra.
It helps restore inner peace.

117
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,966
Please let him finish.

118
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,331
How long will it take?

119
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,036
Until tomorrow morning.

120
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:04,883
No connection.

121
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,052
- No?
- It's quite a deep valley, isn't it?

122
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,575
What?

123
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,312
They make white paint from these mussels.

124
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,371
I know.

125
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,445
Stand up.

126
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,988
It's time to go.

127
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,593
Detective Choi …

128
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,155
let's go as we are.

129
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,263
Detective Chi, the boat won't go forwards.

130
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,303
Ah, now it's moving.

131
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:55,248
Shut

132
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:02,415
Winter

133
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,789
… and Spring
