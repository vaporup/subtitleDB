1
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,392
Lornsome night.

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:04,189
Babbits bawlin', wind bitin' the bone.

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,943
Wind like this...

4
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,154
full of voices.

5
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,367
Ancestry howlin' at ya,

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,453
yibberin' stories.

7
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:25,294
All voices... tied up in't'one.

8
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,133
One voice different...

9
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,427
One voice,

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,475
whisperin' out there,
spyin' from the dark.

11
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:44,313
That fangy devil,

12
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,317
Ol' Georgie himself.

13
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,656
Now you hear up close,

14
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:58,786
and I'll yarn you about
the first time we met,

15
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,205
eye to eye.

16
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:09,340
<i>And thus it was that I made the
acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose,</i>

17
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,217
<i>the man I hoped might
cure me of my affliction.</i>

18
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,190
Have you lost something?

19
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,860
Question one.

20
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:36,075
What secret in Sixsmith's report
would be worth killing for?

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,701
Question two.

22
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:42,956
Is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret?

23
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:45,959
And if so, question three.

24
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:48,004
What the fuck am I doing here?

25
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:53,217
<i>While my extensive
experience as an editor</i>

26
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,552
<i>has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks</i>

27
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:58,598
<i>and flashforwards, and all
such tricksy gimmicks,</i>

28
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,017
<i>I believe that if you, dear reader,</i>

29
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:04,187
<i>can extend your patience
for a just a moment,</i>

30
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:08,233
<i>you will find there is a method
to this tale of madness.</i>

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,194
<i>My dearest Sixsmith,</i>

32
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,656
<i>I shot myself through the roof
of my mouth this morning,</i>

33
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:16,491
<i>with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger.</i>

34
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:23,790
<i>A true suicide is a paced,
disciplined certainty.</i>

35
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:29,921
<i>People pontificate "suicide
is an coward's act".</i>

36
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,507
<i>Couldn't be further from the truth.</i>

37
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:35,469
<i>Suicide takes tremendous courage.</i>

38
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,224
Any problem, sir,
you just hit this button.

39
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,309
Thank you.

40
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:52,820
On behalf of my Ministry,
and the future of Unanimity,

41
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:56,323
I would like to thank you
for this final interview.

42
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,293
– Hello.
– Press pass.

43
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,670
Expecting trouble?

44
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:14,216
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher,
not his shrink or his astrologer,

45
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,427
and the ruddy, bloody truth is,

46
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:20,265
I had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night.

47
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,770
This beach was once
a cannibal's banqueting hall,

48
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:29,900
where the strong gorged on the weak,
but the teeth, sir, they spat out,

49
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:33,820
like you or I would
expel a cherry stone.

50
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:39,326
Do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn?

51
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:44,081
Remember this is not
an interrogation or a trial.

52
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:48,835
Your version of the truth
is all that matters.

53
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:52,172
Truth is singular.

54
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:56,802
Its "versions" are... mistruths.

55
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:00,972
<i>Don't let them say
I killed myself for love.</i>

56
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,268
<i>Had my infatuations, but we
both know in our hearts</i>

57
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:08,147
<i>who is the sole love
of my short, bright life.</i>

PACIFIC ISLANDS, 1849

60
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:38,261
There you are, Mr. Ewing,

61
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:41,973
as binding a covenant
there can ever be between men...

62
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,183
outside the province of Scripture.

63
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,184
Thank you, Reverend Horrox, I...

64
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,981
know my father-in-law is
profoundly excited about this deal.

65
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:51,775
Haskell Moore is a great man.

66
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,695
Future generations depend
on men like him,

67
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,614
men capable of speaking the truth.

68
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,074
Quite.

69
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,873
When I first encountered
Haskell Moore's writing,

70
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:09,960
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation.

71
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,418
The learned doctor here and I,

72
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,881
already spent many a night
debating Mr. Moore's tractus.

73
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,271
I'm only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case

74
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,636
as to why we are sitting here,
enjoying this divine lamb,

75
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:24,058
while Kupaka stands
there, contempt to serve.

76
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,435
Indeed, ain'it.
Uh, Kupaka...

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,272
you enjoy your life here
with us, do you not?

78
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,442
Oh, yes, Reverend, sir.

79
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,486
Kupaka very happy here.

80
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,863
See, you see, this is Moore's
ladder of civilization.

81
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,324
The reason behind this natural order...

82
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,909
Please, Giles, do shut up.

83
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,411
I've been listening to
this for weeks, I...

84
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,790
would love to know what his own
son-in-law has to say about it.

85
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:48,958
Let's see...

86
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:53,463
It is an inquiry concerning
God's will and the nature of men.

87
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:56,007
And what does he have to say
about the nature of women?

88
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,388
I'm afraid that's a subject
he prefers to pass by in silence.

89
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,848
He wouldn't be the first.

90
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,101
Uh, prey, Mr. Ewing, continue.

91
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,688
Well, uh... the question
he does pose is...

92
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:13,982
if God created the world, how do
we know what things we can change,

93
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:17,780
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable?

94
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:23,035
Reverend Horrox' real specific
how to run plantation.

95
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,496
Georgian way best way he say.

96
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,332
God, this heat is unbearable.
How do they take it?

97
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,292
Reverend Horrox say

98
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,337
slaves like camel, bred for desert.

99
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:37,341
He say... they not feel
heat like civilized folk.

100
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,885
Now we should get you out of the sun.

101
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,807
Now what... what is that noise?

102
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:52,210
– Ah, there you are.
– What happened?

103
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:57,507
It is as I suspected.
Gusano Coco Cervello,

104
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:59,759
better known as the Polynesian worm.

105
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:03,012
Once saw a man's brain after
the worm had finished with him...

106
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,806
maggoty cauliflower. Ooph.

107
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:10,937
But have no fear, this particular
devil and I... are well acquainted.

108
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:15,733
Here we go.
Ah, yes, yes, all gone.

109
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:23,408
I-I don't know what I would have
done had our paths not crossed.

110
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,326
Well for starters, you would have died.

111
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,957
I... I shall find a way to repay you.

112
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:34,628
Oh, unnecessary, I assure you.
I am a doctor, Adam.

113
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,464
A tiger cannot change its stripes.

114
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,675
CAMBRIDGE, 1936

115
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:45,347
<i>Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me.</i>

116
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,184
<i>Mr. Frobisher.</i>

117
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:54,148
<i>Mr. Robert Frobisher!</i>

118
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,611
The management would like
a word with you, please, sir.

119
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,368
<i>Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!</i>

120
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:11,081
I do know you're in there, Mr. Frobisher,
please, comply.

121
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:18,381
A letter is being drafted
to your father, sir.

122
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,061
<i>Mr. Frobisher!</i>

123
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:36,232
<i>Hated leaving you like that.
Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.</i>

124
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:44,282
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be on my way to Edinburgh,</i>

125
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:47,160
<i>on my way to fame and fortune.</i>

126
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,372
<i>I know you haven't heard of him,
but trust me,</i>

127
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:54,417
<i>Vyvyan Ayrs is one of
the musical greats, Sixsmith.</i>

128
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:58,463
<i>The tragedy is that he hasn't produced
any new work in years due to illness.</i>

129
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,177
<i>My scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis,</i>

130
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:06,055
<i>and aid him in the creation
of a masterpiece,</i>

131
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,099
<i>before shooting up through
the musical firmament,</i>

132
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,936
<i>eventually obliging
Pater to admit that yes,</i>

133
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:15,438
<i>the son he disinherited is none
other than Robert Frobisher,</i>

134
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,818
<i>the greatest British composer of his time.</i>

135
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:23,322
<i>I know, Sixsmith, you groan and
shake your head, but you smile too,</i>

136
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,157
<i>which is why I love you.</i>

137
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:27,618
<i>P.S.:</i>

138
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,162
<i>Thanks for the waistcoat.</i>

139
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,208
<i>I needed something of yours
to keep me company.</i>

140
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,628
St. George and the Dragon.

141
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:42,174
Reminds me that composing is a crusade.

142
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,845
Sometimes you slay the dragon,

143
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,390
sometimes the dragon slays you.

144
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:51,018
Alright, then.

145
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,520
Frobisher, is it?

146
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,857
I trust Mackerras told
you enough to be useful.

147
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,901
I've had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months,

148
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,779
let's see if you can get it down.

149
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,754
Subtle grace note before the third.

150
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:26,887
Soft and simple. Got it?
Now, it gets interesting.

151
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:38,900
Good.

152
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,568
Play that back.

153
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,572
Would love to, sir.

154
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,286
Um... what key are we in?

155
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,122
What key?
G minor, of course.

156
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,208
And the time signature?

157
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,044
For Christ's sake, did you hear it or not?

158
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:01,255
– Just... just need a little more time.
– You need?

159
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,258
My dear boy, who is working for whom here?

160
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,969
– I apologize, sir...
– Are you an amanuensis or an apologist?

161
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:07,929
Now pay attention.

162
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,098
Three-four, changes to
four-four on fourth bar

163
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,766
and back to three-four on bar five,

164
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,602
if you can count that high.

165
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,524
Crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat
G quaver, then E-flat on the down beat.

166
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:22,277
And so on.

167
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,780
Alright, let me hear you.

168
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,977
Stop, please! You're hurting me!

169
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,273
You must have misheard me,
I said I had a melody not a malady!

170
00:13:58,314 --> 00:13:59,733
Vyvyan...

171
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:02,235
Jocasta, deliver me!

172
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:06,406
– What's going on in here?
– An exercise in futility.

173
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:07,782
Should I be introduced?

174
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,994
There's really no point,
the boy is useful as the clap.

175
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,788
Fortunately, he'll be much
easier to get rid of.

176
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,708
Would you be a dear
and get Henry to show the boy out.

177
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,877
Yes, of course, darling.

178
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,771
That's beautiful.

179
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,066
Yes...

180
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,237
That's it.
That's my melody!

181
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,659
SAN FRANCISCO, 1973

182
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:54,288
Com'on, Luisa, we're made to be together!

183
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:56,832
Luisa, Luisa, com'on, com'on,
I'm telling you,

184
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,335
I'm telling you baby,
you can't leave me. It's a...

185
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:01,879
Don't know if it's a past life thing
or a future life thing,

186
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:03,255
but you know, you and me...

187
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:07,718
Look. For the last hour, all I could think
about was throwing you off the balcony.

188
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:10,221
Well then who the hell you think you are?

189
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:13,641
You write a bullshit
column for a fucking rag.

190
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,309
Elevator!

191
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,314
Thank you.

192
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:27,406
Nice to know the age
of chivalry isn't dead.

193
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:43,046
You okay?

194
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,799
No bones broken, I think.

195
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:50,470
No, no, no, you sit... you sit yourself.
Let me see.

196
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:02,441
Great. Power outage.

197
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:06,319
Perfect end to a perfect day.

198
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,786
Still glad the age of chivalry isn't dead?

199
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:19,208
I'd still rather be right here
than back up there.

200
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,378
Guess Mr. Kipin isn't
everyone's cup of tea.

201
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:26,215
Guys like that are just
an occupational hazard.

202
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:32,096
– You were interviewing him?
– Yeah, for Spyglass magazine.

203
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,016
Luisa Rey.

204
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,101
Rufus Sixsmith.

205
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,187
Rey...

206
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:45,443
You wouldn't happen to be related
to the journalist Lester Rey?

207
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:48,654
Yeah.
He was my father.

208
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:53,159
Really? He must have been
enormously proud of you,

209
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:55,328
– following in his footsteps.
– Hmm.

210
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:00,417
That's her. My niece, Megan.

211
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,294
She's lovely!

212
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:06,673
Born physicist, with a better mind
for mathematics than I ever had.

213
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,677
Did her PhD at Cambridge,
a woman at Caius!

214
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:13,472
Gives you hope for the world.

215
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:18,310
It's hot.

216
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,857
And we're still here.

217
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:35,160
That's a very peculiar birthmark.

218
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:39,790
Yeah.
My little comet.

219
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,044
My mother was sure it was cancer,

220
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,213
she wanted me to get it removed, but...

221
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,924
don't know. I kinda like it.

222
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,178
I knew someone who had
a birthmark that was...

223
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,098
– similar to that.
– Really?

224
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,766
Who was it?

225
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,729
Someone I cared about very much.

226
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:09,195
A uh... a hypothetical
question for you, Miss Rey.

227
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,574
As a journalist,

228
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:15,702
what price would you pay
to protect the source?

229
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,620
Any.

230
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:19,622
Prison?

231
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,877
If it came to that, yes.

232
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,338
Would you be prepared to...

233
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,466
compromise your safety?

234
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,389
My father braved booby-trapped marshes and

235
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,769
the wrath of generals
for his journalistic integrity.

236
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,732
What kind of daughter would I be if I
bailed when things got a little tough?

237
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,166
Saved.

238
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,293
Taxi!

239
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,547
– You sure you don't need a cab?
– No, I've got my car.

240
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:14,262
Well, you know if... there's ever
something I can do for you,

241
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,181
please give me a call.

242
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,975
Thank you, I will.

243
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:20,560
Bye.

244
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:26,274
LONDON, 2012

245
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,902
<i>It was the night of the Lemon Prizes,</i>

246
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:32,948
<i>and in its two lead forced duality,</i>

247
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:36,159
<i>I recall a moment of introspection.</i>

248
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:42,582
<i>Why. Why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher?</i>

249
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,877
<i>This was the precise moment
that Dermot found me.</i>

250
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,588
– Oy, Timothy.
– Aah, Dermot.

251
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:51,425
<i>Bad news inexorably does.</i>

252
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,759
Fockin' waste.

253
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,679
Never forget Herman Melville,

254
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,600
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed,

255
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:02,854
and yet today, it is lugged
around in the backpacks

256
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:05,231
of every serious student
of literature in the world.

257
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,357
I don't give a fock what
happens when I'm dead,

258
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,193
I want people to buy me book now!

259
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:13,322
Well, as your publisher, obviously
nothing would make me happier.

260
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:15,700
But sadly, for whatever reason,

261
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:18,453
"Knuckle Sandwich" has yet
to connect to its audience.

262
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,663
You want a reason? I'll give you a reason.

263
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:23,541
– Right there!
– Aah. You mean Mr. Finch?

264
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,501
Felix fockin' Finch!

265
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:30,631
That cunt that shat all over me book
in his poncy fockin' magazine!

266
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,134
– It wasn't that bad!
– No?

267
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:40,601
"Mr. Hoggins should apologize to
the trees failed for the making of his

268
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:44,980
bloated autobio novel.
Four hundred vain-glorious pages

269
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:49,818
expire in an ending that is flat
and inane beyond belief."

270
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:55,657
Steady now, Dermot. What is a critic
but one who reads quickly,

271
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:58,994
arrogantly, but never wisely.

272
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,959
Fock it.

273
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,045
Dermot!

274
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,431
Ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,727
We have an additional award tonight,
fellow book faeries.

276
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:27,148
An award for "most eminent critic".

277
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:30,318
Mr... oh, beg pardon,

278
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:35,740
SIR! Felix Finch.
O, B and E!

279
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,789
And what might my prize be, I wonder?

280
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:46,918
A signed copy of an
unpulped "Knuckle Sandwich"?

281
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,337
Can't be many of those left.

282
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,384
Well...

283
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,138
Just what does that lead-less
pencil you call an imagination

284
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:02,809
have in mind to end this scene. Hmm?

285
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:10,526
I think you're gonna love this one.

286
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:24,457
Now, that's an ending that is
flat n'inane beyond belief.

287
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,880
<i>My thoughts?</i>

288
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:34,633
<i>If I'm honest, I admit that the
obvious emotions like shock</i>

289
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:37,970
<i>and horror flew as Finch had,
here and gone.</i>

290
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,014
Tequila, couple of fingers.

291
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:44,267
<i>While deep down,
I experienced a nascent sense</i>

292
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:48,439
<i>of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn.</i>

293
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:54,780
<i>Overnight, Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man.</i>

294
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:04,581
<i>"Knuckle Sandwich" shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months.</i>

295
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:08,085
<i>I was for the briefest
of moments, Cinderella,</i>

296
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,923
<i>and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror</i>

297
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:15,342
<i>of my dream come true.</i>

298
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:21,723
– What the fuck...
– Tim-o-tee Cavendish... oy presume.

299
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,308
Caught wi' your cacks down!

300
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:27,353
Uh, my office hours are eleven to two,
and my secretary

301
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:30,482
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire.

302
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,608
Friends like us don't
need appointments.

303
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,403
We like it all cozy like this.

304
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:38,281
– Visited Dermot in the joint.
– Our brother's got a question for you.

305
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:41,327
Where's our focking money?

306
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:45,373
Boys. Boys, look here.

307
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:48,750
Dermot signed what we call
a copyright transfer contract,

308
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,211
which means that legally...

309
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:55,091
Dermot didn't sign a fockin' contract
for the event of a fockin' season!

310
00:23:55,216 --> 00:24:00,555
Er, Perhap-perhaps... er, we could
moot a provisional sum...

311
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:03,213
as a basis for on-going negotiation.

312
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,382
Okeydokey.

313
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:09,188
What sum we gonna moot?

314
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,691
Fifty K will do for starters.

315
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,526
Fifty sounds reasonable.

316
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,403
Tomorrow afternoon.

317
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,405
Tomorrow afternoon?

318
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,200
– Cash.
– No bullocks.

319
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:21,416
– No checks.
– Old fashioned money.

320
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,908
Gentlemen...

321
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:25,497
– The law says...
– The law?!

322
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:35,507
What'd the law do
for Felix fockin' Finch?

323
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,431
NEO SEOUL 2144

324
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:49,271
Ordinarily, I begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories...

325
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:54,610
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future.

326
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,988
Fabricants have no such
memories, Archivist.

327
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:03,911
One twenty-four hour cycle in Papa
Song's is identical to every other.

<i>It is unfortunate that the officials of
the Unanimity can only speak one language.</i>

331

As an officer of Unanimity, I am of
course restricted from using sub speak.

332
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:19,594
Of course.

Please describe a typical
twenty-four hour Papa Song cycle.

334
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,147
At hour four, each server
is woken by auto-stimulin.

335
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,739
From revival, we proceed to the hygiener.

336
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,747
After dressing, we file into the dinery.

337
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:59,051
At hour five, we man our stations
to greet the new day's consumers.

338
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:01,094
Welcome to Papa Song's.

339
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:06,392
For the next nineteen hours,
we input orders, tray food, vend drinks,

340
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,438
upstock condiments, wipe tables,
and bin garbage,

341
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,524
all done in strict adherence
to First Catechism.

00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:18,362
What is the First Catechism?

343
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,614
"Honor Thy Consumer."

344
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,243
After the final cleaning,

345
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:28,122
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box.

346
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:31,917
That is the blueprint
of every single day.

347
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,671
Did you ever think about the future?

348
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:42,054
Papa Song servers have
just one possible future.

349
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,890
You mean "Exultation".

350
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:47,893
Could you describe this
annual Rite of Passage?

351
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:53,982
On first day, Seer Rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars.

352
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:58,111
Twelve stars meant an end to our contract.

353
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:02,282
How did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend?

354
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:03,950
Excitement.

355
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:06,453
I was happy for them,

356
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:08,580
but envious as well.

357
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:12,125
Did your sister servers feel as you did?

358
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,712
Most of them.

359
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:21,468
I would like to ask about
the infamous Yoona-939.

360
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:04,512
If Yoona-939 woke you,
who woke her?

361
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,182
Seer Rhee.

362
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:10,352
Why would Seer wake a server?

363
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:13,605
Perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.

364
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,903
What's wrong with him?

365
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,533
He drinks soap.

366
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,536
It makes him happy.

367
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:33,250
Then he sleep like us in our box.

368
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:45,387
Do you ever think about... what it must
be like, up there with the consumers?

369
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,809
Third Catechism forbids such questions.

370
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:54,105
Yes. It does.

371
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:58,109
Come. Let me show you a secret.

372
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:02,864
<i>Platform four, Lost and Found.</i>

373
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:20,173
Now... Sonmia,

374
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:25,845
we are inside a secret.

375
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,976
A Kino?

376
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,607
– We are not allowed.
– Sonmia, no one will ever know.

377
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:38,442
Come.

378
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,875
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

379
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,337
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

380
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:06,274
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

381
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,474
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

382
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,270
You could have been excised.

383
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,481
How did you justify
such a risk to yourself?

384
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,025
She was my friend.

385
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,158
Please describe the events of
September 18th from your perspective.

386
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,870
I was stationed at pedestal one.

387
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,398
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse!

388
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:42,235
<i>Step away. Code yellow,
the area is secured.</i>

389
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,367
Hawaiian Islands
106 WINTERS AFTER THE FALL

390
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:54,373
<i>Nay, this life all rot n' lockin'
no smile a' some yawnee.</i>

391
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:59,545
<i>In rear's time, I ever fest
the secret of Sloosha's hallow.</i>

392
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,758
<i>Adam, my bro' by law, n' his son n' me
been trekkin' back from Honokaa Market.</i>

393
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:11,598
<i>It was Adam's custom to cult out
his ancestry with offerin's n' honorin's.</i>

394
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:25,195
<i>Suddenwise, that fangy
devil's eyes, I felt'em.</i>

395
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:30,993
Who there?

396
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:42,255
Ooh, a darky spot you're in, friend.

397
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,298
Ol' Georgie...

398
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:47,313
Ain't no blade can protect you
from the True-True.

399
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,590
'Pa!

400
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:55,935
Jonas. Jonas, go.
Go, go!

401
00:32:57,687 --> 00:33:00,190
Zachary!
Zachary?

402
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:01,983
Zachary!!

403
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:15,955
Stay here, safe here...

404
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:24,799
Kona will be feastin' on Adam
n' his boy by sunup.

405
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:33,474
You say it all the time, ain'ya?

406
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,311
"The Weak are Meat, the Strong do Eat."

407
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,447
The True-truth, what that is.

408
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:07,134
<i>Whole valley whisperin' about
the blood o' Adam and his son on my hands.</i>

409
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:10,929
<i>But Rose and Catkin never
believed those rumors, and stood by me.</i>

410
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:15,308
– Uncle Zach, look!
– Yeah, I see them.

411
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:19,312
<i>Prescients come batterin' twice a year,</i>

412
00:34:19,354 --> 00:34:21,565
<i>their ships creep-crawlin' on the waves,</i>

413
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,860
<i>just floatin' on the Smart o' the Old Uns.</i>

414
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:28,739
Barter'll be startin' soon.

415
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,284
Yeah. We must go find ya' Ma.

416
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,377
What are you doin'?

417
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,299
Ma says ya ain't been
right since Sloosha's.

418
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,762
She say we gotta keep out our eyes on ya.

419
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,932
You mindin' me, while I mind the goats?

420
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:58,644
I see.

421
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:03,608
Stump is, who's gonna mind
your Ma at the Barter?

422
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:06,402
She got no tongue for hagglin',
not like you and me.

423
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,945
Sure you alright?

424
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,782
Swear by. Be home for suppin'.

425
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:18,081
<i>Why words slink n' slide off a tongue,
when we need them most?</i>

426
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:20,917
<i>If my tongue'd been more bold,</i>

427
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,921
<i>could I have stopped all that
diresome's about to happen?</i>

428
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:30,134
– Uncle Zach!
– Thi's my big bro I yawned you about.

429
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:33,806
– What's about, sis?
– Special guest hosting.

430
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,975
Thank you for the kindsome hostin'
in the Valley's day.

431
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,311
I ain't saysoe this, Rose.

432
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:43,690
– Abbess saysoe a gift of great honor.
– She can be hostin' then?

433
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,737
I brin' you gift, Zachry.

434
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,449
Need no gift from the stranger.

435
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:59,248
<i>Now kin n' bros n' half-strangers, yay,
even the Abbess, they all come knockin',</i>

436
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:03,460
<i>they gaped in wonderment like
Sonmi herself was sittin' in our kitchen.</i>

437
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,174
<i>Questions about Prescience n' their
whoahsome Ship poured thick n'fast.</i>

438
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:12,094
How your ship's slidin',
glides so silent n'...

439
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,846
Fusion engines.

440
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:17,640
<i>No one queried what fusion engine was,</i>

441
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,770
<i>cos they didn't want to look
stupid in front o' the gatherin'.</i>

442
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,397
Fusion engines...

443
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:26,276
<i>True really was, Meronym
answered the questions,</i>

444
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,945
<i>but no answer ever quenched your curio.</i>

445
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:32,991
<i>All o' that answerin' done was
teach everyone to not trust her,</i>

446
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:34,534
<i>nay, not a flea...</i>

447
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,747
She's lyin'....

448
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,834
Schemin' and wormin' herself in.

449
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,880
Watch her, watch her close.

450
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:51,301
She's got secrets.

451
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:39,225
Zachry Bailey?

452
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:41,852
Sorrysome for wakin'
you up but... a dream.

453
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,438
Some diresome's gonna happen.

454
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:45,856
Come in, come in.

455
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:50,570
Ooh, let Sonmi guide your heart.

456
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:54,074
Ohh, I gonna hear it for us,

457
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,576
I'm prayin' for you.

458
00:37:56,998 --> 00:38:01,331
Ooh, Old Georgie's
hungerin' for your soul.

459
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:03,375
Ooh, I knew it.

460
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:07,129
Spit a cuss on your dreams.

461
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:17,848
"Bridge is broken, hide below"

462
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,642
"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"

463
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:24,688
"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"

464
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:27,691
An augurin'...

465
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:35,908
Trust Sonmi...

466
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:42,623
Keep her warnin' with you,
nail it to your memory.

467
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:48,087
Thank you. Thank you, Abbess.
Thank you.

468
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:17,367
Wait! Wait.

469
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:21,371
There's... no reason to hide.

470
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:28,045
I know you are... Sonmi-451.

471
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:33,425
My name is... Hae-Ju Zheng.

472
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,679
What has happened to Seer Rhee?

473
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:40,182
Soap overdose.

474
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:44,728
It is unfortunate that it had to happen
with everything gone so well.

475
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,563
Cos now it is probable
that the Enforcers

476
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,317
and the DNA sniffers
will find out about you.

477
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:52,486
And if they do...

478
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:56,657
if they realize your connection
to Yoona-939, you will be excised.

479
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,411
But you have a choice.

480
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:05,667
You can remain here
and risk being discovered,

481
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:09,879
or you can come with me.

482
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,978
– Bear away, boy.
– Aye, aye captain.

483
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:32,110
<i>Friday the 15th. We made sail
with the morning tide.</i>

484
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:35,697
<i>Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.</i>

485
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:40,243
<i>I have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew.</i>

486
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:44,247
<i>Henry argued in vain that the
Polynesian worm was not contagious.</i>

487
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:45,749
<i>Not that it matters.</i>

488
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:47,249
<i>All I want to do now is return home</i>

489
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,503
<i>and unburden myself
from this responsibility.</i>

490
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:56,385
<i>My dear Sixsmith, I am in
desperate need of your help.</i>

491
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,597
<i>After my last letter, I'm sure
you're rushing to pack your bags,</i>

492
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:01,182
<i>but you needn't, really.</i>

493
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:06,187
<i>Unless of course, you wish to witness
the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.</i>

494
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:14,904
<i>Is it not miraculous how one's fortune
can turn so quickly, so completely.</i>

495
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:18,240
<i>One moment, leaping from
a hotel window, the next</i>

496
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:22,369
<i>gainfully employed by one of the
world's greatest living composers.</i>

497
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:26,665
<i>My only problem is that I
accidentally got hooked on a journal</i>

498
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,626
<i>written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage</i>

499
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,339
<i>from the Pacific islands
to San Francisco.</i>

500
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,092
<i>To my great annoyance,
the pages cease mid-sentence.</i>

501
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,261
<i>Half the book is missing.
It's completely killing me.</i>

502
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,264
<i>Could you be a mensch and when
you're next foraging</i>

503
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,308
<i>at Otto's Book's, make an inquiry?</i>

504
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:49,481
<i>A half finished book is, after all,
a half finished love affair.</i>

505
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:59,199
America loves oil.

506
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:02,744
America is addicted to oil.

507
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:07,499
Some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas.

508
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:11,729
But I'm here today to
tell you that the cure

509
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:16,592
for oil is right here.
The cure is nuclear power.

510
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,095
The cure is Swannekke.

511
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:31,232
<i>Hello, Miss Rey. I'm frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour.</i>

512
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,443
Dr. Sixsmith?

513
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:34,610
<i>I need help.</i>

514
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:40,282
I need £ 50,000, not 2,000, 50,000!

515
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:42,952
<i>I'm going through it again,
Mr. Cavendish, but the total's right.</i>

516
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,371
<i>2,343 pounds and 16 pence.</i>

517
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:49,417
How is this possible?
The ruddy money was pouring in.

518
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,087
<i>Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish.
Solvency has its drawbacks.</i>

519
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,132
<i>The situation looked dire,</i>

520
00:42:57,133 --> 00:43:01,722
<i>but I knew that Timothy
Cavendish's capital in this town</i>

521
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,808
<i>could not be defined by
an accountant's balance sheet!</i>

522
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,060
McCluskie!

523
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:08,979
Look, how are those
delightful kiddies of yours?

524
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:16,653
Mon cher, tis "Cavendish the Ravenous,"
your favorite Timothy.

525
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,864
Mon cher?

526
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:21,784
You heard it correctly,
Charles Dickens' own original

527
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:25,829
authentic writing desk for £ 60,000.
I think that's very fair.

528
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,540
<i>But our records indicate that the
desk is already accounted for</i>

529
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:30,042
<i>by the Dickens House Museum.</i>

530
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:32,961
Okay, what about
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?

531
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:44,682
<i>In the darkness, I suddenly saw the light.</i>

532
00:43:44,808 --> 00:43:47,519
<i>Blood has always trumped water.</i>

533
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:51,022
<i>If the Hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair,</i>

534
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:56,319
<i>they'd find the Cavendish Clan
more than ready for the task at hand.</i>

535
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:01,116
Oh, Satan's gonads, not again.
Look,

536
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:04,536
just bugger off and leave us in peace.
I'm only gonna asking you nicely once.

537
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:05,620
Good to see you, Denny.

538
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:08,790
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot.

539
00:44:08,998 --> 00:44:12,252
Why-Why should I be forever
giving you a hand out?

540
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:13,878
Denny...

541
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,132
I had a minor running with the wrong sort.

542
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:21,594
If I don't get my hands on £ 60,000,
I got to get an awful beating.

543
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:24,472
Well, get them to video it for us,
would you? Now fuck off.

544
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:28,017
– I'm not joking, Denholme.
– Why is this my problem?

545
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:31,355
Because we're brothers!
Don't you have a conscience?

546
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:35,818
Couple of my special little pills
and a G&T should just set me right.

547
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,446
Denny. Help.

548
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,199
Please.

549
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:45,494
Den, who are you talking to?

550
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:49,623
– Hello, Georgette.
– Hello, Timothy.

551
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:56,922
Right. Right, right.

552
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,215
What did you-60 grand?

553
00:44:58,257 --> 00:45:00,134
It's gonna take some time, but, uh...

554
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:02,970
in the interim, I've got
the perfect place for you to hide.

555
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,227
<i>I begun to fear I might never hold
my beloved Tilda in my arms again.</i>

556
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:15,275
<i>My parasite writhes at night,
igniting spasms of pain,</i>

557
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:18,570
<i>while visions and voices,
obscene and monstrous, haunt me.</i>

558
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:20,447
Mister Ewing...

559
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:22,532
In the name of God!

560
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:26,328
Mister Ewing, no fear.

561
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:28,497
No harm, no shout.

562
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:31,792
Please.
My name Autua.

563
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:35,629
You know I... see Maori whip I...

564
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,006
You know I.

565
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:44,346
– What do you want?
– You help, Mr. Ewing.

566
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:47,599
If you no help, I in trouble dead.

567
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:50,435
Well, you're already
very much "in trouble dead."

568
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,145
The Prophetess is a mercantile vessel,

569
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:54,564
not an underground railroad
for escaping slaves.

570
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,901
I be able seaman, I earn passage.

571
00:45:58,026 --> 00:46:00,947
Well, then I suggest you surrender
to the captain's mercies forthwith.

572
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,325
No, no. They no hear I.

573
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:08,830
They say "swim away home, nigger",
and throw I in drink, but you...

574
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:12,708
you law man, right? Please.
Captain hear you, Mr. Ewing.

575
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,710
I-I can't help you.

576
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:19,340
I'm afraid your fate is entirely
your own, and I desire no part in it.

577
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:22,885
Then kill I.

578
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:24,762
Don't be absurd...

579
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:29,767
If you no help, you kill I just the same,
is true. You know it.

580
00:46:29,892 --> 00:46:32,437
I ain't be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.

581
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:36,107
Die here better.
Do it.

582
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:38,901
Do it quick.

583
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:42,572
I found an old transway marker, Captain.

584
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:45,200
It's got to be the red mountain.

585
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:48,495
The problem is, the valley
people are afraid of it.

586
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:50,664
They think the Devil lives up there.

587
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:54,376
I can't find anybody to guide me
through the Kona territory.

588
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,044
Meronym...

589
00:46:56,587 --> 00:47:00,007
Every day you're out there,
you increase your RAD levels.

590
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:03,802
This dream of yours is going to kill you.
And for what?

591
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:07,181
The Off-World colonies
may no longer exist.

592
00:47:07,598 --> 00:47:09,016
I got to go, Captain.

593
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:13,854
Thank you for coming, I'm in 1404.

594
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:16,065
<i>I'll be right up.</i>

595
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:57,357
Dr. Sixsmith?

596
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:11,079
It's me, Luisa.

597
00:48:58,295 --> 00:49:00,964
Go call the police.
Right now, call the police!

598
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:42,090
<i>My dear Sixsmith, you alone can
understand how I'm feeling right now.</i>

599
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:47,220
<i>Today, Ayrs and I presented our first
collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring,</i>

600
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:50,098
<i>Ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from Berlin.</i>

601
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:54,476
<i>It's called "eternal recurrence".
Wish you could hear it.</i>

602
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,562
<i>It's the most accomplished tone poem
I know of written since the war,</i>

603
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,023
<i>and I tell you, Sixsmith,</i>

604
00:49:59,024 --> 00:50:02,485
<i>that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine.</i>

605
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:13,246
At our time of life, Ayrs,
a man has no right to such daring ideas.

606
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:21,045
I suppose I've won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude.

607
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,924
<i>Diner of pheasant with
Bordeaux rich as buttercream.</i>

608
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:27,718
<i>How I love to listen to men
of distinguished lives,</i>

609
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:30,848
<i>sing of past follies and glories.</i>

610
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:34,810
<i>The only broken note in the entire
evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta,</i>

611
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:37,521
<i>excusing herself early.</i>

612
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:42,067
<i>Sensed the buried bone.
Later I asked Ayrs about it.</i>

613
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:45,571
<i>He said Kesselring had
introduced Jocasta to him.</i>

614
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:49,158
<i>I pried, had Kesselring
been in love with her?</i>

615
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,618
<i>The subject was a prickly one.</i>

616
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,746
Jocasta is a Jew.

617
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:56,665
Obviously her relationship was impossible.

618
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,459
Why obviously?

619
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:04,590
Can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in Germany?

620
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:08,677
<i>At this point in my life,
all I know, Sixsmith,</i>

621
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:13,349
<i>is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces</i>

622
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:15,435
<i>that twist our hearts.</i>

623
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:19,647
– How is it, Mr. Zachry?
– Thin whiles.

624
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:22,984
– Minding some company?
– Nay.

625
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:24,694
But...

626
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:29,199
Goats, and so do herders,
they're known for housin' temper.

627
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:33,411
Feelin' that own n' your reveal count out,

628
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:36,164
for invadin' your house with no saysoe.

629
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:37,999
True sorrysome.

630
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,336
Well it... Now it's done.

631
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:46,883
So, you mindin' a stranger
coverin' about your thrivin'?

632
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:50,136
Swap you. Query for query.

633
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,890
Fair buy.

634
00:51:53,973 --> 00:51:58,312
Cog you and come dow.
Learn stitchin' n' milkin' our heardin'.

635
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:01,690
Why you here?

636
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:04,235
I needin' a guide.

637
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:07,196
Guide? To where?

638
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:10,491
Mauna Sol.

639
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:21,001
<i>"Bridge is broken, hide below"</i>

640
00:52:23,045 --> 00:52:24,505
What's wrong?

641
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:58,206
<i>We cross and recross
our old tracks like figure skaters.</i>

642
00:52:58,248 --> 00:53:01,209
<i>And just as I was reading
a new submission,</i>

643
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:04,379
<i>a powerful déjà-vu ran through my bones.</i>

644
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:09,009
<i>I had been here before.</i>

645
00:53:09,384 --> 00:53:11,762
<i>Another lifetime ago.</i>

646
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:14,514
<i>Ursula.</i>

647
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:18,518
<i>The love of my life.</i>

648
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:21,396
<i>I could think of no other
serious applicants.</i>

649
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,733
<i>What had happened to her?</i>

650
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:26,819
<i>And more importantly,</i>

651
00:53:26,944 --> 00:53:28,905
<i>what had happened to the young man</i>

652
00:53:28,946 --> 00:53:32,366
<i>who had ridden the same train
composing sonnets,</i>

653
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,661
<i>to his so bound a love.</i>

654
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:37,997
Your augurin' come true, Abbess.

655
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:39,915
Broke bridge, just like you say.

656
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,211
Meronym were there, yebberin' about
trackin' up Mauna Sol,

657
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:46,464
why can this Prescient woman
come cursin' n' twistin' on my life?

658
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,925
Mind the words of Sonmi.

659
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:55,139
"Our lives are not our own.

660
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:59,769
From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.

661
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:04,357
Past and present.

662
00:54:06,317 --> 00:54:08,569
And by each crime...

663
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:13,158
and every kindness...

664
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:16,078
we birth our future."

665
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,339
Welcome to Neo Seoul.

666
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:41,603
Come on, out you come.

667
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:45,648
This... maybe the biggest mistake
of my life, but here.

668
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,734
Thank you, Mr. Ewing.

669
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:53,614
Now to tell the truth, I was
worried you might try and eat me,

670
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:55,452
if you didn't get
something in the stomach.

671
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:57,912
Oh, you safe, Mr. Ewing.

672
00:54:58,037 --> 00:54:59,914
I no like white meat.

673
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:04,043
Ah. Right.

674
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:08,631
Before I decide what
I'm going to do with you,

675
00:55:10,008 --> 00:55:12,802
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely?

676
00:55:12,927 --> 00:55:15,430
My uncle was a sailor.

677
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:18,808
He took me on a French whaler
when I was ten years old.

678
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:21,144
Seen too much of the world.

679
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:23,646
I no good slave.

680
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:27,358
Why did you look at me?

681
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:30,779
Pain strong, aye.

682
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:33,698
Friend's eye more strong.

683
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:38,244
Look, you are a runaway slave,
and I am a lawyer.

684
00:55:39,037 --> 00:55:41,540
How did you imagine
we could possibly be friends?

685
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:48,214
All you need.

686
00:55:58,682 --> 00:56:00,017
Ah, Jesus!

687
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:02,961
Javier Gomez, what did I tell you
about jumping onto my balcony?

688
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,522
Why d'you leave the door open
if you don't want me to come in?

689
00:56:05,523 --> 00:56:06,607
Because, smarty pants,

690
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:09,275
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony,

691
00:56:09,276 --> 00:56:12,655
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony, and being stuck out there.

692
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:13,864
Okay!

693
00:56:15,282 --> 00:56:16,826
What are you reading?

694
00:56:20,204 --> 00:56:21,580
Old letters.

695
00:56:22,123 --> 00:56:27,421
<i>Sixsmith, the plot has
taken a sensual turn.</i>

696
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:30,756
<i>Last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.</i>

697
00:56:30,757 --> 00:56:34,761
<i>But don't alarm yourself, it is only
a carnal act, performed in service,</i>

698
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:37,597
<i>not unlike my role as amanuensis.</i>

699
00:56:38,473 --> 00:56:43,937
<i>And I confess women's hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me.</i>

700
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:51,486
<i>Afterward, she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home.</i>

701
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:55,449
<i>I can get clear that Vyvyan
had been there the entire night,</i>

702
00:56:55,574 --> 00:57:00,787
<i>between us like the silence between notes,
that holds the key to warm music.</i>

703
00:57:03,832 --> 00:57:06,501
<i>P.S.: Best news of all,</i>

704
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,130
<i>I've started my own work.</i>

705
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:19,015
Uh, I... called about an old recording,

706
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:22,185
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.

707
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:24,937
Oops. Busted.

708
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:27,773
I know I shouldn't be playing it, I was...

709
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:29,942
checking it to make sure
it wasn't scratched,

710
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:33,403
but... honestly,

711
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:35,573
I just can't stop listening to it.

712
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:37,950
This is the Cloud Atlas Sextet?

713
00:57:39,776 --> 00:57:41,662
It's... the symphony.

714
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,003
It's beautiful.

715
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:51,421
but I think I've heard this before.

716
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:53,759
I can't imagine how.

717
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:58,013
I doubt there's no more than a... handful
copies in the whole of North America.

718
00:57:58,138 --> 00:57:59,681
But I know it.

719
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:03,769
I know I know it.

720
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:10,275
<i>Before I realized it, my feet had brought
me back to the Temple of Sacrifice,</i>

721
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,653
<i>where I offered up my virginity.</i>

722
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,531
<i>Back to those four-days of Paradise,</i>

723
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:19,326
<i>when Ursula's Mater and Pater
slift off to Greece,</i>

724
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,328
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

725
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:26,875
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

726
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:29,837
Ursula!

727
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:37,469
Sir! Madam! I assure you
this is completely innocent...

728
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:44,686
<i>Two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.</i>

729
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:48,148
<i>Official cause of accident,
listed on hospital form...</i>

730
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:49,232
<i>pussy.</i>

731
00:58:53,236 --> 00:58:56,739
<i>What were the chances that
she still lived in this house?</i>

732
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:01,119
<i>And yet, there she was.</i>

733
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:03,288
<i>Ursula.</i>

734
00:59:04,247 --> 00:59:08,001
<i>Why had I never returned
her calls or letters?</i>

735
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:13,089
<i>Shame, spinessless,
hallmarks of the Cavendish clan.</i>

736
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:19,471
<i>I realized I had a choice. I could
slink off and continue as planned,</i>

737
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:21,609
<i>or I could go boldly to the door,

738
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:24,602
 and discover what hope,
if any, would lay within.</i>

739
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,439
Abbess, come quick,
it's the Bailey girl.

740
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:30,608
– Catkin?
– Aye, she dyin'.

741
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:36,887
– What-what...
– Zach.

742
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:43,078
– Sonmi...
– It's scorpion fish.

743
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:46,499
Healer said she be gone by sundown.

744
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,794
Ain't right, ain't fair,
but nothing to be done.

745
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:00,638
Be very still.

746
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,516
Termination charge.
Here!

747
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:07,604
Just enough to blow your carotid.

748
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,007
How does it feel?

749
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,553
Good.

750
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,975
Catkin's dying!

751
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,894
– What?
– She trod on a scorpion fish.

752
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,399
You can save her.
You got spesh smart in that gearbag,

753
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,027
that'll save her.
That's the True-true!

754
01:00:55,153 --> 01:00:58,322
Prescient Councils swear
by a special order.

755
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:01,408
Say I can't go play Lady Sonmi
for everythin' twistin' wrong,

756
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:04,412
and click fingers, make right.

757
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:07,664
I just a stupid goat herder but
I cog you're killin' Catkin by not actin',

758
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:11,461
just... by lettin' you up on that bridge,
you Kona meat.

759
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:17,675
If a Prescient be layin',
with poison meltin' her heart n'lungs?

760
01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:19,761
If it be your kin?

761
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,931
Why the Precient's life worth
more than a Valleysman?!

762
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,985
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.

763
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,197
I know the way!

764
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:40,324
If you save Catkin,

765
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:44,536
I will guide you to the Devil's door,
if that's where you wanna go.

766
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:54,463
<i>While the past may call to us
with the enchantment of a siren,</i>

767
01:01:54,588 --> 01:01:59,009
<i>better, I believed, to stay
the course set by dear brother Den.</i>

768
01:01:59,134 --> 01:02:01,136
Just sign right here.

769
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:09,478
<i>Tomorrow, life could begin
afresh, afresh, afresh.</i>

770
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:10,729
This way.

771
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:16,652
Come.

772
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,335
<i>Designating texture.</i>

773
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:46,558
That's old Seoul.

774
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:49,727
If the tides keep rising
at their present rate,

775
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:52,605
Neo-Seoul will also be under
water in a hundred years.

776
01:03:26,724 --> 01:03:29,059
Your food is in here.

777
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:33,272
It's not what you're used to,
but I think you will like it.

778
01:03:34,482 --> 01:03:36,192
This is your bed...

779
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:39,612
These are your clothes.

780
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:47,828
Mine? But these are...
Pureblood clothes.

781
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:50,372
No. They are yours.

782
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,668
Did you know he was Union?

783
01:03:53,794 --> 01:03:56,630
No, but it wouldn't have mattered.

784
01:03:56,755 --> 01:03:58,590
Why not?

785
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,425
Because...

786
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:04,596
It was the first time
a Pureblood had showed me kindness.

787
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:13,855
I hungry.

788
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:40,425
Do you like them?

789
01:04:43,052 --> 01:04:44,637
You look lovely.

790
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,223
Here...

791
01:04:48,808 --> 01:04:50,351
Come here.

792
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:55,606
Now, this used to play Vidis,
but the chip is corrupted.

793
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:59,318
Stuck in a loop, so I digit it
and found the rest of it.

794
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:01,070
The rest of it?

795
01:05:19,338 --> 01:05:21,829
...the bloody hell are
you doing in my room?

796
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:26,555
Keys... go walkies, let's give these
to Miss Judd for safekeeping, shall we?

797
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,017
Leave my things alone,
you pilvering cow.

798
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:35,981
Cause you're new, I shall not make
you eat soap powder, this time...

799
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:37,107
You're warned.

800
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:41,320
I cannot stand for offensive language
in our arrays, not from anyone.

801
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:44,948
And I never make idle threats,
Mr. Cavendish. Never.

802
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:48,202
I'll talk to you as I ruddy
will like, you thief!

803
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:52,080
Make me eat soap powder?
I'd like to see you try.

804
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:55,375
Ooh, bloody hell!

805
01:05:56,335 --> 01:05:59,004
A disappointing start.

806
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:02,800
Is this some sort of kinky S&M hotel?

807
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:08,014
I am nurse Noakes,
you do not wish to cross me.

808
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:18,358
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
Uh, I know it's a Miss...

809
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:19,609
Rey.

810
01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:23,363
– Luisa Rey, Spyglass magazine.
– Right, right.

811
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:27,200
Luisa, this is Joe Napier,
our security chief.

812
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:29,536
I was surprised to get your query.

813
01:06:29,661 --> 01:06:32,705
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it-it is a feisty magazine, but...

814
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,624
Anything you need,
sir, just let me know.

815
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:37,252
We'll do. Guys, I'm good,
thank you very much.

816
01:06:38,169 --> 01:06:40,671
Our editor's trying to
spice things up a little bit,

817
01:06:40,672 --> 01:06:43,133
he says the public wants
more substance, so...

818
01:06:43,258 --> 01:06:44,551
Probably just a fad.

819
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:49,264
Come on, follow me, let's start
you with the Chicken Ranch.

820
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:51,183
That is where we keep the Eggheads.

821
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:04,738
Hello, Mr. Cavendish,
feeling super this morning?

822
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:09,410
No. I checked in last night,
believing that Aurora House was a hotel.

823
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:13,497
My brother made the booking you see,
his idea of a practical joke.

824
01:07:13,622 --> 01:07:17,710
But listen, you have a bigger problem
closer to home.

825
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:21,212
There's some demented bitch
calling herself Noakes,

826
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:25,259
rampaging about the place,
impersonating a chamber maid.

827
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:31,098
But the point is this:
she struck me, and she stole my keys.

828
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:36,855
Right? I'll need those
keys back, straight away.

829
01:07:37,939 --> 01:07:41,985
Aurora House is your home now,
Mr. Cavendish. Your signature

830
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,488
– authorizes us to apply...
– Signature?

831
01:07:44,613 --> 01:07:47,824
The custody document
you signed last night.

832
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:49,910
Your residency papers.

833
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:53,538
Oh no, no, no. That was
the hotel register.

834
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,500
Ah, never mind, it's all academic, huh?

835
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:59,294
This is gonna make a hell
of a diner party story.

836
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:02,839
Most of our guests get cold feet
on their first mornings.

837
01:08:02,964 --> 01:08:04,883
– My keys, please.

838
01:08:04,925 --> 01:08:08,345
– Residents are not...
– I'm not a ruddy resident!

839
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,389
You'll find temper tantrums
won't help you at Aurora House!

840
01:08:11,515 --> 01:08:14,392
You're breaking the... ruddy...

841
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:19,357
acting... conservation act,
or some ruddy thing,

842
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:22,985
and I will not be subjugated
to a criminal abuse.

843
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:29,951
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

844
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:41,254
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes
are forming on slate roofs.</i>

845
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:47,635
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

846
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,348
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

847
01:09:00,898 --> 01:09:02,442
Off somewhere?

848
01:09:02,817 --> 01:09:06,113
You bet I am.
To the land of the living.

849
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:14,913
Soylent Green is people.
Soylent Green is made of people!

850
01:09:16,832 --> 01:09:19,293
Oy! Get back here, you!

851
01:09:21,462 --> 01:09:24,130
You keep away from me, or
I'll be forced to name you,

852
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:26,133
in the police report, as an accomplice.

853
01:09:26,258 --> 01:09:28,010
I have better things to do than this.

854
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:32,556
Then go, pit and do them,
you bloody sucker son of...

855
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:35,726
Right!

856
01:09:38,771 --> 01:09:42,441
God, you take hands off me,
you ruddy bloody...

857
01:09:44,943 --> 01:09:50,241
You can maintain power over people,
as long as you give them something.

858
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:55,413
Rob a man of everything, and that
man will no longer be in your power.

859
01:09:56,247 --> 01:10:00,376
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
20th century philosopher complete works,

860
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:02,837
banned by Unanimity.

861
01:10:02,962 --> 01:10:05,673
How do you know about him?

862
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:07,091
Hae-Ju.

863
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:13,306
– Sir Zheng.
– Please, you must call me Hae-Ju.

864
01:10:14,474 --> 01:10:15,642
Hae-Ju...

865
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:21,189
Fabricants can be excised for this...

866
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,318
Well, survival often demands some courage.

867
01:10:42,211 --> 01:10:45,881
<i>Knowledge is a mirror,
and for the first time in my life,</i>

868
01:10:45,923 --> 01:10:50,970
<i>I was allowed to see who I was,
and who I might become.</i>

869
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:00,521
Go clean the head.

870
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:03,065
Good morning, captain.

871
01:11:03,066 --> 01:11:07,236
You can help it remain so,
Quillcock, by buggering off.

872
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:09,822
I'm afraid I can't do it, sir.

873
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:12,991
If I was, I would be unable
to inform you of the stow-away

874
01:11:12,992 --> 01:11:15,161
– that I have discovered in my...
– Stow-away?

875
01:11:15,244 --> 01:11:17,789
I assure you that this
Moriori had no choice.

876
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:21,460
Now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class, able bodied seaman,

877
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:23,837
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance.

878
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:29,259
A stow-away is a stow-away,
even if he shits silver nuggets.

879
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,222
Did he ever explain anything to you?

880
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:40,020
He told me their goal was
the creation of a free willed Fabricant.

881
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,774
Yoona had failed.

882
01:11:44,524 --> 01:11:46,610
I was their last hope.

883
01:11:51,156 --> 01:11:54,867
I have to say if all lady
journalists look like you,

884
01:11:54,868 --> 01:11:59,164
I might start to take this, uh,
women's lib thing more seriously.

885
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:02,210
Well, I'm sure they can use your support.

886
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:04,754
Nice.

887
01:12:04,879 --> 01:12:09,008
Okay, uh, you wait here and I will
go find someone smarter who can, uh,

888
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:11,469
walk you through the details
of some of your questions.

889
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:12,678
Great.

890
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:34,075
What would Dad do?

891
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,878
Who the bloody hell is this?
Have you any idea what time it is?

892
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:48,423
– Denny, it's me, Tim.
<i>- Timothee?</i>

893
01:12:49,925 --> 01:12:50,968
Where are you?

894
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:54,263
<i>Ah, I think you ruddy know
about where I am.</i>

895
01:12:54,388 --> 01:12:56,849
But residents are
denied access to phones.

896
01:12:56,932 --> 01:12:58,267
<i>Someone smuggled one in?</i>

897
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:02,062
– You know the rules?
<i>- I helped write them, Timmy.</i>

898
01:13:02,187 --> 01:13:05,524
<i>I have been a principal investor
in Aurora House for twelve years,</i>

899
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:06,817
it's incredibly lucrative.

900
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:10,404
You can't believe what people would pay
to lock-out their parents.

901
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:13,824
Look, Den, you've had your fun,

902
01:13:14,116 --> 01:13:17,411
I think it's high time you put an end
to this little game of yours.

903
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:22,040
No, no, no, Timmy.
My fun has just begun.

904
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,584
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

905
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:26,253
I am your brother, why are
you doing this to me?

906
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:31,008
<i>I think the better question is-would be,
what have you done to deserve this?</i>

907
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:32,677
I don't know what you mean.

908
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:35,430
Oh come, naughty old brother,
don't insult me.

909
01:13:35,472 --> 01:13:38,933
You can't think that I didn't know
about you and Georgette!

910
01:13:40,393 --> 01:13:41,686
Georgette?

911
01:13:44,272 --> 01:13:46,733
Look, Den...

912
01:13:46,858 --> 01:13:48,777
I didn't mean to hurt you.

913
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,487
I'm afraid your penance
has come due, Timbo,

914
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:53,740
it's time to account for your crimes.

915
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:55,533
Den...

916
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:58,828
– I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

917
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:01,164
<i>- No no no, there's
no need to apologize.</i>

918
01:14:01,247 --> 01:14:03,750
<i>Your exile is more than enough reparation.</i>

919
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:08,171
Oh, I do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you,

920
01:14:08,213 --> 01:14:10,408
nurse Noakes and a broom handle.

921
01:14:10,527 --> 01:14:12,612
Cherry up, Timmy.
Bye bye now.

922
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:15,970
He sends his love.

923
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:29,318
I would like to ask about
the night of your arrest.

924
01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:34,824
I remember...
listening to his heart beat.

925
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:39,411
Your heart beats much slower than ours.

926
01:14:40,496 --> 01:14:43,582
There is a gentleness to the sound.

927
01:14:43,707 --> 01:14:46,877
I find it... comforting.

928
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,883
– Vyvyan, what time is it?
– I don't know. Who cares...

929
01:14:53,008 --> 01:14:56,095
I've heard a melody, boy.
For violin.

930
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:57,513
Quick...

931
01:14:57,638 --> 01:14:59,473
Find-find a pen.

932
01:15:00,391 --> 01:15:05,063
I heard it in a dream.
I was in a nightmarish café...

933
01:15:05,188 --> 01:15:09,860
Blaring, bright lights,
but underground and no way out.

934
01:15:11,486 --> 01:15:15,949
And the waitresses...
they all had the same face.

935
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:21,079
There was music playing, not like
any music I've ever heard in my life.

936
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:29,254
It began...
It began...

937
01:15:29,379 --> 01:15:30,630
Wait...

938
01:15:32,382 --> 01:15:35,886
It was so clear a minute ago.

939
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:40,724
Help me, Robert, help me.
It's slipping away!

940
01:15:43,059 --> 01:15:44,311
I've lost it.

941
01:15:46,105 --> 01:15:47,356
It'll come to you, sir.

942
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:50,777
The minute you stop trying
to find it, it will find you.

943
01:15:50,902 --> 01:15:52,820
You are naive, Robert.

944
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,825
I am anything but.

945
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:00,787
There is a gulf between these chairs.

946
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:03,998
What you want is no different
from what I want.

947
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:07,418
The gulf is an illusion.

948
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:11,714
<i>How do I describe that night, Sixsmith...</i>

949
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:16,260
<i>What had happened between
Vyvyan and I transcended language.</i>

950
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,557
<i>It was music that poured from his eyes,
and breathed from his lips.</i>

951
01:16:23,976 --> 01:16:27,355
<i>Music as beautiful as any
I have ever heard.</i>

952
01:16:33,445 --> 01:16:35,364
What-what are you doing in here?

953
01:16:39,576 --> 01:16:41,078
They found us.

954
01:17:08,397 --> 01:17:12,025
I'll be with you the whole way,
now focus on me.

955
01:17:18,116 --> 01:17:19,993
Stay with me.

956
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:23,121
Right here.
I won't let you go.

957
01:17:41,598 --> 01:17:43,183
– Mr. Ewing.
– It-It's alright.

958
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:46,060
I-I talked to the captain,
he'll hear your case.

959
01:17:46,186 --> 01:17:47,854
What's your name, boy?

960
01:17:48,646 --> 01:17:50,815
Autua, sir.

961
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,152
This Christian gentleman,
who knows nothing about ships,

962
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,572
tells me that you're a first-class sailor.

963
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:02,369
Very well, let's see you'd
lower the main top, son.

964
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:10,461
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.

965
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,557
Mr. Boerhaave, ready my piece.

966
01:18:23,974 --> 01:18:28,395
What? Sir, you...
gave me your word, Captain.

967
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:30,648
P-Please, you can't do this.

968
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:34,610
Nobody tells me what I can
and cannot do on my own ship.

969
01:18:34,735 --> 01:18:37,321
Specially when it concerns
nigger stow-away.

970
01:19:03,348 --> 01:19:06,934
Captain look!
He's got fish-hooks for toes.

971
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:09,896
Boerhaave, you don't
make a mess of my deck.

972
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:46,934
Captain, please...

973
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:52,356
Look, if you can just hear me, I'm...

974
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,461
The darkie's salt as I am.

975
01:20:15,589 --> 01:20:17,549
Mr. Boerhaave!

976
01:20:18,509 --> 01:20:21,093
It appears we have an
addition to our crew.

977
01:20:21,094 --> 01:20:22,721
Make sure he earns his keep.

978
01:20:25,182 --> 01:20:26,433
Mr. Hooks.

979
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:32,356
I found her. She was in the chem labs,
looking for the bathroom.

980
01:20:33,232 --> 01:20:38,237
Ah? Well, perfect, then, uh, why don't
you take over from here, Sachs,

981
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,906
you know, introduce our
little tribe, and uh...

982
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:43,951
and guide Ms. Rey through the...
through the tower.

983
01:20:44,493 --> 01:20:47,663
The funny thing is, I am not
even supposed to be here.

984
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:51,374
I was meant to be in Seoul,
but the air traffic controller strike

985
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:54,961
put everything up, so now
I'm on the... time jumper tonight.

986
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:58,258
Did you ever think that
the universe was against you?

987
01:20:58,383 --> 01:20:59,843
All the time.

988
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,345
You mind?

989
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,472
I'm cool.

990
01:21:17,485 --> 01:21:19,904
You seem nervous, Isaac.

991
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:21,906
– Do I make you nervous?
– No.

992
01:21:23,616 --> 01:21:25,285
Actually, just the opposite.

993
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,724
Will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me?

994
01:21:52,563 --> 01:21:57,526
<i>Freedom. The fatuous jingle
of our civilization.</i>

995
01:21:58,194 --> 01:22:02,823
<i>But only those deprived of it have
the barest inkling of what it really is.</i>

996
01:22:20,841 --> 01:22:25,221
There's much disagreement
on what should be done with you.

997
01:22:25,262 --> 01:22:28,850
The Corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant,

998
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:31,770
the Manufacturer is
demanding a period of study,

999
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:36,024
the Pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection.

1000
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:43,031
However, the problem you
create is a political one.

1001
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:48,912
Which means you are my problem.

1002
01:22:49,913 --> 01:22:54,709
I find it intriguing
to imagine that beneath this...

1003
01:22:54,793 --> 01:23:00,841
perfectly engineered features, are thoughts
that terrify the whole of Unanimity.

1004
01:23:05,512 --> 01:23:09,474
I'm not afraid of such thoughts,
because I do not fear the truth.

1005
01:23:11,059 --> 01:23:15,273
There's a natural order
to this world, fabricant.

1006
01:23:15,398 --> 01:23:19,944
And the truth is this order
must be protected.

1007
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,751
Inform the Archivist,
prepare for excisement.

1008
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,837
– Yes sir.
– Sir...

1009
01:23:41,174 --> 01:23:44,135
Can you tell me what
happened to Hae-Ju Zheng?

1010
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,513
Killed, I was told.

1011
01:24:09,203 --> 01:24:12,732
All this feast and excitements,
really Adam, it's...

1012
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,417
all too much, you'll need to rest.

1013
01:24:29,348 --> 01:24:31,183
I had...

1014
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:37,523
a girlfriend once, she kept trying
to get me to read Carlos Castenada.

1015
01:24:37,648 --> 01:24:40,400
– You ever read any o' that shit?
– Oh yeah.

1016
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:45,448
But the relationship was doomed.

1017
01:24:45,573 --> 01:24:47,617
Every time she brought up a new...

1018
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:51,412
karma, past-life stuff,
I-I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

1019
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:54,666
And yet...

1020
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:58,878
I can't explain it...

1021
01:24:59,003 --> 01:25:02,340
but I knew when I opened that door...

1022
01:25:15,103 --> 01:25:18,314
They destroyed most of
the copies of the report.

1023
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:22,110
Most?

1024
01:25:25,238 --> 01:25:27,950
There's no good choice here, is there?

1025
01:25:28,075 --> 01:25:31,203
If I help you, I can lose my job...

1026
01:25:31,328 --> 01:25:32,580
or worse,

1027
01:25:34,623 --> 01:25:38,419
If I don't, a lot of people...

1028
01:25:40,463 --> 01:25:42,673
Yeah, it will be worse than worse.

1029
01:25:45,009 --> 01:25:47,511
You have to do...

1030
01:25:47,636 --> 01:25:50,139
whatever you can't not do.

1031
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:59,064
Someone preyin' on you, Zachry?

1032
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:03,068
You really ain't feary about meetin'
Ol' Georgie on the summit?

1033
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:06,322
I'm more scaresome 'bout
the weather than in the Devil.

1034
01:26:09,992 --> 01:26:11,703
You cog he's real?

1035
01:26:12,412 --> 01:26:15,165
Who tripped the Fall,
if not Old Georgie?

1036
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,752
True-true?

1037
01:26:22,756 --> 01:26:24,508
The Old Uns.

1038
01:26:25,383 --> 01:26:27,469
That's just a rope o'smoke.

1039
01:26:27,511 --> 01:26:30,096
Old Uns got the Smart.

1040
01:26:30,847 --> 01:26:33,391
They mastered sick and seeds,

1041
01:26:33,517 --> 01:26:35,852
they make miracles and fly across the sky.

1042
01:26:35,894 --> 01:26:39,397
True. All true.
But they got somethin' else.

1043
01:26:39,523 --> 01:26:43,860
A hunger in their hearts, a hunger
that's stronger than all their Smart.

1044
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:47,280
Hunger? For what?

1045
01:26:49,074 --> 01:26:50,534
A hunger for more.

1046
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:55,832
<i>Belief like fear or love</i>

1047
01:26:55,873 --> 01:27:00,711
<i>is a force to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity,</i>

1048
01:27:00,795 --> 01:27:03,131
and principles of uncertainty.

1049
01:27:03,965 --> 01:27:07,677
<i>Phenomena that determine
the course of our lives.</i>

1050
01:27:09,178 --> 01:27:13,474
<i>Yesterday, my life was
headed in one direction.</i>

1051
01:27:16,686 --> 01:27:20,565
<i>Today, it is headed in another.</i>

1052
01:27:21,023 --> 01:27:26,821
<i>Yesterday, I believed I would never
have done what I did today.</i>

1053
01:27:26,946 --> 01:27:30,867
<i>These forces that often
remake time and space,</i>

1054
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:34,495
<i>they can shape and alter
who we imagine ourselves to be,</i>

1055
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:39,500
<i>begin long before we are born,
and continue after we perish.</i>

1056
01:27:44,548 --> 01:27:47,676
<i>Our lives and our choices</i>

1057
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:53,182
<i>like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment</i>

1058
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,437
<i>at each point of intersection,
each encounter,</i>

1059
01:27:58,562 --> 01:28:02,774
<i>suggest a new potential direction.</i>

1060
01:28:05,194 --> 01:28:07,321
<i>Proposition:</i>

1061
01:28:07,446 --> 01:28:10,699
<i>I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.</i>

1062
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:17,790
<i>Is this possible?
I just met her, and yet...</i>

1063
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:23,879
<i>I feel like something important
has happened to me.</i>

1064
01:28:34,224 --> 01:28:35,683
That's it.

1065
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:38,228
The music from my dream.

1066
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:24,859
This is from my dream,
that night I came to your room.

1067
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:29,655
This is the music I heard in my head,
somehow I gave it to you.

1068
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,449
I've been working on
this piece for weeks now.

1069
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:36,745
I suspect you heard it, and
incorporated it into your dream.

1070
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,374
I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

1071
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,048
This is obviously the result
of our collaboration.

1072
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:52,011
The Atlas, I believe,

1073
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:55,265
is the only thing I've done
in my life that is of value.

1074
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,561
But I know I could not have written it,

1075
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,273
if I hadn't met you.

1076
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:07,068
There are whole movements in
the Atlas that I wrote imagining us,

1077
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:11,656
meeting again and again,
in different lives and different ages.

1078
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,824
Yes...

1079
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:20,832
Something as important as this
cannot be described as "yours" or "mine",

1080
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,168
it is "ours".

1081
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,052
That this is exactly how I feel, Vyvyan.

1082
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:54,200
I'm sorry, I...

1083
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:58,955
– I thought...
– You thought? You thought what?

1084
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:05,044
That I might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself?

1085
01:31:08,256 --> 01:31:10,091
I pack my bag, and be gone by morning.

1086
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:13,052
You'll do no such thing, you'll leave
only when I say you can leave.

1087
01:31:13,094 --> 01:31:17,640
You will continue working
on Vyvyan Ayrs' Cloud Atlas.

1088
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:20,726
When it is finished, then I will
decide what to do with you.

1089
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:23,187
You can't keep me here!
I'm leaving!

1090
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:26,899
Good luck with your composing.
I'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself

1091
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,778
is still capable of something
completely immemorable.

1092
01:31:29,903 --> 01:31:34,575
I suggest you think about this, Robert.
Think about reputation.

1093
01:31:35,784 --> 01:31:41,123
Reputation is everything in our society.
Yours, my disinherited reprobate,

1094
01:31:41,248 --> 01:31:43,083
has expired.

1095
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:47,296
Did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof?

1096
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:50,466
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:

1097
01:31:50,507 --> 01:31:55,179
"He is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites

1098
01:31:55,387 --> 01:32:00,142
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at Caius.

1099
01:32:00,267 --> 01:32:04,563
Lock up the silverware."
Unquote.

1100
01:32:06,899 --> 01:32:10,278
Be warned.
Leave here without my consent,

1101
01:32:10,487 --> 01:32:16,201
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.

1102
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:19,370
After that,

1103
01:32:19,496 --> 01:32:24,167
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written,

1104
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:26,503
no one will hear it,

1105
01:32:27,003 --> 01:32:30,715
because no one will want
anything to do with you.

1106
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:12,424
I won't let you go again.

1107
01:33:18,347 --> 01:33:20,933
I told you he'd come.

1108
01:33:21,475 --> 01:33:23,227
<i>Two things became clear.</i>

1109
01:33:23,352 --> 01:33:27,314
<i>Hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite</i>

1110
01:33:27,356 --> 01:33:29,150
<i>plunder my talent a day longer.</i>

1111
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:31,694
<i>I must complete my sextet.</i>

1112
01:33:31,735 --> 01:33:34,613
<i>I can't do it here,
so tonight I plan to make my escape.</i>

1113
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:49,880
<i>Please stand by for vehicle scan.</i>

1114
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:54,259
<i>Clearance granted.</i>

1115
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:16,156
Any jailbreak's a risky proposition.

1116
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:20,869
One little cock-up, and we are
dangling at her majesty's pleasure.

1117
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:23,080
I know, I know.

1118
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:25,166
We could use code names,

1119
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:28,419
but the truth is I'd probably
be the first to forget mine.

1120
01:34:28,628 --> 01:34:31,631
So, Mr. Cavendish...

1121
01:34:32,215 --> 01:34:34,091
Ernie Blancksmith.

1122
01:34:34,217 --> 01:34:39,263
This is Mr. Meeks
and my girl Veronica Costello.

1123
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:42,975
– To trust.
– To trust.

1124
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:47,063
I know, I know.

1125
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:50,650
What about the parrot, then?

1126
01:34:50,775 --> 01:34:52,568
If ever that was a likely songbird.

1127
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:57,365
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman, he would never betray us.

1128
01:34:57,490 --> 01:35:00,701
Besides, no one's ever heard
him say anything else.

1129
01:35:00,827 --> 01:35:02,912
I know, I know.

1130
01:35:03,037 --> 01:35:05,581
Question is, old man,

1131
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:07,709
think you're up to snuff?

1132
01:35:22,808 --> 01:35:24,685
<i>Unanimity requires compliance.</i>

1133
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:27,980
<i>We have a security code Red,
prepare to be boarded.</i>

1134
01:35:28,105 --> 01:35:30,065
What are you going to do?

1135
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:32,317
Stay calm, stay calm.

1136
01:35:33,402 --> 01:35:37,072
<i>" It will end in tears."
You've warned me.</i>

1137
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:39,366
<i>I suppose I'm as hopeless
as Adam Ewing,</i>

1138
01:35:39,491 --> 01:35:42,618
<i>oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting,</i>

1139
01:35:42,619 --> 01:35:45,038
<i>blind to the fact his friend
is poisoning him.</i>

1140
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,748
Wait, please...

1141
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:49,376
The idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure.

1142
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:50,794
Don't be a silly puff here, Adam,

1143
01:35:50,836 --> 01:35:54,549
I'm sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop.

1144
01:35:54,883 --> 01:35:59,429
I have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight!

1145
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:04,558
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith,
who works with such alacrity,

1146
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:07,687
that your Tilda may not have
to know this was ever removed.

1147
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,984
– Give it to me!
– Get your fucking hands off my pudding!

1148
01:36:13,026 --> 01:36:15,945
It's not your pudding, you
Alzheimer riddled lout!

1149
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:17,530
You've already eaten...

1150
01:36:24,704 --> 01:36:26,581
Better get in here.

1151
01:36:46,977 --> 01:36:48,729
Mr. Cavendish!

1152
01:36:57,863 --> 01:37:01,116
<i>The room stank of bitter medicine.</i>

1153
01:37:07,373 --> 01:37:10,291
<i>Curiously heavy things, guns.</i>

1154
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:13,087
Why did I take it, exactly?

1155
01:37:13,212 --> 01:37:15,339
<i>Can't say.</i>

1156
01:37:15,464 --> 01:37:16,882
<i>An intuition.</i>

1157
01:37:17,007 --> 01:37:19,176
<i>A sense of significance.</i>

1158
01:37:19,969 --> 01:37:22,013
<i>That from this point on...</i>

1159
01:37:23,515 --> 01:37:25,308
<i>there was no going back.</i>

1160
01:37:43,368 --> 01:37:46,997
Just seein' them clouds,
we run out o' time.

1161
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:56,590
– Don't need no smart rope.
– Yeah, see you fall,

1162
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,217
I'll catch you.

1163
01:38:14,984 --> 01:38:17,695
Hands in the air. Now!
Move it, step off of the vehicle!

1164
01:38:17,737 --> 01:38:21,157
Get down.
Down, now!

1165
01:38:24,827 --> 01:38:27,038
Fuckin' migrant monkey-talk.

1166
01:38:27,538 --> 01:38:30,166
Why do they hire these greasy stubs?

1167
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:33,044
Negative, sir.
Definite illegal.

1168
01:38:33,169 --> 01:38:34,462
You turn him from now.

1169
01:38:35,129 --> 01:38:36,464
I'm reading a second life form!

1170
01:38:36,465 --> 01:38:38,132
– Where?
– In the truck.

1171
01:38:38,257 --> 01:38:40,468
– Check it out.
– Yes, sir.

1172
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:16,547
You troddin' on the Devil's ground now,

1173
01:39:16,672 --> 01:39:18,048
Valleysman.

1174
01:39:20,425 --> 01:39:26,765
I'm sayin' just once.
That off-lander ain't gettin' to the top.

1175
01:39:27,975 --> 01:39:31,937
Time for you to let go that rope.

1176
01:39:32,062 --> 01:39:33,730
You trespass...

1177
01:39:34,356 --> 01:39:36,025
You pay the price.

1178
01:39:37,777 --> 01:39:40,363
Now drop that rope.

1179
01:39:40,488 --> 01:39:43,950
Drop that rope.

1180
01:39:45,702 --> 01:39:48,538
– Forcecom 1, entering the truck.
– Roger that.

1181
01:39:48,788 --> 01:39:50,665
I turn in visual.

1182
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:54,502
– It's her!
– It'll be okay, uh?

1183
01:40:11,561 --> 01:40:13,730
Fire at me.
Fire at me!

1184
01:40:30,581 --> 01:40:32,041
Who are you?

1185
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,084
Commander Hae-Ju Zheng.

1186
01:40:35,127 --> 01:40:38,339
First science officer
of the Union rebellion.

1187
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:41,008
Why are you doing this?

1188
01:40:41,592 --> 01:40:44,887
Because I believe you have
the power to change this world.

1189
01:40:45,304 --> 01:40:50,226
<i>Drop that rope...
Let go that rope.</i>

1190
01:40:50,351 --> 01:40:53,145
<i>"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"</i>

1191
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:57,274
Hands are bleedin'.
Can't let go.

1192
01:41:11,122 --> 01:41:12,624
Thank you Zachry.

1193
01:41:14,292 --> 01:41:16,127
You savin' me twice, ain't ya?

1194
01:41:17,295 --> 01:41:19,172
You fall, I catch you.

1195
01:42:02,258 --> 01:42:04,552
<i>Excessive force confirmed.</i>

1196
01:42:07,513 --> 01:42:08,931
<i>Stop them.
Stop them now.</i>

1197
01:42:23,362 --> 01:42:27,074
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I made myself clear.

1198
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:31,537
– Do what you want. I'm leaving!
– Fine, Frobisher...

1199
01:42:31,662 --> 01:42:34,208
Go, but I take this.

1200
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:36,502
– Give that to me.
– It's mine!

1201
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:37,586
I'm warning you!

1202
01:42:37,711 --> 01:42:39,880
Under the conditions of this relationship,

1203
01:42:39,922 --> 01:42:42,508
I'm certain that I'm in my legal rights.

1204
01:42:43,467 --> 01:42:47,471
Give it to me. Give it to me, or I swear
to God I will kill you as you stand!

1205
01:42:49,223 --> 01:42:52,392
Please... you're a coward.

1206
01:42:52,434 --> 01:42:55,521
– I'll do it.
– You won't pull that trigger.

1207
01:42:57,648 --> 01:43:00,067
Your kind never does.

1208
01:43:20,004 --> 01:43:24,425
PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWING

1209
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:44,279
Yes. Yes, well...

1210
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,824
How-how fares our worm today, Adam?

1211
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:51,536
I- I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.

1212
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:54,247
Oh no no no. Nonsense.
Nonsense.

1213
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:58,084
You mustn't give up.
You must think of your beautiful wife.

1214
01:43:58,334 --> 01:44:01,004
You must think of Tilda.

1215
01:44:21,817 --> 01:44:23,819
They're trapped in the downway.
We've got them.

1216
01:44:35,956 --> 01:44:37,541
What are you doing?

1217
01:45:36,519 --> 01:45:39,355
<i>Nay, the dead never stay dead.</i>

1218
01:45:43,442 --> 01:45:48,030
<i>Open your ears, and
they'll never stop a yibberin'.</i>

1219
01:46:02,628 --> 01:46:04,630
What is this place?

1220
01:46:05,548 --> 01:46:08,092
Before the Fall,

1221
01:46:08,217 --> 01:46:11,345
Old Uns built dwellings,

1222
01:46:11,387 --> 01:46:15,016
beyond the sky, among the stars,

1223
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:20,564
this place joined here with there.

1224
01:46:30,053 --> 01:46:31,673
Sonmi.

1225
01:46:37,706 --> 01:46:39,208
It is she.

1226
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:43,045
The Old Uns pray to Sonmi
same as Valleysmen?

1227
01:46:44,213 --> 01:46:48,300
Nay... not 'zactly same.

1228
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:15,829
Stay close.
Fabricants get snatched here.

1229
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:20,166
– All clear.
– Thank you.

1230
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:23,670
No sweat, we're partners.
But you got to tell me what's happening.

1231
01:47:23,795 --> 01:47:25,922
Okay, let me take off these clothes,
call the cops,

1232
01:47:25,923 --> 01:47:28,549
and I promise I tell you everything
that happen in the morning.

1233
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:31,052
Okay. But I hope you
realize you just said exactly

1234
01:47:31,094 --> 01:47:33,263
what every character in
any decent mystery says

1235
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:35,098
right before they get killed.

1236
01:47:35,223 --> 01:47:36,850
Good night, Javier.

1237
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:22,353
What'd you mean down there?
'bout...

1238
01:48:22,354 --> 01:48:27,693
The Old Uns and Valleymen prayin'
to Sonmi not 'zactly the same?

1239
01:48:29,612 --> 01:48:32,657
Old men... they were different.

1240
01:48:34,493 --> 01:48:36,244
Different?

1241
01:48:36,369 --> 01:48:37,787
How?

1242
01:48:40,624 --> 01:48:42,751
You want the True-true?

1243
01:48:55,305 --> 01:48:57,432
This is where you live?

1244
01:48:57,557 --> 01:49:00,519
This... is where Union was born.

1245
01:49:08,777 --> 01:49:10,946
Sonmi were no God.

1246
01:49:11,112 --> 01:49:16,702
She died hundreds of years ago
on a faraway peninsula, deadlanded now.

1247
01:49:17,328 --> 01:49:18,329
What?

1248
01:49:19,163 --> 01:49:20,581
I cog Valleysmens beliefs,

1249
01:49:20,623 --> 01:49:23,084
I know Abbess teach you
Sonmi was a miracle,

1250
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:27,547
birthed o' Darwin god o' Smart,
but ain't the True-true.

1251
01:49:28,256 --> 01:49:33,386
Her life was sad n' judased, she died
tryin' to change the Old-Uns thinkin'.

1252
01:49:33,511 --> 01:49:39,058
<i>Liiiies... nothing but lying.</i>

1253
01:49:39,141 --> 01:49:41,561
Nay, nay you-you're lying.

1254
01:49:53,114 --> 01:49:56,111
The nature of our immortal
lives is in the...

1255
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:57,743
Sonmi?

1256
01:49:58,494 --> 01:50:01,665
Before she died, she spoke
of her acts n' deedins'.

1257
01:50:01,874 --> 01:50:05,502
Her words are heart savin' blessin',
remindin' me what's the True-true.

1258
01:50:05,627 --> 01:50:09,423
How long you lissin' to this?!
How long you jus' stand there,

1259
01:50:09,506 --> 01:50:15,220
n' let a stranger keep fuggin'
your beliefs up n' down, in n' out!

1260
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,640
<i>Our lives are not our own,</i>

1261
01:50:18,891 --> 01:50:22,811
<i>from womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.</i>

1262
01:50:24,423 --> 01:50:25,543
Zachry.

1263
01:50:26,857 --> 01:50:28,275
You alright?

1264
01:50:29,526 --> 01:50:30,861
Finish your saysoe...

1265
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:41,538
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

1266
01:50:42,498 --> 01:50:45,960
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk.

1267
01:50:46,461 --> 01:50:48,671
Be cool.
Alright.

1268
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:54,928
And if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

1269
01:50:55,053 --> 01:50:59,057
How's it feel, uh?
Good conversation start, isn't it?

1270
01:51:01,684 --> 01:51:04,854
You are Lester Rey's daughter,
that's for goddamn sure.

1271
01:51:05,396 --> 01:51:08,608
– You knew my father?
– Korean War.

1272
01:51:09,317 --> 01:51:11,236
I was in the two-one.

1273
01:51:12,779 --> 01:51:15,698
That's me on the end, next to your dad.

1274
01:51:16,074 --> 01:51:18,868
Mortar landed so close
it could have dropped out of my ass.

1275
01:51:18,993 --> 01:51:22,956
If your father hadn't done what he did,
I wouldn't be here.

1276
01:51:28,127 --> 01:51:30,047
Guess that makes two of us.

1277
01:51:39,849 --> 01:51:47,523
You ain't let go that rope cause you' a
lustin' for that darkly, sweet'meat.

1278
01:51:47,648 --> 01:51:49,567
I cog it all, now.

1279
01:51:49,608 --> 01:51:55,698
This whore, with her cokeynut
skin, and her slywise mask,

1280
01:51:55,906 --> 01:51:59,785
smilin' n' wormin' her way into
your trust so you brin' her here,

1281
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:03,831
scavin' n' sivvin' for what?

1282
01:52:03,914 --> 01:52:06,375
For what, fool?

1283
01:52:06,542 --> 01:52:11,589
They want the island.
The Prescients want it all.

1284
01:52:11,630 --> 01:52:17,262
You judasin' your kin for a piece of ass.

1285
01:52:17,554 --> 01:52:20,015
She ain't your tribe, she
ain't even your color,

1286
01:52:20,056 --> 01:52:22,976
she just 'bout ignorin'
all your yarns n' ways,

1287
01:52:23,185 --> 01:52:28,106
spinnin' n' spoutin' her whoahsomse lies,
and you lap it up, like a dog in heat!

1288
01:52:28,315 --> 01:52:31,359
– That ain't truth.
– Ain't it? Then do sumthin', stop her!

1289
01:52:31,401 --> 01:52:35,989
Take your spiker an' slit her throat!

1290
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:39,825
Protect your tribe,
protect your sister, little Caktin,

1291
01:52:39,826 --> 01:52:42,746
kill her now, before it's too late!

1292
01:52:47,334 --> 01:52:48,752
They will kill you.

1293
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:52,130
– You don't know these people like I do.
– Yeah?

1294
01:52:52,547 --> 01:52:55,175
Well if that's all you came to tell me,

1295
01:52:55,258 --> 01:52:56,885
you're a little bit late.

1296
01:52:56,968 --> 01:53:00,306
Somebody just forced me off
the Swannekke bridge.

1297
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:06,437
This is out of control.

1298
01:53:07,313 --> 01:53:08,648
Do you know who did it?

1299
01:53:08,773 --> 01:53:11,526
The contractor calls himself Bill Smoke.

1300
01:53:11,651 --> 01:53:13,986
– And...
– What?

1301
01:53:15,738 --> 01:53:17,240
He got Sachs.

1302
01:53:17,865 --> 01:53:18,866
Isaac?

1303
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:20,451
A bomb on his plane.

1304
01:53:22,411 --> 01:53:24,539
The press is blaming the PLO.

1305
01:53:26,249 --> 01:53:31,295
He was a treat.
Like Sixsmith, like... you.

1306
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:40,972
Bring them thru.

1307
01:53:51,859 --> 01:53:55,696
Sonmi 451,
I'm most honored to meet you.

1308
01:53:55,988 --> 01:53:59,825
I am General An-Cor Apis,
leader of Union.

1309
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:03,036
Who is paying them?

1310
01:54:03,495 --> 01:54:05,330
The same guy that pays me.

1311
01:54:06,039 --> 01:54:07,708
Lloyd Hooks?

1312
01:54:07,958 --> 01:54:10,169
Hughes & Pikes Consulting.

1313
01:54:11,003 --> 01:54:12,921
I've heard of them.

1314
01:54:13,005 --> 01:54:16,466
They're, uh... lobbiers for oil companies.

1315
01:54:18,635 --> 01:54:25,809
Why would big oil... hire
Lloyd Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?

1316
01:54:28,438 --> 01:54:33,443
You get that same look your father
used to get. You see I told you.

1317
01:54:34,068 --> 01:54:36,237
Hooks doesn't want the report discovered,

1318
01:54:36,279 --> 01:54:38,573
because he doesn't want the reactor fixed.

1319
01:54:38,823 --> 01:54:40,700
He wants it to fail.

1320
01:54:40,742 --> 01:54:43,453
This is about the future
of energy in this country.

1321
01:54:44,204 --> 01:54:48,124
They want the explosion.
The chaos and carnage.

1322
01:54:48,249 --> 01:54:50,919
The more deaths, the better.

1323
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,892
Can't cog o' thing,
words n'worrins' like a wasp's nest,

1324
01:55:05,934 --> 01:55:07,519
proke'd n'prod'd by you.

1325
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:11,523
You come elbowin' in' our life,
yibberin' about the True-true,

1326
01:55:11,564 --> 01:55:13,567
and never tellin' the whole true.

1327
01:55:13,901 --> 01:55:15,778
I need to cog what you doin'!

1328
01:55:16,153 --> 01:55:19,657
I told you.
I come to send a plea o' help.

1329
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:21,658
Help, why?

1330
01:55:21,659 --> 01:55:24,203
To steal our land?
To kill n' slave us all?!

1331
01:55:24,245 --> 01:55:25,663
What d'you want?!

1332
01:55:35,756 --> 01:55:39,426
Prescients' dyin', Zach.
Just like Catkin.

1333
01:55:39,885 --> 01:55:42,888
This world poison me n' all my kin'.

1334
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:46,767
We get no help,
ain't no home if I don' find a way.

1335
01:55:46,892 --> 01:55:50,437
I say the truesome.
We not survive.

1336
01:55:51,856 --> 01:55:53,566
We not survive...

1337
01:55:57,278 --> 01:55:59,322
<i>Ayrs has the dogs after me.</i>

1338
01:56:00,365 --> 01:56:03,368
<i>The bullet passed through,
killing little more than his appetite,</i>

1339
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:07,247
<i>and he's out for blood.
I'll have to pay the piper.</i>

1340
01:56:08,331 --> 01:56:11,168
– I should call the cops.
– It won't help.

1341
01:56:12,127 --> 01:56:14,546
How do I know you're not lying to me?

1342
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:18,258
Smoke will be coming for me,
as soon as he figures out I'm with you.

1343
01:56:18,383 --> 01:56:20,677
We need that report.

1344
01:56:20,802 --> 01:56:23,054
I can't protect you for long without it.

1345
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:27,726
– General Apis...
– You, my dear...

1346
01:56:27,767 --> 01:56:31,104
are proof... our efforts were not in vain.

1347
01:56:31,146 --> 01:56:34,107
But... I'm just a dinery server.

1348
01:56:34,232 --> 01:56:37,402
I was not genomed to alter reality.

1349
01:56:37,485 --> 01:56:39,863
No revolutionary ever was.

1350
01:56:44,577 --> 01:56:46,621
I'm sorry.

1351
01:56:46,746 --> 01:56:49,415
I cannot do what you're asking.

1352
01:56:52,752 --> 01:56:56,172
It would be a difficult choice for anyone.

1353
01:56:58,132 --> 01:57:01,969
But, before you call your decision final,

1354
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:05,014
there is one last thing
I would like you to see,

1355
01:57:05,223 --> 01:57:09,060
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for.

1356
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:32,042
Cross your fingers n' toes.

1357
01:58:20,925 --> 01:58:23,011
If your pray' be answered,

1358
01:58:24,012 --> 01:58:26,931
nay Prescients never
return to the Valley again?

1359
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:35,148
Those wishin' to come with us,
they're welcome.

1360
01:58:37,692 --> 01:58:39,485
The Valley is my home.

1361
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:28,911
Are you alright?

1362
01:59:29,662 --> 01:59:33,123
I know... it is forbidden.

1363
02:00:04,281 --> 02:00:09,244
<i>Sixsmith. I climb the steps of
the Scot monument every morning.</i>

1364
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:11,121
<i>And all becomes clear.</i>

1365
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:14,541
<i>Wish I could make you
see this brigthness.</i>

1366
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,837
<i>Don't worry, all is well.</i>

1367
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:22,382
<i>All is so perfectly, damnably well.</i>

1368
02:00:24,176 --> 02:00:31,058
<i>I understand now, that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions.</i>

1369
02:00:34,145 --> 02:00:39,567
<i>All boundaries are conventions,
waiting to be transcended.</i>

1370
02:00:42,069 --> 02:00:44,238
<i>One may trandcend any convention,</i>

1371
02:00:44,447 --> 02:00:47,533
<i>if only one can first
conceive of doing so.</i>

1372
02:00:53,539 --> 02:00:58,920
<i>Moments like this, I can feel your heart
beating as clearly as I feel my own,</i>

1373
02:01:00,046 --> 02:01:03,132
<i>and I know that separation is an illusion.</i>

1374
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:13,894
<i>My life extends far beyond
the limitations of me.</i>

1375
02:01:31,829 --> 02:01:35,582
Storm is coming, Mr. Ewing.
Gonna get you down below.

1376
02:01:37,793 --> 02:01:42,172
I'm not running a fuckin' charity,
out with you! Off you go!!

1377
02:01:43,173 --> 02:01:47,386
Aah, Mr. Ewing!
A-a-a word if you may.

1378
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:53,392
Dangerous times we have here.
About that scandal. They say that

1379
02:01:53,517 --> 02:01:57,605
ruffian Robert Frobisher is a composer.

1380
02:01:58,523 --> 02:02:02,902
You're a composer too,
aren't you Mr. Ewing?

1381
02:02:03,027 --> 02:02:06,823
– What d'you want?
– The constable asked to search my rooms.

1382
02:02:06,948 --> 02:02:09,033
I know how hard... you're working,

1383
02:02:09,075 --> 02:02:12,328
so I told him there's
no one on the third floor.

1384
02:02:12,829 --> 02:02:17,834
It costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty.

1385
02:02:27,677 --> 02:02:29,596
– That's all I have.
– Hmm...

1386
02:02:34,559 --> 02:02:37,854
What a beautiful... waistcoat.

1387
02:02:39,899 --> 02:02:41,817
If these letters are important,

1388
02:02:41,942 --> 02:02:44,361
– why d'you keep reading them?
– I don't know.

1389
02:02:45,112 --> 02:02:48,616
Maybe I'm... just trying
to understand something.

1390
02:02:50,034 --> 02:02:50,993
What?

1391
02:02:52,119 --> 02:02:57,625
Why we keep making the
same mistakes, over and over.

1392
02:02:58,292 --> 02:03:01,462
Maybe you should ask... Megan.

1393
02:03:02,254 --> 02:03:04,715
– What?
– Do you know a Megan?

1394
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,718
That's his niece.
How do you know that?

1395
02:03:09,929 --> 02:03:11,764
Looks like he mailed something to her.

1396
02:03:12,223 --> 02:03:15,851
Probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in.

1397
02:03:17,853 --> 02:03:20,648
Come on, Luisa.
First rule of mystery writing:

1398
02:03:20,731 --> 02:03:23,484
a good clue always leads to another clue.

1399
02:03:24,026 --> 02:03:28,990
When the ghostly ordeal of Timothy
Cavendish is turned into a film,

1400
02:03:29,115 --> 02:03:34,246
I'm thinking for the role of the hero,
one patch of Laurence Olivier

1401
02:03:34,371 --> 02:03:36,164
with a dash of Michael Caine.

1402
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:38,416
Who the hell is this?

1403
02:03:38,542 --> 02:03:41,377
<i>The Doctor Conway of Aurora House,
I'm covering for Dr. Upward.</i>

1404
02:03:41,378 --> 02:03:44,547
– Ooh, is this about mother?
– Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss,

1405
02:03:44,548 --> 02:03:46,132
I-I'm afraid you must deal yourself,

1406
02:03:46,174 --> 02:03:48,176
I don't think that she's
gonna last the night.

1407
02:03:48,718 --> 02:03:51,096
<i>Unfortunately, it is an
unconvenient time for us,</i>

1408
02:03:51,137 --> 02:03:53,306
do we really need to come right now?

1409
02:03:53,723 --> 02:03:57,435
No no, of course not, but she
did ask for you specifically,

1410
02:03:57,727 --> 02:04:00,522
and she seems quite upset
about her last will.

1411
02:04:04,317 --> 02:04:05,485
I'll be right there.

1412
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:19,250
<i>The plan was a series of topling dominoes,</i>

1413
02:04:19,292 --> 02:04:23,212
<i>that had commenced with Ernie
announcing my death to nurse Noakes.</i>

1414
02:04:23,754 --> 02:04:25,925
– I know, I know.
– Shhh!

1415
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:31,137
<i>The entire ambush hinged upon
the silence of Mr. Meeks.</i>

1416
02:04:31,345 --> 02:04:33,308
– I know, I know.
– Shh!

1417
02:04:38,269 --> 02:04:40,146
Mr. Cavendish?

1418
02:04:41,355 --> 02:04:42,815
Everything alright?

1419
02:04:46,402 --> 02:04:48,404
– Don't leave me here.
– Shh.

1420
02:05:03,378 --> 02:05:05,130
Mr. Cavendish?

1421
02:05:10,594 --> 02:05:13,680
– I knew it was too good to be true!
– You temp-temperous witch!

1422
02:05:14,264 --> 02:05:18,602
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother is my
dearest friend here. Do please hurry.

1423
02:05:22,731 --> 02:05:24,983
And so... adieu!

1424
02:05:25,108 --> 02:05:30,447
Which, translated literally from the
French, means: "To command before...

1425
02:05:30,572 --> 02:05:31,740
God"!

1426
02:05:38,498 --> 02:05:42,293
<i>I have Joe Napier on Line 1,
Mr. Hooks. He said it can't wait.</i>

1427
02:05:44,295 --> 02:05:46,840
For God sake, Joe,
I am late already. What's up?

1428
02:05:46,965 --> 02:05:51,302
<i>I got a call from that reporter. Rey...</i>

1429
02:05:51,427 --> 02:05:53,721
She was asking about Sixsmith.

1430
02:05:53,805 --> 02:05:54,722
<i>I see.</i>

1431
02:05:54,848 --> 02:05:56,766
You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.

1432
02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:02,230
Well, some problems are
more resilient than others, Joe.

1433
02:06:04,732 --> 02:06:07,986
– Where's the ruddy key?
– He didn't leave it in the ignition!

1434
02:06:08,111 --> 02:06:10,070
His wife was driving, she took it,

1435
02:06:10,071 --> 02:06:12,657
the ruddy female took
the key in with her!

1436
02:06:12,782 --> 02:06:15,535
Oh Sweet Saint Ruddy Jude,
what do we do now?

1437
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:17,412
Look under the sunpad.

1438
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:23,377
What is it?

1439
02:06:23,502 --> 02:06:25,085
It's not a key, what'd you do with it?

1440
02:06:25,086 --> 02:06:27,214
– What else could it be?
– Well, how does it work?

1441
02:06:29,967 --> 02:06:31,468
– Shite!
– Oh no!

1442
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,637
Well, think of something,
you're the genius,

1443
02:06:33,638 --> 02:06:35,848
you're the bloody ruddy genius!

1444
02:06:38,017 --> 02:06:39,310
We're done for.

1445
02:06:47,568 --> 02:06:51,655
Oh right... I can't even believe
I'm going to do this.

1446
02:06:52,656 --> 02:06:55,326
<i>Is this thing working?
I mean is it still on, can you hear me?</i>

1447
02:06:55,451 --> 02:06:56,994
Just keep walking.

1448
02:07:04,335 --> 02:07:05,753
I think he's behind me.

1449
02:07:06,587 --> 02:07:08,882
Whatever you do, don't look back.

1450
02:07:12,594 --> 02:07:14,179
Get out of my car!

1451
02:07:22,604 --> 02:07:24,439
Press that button thru!

1452
02:07:37,410 --> 02:07:40,789
Oh no, it's Mr. Meeks,
he doesn't want to come.

1453
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:46,586
Ruddy bloody hell!

1454
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:50,799
All for one and one for all?

1455
02:08:06,107 --> 02:08:07,483
The gate!

1456
02:08:09,193 --> 02:08:12,113
Veronica, would you unlock
the door for Mr. Meeks.

1457
02:08:13,865 --> 02:08:17,326
Hello Mr. Meeks,
we're off for a lifetime trife.

1458
02:08:17,451 --> 02:08:19,453
I know, I know.

1459
02:08:24,375 --> 02:08:28,004
– Rev in speed!
– Ho, how fondling!

1460
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:31,622
Oh, no!

1461
02:08:31,623 --> 02:08:33,676
Go for it, cavendish!
– Here we go!

1462
02:08:49,568 --> 02:08:51,236
Here we go.

1463
02:09:23,811 --> 02:09:27,190
Come on, Adam, we haven't all day.
You really need to drink this.

1464
02:09:27,315 --> 02:09:29,692
The worm fights back,

1465
02:09:29,734 --> 02:09:32,820
it is always darkest before the dawn.

1466
02:09:32,862 --> 02:09:34,322
Mr. Ewing?

1467
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:38,492
Mr. Ewing is at a critical
juncture in his treatment.

1468
02:09:38,493 --> 02:09:41,788
The next few hours will
determine if he lives or die.

1469
02:09:41,913 --> 02:09:43,581
Then I stay here.

1470
02:09:43,706 --> 02:09:48,002
– No, no, no you can't.
– I must. Mr. Ewing saved my life.

1471
02:09:48,336 --> 02:09:49,712
It my duty.

1472
02:09:52,298 --> 02:09:55,343
Listen to me, you ignorant ape,

1473
02:09:55,468 --> 02:09:57,220
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him,

1474
02:09:57,262 --> 02:09:59,097
you probably infected him to begin with.

1475
02:09:59,556 --> 02:10:03,434
He begged me, and I quote:
"Keep that dirty nigger away from me!"

1476
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:06,605
So please kindly respect his wishes!

1477
02:10:38,012 --> 02:10:39,680
– Where'd he go?
– I don't know.

1478
02:10:44,101 --> 02:10:45,311
Shit!

1479
02:11:03,496 --> 02:11:05,040
To freedom.

1480
02:11:29,856 --> 02:11:36,322
You are going to be sorry
in ways you cannot even imagine.

1481
02:12:25,289 --> 02:12:27,416
– No immigrants here, no immigrants here.
– Look,

1482
02:12:27,457 --> 02:12:30,085
I'm not an inspector.
We need your help...

1483
02:12:32,504 --> 02:12:33,587
I don't understand.

1484
02:12:33,588 --> 02:12:35,380
[IN PERFECT SPANISH]
We don't want the police to get involved,

1485
02:12:35,381 --> 02:12:37,217
but there is a man trying to kill me

1486
02:12:37,218 --> 02:12:39,636
and we really need your help.

1487
02:12:44,933 --> 02:12:49,021
Are there no true Scotsmen in the house?

1488
02:12:50,355 --> 02:12:54,401
Those there English gerrrrunts

1489
02:12:54,443 --> 02:12:59,031
are trampling all over
my God-given rrights!

1490
02:12:59,907 --> 02:13:02,367
These people are mine.

1491
02:13:06,497 --> 02:13:11,628
They've used me an' my pals most direly,

1492
02:13:11,753 --> 02:13:16,049
and we're in need
of a wee pit of assistance!

1493
02:13:16,174 --> 02:13:17,717
Right, pal...

1494
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:22,138
We'll not gonna let ye down.

1495
02:13:22,263 --> 02:13:24,390
Now you just look here, you grebo,

1496
02:13:24,432 --> 02:13:27,143
you can go shag your bloody sporran...

1497
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:04,056
They two people came in here,
which way did they go?

1498
02:14:07,685 --> 02:14:09,812
Which way they go?!

1499
02:14:12,189 --> 02:14:13,357
Shut up!

1500
02:14:14,650 --> 02:14:16,277
Shut the fuck up!

1501
02:14:21,532 --> 02:14:23,325
Stupid fucking wetback.

1502
02:14:28,163 --> 02:14:29,790
What-what's that, Ewing?

1503
02:14:29,832 --> 02:14:34,588
How shall I comprehend
when you drool and dribble so?

1504
02:14:34,671 --> 02:14:37,215
Oh, let me hazard a guess,
something in the key of

1505
02:14:37,257 --> 02:14:40,176
"Oh Henry, how could you do this to me?

1506
02:14:40,468 --> 02:14:44,514
I thought we were friends?"
Oh, unfortunately, you're wrong.

1507
02:14:44,723 --> 02:14:48,935
Wrong like Horrox and
your silly father-in-law.

1508
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:54,315
There is only one rule that binds
all people, one governing principle

1509
02:14:54,316 --> 02:14:56,985
that defines every relationship
on God's green earth.

1510
02:14:57,694 --> 02:15:02,324
"The Weak are Meat
and the Strong Do Eat."

1511
02:15:36,442 --> 02:15:37,443
That way.

1512
02:15:42,907 --> 02:15:46,327
I told Hooks you couldn't be trusted, Joe.

1513
02:15:46,369 --> 02:15:48,704
You'll be next, you silver bitch.

1514
02:15:48,829 --> 02:15:50,748
Part of the business.

1515
02:15:51,582 --> 02:15:53,834
Enjoy your retirement.

1516
02:15:59,465 --> 02:16:03,010
Amaba... a este... perro!

1517
02:16:06,807 --> 02:16:09,393
And don't call me a fucking wetback.

1518
02:16:13,981 --> 02:16:15,983
"Why?" you ask.

1519
02:16:16,066 --> 02:16:21,572
It's absurdly simple,
there is gold in your trunk, I want it.

1520
02:16:21,738 --> 02:16:24,157
so I've killed you for it.

1521
02:16:33,292 --> 02:16:35,669
Get off Mr. Ewing or you know I kill you!

1522
02:16:39,256 --> 02:16:41,341
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!

1523
02:16:41,466 --> 02:16:44,636
Gotta flush you out.
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.

1524
02:17:45,407 --> 02:17:47,116
What was that?

1525
02:17:47,117 --> 02:17:49,453
Kona war-cry.

1526
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:51,038
Zachry!

1527
02:17:56,585 --> 02:17:58,003
Oh no no, Sonmi, no.

1528
02:17:58,837 --> 02:18:00,005
Zachry!

1529
02:18:07,096 --> 02:18:10,057
This is what the general wanted me to see?

1530
02:18:21,194 --> 02:18:25,907
<i>The end rushes towards me.
Unable to eat or sleep.</i>

1531
02:18:26,032 --> 02:18:30,412
<i>Like Ewing, the "mortal coil"
has become a noose.</i>

1532
02:18:34,249 --> 02:18:36,751
<i>I'd rather become music.</i>

1533
02:18:46,136 --> 02:18:49,556
They believe they're going to Exultation.

1534
02:18:49,973 --> 02:18:52,851
But they are not, are they?

1535
02:19:06,365 --> 02:19:08,784
Welcome to Exultation.

1536
02:19:09,994 --> 02:19:11,454
Take a seat.

1537
02:19:15,208 --> 02:19:17,168
Just relax.

1538
02:19:18,211 --> 02:19:21,005
This is to remove your collar.

1539
02:21:39,313 --> 02:21:43,317
<i>"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"</i>

1540
02:22:27,863 --> 02:22:32,826
The genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks.

1541
02:22:32,951 --> 02:22:36,246
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force.

1542
02:22:37,414 --> 02:22:40,876
Recycled Fabricants are
a cheap source of protein.

1543
02:22:42,127 --> 02:22:43,712
Soap.

1544
02:22:46,215 --> 02:22:49,468
They feed us to ourselves.

1545
02:23:00,563 --> 02:23:01,981
That ship...

1546
02:23:05,067 --> 02:23:07,778
The ship must be destroyed.

1547
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:10,990
Yes.

1548
02:23:11,115 --> 02:23:15,661
The systems that built them
must be turned down.

1549
02:23:17,121 --> 02:23:18,164
Yes.

1550
02:23:19,415 --> 02:23:25,713
No matter if we're born in a tank
or a womb, we are all Pureblood.

1551
02:23:28,216 --> 02:23:29,008
Yes.

1552
02:23:31,595 --> 02:23:37,142
We must all fight...
and if necessary, die

1553
02:23:38,018 --> 02:23:42,147
to teach people the truth.

1554
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:52,824
This is what we have been waiting for.

1555
02:23:59,623 --> 02:24:01,124
<i>It's done.</i>

1556
02:25:22,249 --> 02:25:26,212
You were then taken to
a Union control satellite link.

1557
02:25:27,087 --> 02:25:33,302
I broadcast my Revelation to the
twelve States and four Off-World colonies.

1558
02:25:33,969 --> 02:25:38,682
18 minutes later,
the Enforcers attacked.

1559
02:25:40,226 --> 02:25:42,937
<i>To be is to be perceived.</i>

1560
02:25:43,562 --> 02:25:49,027
And so to know thyself is only possible
through the eyes of the other.

1561
02:25:51,947 --> 02:25:54,365
<i>The nature of our immortal lives</i>

1562
02:25:54,366 --> 02:25:58,328
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds,

1563
02:25:59,246 --> 02:26:03,667
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time.

1564
02:26:46,168 --> 02:26:48,045
Hide.

1565
02:27:15,073 --> 02:27:18,410
From good chief, now you're meat.

1566
02:28:20,723 --> 02:28:23,601
– Catkin...
– Uncle Zach.

1567
02:28:30,733 --> 02:28:32,068
Thanks, Zachry.

1568
02:28:32,777 --> 02:28:35,321
No, thank you.

1569
02:28:44,707 --> 02:28:48,502
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.
One more.

1570
02:28:49,003 --> 02:28:53,173
One more.
Salt clean out your stomach.

1571
02:28:56,468 --> 02:29:00,222
Close.
Com'on Mr. Ewing, com'on!

1572
02:29:04,184 --> 02:29:08,522
Do you see where we are, Mr. Ewing?

1573
02:29:10,482 --> 02:29:11,483
Home.

1574
02:29:18,532 --> 02:29:20,534
Megan Sixsmith?

1575
02:29:30,962 --> 02:29:32,422
Make them pay.

1576
02:29:36,968 --> 02:29:39,012
You can count on it.

1577
02:29:48,396 --> 02:29:49,522
Thank you.

1578
02:29:53,526 --> 02:29:55,612
My uncle was a scientist,

1579
02:29:55,737 --> 02:29:59,282
but... he believed that love was real.

1580
02:30:00,534 --> 02:30:04,454
A kind of... natural phenomenon.

1581
02:30:06,998 --> 02:30:11,962
He believed that love could outlive death.

1582
02:30:15,383 --> 02:30:19,345
<i>I finished it in a frenzy that reminded me
of our last night in Cambridge.</i>

1583
02:30:20,721 --> 02:30:24,976
<i>Watched my final sunrise,
enjoyed the last cigarette.</i>

1584
02:30:25,476 --> 02:30:27,978
<i>Didn't think the view
could be anymore perfect,</i>

1585
02:30:27,979 --> 02:30:30,356
until I saw that beat-up trilby.

1586
02:30:32,233 --> 02:30:36,320
<i>Honestly, Sixsmith, as
ridiculous as that thing makes you look,</i>

1587
02:30:36,445 --> 02:30:39,699
<i>I don't believe I've ever seen
anything more beautiful.</i>

1588
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:48,624
<i>Watched you for as long as I dared.</i>

1589
02:30:50,793 --> 02:30:55,464
<i>I don't believe it was a fluke
that I saw you first.</i>

1590
02:30:58,577 --> 02:30:59,829
– Okay.
– Thank you.

1591
02:31:05,225 --> 02:31:07,603
Captain saysoed he take you with us.

1592
02:31:07,728 --> 02:31:11,064
– I wanna go with Meronym.
– Go... Go where?

1593
02:31:12,065 --> 02:31:16,570
Prescients in the same boat as all us.
Got no home neitherwise.

1594
02:31:18,447 --> 02:31:21,617
Nay, not yet.

1595
02:31:23,410 --> 02:31:28,916
You think someone will gonna hear
your prayer, come down from the sky?

1596
02:31:29,291 --> 02:31:30,834
Perhaps...

1597
02:31:30,959 --> 02:31:32,920
Perhaps one day.

1598
02:31:33,045 --> 02:31:35,422
One day ain't but a flea o' hope.

1599
02:31:35,964 --> 02:31:38,342
Yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.

1600
02:31:52,398 --> 02:31:55,777
<i>I believe there is another
world waiting for us, Sixsmith.</i>

1601
02:31:55,902 --> 02:31:57,820
<i>A better world.</i>

1602
02:31:58,321 --> 02:32:00,531
<i>And I'll be waiting for you there.</i>

1603
02:32:02,992 --> 02:32:04,202
May I help you, sir?

1604
02:32:04,203 --> 02:32:07,455
Yes, thank you. I-I'm looking for
a friend who came to Edinburg...

1605
02:32:14,462 --> 02:32:17,048
<i>I believe we do not stay dead long.</i>

1606
02:32:18,925 --> 02:32:22,470
<i>Find me beneath the Corsican
stars where we first kissed.</i>

1607
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:27,726
<i>Yours eternally.
R.F.</i>

1608
02:33:37,130 --> 02:33:41,259
The report said commander Zheng
was killed in the assault.

1609
02:33:41,968 --> 02:33:43,553
That is correct.

1610
02:33:45,138 --> 02:33:47,182
But you say that you loved him?

1611
02:33:48,892 --> 02:33:50,477
Yes I do.

1612
02:33:51,770 --> 02:33:55,065
You mean you are still in love with him?

1613
02:33:55,649 --> 02:33:58,319
I mean that I will always be.

1614
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:04,825
Our lives are not our own.

1615
02:34:05,993 --> 02:34:10,831
From womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.

1616
02:34:13,751 --> 02:34:16,379
Past and present.

1617
02:34:24,262 --> 02:34:28,015
And by each crime and every kindness,

1618
02:34:29,642 --> 02:34:32,562
we birth our future.

1619
02:34:56,545 --> 02:35:00,381
In your Revelation, you spoke of
the consequences of an undividual's life

1620
02:35:00,382 --> 02:35:03,760
replicated throughout eternity.

1621
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:09,516
Does this mean that
you believe in an afterlife?

1622
02:35:10,642 --> 02:35:12,728
No heaven or hell?

1623
02:35:15,564 --> 02:35:19,693
I believe death is only a door.

1624
02:35:21,528 --> 02:35:25,575
When its closes, another opens.

1625
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:29,829
If I'd care to imagine heaven,

1626
02:35:30,455 --> 02:35:33,082
I would imagine a door open.

1627
02:35:34,751 --> 02:35:36,878
And behind it,

1628
02:35:38,129 --> 02:35:42,258
I will find him there, waiting for me.

1629
02:35:53,019 --> 02:35:54,479
My love.

1630
02:35:58,983 --> 02:36:01,653
Oh God, I missed you so much.

1631
02:36:08,451 --> 02:36:09,870
Thank you, sir.

1632
02:36:11,997 --> 02:36:14,833
If I may ask one last question...

1633
02:36:15,292 --> 02:36:18,796
You had to know this Union
scheme was doomed to fail.

1634
02:36:18,921 --> 02:36:19,922
Yes.

1635
02:36:20,214 --> 02:36:22,591
And why did you agree to it?

1636
02:36:22,841 --> 02:36:26,804
This is what general Apis asked of me.

1637
02:36:26,929 --> 02:36:29,014
What, to be executed?

1638
02:36:29,431 --> 02:36:34,143
If I had remained invisible,
the truth would stay hidden.

1639
02:36:34,144 --> 02:36:36,188
I couldn't allow that.

1640
02:36:38,691 --> 02:36:42,528
And what if no one believes this truth?

1641
02:36:45,155 --> 02:36:47,157
Someone already does.

1642
02:37:06,887 --> 02:37:08,638
Adam, good God...

1643
02:37:08,763 --> 02:37:12,392
I have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure.

1644
02:37:12,517 --> 02:37:15,102
Please, join us.
Give him a chair.

1645
02:37:15,103 --> 02:37:16,605
No no, thank you.

1646
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:18,732
I cannot stay.

1647
02:37:18,815 --> 02:37:22,444
What are you doing here? Has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed?

1648
02:37:22,611 --> 02:37:25,280
He did, but this couldn't wait.

1649
02:37:26,448 --> 02:37:28,449
I need to speak with you, sir.
Privately.

1650
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:30,493
Of course.

1651
02:37:39,044 --> 02:37:42,089
Is that the contract
from Reverend Horrox?

1652
02:37:43,299 --> 02:37:46,802
– It is indeed.
– Well, you know I could have sent a boy.

1653
02:37:52,266 --> 02:37:54,435
Are you insane?!

1654
02:37:54,810 --> 02:37:58,856
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.

1655
02:37:59,815 --> 02:38:04,320
And I cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer.

1656
02:38:07,031 --> 02:38:09,200
This would make such a good book.

1657
02:38:09,325 --> 02:38:10,952
I'll drink to that.

1658
02:38:20,753 --> 02:38:27,261
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls.</i>

1659
02:38:27,386 --> 02:38:32,975
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

1660
02:38:33,058 --> 02:38:37,312
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

1661
02:38:49,116 --> 02:38:54,413
Goddamn you, sir, if you were
not my daughter's husband...

1662
02:38:54,538 --> 02:38:56,081
Hello, Father.

1663
02:38:56,748 --> 02:38:57,916
Tilda?

1664
02:39:00,752 --> 02:39:02,128
What's going on?

1665
02:39:02,129 --> 02:39:04,590
I've come to say goodbye.

1666
02:39:04,715 --> 02:39:07,217
Goodbye?
Where are you going?

1667
02:39:07,342 --> 02:39:11,055
We're moving back East,
to work with the abolitionists.

1668
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:12,682
What?

1669
02:39:13,641 --> 02:39:17,979
That poison has rotted your brain.

1670
02:39:18,021 --> 02:39:20,648
Oh if it has, I highly recommend it.

1671
02:39:20,857 --> 02:39:22,984
I've not felt this good in years.

1672
02:39:23,109 --> 02:39:27,196
Tilda, I forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man.

1673
02:39:27,322 --> 02:39:30,450
I've been afraid of you
my whole life, Father.

1674
02:39:33,286 --> 02:39:35,622
I'm going with my husband.

1675
02:39:40,668 --> 02:39:41,586
Adam.

1676
02:39:45,632 --> 02:39:47,425
Listen to me...

1677
02:39:47,926 --> 02:39:51,638
For the sake of my grandson,
if not your own...

1678
02:39:51,763 --> 02:39:54,891
there is a natural order to this world,

1679
02:39:54,892 --> 02:39:58,604
and those who try to upend it
do not fare well.

1680
02:40:00,231 --> 02:40:03,150
This movement will never survive.

1681
02:40:03,776 --> 02:40:08,322
If you join them, you and
your entire family will be shunned.

1682
02:40:08,447 --> 02:40:13,035
At best, you exist as pariah,
to be spat on and beaten.

1683
02:40:13,577 --> 02:40:17,122
At worst, lynched or crucified.

1684
02:40:34,765 --> 02:40:36,684
And for what?

1685
02:40:38,228 --> 02:40:39,688
For what?

1686
02:40:39,813 --> 02:40:43,023
No matter what you do, it will
never amount to anything more

1687
02:40:43,024 --> 02:40:46,736
than a single drop in a limitless ocean.

1688
02:40:47,904 --> 02:40:51,408
What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

1689
02:41:04,838 --> 02:41:06,756
Fire is dyin'.

1690
02:41:08,133 --> 02:41:11,261
Just as well, my yawnin' is done.

1691
02:41:11,286 --> 02:41:13,286
No, please Gran'Pi, Please!

1692
02:41:15,307 --> 02:41:18,768
Come on, come here, you little buggars!
Com'on, it's getting cold!

1693
02:41:18,852 --> 02:41:22,064
No, you heard your Gran'mi,
com'on, get on with you.

1694
02:41:33,784 --> 02:41:36,746
You like it down here, don't you Gran'pi?

1695
02:41:37,413 --> 02:41:41,375
Supposin'... reminds me of my Valley.

1696
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:43,252
Which is Earth?

1697
02:41:46,339 --> 02:41:49,383
That in there, that blue shimmerin'.

1698
02:41:54,639 --> 02:41:56,891
Now, help your Gran'pi up.

1699
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:04,778
You gonna tell us about the
roguesome ship, and the big split,

1700
02:42:04,779 --> 02:42:06,067
and all the next-next?

1701
02:42:06,192 --> 02:42:09,780
Oh, your Gran'mi tells the next-next
way better than me.

1702
02:42:11,698 --> 02:42:13,992
D'you still love Gran'mi?

1703
02:42:16,245 --> 02:42:20,999
Your Gran'mi is the best thin'
that ever happened to me.

1704
02:42:27,172 --> 02:42:29,341
Come on, you Gran'pi.

1705
02:42:29,466 --> 02:42:32,386
Let me warm that li'le ol' bone.

1706
02:42:50,898 --> 02:42:58,899
