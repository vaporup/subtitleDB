Congratulations...

23
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:11,918
Is Master Wong Fei Hung there?

24
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,878
Fei Hung is out,

25
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:14,468
thank you for coming

26
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,392
Give them the red packets for their presents

27
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:16,942
I am going to fetch it at once

28
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,682
Thank you Master Tam,

29
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,262
your present is too precious!

30
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,699
Please go in and have some tea

31
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,477
After you...

32
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:25,507
Red packets...

33
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,128
Come on, it's yours

34
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,475
Master Chiu has arrived

35
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:31,060
Your son won in the Lion King Competition,

36
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:32,335
he is so famous now

37
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,935
Give a red packet as a present

38
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,220
Master Wong,

39
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,148
today is a big day.

40
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:38,149
I want to have a drink with your son.

41
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,018
Where is Fei Hung?

42
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,544
He has gone to the train station

43
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,288
Is this the lion head used by Wong Fei Hung

44
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:42,917
for the competition?

45
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,411
I've heard that this defeated
thousand of lions

46
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:46,982
for the gold medal

47
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:51,323
Someone said Master Wong joined
the competition so as to save a person

48
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:54,370
That's why he returned the medal to
the government after receiving it

49
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,128
What a hero!

50
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,502
Isn't it fantastic!

51
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:02,705
A true hero!

52
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,755
The Lion King Competition started...

53
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,738
My master,
Wong Fei Hung, appeared

54
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,939
He is the head of the 10 Tigers of Canton,

55
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,295
and he is the coach of the Local Militia

56
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,578
He stood on the tower,

57
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,695
he called, "Leung Fu,

58
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,683
Leung Fu..."

59
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,387
Who is Leung Fu?

60
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:18,851
Why did Wong Fei Hung

61
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,390
shout for his help at such at critical moment?

62
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,765
Leung Fu, never heard of him!

63
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:23,398
Never heard of him?

64
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,607
He is so famous

65
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:25,948
What a shame!

66
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:29,082
About Leung Fu,

67
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,419
his eyes are sharp and big

68
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:32,603
Look at me!

69
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,946
Remind you of anybody?

70
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:35,476
Leung Fu is great,

71
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:38,126
he is a famous Kung-fu master
from Mei Province to Fu-Shan

72
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,076
He is famous from Fu-Shan

73
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,968
to Macao and to Hong Kong too

74
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:43,759
Inform me when you see Master

75
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:45,929
I haven't seen Master yet,

76
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:46,981
let Fu keep on bluffing

77
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,932
Leung Fu is the number one
student of Master Wong,

78
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,672
but...

79
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,873
He is as famous as
Wong Fei Hung

80
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,250
I know him so well!

81
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,597
Guess who am I!

82
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,425
I don't know

83
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,514
Don't you know?

84
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,476
Let me tell you

85
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,189
I am Leung Fu

86
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,043
It's him, it's him

87
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,893
Wrong guy

88
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:04,727
Foolish people,

89
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:05,560
they are too ignorant

90
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,512
Master...

91
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:14,457
Master!
- What's the matter?

92
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:15,843
Some officials are coming,
they look nasty

93
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,043
Officials?
- Yes

94
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:17,136
What are they coming for?

95
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,288
Maybe they are coming to arrest someone?

96
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,466
Impossible, let's go and have a look

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,107
Sire

98
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,884
The Deputy Governor is coming
with his golden dragon

99
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,484
with a congratulation card
from the General's Office,

100
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:26,319
for Master Wong

101
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,165
Please arrange for the reception

102
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,285
A congratulation from the General's Office?

103
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,351
Quick!
Ask them to prepare the firecrackers,

104
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,691
to welcome the golden dragon

105
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:35,525
Hurry up!

106
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,281
Brother Fu,
a golden dragon is coming from the East Gate

107
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,700
A dragon?

108
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,003
Yes, a big dragon

109
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:02,985
Coming for a challenge?

110
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,165
You are stepping on my foot

111
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:10,368
Brother Fu, what'll we do?

112
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:10,790
Inform Master now

113
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,511
There's no time!
Now, listen to me

114
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,221
Ah Yan,

115
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:13,722
bring me the lion head

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,532
Club Foot, the flag of our Association

117
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:17,278
Don't forget the drum

118
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,692
I see them,
they are outside the East Gate

119
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:33,323
Give way please

120
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,366
Here comes the Lion King

121
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:53,526
Sire

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,435
What's the matter?

123
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:56,889
A lion from the Cantonese Association

124
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,511
has come to block our way

125
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,535
Block our way?

126
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,149
Have they come to welcome us?

127
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:03,891
It doesn't seem so

128
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,361
The lion keeps kicking our dragon's head

129
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,758
Master

130
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,990
Have the people from the
General's Office arrived yet?

131
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,493
No, they've stopped in front of the East Gate

132
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:12,837
Why?

133
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,564
A lion is challenging them

134
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,437
Brother Fu, balance yourself,
don't fall down

135
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,515
Brother Fu, you are heavy

136
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,215
No Shadow Kick from Fu-Shan

137
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,730
The dragon head can't touch
the ground

138
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,168
I haven't lost face, have I?

139
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,148
Dragon in the sky!

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,208
Lion head

141
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,537
Think you can catch the lion head again?

142
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:56,549
Club Foot

143
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:58,826
Master!

144
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:26,222
Master!

145
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,027
You are back?!

146
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:29,391
Why are you standing there?

147
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,462
Hold the tail

148
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:31,430
Yes, Master

149
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,133
He must be Wong Fei Hung

150
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,685
Dragon in the sky

151
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,496
Master, watch the dragon

152
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:46,791
Club Foot, "Rolling tiger"

153
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,631
Club Foot,
"Tiger look up to the moon"

154
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,514
All right

155
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,744
They are higher,
let me test you

156
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:21,537
Clubfoot, the lion head must face the
dragon head, that's the rule, got it?

157
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,379
That's no problem at all

158
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,368
Club Foot, keep your balance,
don't make any mistakes

159
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,206
I am speedy

160
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,319
Excellent, so stable

161
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:47,792
Dragon ball

162
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,629
Dragon ball from the golden
dragon, it represents good luck

163
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:54,303
Catch the ball

164
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,893
Master Wong, good luck to you

165
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,686
Thank you very much

166
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:06,993
Ever successful

167
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:08,172
Ever successful

168
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,248
Club Foot, let me send you there

169
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:35,629
Once again

170
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,970
Master, I can't make it

171
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,207
Let me do it

172
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:50,005
Catch the tail

173
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:50,811
Yes

174
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:23,950
My respects!

175
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:27,681
I am the Deputy Governor,
Guan Shingtao

176
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:30,284
Your Excellency,
I am Wong Fei Hung from Fu-Shan

177
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:34,373
I've heard your name for a long time,
you're really a great master in Kung-fu

178
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,609
We've seen the best today

179
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,257
You really are the Lion King

180
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:41,473
Thank you

181
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:43,232
You're welcome

182
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,373
If it hadn't been for this,

183
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,913
we would never have seen
your fantastic lion dance

184
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,373
Master Wong rejected the gold medal of Lion King

185
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,919
Thus, his Excellency Li Hung-Chang asked me
to return the medal to you

186
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,653
Please

187
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,768
don't make me lose face

188
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:59,720
Come on, please take it

189
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,675
Your Excellency...

190
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:01,761
Please take it

191
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,143
Thank you, Your Excellency

192
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,252
Please be seated

193
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,274
Thank you

194
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:11,427
Fu!

195
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:12,377
Tell me,

196
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,424
how should I punish you?

197
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,606
I know what to do

198
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,388
I have packed up,
I will leave for Fu-Shan by tomorrow morning

199
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,633
How about the ticket?

200
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,782
I have asked Uncle Kau to buy it for me

201
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:23,076
I will go to the train station
by tomorrow morning

202
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:27,333
When you reach Fu-Shan,
write me a letter to tell me you're all right.

203
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:28,578
It's written

204
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,682
No, I mean

205
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,699
I will write a letter
right after reaching Fu-Shan

206
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:35,730
You are always disobedient

207
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:39,473
Brother Fu

208
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,624
What's the matter?

209
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:41,803
Let me come back to Fu-Shan with you.

210
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:43,056
I'll live in seclusion with you

211
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,496
Live in seclusion,

212
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:44,911
you are that great?

213
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,025
I won't stop you from living
in seclusion alone

214
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,102
You've a night to think over,

215
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,275
are you going to live in seclusion or not?

216
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:53,337
Your Excellency

217
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:53,981
Master Wong

218
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,165
Everybody, please

219
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,819
Master Wong, please take a look

220
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:57,528
An invitation?

221
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:58,231
Yes

222
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,229
Why is there another Lion King competition?

223
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,954
This Lion Competition is between 8 countries

224
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,199
Another competition

225
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:07,576
what a pity you're going back to Fu-Shan soon

226
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,864
Why do the foreigners want to
organize another lion competition?

227
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,005
This lion competition organized

228
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,725
by 8 foreign countries,

229
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,736
mirrors the present situation,

230
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:19,265
The relationships between China

231
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:21,012
and the other countries are quite tense

232
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,457
Our country is getting weaker and weaker

233
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:26,184
The challenge of the 8 countries

234
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,991
Is designed to suppress our spirit

235
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,995
there may be other tricks as well

236
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,404
To compete with the lions of the foreigners...

237
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,254
It's quite a challenge

238
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,815
I won't leave no matter what!

239
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:37,030
I guessed so

240
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:39,236
Master Wong

241
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,824
this competition is similar to a war

242
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,425
Our office has sent someone
to investigate their force

243
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:49,302
These are the plans designed by the foreigners

244
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,739
Golden Eagle, Giant Clam

245
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:56,131
Long Dragon, Double Horses

246
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,371
Flying Phoenix,

247
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:00,482
Golden Unicorn

248
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:03,944
I have heard that these lions

249
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,759
are much bigger than normal

250
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:07,900
They are specially equipped

251
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,055
But I don't know how powerful they are

252
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,754
I hope you can participate

253
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,135
in the competition with me

254
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,304
To fight together for our beloved country

255
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,091
Master Wong, it's different

256
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:20,297
from the previous competition

257
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:22,598
I hope you'll come with us

258
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,613
Fu, guess what Master's answer will be

259
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,381
He must say,

260
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,426
"I'm afraid we may be trapped if we

261
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,287
participate in this competition"

262
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,561
I am afraid we may be

263
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,187
trapped if we participate in this competition

264
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,221
"But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face"

265
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,752
"I think, we should have a detailed plan"

266
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,569
But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face

267
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:50,369
I think, we should have a detailed plan

268
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,940
Master Wong, are you going to participate or not?

269
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,163
"In our present situation,

270
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,940
it's pointless participating in this competition"

271
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,001
Although we know this a trap

272
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,967
we should take the risk anyway

273
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,178
I have to participate in this competition

274
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:13,873
Master Wong

275
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,735
We're going to participate in the competition,
bravo!

276
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,237
Shit

277
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:22,868
I can't stay for the competition

278
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:25,576
Oh yes

279
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:29,698
Go and seek help from Aunt May

280
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,374
Good idea

281
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,899
Aunt May!

282
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:32,636
How can she help?

283
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,681
She has a news agency in Peking

284
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,191
Go and help her to deliver

285
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:37,875
the newspapers, beg her to let you stay

286
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,881
And ask her not to tell Master, that's it

287
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,926
Good idea, but...

288
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,879
Your ideas are usually terrible

289
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,463
Is this Man Hing News?

290
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,569
It seems to be

291
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:51,466
Aunt May...

292
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:52,294
Have you got the wrong address?

293
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,223
Aunt May

294
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,440
Coming...

295
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,332
Aunt May

296
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,005
Who's it?

297
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,602
It's me, Leung Fu

298
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:00,899
Aunt May

299
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,977
Have you had Cantonese tea yet?

300
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:03,580
There is no Cantonese restaurant in Peking!

301
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,138
Why did you bring so much luggage with you?

302
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,425
You know, Master is so mean!

303
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,605
So we didn't tell Master we came to help,
but told him we were going to Fu-Shan

304
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,654
Don't tell...

305
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,512
Don't tell your Master you are hiding here,
right?

306
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:15,758
Right...

307
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:16,846
So you...

308
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,561
Only Brother Fu was kicked out by Master

309
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,301
You bastard

310
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,345
What's happened?

311
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,520
Brother Fu, I don't mean to tell the truth

312
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,276
You always betray me

313
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,949
I didn't...

314
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:27,522
Not another word!

315
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:28,684
Follow me

316
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:30,719
Stupid

317
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:32,835
You deserved that!

318
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,010
Let's have a look...

319
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:37,404
So spacious!

320
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,800
Will they publish the news about your arrival?

321
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:48,753
Don't say anything without my consent

322
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,840
Siu Mo, come here

323
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:54,669
What's the matter?

324
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,466
Look. This word is wrong,

325
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,033
you should write it this way

326
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:01,599
And this paragraph,

327
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:02,721
why not move it down here.

328
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,837
So, it won't be that messy

329
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:04,703
That's the way to print a newspaper

330
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,943
Try it

331
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,147
The words are not clear enough

332
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,161
Don't be big mouth

333
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,028
it's printed on the dress

334
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:19,892
You assaulted Aunt May

335
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:21,286
Brother Fu, I was about to tell you,
but you didn't...

336
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,340
You always betray me,
and now you want to frame me too?

337
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:23,763
You bastard!

338
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,206
How dare you set me up?

339
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:25,072
Set up? What set up?

340
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:25,770
What was set up?

341
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:30,534
Fu, you must be insane!

342
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:31,779
Someone is coming

343
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,243
Siu King, open the door

344
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,126
Let me help her to open the door

345
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,217
Miss Siu King, let me open the door for you

346
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,674
No, thanks

347
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:41,626
Who is it?

348
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,142
Wong Fei Hung

349
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,037
Why did Fu react so strangely?

350
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:47,319
Master is coming,

351
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:47,891
hide up now, be quick

352
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,983
Master Wong

353
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:51,659
Don't tell him that I am here

354
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:54,540
What was the noise about?

355
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:56,200
Someone wanted to open the door for me

356
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,266
When he heard your name,

357
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,190
he was got scared

358
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:58,694
and ran away

359
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,192
Does the man have big eyes?

360
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,633
Right, that's him

361
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:06,654
And a guy like this

362
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,094
He is here too

363
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,626
And the other one, like this

364
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:17,690
Let's get out of here!

365
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,540
Brother Fu, your luggage!

366
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,693
What's wrong with you?

367
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,228
Why shout at me?

368
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:28,683
Club Foot, hurry up

369
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:30,727
Why shout at me again?!

370
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:35,361
Brother-in-law,

371
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:36,928
have you seen sister to the train station?

372
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:38,601
Where are they?

373
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:39,743
Stop searching,

374
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,211
they left when they saw me

375
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,159
Your sister asked me to take care of you

376
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,878
Sister asked me to take care of you too

377
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,063
Are you hoping sister would come back sooner?

378
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,908
I may write to her

379
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,080
What kind of important news is it?

380
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,332
Why is it printed on a cloth?

381
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,144
Nothing, look at it yourself

382
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,067
It's an article
about the status of woman in China

383
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:01,993
What kind of status do women have?

384
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:07,425
So, you only ever think about men?

385
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,267
This news agency of sister's is in real trouble

386
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,058
Look at the newspapers,
they are all piled up here

387
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:14,391
They never sell,
no one wants to look at them

388
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:15,766
No matter what we print,
it's useless

389
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:17,433
Someone will take a look at it

390
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,549
Who?

391
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,666
They'll give me face if I ask them to take a look

392
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,757
Of course! It's too generous of Master Wong

393
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,517
It's a gift from Master Wong, one for everyone

394
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,373
Stop fighting over them!

395
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,046
Everyone gets one

396
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,297
Be careful!

397
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:32,014
Don't break the things inside

398
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,783
What's in the wrapping?

399
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,028
Other than a paper, nothing else!

400
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,595
It is a newspaper

401
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,437
The more newspapers you read,
the more you will know about the world

402
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:44,030
The more you know,
the more you can achieve

403
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,397
Is this sheet of paper that powerful?

404
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,322
To be frank, my students and I

405
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,432
come from poor families

406
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,275
We want to learn Kung-fu

407
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,942
to earn a living

408
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:56,565
We haven't studied, so we are illiterate

409
00:20:57,111 --> 00:21:00,369
How can we read the newspaper?

410
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,953
What a pity,
they can't show you the respect they want to

411
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,011
The paper is so dirty,
don't use it for wrapping anymore

412
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,538
OK, just once

413
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:12,676
I think, we should start teaching people to read
before operating a newspaper

414
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,398
Or, these papers will just be used as wrapping

415
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:18,610
I wish there were more people
like you in the world

416
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,491
Your sister never praised me like this

417
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:27,154
Am I nicer, or is my sister nicer?

418
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:29,612
You are both nice

419
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,317
The Ladies of the Red Lantern are coming.

420
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,468
Come and take a look

421
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,173
The Red Lanterns?

422
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,540
Let's go and take a look

423
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,454
"We come from the four seas"

424
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:53,754
"Our lantern is hung on the

425
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,929
mast to recruit heroes"

426
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,484
"Our God sends us the swords"

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,469
The angels change the clouds

428
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:00,722
with their handkerchiefs

429
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,089
"The world, receives our order"

430
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:05,135
"Our words will be spread forever"

431
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:10,254
"We fear not foreign guns"

432
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:11,432
"For we use wind, fire,

433
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,658
thunder and lightning as weapons"

434
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,963
"We are powerful"

435
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:27,106
Dressed in red, with little lanterns

436
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,148
The ladies from the Red Lantern Sect

437
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:30,164
Juggle!

438
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:41,421
Expel the foreigners
and strengthen our beloved country

439
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,830
Red Lantern shines on the fairies,

440
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:43,918
expel the foreigners,

441
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:44,581
we are enriched with power

442
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:46,239
We use holy swords to go against foreign guns

443
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:47,972
A riot over there!

444
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,515
Don't go over there,

445
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,238
It's too dangerous

446
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,856
I will wait for you right here

447
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:51,462
All right!

448
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:53,664
We have strong will to protect our holy land

449
00:23:54,788 --> 00:23:55,356
Throw the lanterns

450
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,733
Juggle!

451
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:04,244
Hear my order!

452
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,011
Return the holy land to us

453
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,885
Set the altar to hang the lanterns

454
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:09,386
Expel the foreigners

455
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:11,403
Mister, please lend me the whip

456
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,843
Give way please

457
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,884
This is the foreigner’s drugs store

458
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,595
Don't kill innocent people

459
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,464
What's the situation?

460
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:30,450
The leased territory is ahead,

461
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:31,574
the foreign troops will be coming soon

462
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,141
Don't go there

463
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,065
You'll lose your life if they catch you

464
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,382
Have you seen Wong Fei Hung?

465
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:35,054
Master Wong?

466
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:35,819
He must have left

467
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:36,239
Left?

468
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,614
Did you see him leaving?

469
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,161
Go!

470
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:46,337
You are Ladies...

471
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,588
What drives you to kill people and set fires?

472
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:55,501
Don't kill us, we're innocent

473
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,243
I've come to save you

474
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,677
They are coming, kill them!

475
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,443
Yes!

476
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,714
Let them go

477
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:03,142
Don't listen to him, attack!

478
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:10,845
Don't come over here again

479
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:21,618
You may go now

480
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,857
Go, run for your lives!

481
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,295
Who is he?

482
00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:26,537
He must be Wong Fei Hung

483
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:44,210
Wong Fei Hung?

484
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:45,143
Go!

485
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:48,910
Come here

486
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,063
Juggle!

487
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,806
Red Ropes!

488
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:05,985
Attack

489
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,192
The foreigners are coming,

490
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:28,762
run!

491
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,251
They're over there, fire!

492
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:33,846
Go!

493
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:54,080
Your ladies have all left, why haven't you?

494
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,148
Don't move

495
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:00,772
The lease troops

496
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:02,930
Take them away, go!

497
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:04,976
Go!

498
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:06,450
The Red Lantern is showing it's power

499
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:07,212
Holy Mother

500
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:10,694
Watch out, be careful

501
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:11,468
Yes

502
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:21,342
Have you seen a Chinese
fellow passing by the way you came?

503
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:23,636
No

504
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,781
I think the patient needs more medication

505
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:42,633
Let me help you

506
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,458
You'll go home soon. Don't cry

507
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,812
Miss...

508
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:53,916
We have come to a conclusion,

509
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,046
you should leave this place immediately

510
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,799
All right,

511
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,144
if that will make you feel better

512
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,121
I leave now, but...

513
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,749
Maybe you need some more help later

514
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:08,036
I don't think so. Go

515
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,885
Child, let me help you to open the door

516
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:17,845
Thank you

517
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,005
I saw everything

518
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:22,835
Our Father won't forsake

519
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,588
those who devote their lives to others

520
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,406
Father, I hope there is a real God

521
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,965
So as to solve the hatred between our nations

522
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:34,045
Otherwise, we can't escape
from the coming disaster

523
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,341
Don't worry,

524
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,492
God has arranged everything

525
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,153
May God bless you

526
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:42,140
Thank you Father

527
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:43,791
Take care

528
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,608
Welcome to our army

529
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:08,879
Your ancestors sacrificed

530
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:09,907
themselves in the

531
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:10,710
Anti-Ching movement

532
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:17,158
This is the 8-colour flag of the Ching army

533
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:19,820
Lui...

534
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,608
You'll have chance to take revenge
for your ancestors now

535
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:58,420
Wong

536
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,305
Bravo,

537
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:22,898
I'm General Henlintak

538
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,178
Lui, Wong,

539
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,280
tell the descendants of the Anti-Ching warriors

540
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,553
You have my full support

541
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:30,217
To go against the Ching soldiers

542
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:31,330
who invaded your land

543
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:35,466
Kill him, kill him

544
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:41,287
You pig

545
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:53,259
Put him in the cell

546
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:55,223
Put him in the shithole

547
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,605
Wong Fei Hung

548
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:06,941
Did they torture you?

549
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:10,059
Are you the lady of the Red Lantern?

550
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,298
I thought you were allied with them

551
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,644
I'm sorry!

552
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:24,019
We must punish the Chinese rebels
to maintain our interests in China

553
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,729
This may also be a warning
to the Chinese government

554
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,908
Moreover the Manchurian government

555
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:33,506
uses such local organizations

556
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,667
as a protest against us to frighten us

557
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,688
By punishing these people

558
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,298
we can prevent any further disturbances

559
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:40,905
But this is China

560
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:46,738
punishing these people will cost us our heads.

561
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:51,480
The armies of the 8 nations
made a pact in Tientsin

562
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:53,795
everything is set for a war
against the Manchurians

563
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:00,266
Then let us execute the China man tonight

564
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:04,845
Then tomorrow,
display his corpse in the street as an example

565
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,597
Yes, General

566
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:15,629
You won't get the chance to compete
with Wong Fei Hung

567
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,697
Because they will execute him tonight

568
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:22,827
Aim...

569
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,628
Fire!

570
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:27,533
Kill him!

571
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,090
There's the prisoner

572
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:40,795
Thank you

573
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:47,570
On your feet!

574
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,601
Are you Wong Fei Hung?

575
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,344
I am Father Thomas

576
00:32:57,731 --> 00:32:59,677
I am sorry to have to bring you some bad news

577
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:03,956
You will be executed by the Germans
in an hour's time

578
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:04,623
Wong Fei Hung

579
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,031
Executed?

580
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:09,700
You devil,
you will be punished by Heaven

581
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:11,215
My child...

582
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,043
There is only one God who can save you

583
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:24,682
It's the God, who gave me this holy clothing

584
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,438
So they won't suspect me

585
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:43,502
Father, you should leave now

586
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:50,368
Open the door

587
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,824
Get up

588
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:56,818
Father, stay back

589
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:04,840
Catch him

590
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:50,686
Catch!

591
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,873
My child.. Wait

592
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,367
I want you to help me

593
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:00,734
You must knock me unconscious too

594
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:01,952
Sorry to have to hurt you

595
00:35:01,993 --> 00:35:02,495
Let me do it

596
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:07,293
Why did you punch so heavily?

597
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,442
Not to make them suspect him

598
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:11,793
Don't hit him anymore

599
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:12,430
It's enough already

600
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,435
Go!

601
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:15,254
Hurry up

602
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,222
Thank you for reporting

603
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:20,147
Your Excellency, please

604
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:22,663
Your Excellency

605
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:23,879
Master Wong, please get up

606
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:29,563
What?

607
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,196
Wong Fei Hung is missing?

608
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,031
Yes, Your Excellency,

609
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,604
we saw the parade of the Red Lanterns

610
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:38,132
Then I was separated from my brother,
he hasn't come back yet

611
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:40,976
The capital is in such a mess

612
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,838
The foreigners are going against the boxers

613
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:45,628
It's not wise to get any side angry

614
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,678
On one hand,
the foreigners want us to protect them,

615
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:48,767
on the other hand,

616
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,396
The Empress Dowager wants us
to overlook the matter

617
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,766
Ah Fu

618
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:52,481
What?

619
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:54,952
Do you think Master is doing this
to draw you out of hiding?

620
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,273
Master knows I am clever,

621
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,487
so he's using this method

622
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:58,416
to force me out

623
00:35:58,611 --> 00:35:59,655
This method is quite new

624
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,022
No, brother Fu, Master needn't use
so many people to look for you

625
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:04,613
Just Club Foot and I were enough

626
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,433
You can shut up!

627
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:08,150
If you hadn't let Aunt May know,

628
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,429
how would Master have suspected me
of staying in the capital?

629
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,270
Fu, behave yourself

630
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,210
Don't worry too much

631
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,950
I will try my best to find Fei Hung for you

632
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:22,914
Thank you, Your Excellency

633
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:23,897
Your Excellency,

634
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:28,623
Fei Hung might be in the hands
of the Red Lanterns

635
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,985
Ho Lan

636
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:32,924
Your Excellency

637
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:35,596
Get some information on the Red Lanterns

638
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:36,282
Yes!

639
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,454
Are there many ladies from the Red Lanterns

640
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:39,512
Maybe

641
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:43,292
I think, Wong Fei Hung
may have been caught by the German Army

642
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,473
I have to check it out myself

643
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,349
Your Excellency, let me go with you

644
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:55,476
On this matter, it's better for the officials
to discuss among themselves

645
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,645
Please don't worry

646
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:02,237
My office carries some weight in the capital

647
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:04,929
It's bad luck staying with you two

648
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:07,419
One is as dumb as a stone

649
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:08,884
The other betrays me

650
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,603
Don't you think the street is
quieter than usual

651
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,834
You are just more aware

652
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:16,633
Really?

653
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:20,111
What's happened?

654
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:22,988
Have we come to the wrong place,
it's all red

655
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:34,485
The Red Lanterns shine,

656
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:35,397
here come the ladies

657
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:36,785
My dear fellows,
kneel down for worshipping

658
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,872
They're the Red Lantern ladies,
what beauties

659
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:44,553
I am going to kneel, kneel

660
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,132
Brother Fu, are you insane?

661
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:48,949
Not that simple! Should we kneel down too?

662
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:50,808
I failed in courting Aunt Yee

663
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,523
Now, I've got so many choices!

664
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:54,203
You'd better let me choose first

665
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:56,268
I'm Leung Fu,

666
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,263
I'm strong and considerate

667
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:00,911
and I know how to make a lady happy
if you get my meaning

668
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,700
How dare you!
I want to know where Wong Fei Hung is

669
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:06,956
Haven't you caught Wong Fei Hung?

670
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:11,132
How can this guy claim to be
the greatest Kung-fu master?

671
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,714
He conspired with the foreigners
and locked our senior up

672
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:15,918
Fei Hung is not that kind of person

673
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,619
Don't you dare accuse him!

674
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,526
Do you think I'll believe what you say?

675
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,498
Don't you want me to believe he's not involved
because he's in hiding?

676
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,641
Follow me to our main hall

677
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,231
Let's see how long will stay hidden

678
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,566
Lady, don't be so stubborn

679
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,086
We don't know what happened either

680
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,274
How dare you!

681
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,597
It's you who refuses to listen to the truth

682
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,944
Burn the house

683
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:37,967
Burn the house?

684
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:39,590
Be careful of the lanterns

685
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:40,884
They won't have a chance to use them!

686
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,159
Let's get the leader first

687
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:48,481
I don't think so

688
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,711
Watch out!

689
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:51,896
My feet!

690
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,127
Escape from him

691
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:15,914
The Red Lantern Shines

692
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:19,774
Brother Fu,

693
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:20,349
let me handle this

694
00:39:20,871 --> 00:39:21,950
She is too tall for you

695
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:23,235
Go and fetch a shorter one next time

696
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,351
No need to make it look good,
they can't see us

697
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:29,630
You act like you mean it!

698
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,798
Lady, why do you always attack my feet?

699
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:36,793
Burn your crude mouth!

700
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,064
Like that is it?

701
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,962
Let's see how you like it

702
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,393
Are you excited?

703
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,825
But you're trying not to show it!

704
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:48,812
Come on...

705
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:54,930
Is this dirty stance taught
by Wong Fei Hung?

706
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:56,041
Wong Fei Hung is not as smart as me

707
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:57,000
Some more

708
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,103
Red ropes

709
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,034
Let me catch them

710
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:10,886
It hurts!

711
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:18,653
Amazing Lantern

712
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:19,210
Catch it

713
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,289
Master, let me help you

714
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:31,673
Blow the powder off!

715
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:36,349
Why are you lying down?

716
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:39,381
That was a stupid idea

717
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:40,468
Come on

718
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:47,760
What...

719
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:54,731
So many people

720
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:55,800
Yan!

721
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:57,358
Master!

722
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:58,359
Club Foot!

723
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:00,424
Club Foot is missing too

724
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:04,297
Master, only you can save me

725
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:23,721
Your Excellency

726
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:24,722
What can I do for you?

727
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:29,269
I'd like to see Ambassador Henlintak
concerning Wong Fei Hung

728
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:34,072
Your Excellency,
I've never heard of Wong Fei Hung

729
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,867
In the German Territory,

730
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,720
no one is allowed to interfere
with our judiciary system

731
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,830
You imprisoned him without reason

732
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:42,518
It's my duty to protect him

733
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:44,819
Don't you know the leasing terms?

734
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:46,385
It's an agreement between China and Germany

735
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:47,954
Change it if you want to

736
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:52,101
Otherwise, settle it with another war

737
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:53,209
Damn it!

738
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:20,931
What barbarians!

739
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:23,441
Now, even you should follow our judiciary system

740
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,825
I don't think war between us
can be avoided anymore

741
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:30,075
Indeed, the war will start tomorrow

742
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:31,129
Our lions are well prepared

743
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,633
to fight with your dragons in the Square!

744
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:34,867
You will find out whose system is the best

745
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:38,192
Fine,

746
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:41,168
I will come for the race!

747
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:43,091
You will be the losers, for sure

748
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:45,843
Your Excellency,

749
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:46,827
What about Wong Fei Hung?

750
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:49,733
I don't think they'll dare harm him

751
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:51,018
Let's go back

752
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:01,640
What the hell happened?

753
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,290
Holy Light shines

754
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:08,070
It must be a trial of the Cantonese Association!

755
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:10,399
Why would we be on trial?

756
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,847
The main hall of the Red Lanterns!

757
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:16,669
Isn't this your main hall?

758
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:17,535
Yes

759
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,333
We are divided into
Red Lanterns, Blue Lanterns and Green Lanterns

760
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,783
This is our head quarters

761
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:24,019
And this is where we
execute the foreigners too

762
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,233
I won't care what it is,
I have to go in

763
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:31,764
Wong Fei Hung

764
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,704
Return my country and my power

765
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:40,623
I fear no fire or knives

766
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,657
The Heaven's troops come
to expel the foreigners

767
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:46,122
We will sacrifice our lives
for our beloved country!

768
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:47,369
Lady Miu San is taking

769
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,353
Wong Fei Hung to greet our Holy Mother

770
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,340
I am Wong Fei Hung,

771
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,909
I come to look for my family and students

772
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:55,460
If you know where they are, please let me know

773
00:43:57,006 --> 00:43:59,302
Burn the incense for our Holy Mother

774
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,806
Lady Miu San is leading

775
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:03,136
Wong Fei Hung to greet the Holy Mother

776
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:05,864
To enter our main hall,

777
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:07,206
you must go through the

778
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,189
Green Lantern Position first

779
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:09,379
You will pass the 1st test

780
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:11,073
only if your feet don't touch the ground

781
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:12,389
Please!

782
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:14,398
All right, thank you

783
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:43,881
Go down

784
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:54,678
I've kicked them all over

785
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:55,291
Can you still stand?

786
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:05,343
Return to normal position

787
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:15,461
Thank you

788
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:25,232
Blue Lantern Position, please try

789
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:27,355
How do I pass it?

790
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:29,211
This is the Whirl Position
designed by the Blue Lanterns

791
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,801
Cross this big revolving lantern

792
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:32,147
But you can't tear any of the paper

793
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:33,974
If you can go through it safely,
then you've passed

794
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:35,498
Thank you

795
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:36,398
Watch out

796
00:45:58,444 --> 00:45:58,857
Take it

797
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:15,551
Ether powder?!

798
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:51,431
Lady Miu, why are you here to fight with me?

799
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,001
If you want to go out, fight with me

800
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:03,261
Senior

801
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:06,241
Give me the sword

802
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:11,930
Lady Miu

803
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:14,552
We work for our own master, go now

804
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:15,791
Thank you

805
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:19,037
Senior

806
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:20,818
I am fine, don't worry

807
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:26,525
Fei Hung

808
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,509
Master

809
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:30,318
Dad, Club Foot,
are you all right?

810
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:31,633
We are fine

811
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:32,695
Master, save us

812
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:34,161
Fu

813
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:34,960
Haven't you gone back to Fu-Shan?

814
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:36,916
You're so mean

815
00:47:37,494 --> 00:47:38,921
The candles are red

816
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:39,984
The heroes come from the

817
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,881
local organizations

818
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:42,128
Flying phoenix

819
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:43,177
from the poles

820
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:44,974
The dragon is kept in the cabin

821
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:51,656
The Holy Mother is right here

822
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,707
Poor fellows,
kneel down to worship the Holy Mother

823
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:55,686
Are you Goddess Lotus?

824
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:57,674
My family has not offended you.

825
00:47:57,706 --> 00:47:58,404
Why did you kidnap them?

826
00:47:59,081 --> 00:47:59,909
Please let them go

827
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:03,580
Stepping on the Heaven's ladder

828
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:12,379
Master, what kind of Kung-fu is it?
She can fly!

829
00:48:13,122 --> 00:48:13,981
It's just some tricks!

830
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:16,635
Our country is in trouble,
everyone is responsible for her safety

831
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:19,568
You should carry the duty
to expel the foreign devils

832
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:22,778
I think you should join us and be the boxers

833
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,776
Join the boxers?

834
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:32,566
I've no relationship with any God or ghosts.
I think, you'd better seek help from others

835
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:33,971
Wong Fei Hung,

836
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:35,315
why are you so stubborn?

837
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,053
I have to punish you on behalf of our God

838
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:39,470
The paper troops,

839
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:40,238
listen to my order

840
00:48:40,307 --> 00:48:40,789
Juggle

841
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,710
Do you think such tricks can save our country?

842
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:07,213
Do you want me to set them free? It's simple

843
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,950
If you can pass through my
holy tower and holy bridge.

844
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:09,823
I will let your men go

845
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:11,351
If not...
You must follow me

846
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:13,611
Well,

847
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:14,206
I have to offend you then

848
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:27,279
Walk on the holy ladder

849
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:30,748
Catch!

850
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:34,101
Take it back

851
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:40,578
Ah, it's just wires

852
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:42,301
Ok, let me come up and play with you

853
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:49,481
Right ladies, let's test your balancing skills

854
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:12,040
Now, only the Holy Mother is left

855
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,344
You will be my student!

856
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:23,397
Double Dragon's stance

857
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,334
Master's feet are tied

858
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:30,508
Go down

859
00:50:31,253 --> 00:50:31,697
Not that easy

860
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:36,389
Come here

861
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:37,827
All right!

862
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:45,705
Cut!

863
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:07,167
Take it back

864
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:17,037
Come up

865
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:19,585
Cross the bridge

866
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:23,119
Your bridge is ruined,

867
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:24,202
why don't you release us now?

868
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:24,978
Retreat!

869
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:30,404
Master, my money was on you!

870
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:31,925
No... I mean.

871
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:32,914
I was sure you'd defeat them

872
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:33,969
Burn the bridge

873
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:41,412
Fei Hung

874
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:42,461
How are you?

875
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:43,112
I am fine

876
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,699
Fei Hung,

877
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,112
I was worried about you

878
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:50,467
It's a mess, a mess

879
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:52,727
If Aunt Yee sees Master holding Aunt May,

880
00:51:52,802 --> 00:51:54,292
there'll be trouble

881
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:58,312
Fei Hung, it's fine, let's write to Aunt Yee
to tell her we're safe

882
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,349
Aunt Yee is enough, how can he court Aunt May?

883
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:03,305
Aunt Ching will come
next month... Oh my God!

884
00:52:04,113 --> 00:52:05,006
What is it?
Who's there?

885
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:06,527
I want to comfort that lady

886
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:08,027
But you don't know her

887
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:10,165
So how can you comfort her?

888
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,407
If I don't comfort her,
how can I get to know her?

889
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:21,635
They are back! Come out!

890
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:22,946
Master, master

891
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:23,938
Are you all right?

892
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,747
I am fine

893
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:30,508
Of course, they can't
compete with master at all

894
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:33,675
How are you, sir!

895
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:34,925
I'm glad you're back

896
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:36,780
Old Master Wong, Master Wong

897
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:39,098
We were thinking of ways to save you all night

898
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:42,005
Then we discovered
the Red Lantern Sect had visited

899
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:44,204
We've just sent someone to rescue you,
but you are back now

900
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:45,708
Sorry for worrying you

901
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:46,757
Time

902
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,665
Shit, it's started

903
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:50,211
Master Wong

904
00:52:50,788 --> 00:52:51,435
Your Excellency

905
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,853
General Guan has instructed us
that if we see you

906
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,306
we should ask you to go
to Tun Chau Square at once

907
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:57,764
The Dragons and the Lions are fighting now

908
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:00,967
What?
The Lion King Competition is being held today?

909
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:04,055
Right, The Lion King Competition organized by
the 8 countries is being held today

910
00:53:04,091 --> 00:53:05,614
Right, Master, it's today

911
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,244
Why are you so excited?

912
00:53:08,006 --> 00:53:08,869
I thought you'd forgot

913
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:09,670
Think again!

914
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:10,727
Your Excellency,

915
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:11,339
please show me they way

916
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,878
Fine

917
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:15,388
Fei Hung

918
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:16,259
Aunt May

919
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:18,255
Brother-in-law,
let me go with you

920
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:21,094
If anything happened,
how could I explain it to your sister?

921
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,775
Club Foot, follow me

922
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:25,432
Yes Master!

923
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:27,412
Ah Fu

924
00:53:29,424 --> 00:53:30,398
Why are you standing there?

925
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:30,930
Come on now!

926
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,417
So childish

927
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:47,343
Childish

928
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:49,666
Bastard! What a copy cat

929
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:11,168
Our nine golden dragons

930
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:12,862
must stay alert

931
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,859
Under the bait,

932
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:17,486
there are machine guns

933
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:40,227
Nine Dragons set out

934
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:55,375
They are blocking our way,

935
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:56,554
we've to find a way out

936
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,650
Dragons in the sky

937
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,615
Dragons in the sky...

938
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:15,533
Dragons in the sky

939
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,147
The Yellow and the

940
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:22,137
Red Dragon are destroyed

941
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,353
There are many enemies,

942
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,533
you'd better be more careful

943
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:25,231
Got you!

944
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:27,204
Halt!

945
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,448
We are the competitors

946
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:30,974
The competition had started,

947
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:31,464
leave now

948
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:34,480
What did he say?

949
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,244
He said the competition has started

950
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:37,021
We are not allowed to go in

951
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:38,464
How come!

952
00:55:41,117 --> 00:55:42,899
Master, let me talk to him

953
00:55:42,936 --> 00:55:44,002
Consider it carefully Fei Hung

954
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:44,966
Fu, Club Foot, let's go

955
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:45,835
Forget about them,

956
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:46,251
let's rush in

957
00:55:46,286 --> 00:55:46,915
Fine

958
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,674
Don't let them leave

959
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:05,042
They have gone that way

960
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:09,217
Don't let them get away

961
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:21,757
Ride on it's back

962
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:28,766
Be careful of it changing position

963
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:39,508
Catch the dragon head

964
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,603
Let me ride that horse

965
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,865
The dragon of the Blue Clan is in trouble

966
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,308
Take the wounded away

967
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:14,905
Yes Sir!

968
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:16,628
The great eagle is coming

969
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:24,929
White dragon, watch out!

970
00:58:38,013 --> 00:58:38,989
Yellow dragon, be careful!

971
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:45,594
Sir, the red dragon is trapped

972
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:56,515
Close the gate, hurry up

973
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,675
Prepare to fire weapons,
close the gate now

974
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,625
Close the gate

975
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:05,701
Fei Hung, they are trying to close the gate

976
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:06,815
They won't!

977
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,570
Hurry up, they are chasing us

978
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:15,843
Don't be afraid, I am here

979
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,328
Club Foot, you have no horse,
you can't catch up with us

980
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,323
Open it, quick

981
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:28,158
Yes!

982
00:59:29,086 --> 00:59:29,848
Let's see who's faster

983
00:59:35,441 --> 00:59:37,123
Damn you Clubfoot, how dare you
step on my shoulders?

984
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,368
They are shooting...
Get down!

985
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,091
Fei Hung, we've made it

986
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:48,717
Watch out, it's coming

987
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:57,181
Just our dragon is left

988
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:02,921
His Excellency is in the middle

989
01:00:07,966 --> 01:00:09,397
It's oil, let's escape

990
01:00:41,483 --> 01:00:41,930
Hurry up

991
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:51,273
Sir

992
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:56,059
Fei Hung
- Sir

993
01:00:58,198 --> 01:00:58,861
Wong Fei Hung

994
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:04,184
You must take revenge... for me

995
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:10,534
Your Excellency...

996
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:13,792
We were too late

997
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:14,871
What a pity

998
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:17,039
Your Excellency...

999
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:20,173
Your Excellency!

1000
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:40,149
The officers from Tai Lei Temple
send their condolences

1001
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,313
The Officers from Shun Tin Office
send their condolences

1002
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:54,824
Sirs, thank you for your condolences

1003
01:01:55,465 --> 01:02:00,818
His Excellency Li Hung Chang
sends his condolences

1004
01:02:09,883 --> 01:02:14,183
His Excellency send his condolences

1005
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,739
Wong Fei Hung sends his condolences

1006
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:19,051
A blood letter from Wong Fei Hung

1007
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:31,108
I am the Lion King of Ching Dynasty

1008
01:05:31,782 --> 01:05:38,182
I was too late to participate
in the competition last time

1009
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:42,245
Now I am challenging
the lion kings of the 8 countries

1010
01:05:43,267 --> 01:05:45,084
If you accept the challenge,

1011
01:05:45,563 --> 01:05:48,008
I'll meet you in two days time
in the same square

1012
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:51,038
Let destiny determine who will win or lose

1013
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:52,898
Wong Fei Hung

1014
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,023
Does Wong Fei Hung want to take
revenge for Guan Shing-tao?

1015
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:03,860
Fine, tell him that I will give him a chance...

1016
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:05,395
To meet an even worse fate!

1017
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:33,788
Brother Fu, how do I look?

1018
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:36,059
Fine, just look at Clubfoot

1019
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,067
so lady like

1020
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:40,077
To be honest, I don't think so

1021
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,891
But I am afraid we'll be discovered by others

1022
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:42,944
Don't worry!

1023
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,117
If we are discovered,

1024
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:44,954
I'll handle it. Let's go

1025
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:52,923
Sister Fu, what does your lady look like?

1026
01:06:53,123 --> 01:06:54,843
She is like me, so lovely

1027
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,070
We're so well matched!

1028
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,802
Sister Yan, don't run off

1029
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:15,320
It doesn't matter,
we will go for our own targets later

1030
01:07:15,516 --> 01:07:16,310
What for?

1031
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,248
To look for our own ladies

1032
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:19,046
That's big trouble

1033
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:20,365
This seems to be the road

1034
01:07:20,398 --> 01:07:21,287
leading to the rented territory

1035
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:24,546
Who cares if it is or not?
Let's concentrate on the ladies!

1036
01:07:24,576 --> 01:07:25,272
Let's go

1037
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:29,040
Master Chiu, why are you looking for me?

1038
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,582
I have heard that you are going to challenge
the lions of the 8 countries

1039
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:35,922
Our ancestors have left us something
to combat the "Powerful Fists"

1040
01:07:37,081 --> 01:07:39,049
I asked the smith to repair it overnight

1041
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,893
I don't know whether it's useful to you or not

1042
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,736
The copper lion

1043
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:47,436
Yes

1044
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:51,267
It's made from 90 catties of copper

1045
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:57,840
Look at the craftsmanship in this lion head

1046
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,197
It is a work of art

1047
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:05,616
But our students can hardly handle it

1048
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,656
If it is useful to you in the competition,

1049
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:12,223
Please take this as a present from our school

1050
01:08:12,393 --> 01:08:12,893
Master Chiu

1051
01:08:14,976 --> 01:08:15,421
Please rise

1052
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:20,712
Fei Hung, this lion head is much heavier
than normal lion heads

1053
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:23,772
It's not easy to handle

1054
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,532
Yes, but there are merits too

1055
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,802
The lions of the 8 countries
are strong and powerful

1056
01:08:30,095 --> 01:08:33,626
It's useless to rely on our Kung fu against them

1057
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:35,797
We should destroy them by tactics

1058
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:37,012
I agree with you

1059
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:39,684
I would like to accompany you Master Wong

1060
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:40,685
Master Chiu

1061
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:44,995
Father...

1062
01:08:46,051 --> 01:08:47,505
Father

1063
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:48,240
The Red Lanterns are here

1064
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,448
Red Lanterns?

1065
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:10,023
Listen, keep calm, keep calm

1066
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:14,227
It is not safe here, we'd better leave

1067
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:17,503
Where are you going?

1068
01:09:17,538 --> 01:09:17,944
You devils!

1069
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,754
Sister, let's chase the devils separately

1070
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:21,111
The rest of you...

1071
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:22,004
Burn the church. Go

1072
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,057
Go, chase after the devils

1073
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:23,754
Yes!

1074
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:26,498
It's on fire

1075
01:09:27,846 --> 01:09:28,825
What? On fire?

1076
01:09:29,482 --> 01:09:30,308
Where is on fire?

1077
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:32,793
It should be the East Alley

1078
01:09:33,117 --> 01:09:35,151
The church of Father Thomas is over there

1079
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:37,101
I have to take a look

1080
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:44,711
Fu

1081
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:46,148
What's the matter?

1082
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,003
The Red Lantern ladies are burning and killing,
what'll we do?

1083
01:09:48,357 --> 01:09:49,181
Don't disclose our identities

1084
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,174
Leave at once

1085
01:09:50,209 --> 01:09:50,619
Freeze

1086
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:54,177
I know you are men posing as women

1087
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:57,292
So, you've seen through our disguise

1088
01:09:57,621 --> 01:09:59,240
Ladies, castrate them

1089
01:10:00,202 --> 01:10:01,029
We are in danger!

1090
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:01,921
Let's run for our lives!

1091
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:06,125
Where are you going?

1092
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,662
Club Foot, let's go separately

1093
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:08,933
So, whom should I go with?

1094
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:32,125
Kill them right here

1095
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:41,562
Wong Fei Hung?!

1096
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,714
Go

1097
01:10:45,392 --> 01:10:46,053
Why don't you go now?

1098
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:46,919
Go now

1099
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,540
Oh... He asked us to go

1100
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:51,056
This way is safe

1101
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:51,673
This way

1102
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,290
May, you'd better stop searching
for Fei Hung with us

1103
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:59,789
Well, I will wait for you right here

1104
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:02,099
Master Chiu, let's search for
Fei Hung separately

1105
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:02,547
Fine

1106
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,816
Go over there

1107
01:11:16,145 --> 01:11:17,382
Sister, the foreigners are over there

1108
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,713
Let's attack them from both sides

1109
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,898
OK, follow me

1110
01:11:20,098 --> 01:11:20,545
Yes!

1111
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:25,380
Father Thomas, are you all right?

1112
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:26,570
Heaven have mercy

1113
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,669
My child, the Red Lanterns are after us,
run for your life!

1114
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:29,364
Go that way

1115
01:11:37,536 --> 01:11:38,005
It's you?!

1116
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:39,665
Yes, it's me

1117
01:11:40,598 --> 01:11:41,674
What bad luck!

1118
01:11:42,476 --> 01:11:44,925
Father, you are here!

1119
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:46,643
It's you

1120
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:50,572
Go over there.

1121
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,532
Let me fight with them

1122
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:53,634
Go!

1123
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:54,684
Yes, Senior

1124
01:11:55,933 --> 01:11:59,397
Ladies, no massacre please,
they're innocent!

1125
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:00,840
If you want to kill, kill me first

1126
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:02,431
Get lost,

1127
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:03,292
you have no say here

1128
01:12:05,816 --> 01:12:07,174
Catch them and kill them right here

1129
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:07,916
Yes

1130
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:08,449
Let's run for our lives

1131
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:09,377
I'll kill the woman,

1132
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:10,048
you take the foreigners!

1133
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:11,742
Sister, stop!

1134
01:12:13,977 --> 01:12:14,456
Father

1135
01:12:16,464 --> 01:12:16,911
You!

1136
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:20,916
Kill the devils!

1137
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:22,669
Sister

1138
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,558
He saved me once

1139
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:32,537
You liar!

1140
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:33,685
You are the betrayer!

1141
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,521
When Wong Fei Hung came to our hall,

1142
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,571
I started to suspect you

1143
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,453
Now, I'm proved right!

1144
01:12:39,845 --> 01:12:41,498
You are not qualified to hold
this Anti-foreigner's Flag

1145
01:12:44,499 --> 01:12:44,912
Shoot!

1146
01:12:58,493 --> 01:12:59,384
Senior!

1147
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:02,573
She deserved it,

1148
01:13:02,609 --> 01:13:03,433
God will punish her

1149
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:07,037
Miss

1150
01:13:09,016 --> 01:13:09,496
Let's go

1151
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:13,700
Get lost, forget about me

1152
01:13:20,077 --> 01:13:22,457
Don't leave me alone!

1153
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,057
I didn't betray you

1154
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:40,219
Die bitch!

1155
01:13:43,606 --> 01:13:44,463
Let's see your magic now!

1156
01:13:49,952 --> 01:13:50,745
Miss

1157
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:52,689
Stop!

1158
01:13:57,985 --> 01:13:58,648
Help!

1159
01:14:01,653 --> 01:14:02,151
Fei Hung?!

1160
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:04,865
Take her away

1161
01:14:26,214 --> 01:14:27,007
Prepare to fire!

1162
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:35,214
You are hurt, why do you still want to fight?

1163
01:14:36,586 --> 01:14:37,443
Don't go!

1164
01:14:38,436 --> 01:14:39,954
Move her over there

1165
01:14:41,747 --> 01:14:43,367
She's been hurt.

1166
01:14:43,405 --> 01:14:43,935
She must be cold

1167
01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:45,759
Use this to cover her

1168
01:15:12,368 --> 01:15:14,431
It's dark! I can't see anything

1169
01:15:15,872 --> 01:15:16,728
What a fate!

1170
01:15:19,789 --> 01:15:20,582
Where is Wong Fei Hung?

1171
01:15:20,778 --> 01:15:21,723
Fei Hung...

1172
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:22,330
Where is he?

1173
01:15:23,869 --> 01:15:24,564
He is here

1174
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:30,021
You're not him!

1175
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:33,240
I'd never have believed

1176
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,247
I'd die saving the devils!

1177
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:37,004
It's my punishment!

1178
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,174
I may die in peace now

1179
01:15:45,388 --> 01:15:49,020
Wong Fei Hung, at last, you've come

1180
01:16:11,895 --> 01:16:12,840
Brother Fu, let's go

1181
01:16:13,616 --> 01:16:15,269
Brother Fu, the Holy Mother is coming

1182
01:16:18,778 --> 01:16:19,815
Brother Club Foot,
come and save us!

1183
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:20,872
Go to hell

1184
01:16:25,246 --> 01:16:26,058
Stay where you are!

1185
01:16:26,093 --> 01:16:26,870
I want to punish you

1186
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,320
Club Foot, are you all right?

1187
01:16:29,387 --> 01:16:29,868
I'm fine

1188
01:16:31,204 --> 01:16:31,649
Take aim!

1189
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:33,938
The symbol of heresy!

1190
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:49,299
Should we save her?

1191
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:50,597
How?

1192
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:52,098
We are wearing the uniforms

1193
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:53,653
If we go out like this,
we will be shot at

1194
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:04,357
I'm Goddess Lotus,
the spirit resides in me

1195
01:17:04,464 --> 01:17:06,365
I'm invincible!

1196
01:17:06,696 --> 01:17:08,663
How dare you offend me!

1197
01:17:09,053 --> 01:17:11,433
I've to punish you on behalf of God

1198
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:13,509
I'll send you to hell!

1199
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:15,131
To tear your skin off!

1200
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,377
To break your bones!

1201
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:17,742
You bastards!

1202
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:31,571
Let's go

1203
01:17:32,758 --> 01:17:33,420
Master

1204
01:17:33,873 --> 01:17:34,695
The three of you, stay where you are

1205
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:38,074
Club Foot? Ah Fu? Ah Yan?

1206
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:39,729
Why are you dressed like this?

1207
01:17:40,414 --> 01:17:41,334
Are you going to be opera actors?

1208
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:43,252
You had it coming!

1209
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:50,083
Holy Mother...

1210
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:56,455
Don't cry, tears can't help

1211
01:17:57,258 --> 01:17:59,072
Right, Holy Mother hasn't passed away,

1212
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:00,888
she is living in our hearts

1213
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:02,641
Let's take an oath, we should

1214
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:05,468
carry on the mission
of killing the foreigners!

1215
01:18:06,498 --> 01:18:10,255
Kill the foreigners,

1216
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:13,025
save our beloved country!

1217
01:18:56,405 --> 01:18:58,567
This bait could hurt us anytime

1218
01:18:59,589 --> 01:19:00,928
If the opposite side use fire.

1219
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:04,178
Getting the bait is less important
than beating their lions

1220
01:19:05,072 --> 01:19:06,244
Let's attack them remember

1221
01:19:06,759 --> 01:19:07,203
Yes, Master

1222
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:08,917
Music!

1223
01:19:52,104 --> 01:19:53,046
The lions roar!

1224
01:20:12,191 --> 01:20:13,613
Each lion attack a monster

1225
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:14,263
Yes!

1226
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:17,792
"One step to the sky"!

1227
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,200
Stop turning!

1228
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:26,034
We can't turn

1229
01:20:26,485 --> 01:20:28,004
"Magic Turn"!

1230
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:34,132
I want you to "turn round and round"

1231
01:20:39,295 --> 01:20:41,288
Old Master Wong, I can't
identify the flag in the front

1232
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:42,280
It's so messy,
I can't identify either

1233
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:43,388
Forget the flags,
let's recognise their face

1234
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:55,203
Should we beat this one?

1235
01:20:55,244 --> 01:20:55,939
No, not this...

1236
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:05,981
Club Foot, hold this for me

1237
01:21:06,309 --> 01:21:07,608
I feel better having no lion head

1238
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,441
But, how am I going to handle
two lion heads?

1239
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,115
You are abnormal anyway

1240
01:21:13,154 --> 01:21:15,496
The may be scared of you
holding two lion heads!

1241
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:16,932
That's it

1242
01:21:20,824 --> 01:21:21,454
It's our turn!

1243
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:21,942
All right!

1244
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:28,011
"Swinging lion tail"!

1245
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:18,586
Come on...

1246
01:22:18,909 --> 01:22:20,145
Fu, what are you doing?

1247
01:22:20,277 --> 01:22:21,035
You should be careful!

1248
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,029
"Tiger jump"!

1249
01:22:42,278 --> 01:22:43,133
Come on...

1250
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:49,600
Why has it gone dark?

1251
01:23:25,765 --> 01:23:26,460
Where am I?

1252
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:32,814
Who are you?

1253
01:23:32,982 --> 01:23:34,280
Big head Buddha,
don't you recognise me?

1254
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:35,588
Let me show you

1255
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,152
Some more!

1256
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,443
You want to fire?

1257
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:09,486
Not that easy!

1258
01:24:13,657 --> 01:24:14,518
Here comes a cookie!

1259
01:24:23,312 --> 01:24:25,629
This one is even better,
I'll leave it with you

1260
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,526
Let's help old Master

1261
01:24:48,722 --> 01:24:51,489
Attack!

1262
01:25:21,953 --> 01:25:22,843
Master Chiu, watch out!

1263
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:27,136
Catch the lion tail

1264
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:43,554
So you are scared away?

1265
01:26:44,257 --> 01:26:45,113
Brother Fu, look out behind!

1266
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,504
How dare you scare me?!

1267
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:01,696
The sun will soon go down

1268
01:27:01,731 --> 01:27:02,807
behind The Forbidden City

1269
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:04,882
History will be re-written

1270
01:27:05,614 --> 01:27:07,866
We'll see who is going to be the winner

1271
01:27:34,981 --> 01:27:36,089
Throw the burning lion heads up here

1272
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,080
Yes!

1273
01:27:50,337 --> 01:27:51,282
The bait?!

1274
01:28:01,256 --> 01:28:02,047
Ah Yan

1275
01:28:02,626 --> 01:28:03,222
Ah Yan!

1276
01:28:10,932 --> 01:28:11,561
Take cover!

1277
01:28:15,037 --> 01:28:17,546
My ass is shot! Take me out!

1278
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:19,803
Go!

1279
01:28:20,481 --> 01:28:21,779
Club Foot, come over here, be quick!

1280
01:28:28,026 --> 01:28:30,061
Master, let me send you up there

1281
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:38,465
General, leave here quickly

1282
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,440
We won

1283
01:28:51,689 --> 01:28:52,384
General Henlintak

1284
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,163
Good news

1285
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:03,433
Long live Germany!

1286
01:29:03,466 --> 01:29:05,693
Long live America!

1287
01:29:13,303 --> 01:29:13,832
What has happened?

1288
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:15,020
Why are they so cheerful?

1289
01:29:15,532 --> 01:29:17,456
Bull shit, they are celebrating for us

1290
01:29:17,981 --> 01:29:19,051
It's bull shit indeed!
Let's go and take a look

1291
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:30,075
I can't see them, move forward

1292
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:30,953
Move forward

1293
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:31,422
Yes

1294
01:29:43,075 --> 01:29:43,487
Fei Hung

1295
01:29:43,552 --> 01:29:45,184
Sir, why are you dressed like that?

1296
01:29:45,652 --> 01:29:47,778
The allied troops of the 8 foreign countries have
marched into the Forbidden City

1297
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:48,852
The Empress Dowager has surrendered

1298
01:29:52,949 --> 01:29:54,253
Master Wong, let's go

1299
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:56,793
Let's go!

1300
01:30:01,612 --> 01:30:04,763
Although we won this competition,
we lost our country!

1301
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:14,850
Henlintak

1302
01:30:17,452 --> 01:30:20,252
General, go to the celebration now,
let us handle Wong Fei Hung

1303
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:22,825
Wait for me

1304
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:24,292
Fei Hong

1305
01:30:40,218 --> 01:30:41,010
Henlintak!

1306
01:30:45,157 --> 01:30:46,580
Get lost, don't block my way

1307
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,164
Wong Fei Hung

1308
01:31:15,716 --> 01:31:16,195
I am here

1309
01:31:32,694 --> 01:31:33,139

Master,

1347
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:24,518

1348
01:35:25,923 --> 01:35:27,855
We can't change anything
by killing him

1349
01:35:30,967 --> 01:35:31,501
Let's go

1350
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:33,282

Brother

1356
01:35:38,162 --> 01:35:40,548
It's dangerous here, we'd better leave

1357
01:35:41,289 --> 01:35:42,845
Dad, let's go back to the South

1358
01:35:44,251 --> 01:35:45,390
Yes. Our capital is occupied.

1359
01:35:45,428 --> 01:35:47,686
We should go back and prepare to retaliate

1360
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:52,116
OK, let's go back to the South, now

1361
01:35:52,373 --> 01:35:52,838
Get in

1362
01:35:53,584 --> 01:35:55,462

01:35:55,685 --> 01:35:56,989
Lie down then
