1
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:18,400
Where did you go?

2
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:29,954
Excuse me, nurse.

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,580
We're from Interpol.

4
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:34,875
Would you mind if we have
a few moments with the boy?

5
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,591
You know, the man outside
says you're not eating.

6
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:45,010
You should eat to gain strength.

7
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,865
How are you feeling?

8
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:07,992
Feeling. Feel.

9
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:09,493
Feeling.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,745
Bit bumpy out there
on the ocean waves?

11
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:12,913
Bit rough?

12
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,584
Out there?

13
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:25,426
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?

14
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:30,431
Excuse me. We have to take him
for a checkup now.

15
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,266
Yes, yes, yes.

16
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:37,813
Wait.

17
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,325
I think this belongs to you.

18
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,127
Half for me?

19
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:15,517
Nice lad.

20
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:18,229
You okay?

21
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,314
That nurse...

22
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,442
Yeah.

23
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,070
Her boots...

24
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:29,448
No.

25
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:31,492
Her boots.

26
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:33,869
Oh, boots.

27
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:36,038
Nurses don't wear boots.

28
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,506
Watch out!

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,348
- Get out of my way!
- Sorry.

30
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,725
- Get the boy.
- Stop him.

31
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,862
What the heck?

32
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,050
Give me that!

33
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,726
There he goes!

34
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,060
Come here.

35
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,188
- I got him. I got him.
- There he is.

36
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,402
He's mine. I've got him.

37
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:40,746
Let's go.

38
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:52,633
Jai!

39
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,011
- Clear all exits.
- Right, sir.

40
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,358
Watson, are you there?

41
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,654
I'm not here.

42
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,201
What happened?

43
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:21,579
Snakehead's men.
They were here for the boy.

44
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,833
- I'm gonna keep him with me.
- Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.

45
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,837
Watson, you did all this alone?

46
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,380
No, Eddie is...

47
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:36,176
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie
wasn't the only one with a black belt.

48
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,762
So you're all right?

49
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:40,848
Perfect.

50
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:44,727
- Great.
- Okay. I'll see you back at the...

51
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:49,189
Yeah. I'm gonna do a couple of
press-ups and meet you back there.

52
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:51,150
Yes. Yes.

53
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,528
You just take care of the boy.

54
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,626
- Eddie, listen...
- Watson, something wrong.

55
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,879
Snakehead's men got away again,
but at least the boy is safe.

56
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:14,131
I mean, something wrong with me.

57
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:16,759
Hit me.

58
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,053
- What?
- Go on, hit me.

59
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,596
No, I can't do that.

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,389
It's okay, I don't mind.

61
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,974
Well, I mind. I mean...

62
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,101
A chap could break
a finger, you know.

63
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,519
Okay.

64
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:29,730
Use this.

65
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:33,651
- No, thanks. I went before I came out.
- No, hit me with this.

66
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,154
- For real?
- Yes.

67
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:40,991
God.

68
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,916
There you go. All right?

69
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,334
Harder.

70
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,461
I can't do this. This is ridiculous.

71
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,964
- The queen hits harder than that.
- How...

72
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,882
How dare you.

73
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,009
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

74
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:02,930
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?

75
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,640
Of course it hurt.

76
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,475
But nothing.

77
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:08,894
I was shot before...

78
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,688
...but I was okay.

79
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,398
Shoot me.

80
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,607
Go ahead.

81
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,986
No, I think the embalming fluid
has gone to your head.

82
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:19,196
- This is ridiculous.
- Give me the gun.

83
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,365
- Absolutely not.
- I'll show you.

84
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:25,494
You know how many forms I have to
fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.

85
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,414
- This is how accidents happen.
- Look.

86
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,173
Amazing.

87
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,305
No blood.

88
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,891
Amazing.

89
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,311
Incredible.

90
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,646
- See?
- I mean, still...

91
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,985
That's incredible. I mean, just...

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,288
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.

93
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,498
That was below the belt. I'm sorry.

94
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,335
That's what I mean.

95
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,927
Can one of you explain
this latest failure?

96
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:26,055
Why you couldn't
retrieve one small boy?

97
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,181
Sir...

98
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,516
...this might sound crazy...

99
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:33,646
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.

100
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,980
What Chinese cop?

101
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,441
That's Eddie Yang.

102
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,945
He's supposed to have died yesterday,
drowned in that container.

103
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,114
Then it's true.

104
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:49,787
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

105
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,789
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

106
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:53,415
Thank you for being here.

107
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,210
We've come across something
very interesting.

108
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,546
Have you ever seen this before?

109
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,423
- Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
- I've seen that before.

110
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,718
- The fish is the sign of life.
- That's interesting.

111
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,054
- And the snake is the sign of...
- Whoa.

112
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,014
The medallion.

113
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,516
You're gonna love this.

114
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,852
Now, it should have a serpent
on one side.

115
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,398
And a fish on the other.

116
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:23,070
If what you have is real, that is
the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.

117
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,656
And maybe the secret to eternal life.

118
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,491
Sweet!

119
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:34,248
- Where'd you get the medallion?
- I recognize the fish.

120
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,584
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
- Yes.

121
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,711
The legend says
every thousand years...

122
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,797
...a child is chosen that can bind the
halves together...

123
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:45,885
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...

124
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,137
...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.

125
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,055
- So where's the other half?
- Wait!

126
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,350
The ancient texts say that if you want
superhuman strength...

127
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,103
...and immortality,
you need both halves.

128
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,398
The only documented case
of a genuine resurrection...

129
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,109
You can't weigh it,
measure it, smoke it.

130
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:05,279
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.

131
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,073
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.

132
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,909
- Cheerio, for now.
- Good luck.

133
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,248
Why would a young boy
have something like this?

134
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,502
This Snakehead chap, is he
after the medallion or the boy?

135
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,922
By the way,
take good care of that kid.

136
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:27,343
The medallion can not only give life,
it can take it away.

137
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,851
Okay, I'll cover the front door,
call in for backup.

138
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:39,021
You go to the rear to Nicole's
apartment as fast as you can.

139
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,522
Got it.

140
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,068
Sorry.

141
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,515
You know, for a little person,
you sure do eat a lot.

142
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,226
Still going?

143
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,019
What did you have?

144
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,484
Okay.

145
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,279
Here we go.

146
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,822
Try that.

147
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:32,533
That good?

148
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:36,704
You don't like... You're not...

149
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,378
One of my culinary skills...

150
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:47,006
...other than peeling fruit, of course...

151
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,593
...just so happens to be a toasted...

152
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:54,597
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...

153
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,935
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

154
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,690
Then again, he didn't really
have any choice.

155
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,611
- Why?
- Because I can't cook anything else.

156
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,624
I just can't believe
that he's really gone.

157
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,718
He's not gone.

158
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,111
Jai...

159
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,115
...do you not understand that Eddie's
not coming back?

160
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,784
I pulled him back.

161
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:01,622
Okay...

162
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,503
Jai, Eddie's...

163
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,671
He...

164
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,721
Just hold on.

165
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,106
See?

166
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:32,611
Oh, my God.

167
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,280
Eddie?

168
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,972
Eddie.

169
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,059
Jai!

170
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,077
No!

171
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:23,454
Eddie!

172
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,020
You see? I told you he wasn't dead.

173
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,427
The boy, sir.

174
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,595
Yes.

175
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,738
Welcome...

176
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,782
...my old friend.

177
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,708
So...

178
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,335
...a quick, painless death...

179
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,088
...followed by resurrection...

180
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,549
...immortality...

181
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,094
...and powers beyond your dreams.

182
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:03,804
Are you sure?

183
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,602
His order is ruled
by reverence for life.

184
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,314
My death before him
must be reversed.

185
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,317
And if it isn't...

186
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:17,526
...kill him.

187
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,113
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?

188
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,860
Pitiful mortal.

189
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,489
So...

190
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,326
...I have no further use
for you, Chosen One.

191
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,036
You're not immortal.

192
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,663
What?

193
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,375
To become immortal, you need
both halves of the medallion.

194
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,876
Where's the other half?

195
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,004
Tell me!

196
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,260
- Nicole.
- Eddie.

197
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:27,304
It's me. I'm fine, really.

198
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:28,806
I just...

199
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:32,601
I still don't understand, Eddie,
because I was there...

200
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:36,021
...and I saw you, and...
- Nicole, it's me.

201
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,942
You see, it's just that I was at the
container and you were dead.

202
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,652
I mean, you were dead.

203
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,197
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion
to give life.

204
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,866
That's why Snakehead took him.

205
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,452
With the boy and the medallion,
he could...

206
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,580
He could become like you?

207
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,583
Yes, but he needs
the whole medallion...

208
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,918
...and he only has half.

209
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,255
Look...

210
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,883
...this is a touching reunion.

211
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:06,510
We're all glad that Eddie's
amongst the living...

212
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:09,346
...but we still haven't found
Snakehead's helicopter.

213
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:12,683
Get online. Find anything
that was in the air in the last hour.

214
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,936
I don't care if it was a bird, a plane
or bloody Superman.

215
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,980
No offense, old chap.

216
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,066
Eddie.

217
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,612
If he needs the other half, he's
gonna come looking for you.

218
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,783
If he is looking for me...

219
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,703
...he'll be looking for my partner.

220
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:36,373
Me?

221
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,461
My family.

222
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:42,296
My family.

223
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:50,888
Cool.

224
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:54,892
See, that's not normal. I mean,
that's not natural. What...?

225
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,769
Eddie, take my bike!

226
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,226
Thank God.

227
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,602
They're all right.

228
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,481
Charlotte?

229
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,234
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.

230
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,902
Yes, dear?

231
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,362
Eddie...

232
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,032
Watson! They're here!

233
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,413
Go!

234
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:03,752
Go!

235
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:08,757
Charlotte, where are you going?

236
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,971
This is no time for cleaning.

237
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,726
Take your shield!

238
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,897
Watson!

239
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:31,572
- Are you all right, love?
- Yes, I'm fine, dear.

240
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,366
Catch!

241
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:36,535
Here. I'll lead them away.

242
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,495
Your wife?

243
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,250
What the...?

244
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,256
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That's a good boy.

245
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:53,552
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous
things, all right? Right.

246
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,102
How dare you shoot...

247
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:04,355
...at my...

248
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:06,232
...wife!

249
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:21,455
My Lord.

250
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:35,803
Where'd he go?

251
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,517
We meet again...

252
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:42,768
...Eddie Yang.

253
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,778
Where's the boy?

254
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,823
My guest is no concern of yours.

255
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,368
All that matters is that you have the
other half of the medallion.

256
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,126
Don't run, Eddie!

257
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,378
You can't hide from me!

258
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:20,306
The medallion is mine!

259
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:28,522
You think it's a game?

260
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,190
Well, let's play!

261
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:52,713
We're the same, you and I.

262
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,059
What a pity. What a waste.

263
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,228
You don't know
what powers you have.

264
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,839
Destiny calls.

265
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,512
He's sleeping. At least, I think that's
what he's doing.

266
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,974
He doesn't even look like he's
breathing.

267
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:46,308
The boy!

268
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,686
Oh, God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

269
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:50,437
Eddie, you're all right.

270
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,565
The boy's in danger.

271
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,026
He's going to kill him. Right?!

272
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:58,487
Snakehead has taken the boy
to Raven's Keep.

273
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,197
I told you everything I know.

274
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,407
I did.

275
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:03,284
We need to move fast.

276
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:07,162
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.

277
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,665
You take the bike.
I'll guide you from the air.

278
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,125
I'm driving.

279
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,624
That's Raven's Keep.

280
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,126
It's five miles away.

281
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,840
You should wash your hands.

282
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,094
Come on.

283
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:06,365
Nicole.

284
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,325
Be careful.

285
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:09,869
You too.

286
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:40,900
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where's the boy?

287
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,694
- Let's get out of here!
- Move!

288
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,029
You cowards!

289
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,841
Watson. Watson!

290
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,260
Are you crazy?

291
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:52,012
Be careful.

292
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,640
Interpol. Freeze.

293
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,860
Jai, are you all right?

294
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,575
There she is! Get her!

295
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,343
Excuse me.

296
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,599
You looking for something?

297
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,722
Interpol! Freeze!

298
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,517
Interpol! Freeze!

299
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,020
Interpol! Free...

300
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,525
Jai, thank God.

301
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:30,152
You're in danger.

302
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,071
It's over.

303
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,739
You're safe now.

304
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:35,115
I don't think so.

305
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:36,909
No, it's all right.

306
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:44,792
Run!

307
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,548
For your lives.

308
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,478
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

309
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,649
Fetch.

310
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:33,173
My brother...

311
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,843
...don't be sentimental.

312
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:39,013
It's so unnecessary.

313
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:40,389
It's so human.

314
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:42,141
So normal.

315
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,518
You and I will live forever.

316
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,854
We are the lords of time.

317
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,939
We can take whatever we choose.

318
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:55,738
I mean, what difference can a single
human life like hers make to us?

319
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:58,240
We are immortal.

320
00:30:58,407 --> 00:30:59,783
Let me show you.

321
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:02,156
Eddie, use the medallion
to end the life that it gave.

322
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:46,385
Can you?

323
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,639
It's your turn.

324
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,489
What's that for?

325
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:51,450
That, Eddie Yang,
is for not catching me.

326
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:03,128
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not
catching me.

327
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,468
Interpol! Freeze!

328
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:15,683
Isn't that lovely?

329
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,143
Of course...

330
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,105
...when he came back, he was naked.

331
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:24,233
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.

332
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,443
I'm not complaining, mind you.

333
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,487
Listen, I have this cough.

334
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,949
I think it's quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.

335
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:34,910
I don't suppose you'd consider
a rub on your medallion?

336
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,620
I really am. Hello?

337
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:38,998
It's very bad...

338
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,293
Very bad. You...

339
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,670
Please, the med... One quick rub.

340
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,547
That's all. Oh, the medallion.

341
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:52,469
Quick. Give me the medallion.

342
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,013
Give it.

343
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:58,809
All right.

344
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:01,770
It was only a tickle anyway.

345
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:03,188
Come with me.

346
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:06,358
Wait!

347
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,569
Nicole! Eddie!

348
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,905
You can't leave me here.

349
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:20,080
Goodbye!

350
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,544
Okay, that wasn't scary at all.

351
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:29,256
He walked through a vortex
to the next universe.

352
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,134
I'm going this way.

353
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:46,774
- Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
- Cameras are ready.

354
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:48,525
Jackie, Claire. And action.

355
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:49,693
I'm sorry.

356
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,988
Can you overlap
that line for me?

357
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:56,200
Eddie Yang. I knew there
couldn't be two of you.

358
00:37:56,951 --> 00:38:00,204
- Will you say action, or am I just...?
- I did. Okay, here we go.

359
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:01,664
And action.

360
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:05,918
Three months and not so much
as a phone call?

361
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,921
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.

362
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:11,423
- Come on! Oh, my God!
- In the middle...!

363
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,093
- I got slapped for nothing!
- I'm so sorry.

364
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,555
- I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I can't believe it.

365
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,181
- Oh, no!
- Claire.

366
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:22,309
Jackie, I'm so sorry.
That rea... That hurt me.

367
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:26,146
- You should continue filming!
- Oh, I didn't know!

368
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:29,191
- Now I got another one!
- Oh, no!

369
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,569
- That was really bad.
- Try it again.

370
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:33,279
Let's go.

371
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:35,281
Let's move.

372
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:37,908
Take one.

373
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:39,243
Eddie.

374
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:42,580
All those things that I said...

375
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:46,500
I was right there.

376
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,793
- Seven, take three.

377
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:50,087
God bless, Eddie.

378
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,182
Action!

379
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:06,312
Cut!

380
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:08,355
Cut.

381
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:10,482
Take one.

382
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,735
You... Now, how...?

383
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:14,403
It's Giscard.

384
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,532
- Really? What about Snakehead?
- Snakehead is not here yet.

385
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,951
Is he not here?
What about Ken?

386
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,828
- Yeah. Ken is...
- Pete? Pete?

387
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:25,331
Pete is just right beside me.

388
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,707
That's it. We're fine.

389
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,295
- Now, that's...
- Somebody let Jackie in.

390
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:35,049
Here's the plan.

391
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:36,217
We have to...

392
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,177
Whoops.

393
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:39,637
I got it wrong.

394
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:44,725
It's this way.

395
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:48,520
Oh, sorry. It's the other way.

396
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:51,023
Oh, damn.

397
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:52,733
Oh, I missed.

398
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:55,402
Watson.

399
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:58,614
- Cut. Print.
- Phone.

400
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:00,074
- A-camera.
- Action.

401
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:02,701
Watson. So many things are going on.

402
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:07,831
- Marker.
- Come on.

403
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,376
- Marker.
- One more.

404
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:12,836
Watson.

405
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,589
Sorry. What? It's... No, you... No.

406
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:16,799
- Again.
- Sorry.

407
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,092
Marker!

408
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,640
- Cut.
- Cut!

409
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:28,352
I want ice cream.

410
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,988
Cut!

411
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:40,155
Cut!

412
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:43,284
Slate X67, take one coming up.

413
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,786
- A-marker.
- Like a woman.

414
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,497
That's it. That's it. Okay.

415
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:51,417
It's just down there.

416
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,002
Down.

417
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,795
Then the bottom.

418
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:56,505
Then the bottom.

419
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,218
- Sorry, Jackie.
- What's this? "The bottom."

420
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:04,013
- Marker.
- Move!

421
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:09,935
Wait, wait!

422
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:17,526
Oh, shit.

423
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:20,237
Nicole, the boy used the meda...

424
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,531
Very good. Cut. Cut.

425
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,827
The dog barking.

426
00:41:27,036 --> 00:41:28,162
Yeah, I heard it.

427
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:29,914
Go. Go away.

428
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:31,790
And action.

429
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,626
Interpol! Freeze!

430
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:34,793
Cut.

431
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:37,630
A-camera.

432
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,840
In case of emergency...

433
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:42,343
...the exits are here...

434
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:43,677
...here...

435
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:45,971
...and here.

436
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:52,353
- I slapped you.
- Again.

437
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,563
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

438
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,149
- It was meant to be fake. Sorry.
- You do on purpose.

439
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:58,609
Are you doing on purpose?

440
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:00,694
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.

441
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,946
It drives me crazy.
