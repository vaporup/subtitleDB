1
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,710
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:02,672
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:07,968
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,221
And at his touch...

5
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:13,557
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:18,312
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,191
You've done well.

8
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,277
As agreed.

9
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,117
Pitiful.

10
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,704
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,457
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,127
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,712
...is your life.

14
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,131
Okay.

15
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,383
Actually...

16
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,095
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,420
It's nobody you know, okay?

18
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,426
It's fish. See?

19
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:34,740
Happy now?

20
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:36,867
Cheers.

21
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,149
In English, please.

22
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:12,319
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,453
Inspector.

24
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:24,248
Positive ID on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,792
- And he's got company.
- Copy that.

26
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,377
Hold your position.

27
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,181
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:43,768
It's our guy.

29
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:45,311
All right, men.

30
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:54,779
- And Snakehead?
- Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:55,988
We should wait.

32
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,823
My intelligence says he's here...

33
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,534
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.

34
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,238
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,783
- We are supposed to be partners.
- This is an Interpol operation.

36
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,702
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...

37
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,496
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,126
You don't like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,600
It's true.

40
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,312
Tell him we found it and we're in.

41
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,926
Full force, men.

42
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,803
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,561
That's a temple. It's a holy place.

45
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,313
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,941
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,360
They're holey guns.

48
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,113
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,159
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,500
All right.

51
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,710
Move out, men!

52
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:22,134
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,011
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:45,032
Inter...

55
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,660
Freeze!

56
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:50,037
Damn.

57
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,720
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,556
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:35,291
The medallion.

60
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,295
You cannot come in he...

61
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,732
You will give me what I want.

62
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,637
What's that?

63
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,305
Check it out.

64
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,142
- Go that way.
- Got it.

65
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,714
Peter?

66
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,507
Eddie.

67
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,068
Interpol! Fre...

68
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,574
What the he...?

69
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,623
You okay?

70
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:24,418
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,798
It's the cops!

72
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,925
We've gotta go now!

73
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,468
I need more time.

74
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,140
- We haven't finished yet.
- It's too late.

75
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,476
- We'll try again later!
- Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,281
Jai!

77
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:02,289
Hang on!

78
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:17,638
Eddie!

79
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,641
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,144
Right!

81
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:44,915
Damn!

82
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,043
Four months' work!

83
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,879
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,215
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.

85
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:57,762
Perhaps he's found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,639
...you let him get away.

87
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,517
Watson.

88
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,520
I also saw his face.

89
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:15,112
Interpol's all over me,
and I can't stay here any longer.

90
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,865
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,327
I trust you will make my continued...

92
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,662
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,470
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,263
All right, notify the team...

95
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,557
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

96
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,184
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

97
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,521
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,486
- Where are you keeping the boy?
- In a safe place.

99
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,363
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,906
Up there. Okay.

101
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,499
- Where is he?
- Over here.

102
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,836
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,630
Untie him. Don't hurt him.

104
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,048
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,841
Inspector, what's going on?

106
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:42,426
Snakehead's men.

107
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:44,595
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,889
It's the boy.

109
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:54,814
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,148
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,109
Oh. Of course.

112
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,322
That's him.

113
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,909
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,621
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:14,500
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,253
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,630
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,382
Attention!

119
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,551
- Showtime!
- This is the marine police.

120
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,345
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,014
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,057
This is the marine police.

123
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,934
Look out!

124
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,527
Let's go!

125
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,946
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,049
Are you ready?

127
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:05,634
I'll cover you.

128
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,156
The boy!

129
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,374
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,009
We've interrogated the prisoner, Inspector.

131
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,888
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in Ireland. Repeat, Ireland.

132
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:20,436
Time for vacation.

133
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:21,771
Call me in Ireland.

134
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,773
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:06,315
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.

136
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,901
I'm Inspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,239
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:19,662
Nicole.

139
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,455
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,916
I knew there couldn't be two of you.

141
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,209
Nice.

142
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,003
You clean up well.

143
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,462
Thank you.

144
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:40,516
Come on.

145
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,485
It's been a long time.

146
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:52,695
Three months.

147
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,989
I was assigned overseas and...

148
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,033
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,826
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:02,496
- I didn't know you'd been assigned...
- To Ireland?

151
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,458
- Yes.
- Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,293
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,505
...between the local Interpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:14,800
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised...

155
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:17,345
Nicole.

156
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:18,721
I should have called.

157
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:20,306
I'm sorry.

158
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,642
That's worth something.

159
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:26,812
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,357
Commander?

161
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,984
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,277
Yes.

163
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:36,739
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:37,865
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,868
Commander, I was just...

166
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:48,668
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,419
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,840
You're not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,885
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:00,262
Yes.

171
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,682
You remember this boy?

172
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,894
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,187
- Who's he?
- One moment.

174
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,732
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,192
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,112
Snakehead's number two man.

177
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,699
That's privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,494
- I need to find him, Watson.
- Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,246
...but that's classified.

180
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,248
We've received a tip-off...

181
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:31,043
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in Ireland.

182
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,421
- Maybe the boy will come with it.
- Where?

183
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,256
We don't know.

184
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:39,010
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,763
- Watson!
- What?! I mean... Sorry. What?

186
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,473
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,728
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,857
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:58,696
Watson!

190
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:02,491
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,126
Yes.

192
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:15,880
I was just getting these.

193
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,384
I think we're in trouble.

194
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,514
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,600
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,311
- Well, let me have it checked out.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,480
Watson, wait.

198
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,942
- Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
- I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,904
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,616
- You need me.
- Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,826
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:48,788
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,626
Watson.

204
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,337
It just wasn't for me anymore.

205
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:59,006
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,591
Oh, I understand.

207
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:04,970
I understand that you didn't like me
always being on top.

208
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:10,351
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,604
Let's just do it together. Okay?

210
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:18,567
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,663
You think because of the way...

212
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:48,973
Thank you.

213
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,392
Think we...

214
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,185
Well, we're not.

215
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:54,979
I'm a man!

216
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:59,650
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:00,860
...one another.

218
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,695
It's a good thing. I...

219
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,532
That's your fault, that is.

220
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:09,994
Now, I'm gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,717
So on a scale of one to 10...

222
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,594
...how did that go?

223
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:29,805
About a seven.

224
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,392
Below zero.

225
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:40,608
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:44,695
Dinner.

227
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,364
Dinner?

228
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,907
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:51,035
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,746
He's stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,457
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:56,624 --> 00:26:57,917
I'll just be myself.

233
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,882
One more thing.

234
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,967
Watson's family...

235
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:09,470
...they don't know
that he's an Interpol agent.

236
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,722
- What do they think he is?
- A librarian.

237
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,683
- A librarian?
- Yes.

238
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,269
Hi.

239
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,355
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

240
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:21,774
Look, you can't just
turn up and barge in, you know.

241
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:25,611
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:28,239
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hello.

243
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,200
- Please. Please come in. Please.
- Thank you.

244
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:34,620
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,789
- Please, welcome.
- Didn't know myself.

246
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,250
- We're librarians.
- Librarian?

247
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,089
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:48,050
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,677
- Yes.
- No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:50,803
Thank you.

251
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:55,266
See what you've done to my chops?

252
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,146
What's that called?

253
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,689
Now?

254
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,942
"Lamb a la victim."

255
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,865
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:12,533
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,655
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,869
- Right. I was looking for...
- Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,330
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:02,208
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:07,088
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for
that book myself, so...

262
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,548
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,597
But I'm head librarian, though, right?

264
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:18,432
Right.

265
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,492
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,786
I already checked in.

267
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:40,705
Okay.

268
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,921
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,756
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,677
Why can't he just pick me up?

271
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,470
It's Watson.

272
00:29:57,304 --> 00:30:01,308
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So...

273
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:07,690
Okay.

274
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,191
Okay.

275
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,155
Nicole.

276
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:15,614
Yeah?

277
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,283
Tonight was fun.

278
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:19,952
Yeah.

279
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,600
Excuse me.

280
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,437
- Is this place far away or close by?
- Far away.

281
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:49,065
- Hop in the car and I'll take you.
- Thank you.

282
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,163
What are you doing?

283
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:05,956
Move.

284
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:28,396
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:36,112
- Oh, my!
- Sorry.

286
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:40,700
Did you see that?

287
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,001
What are you doing?

288
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,294
Open this door!

289
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,283
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,202
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,351
Come on.

292
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:56,609
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,364
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any...

294
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:09,538
Say it!

295
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:11,207
Talk! Where's the boy?

296
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:13,417
Let me out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

297
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:16,212
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,173
- You ever hear of police brutality?
- Sounds like fun.

299
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:22,510
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,387
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,597
- What?
- You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,265
If you say so.

303
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,227
What kind of music you like?

304
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,355
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:37,942
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:41,195
He's coming on a boat. I don't know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,447
- He'll be coming into the docks.
- A boat!

308
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,616
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,538
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,875
What's the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:56,252
You're out of shape.

312
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:57,837
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:58,004 --> 00:34:00,798
Right, but let's not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:06,804
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard's telling the truth.

315
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:09,724
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.

316
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:28,242
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,535
Do you have a gun?

318
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,996
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:33,831
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:37,251
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,586
- All right?
- Yes.

322
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:42,757
Right.

323
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:44,133
Here's the plan.

324
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:47,595
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar...

325
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:49,388
You circle arou...

326
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:51,849
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,896
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:41,732
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,176
Excuse me.

330
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:13,806
You're under arrest.

331
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:25,985
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,418
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:44,378
There.

334
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:52,887
Watson, come on!

335
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:04,815
Where's the boy?

336
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:06,734
- We couldn't find him.
- Find him!

337
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:12,156
Shoot him.

338
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,090
You okay?

339
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,474
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:41,811
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:01,122
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

342
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,331
Me, who?

343
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,791
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,460
I'm trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:38:06,669 --> 00:38:08,963
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

346
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,091
What color is it?

347
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,427
I don't know.

348
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:19,265
Watson.

349
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:23,144
- Eddie's in a container.
- Which one?

350
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:25,813
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:37,992
There! There!

352
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:39,535
It's Eddie.

353
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:00,056
Eddie.

354
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:03,726
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:11,233
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,364
Nicole!

357
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,126
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,554
Don't be afraid.

359
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:42,056
I'm not afraid.

360
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:54,443
We'll be all right.

361
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:26,494
We got control of the container. We
believe that there's bodies inside.

362
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:38,339
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:44,845
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:47,682
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,309
- You all right?
- Please.

366
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:52,228
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:56,982
Nicole...

368
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:00,986
...he's gone.

369
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,332
Come on.

370
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,752
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,087
God bless.

372
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:04,550
Nicole.

373
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,469
- We've got work to do.
- You sure?

374
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:08,095
I'm sure.

375
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:09,764
Let's go.

376
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:41,921
I'm sorry...

377
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,843
...I wasn't there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:50,805
That was nice.

379
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:52,807
Thank you. I...

380
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,229
- What's wrong?
- Who are you?

381
00:43:58,396 --> 00:43:59,605
What's the matter?

382
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:02,108
Who are you? What...?

383
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:05,111
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?

384
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:08,614
Watson.

385
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,074
Watson.

386
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:20,584
- Watson!
- Get away from me!

387
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:24,588
It must be fake.

388
00:44:24,964 --> 00:44:27,174
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:31,262
My nose isn't that big.

390
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:37,476
It's really me.

391
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:38,644
Are you sure?

392
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:40,855
Don't you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:42,940
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:47,278
- What's happening to me?
- All right.

395
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:48,696
Let's just...

396
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:50,614
...stay calm.

397
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:56,412
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,206
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:00,458
What happened?

400
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,668
Lights everywhere.

401
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:05,296
- The boy.
- The boy?

402
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,256
- Medallion.
- Yes.

403
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,676
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:45:16,724 --> 00:45:17,892
What's this?

405
00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:20,394
Wow.
