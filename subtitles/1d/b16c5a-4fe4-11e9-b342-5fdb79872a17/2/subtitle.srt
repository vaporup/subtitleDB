1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,232
You're going to see the boat people
trying to sell...

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,276
It's so hot.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,717
Let me tell you something nice.
Watching them makes me very happy.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,358
They want us...

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,908
Right. Tell Tong
to drive us around tomorrow.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,319
You tell him.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,914
He's your man. You tell him.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,592
Have you finished?

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,318
He hopes we'll go easy on him.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,789
But we've never been hard on him.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,839
Hey, Tong,
take Mr Wong sightseeing tomorrow.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,399
What about a boat trip?

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,077
Whatever! Just don't be seen.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,833
Have you finished?
We've got business to discuss.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,710
- Call Inspector Ho for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,798
Tomorrow we'll take a drive
to the Peak, and then the Gardens.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,314
Don't forget the camera.
We'll have...

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,949
Don't walk about like that,
you're making me ill.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,439
I want to.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,635
Now don't forget.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,269
The boat people who we left
asked us to entertain...

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,998
Mr Kuo, please.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,193
Boss, the telephone.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,390
You're using my shoe as an ashtray?

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,351
Mr Wong wants me to get
Chief Inspector Ho.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,797
Where can I find
an Inspector Ho for him?

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,352
- What's wrong?
- I thought you'd fixed everything.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,634
- Is that my call?
- Yes.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,909
Fixed.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,079
I'll go clean the car.

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,792
- Are Filipino maids popular here?
- It's becoming fashionable.

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,269
They're hard to come by.

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,799
There is so little money.
Why should they have first choice?

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,156
Fei, you can take it, but we can't.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,153
You've helped us for so many years.
We won't forget it, will we?

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,152
You can have anything you want.
Just say the word.

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,117
I thank you for your goodwill.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,556
Have faith in me.
Better days are ahead. Let's go.

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,795
Let's go.

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,359
Where's Snake Ming?

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,432
He left without saying
where he was going.

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,431
- Have they found Wong?
- Not yet.

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,555
Who did you call?

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,949
My cousin,
he works for the shipping company.

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,917
He's checking the passenger list.

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,994
- Inspector.
- Where did you go?

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,389
The Five Continents Hotel,
Luk Kwok Hotel...

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,756
Is our Mr Wong at the Five Continents
or Luk Kwok?

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,308
- Neither.
- Then why did you go there?

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,675
Then later I found out
he was at King's.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,558
Then why did you go
to the other places?

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,551
- I've got it.
- Got what?

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,837
Wong's already here,
so I'll check the hotel.

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,310
Who told you to check on Wong?
Find the reporters for me.

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,871
Why do I have to do everything?

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,429
I've never lied in my life.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,673
I'm really scared.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,070
We mustn't disappoint them.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,799
Uncle, you're more than an hour late.
Tiger means business.

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,716
Do you think Tiger will trick us?

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,076
- Our boys will be watching.
- I have to get my lucky rose.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,153
- Tiger's been waiting all morning.
- We'll invite him for lunch.

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,878
He wants to see you now.

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,348
I must get my rose first.

65
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,235
Boss.

66
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,319
A couple of Tiger's stooges.

67
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,516
They've got some nerve,
walking in here.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,314
What's up?

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,029
- Our boss doesn't like waiting.
- So I'll invite him for dinner.

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,269
Freeze!

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,670
- Stay there!
- Come with us, Tiger's orders.

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,839
Look, guys... this is our turf.

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,238
I'll go with them.
You and the boys...

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,308
You dare make trouble here?
Tie them up!

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,999
I'll buy my rose,
then I'll see your boss.

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,069
Let's go.

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,872
Tiger will get you for this.

78
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,159
So you're planning
to issue stocks here?

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,719
That's the idea.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,518
The door! When?

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,594
Very soon, I hope.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,395
Gentlemen.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,075
We're associates of Mr Wong's.
Is he in?

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,396
- Mr Wong is not here right now.
- We were told he was in his suite.

85
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,511
He's breakfasting right now.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,398
- We're good friends of his.
- Long time associates.

87
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,956
Just the man. These are
Mr Wong's business associates.

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,759
- What now?
- I don't do anything illegal.

89
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,673
That's kidnapping.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,228
- Close the door.
- How many have you tied up now?

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,556
You own a steel foundry as well?

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,151
Good morning, good morning.

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,719
You're very early today.

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,916
Mr Wong,
is everything to your liking?

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,558
Fine, very comfortable.

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,272
Mr Wong likes it here.

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,830
- Is everything OK, cousins?
- Of course.

98
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,911
Fresh roses. They're lovely.

99
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,590
A rose to bring you luck.

100
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,159
Why do you give him a rose?

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,752
Tradition, it's a family custom.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,308
- A tradition.
- A family tradition.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
- Wait! Come back down!
- Not so loud.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,634
Inspector Ho is coming up
with two others.

105
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,188
Mr Kuo, an urgent call for you.

106
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,679
I'll take it there.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,434
Inspector Ho is on his way up.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,192
He's already in the lift.

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,069
What do we do now?

110
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,392
Cousin. Cousin.

111
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,715
He's calling you.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,394
- You forgot our business deal.
- Today?

113
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,674
They're on the phone.

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
I'd completely forgotten about it.

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,311
He's so busy.

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,233
Give me some clothes.

117
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,958
Inspector Ho's on his way up.

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,870
This way. Take this.

119
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,029
And this.

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,352
Go on, follow him. Inside.

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,233
Mr Wong, sir.

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,274
Tell them I'll be home by noon.

123
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,918
Mr Wong, I'd recognise you anywhere.

124
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,080
You are sharp.
You must be the famous Inspector Ho.

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
At your service, sir.

126
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,475
Have you been that busy
you couldn't come to the dock?

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,596
Oh, but I was. Let me explain.

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,750
Come with me. I'm on my way out.

129
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,515
- Butler, that's all.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,114
- Who are they?
- My assistants.

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,551
They've gone.

132
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,632
That's that taken care of!

133
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,271
Tiger is on our backs
and you're still prancing about!

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,955
It may not bother you,
but it bothers me.

135
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,269
You taught me to how to dress,

136
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,512
how to walk, how to talk,
how to negotiate, how to fight.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,956
You treat me like a puppet.
Aren't you bothered about that?

138
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,314
He's right. The car.

139
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,472
- That's what you should be doing.
- That's what you think.

140
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,950
- What do you think you should do?
- What I'm doing right now.

141
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,032
- This makes you happy?
- Do I look happy?

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,033
- Continue with what you're doing.
- I will.

143
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,237
- Go on, then.
- I would if I knew what I was doing.

144
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,271
Imported goods are excellent here.

145
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,590
- Have you got any currency?
- Not yet.

146
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,796
- I'll lend you some.
- How kind.

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,678
- When are you floating your company?
- Soon.

148
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,752
He's worth a fortune.
He even owns a goldmine.

149
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,558
And the shipyard and the steelworks.

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,757
Go and find the reporters.
I'll handle this.

151
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,514
Mr Wong,
how much are the shares worth?

152
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,239
One dollar.
$2.80 once they're floated.

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,151
Double your selling price?

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,232
- There are no outside buyers.
- Can I buy some?

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,032
You're not an outsider, nephew.

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,031
Nephew, I'm one of them.

157
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,191
Inspector Ho, Chairman of
the planning committee, police club.

158
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,831
That's the police club.
I'm in charge of fundraising.

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,993
Nephew, your charitable deeds
are praiseworthy indeed.

160
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,958
- Very good, very good.
- Thank you.

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,078
Are you all right?

162
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,149
I'm just sighing.

163
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,119
It's no use sighing.
You must enjoy life.

164
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,351
I'm sighing
because the club needs $80,000,

165
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,273
but we've only raised $15,000
in 3 years.

166
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,511
That's only about $60,000
short of the target.

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,593
After the stocks are issued,
I'll see what I can do to help.

168
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,716
Mr Wong... I'm sorry.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,552
I know all it takes
is one word from you.

170
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,713
You're so clumsy.

171
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,269
My son will treat Belle well.

172
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,113
How can I say no to you?

173
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,352
Thank you for being my guide
for the day.

174
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,793
It's nothing.

175
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,350
Make a note of what I bought.
I'll pay you back soon.

176
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,998
Consider it a deposit.

177
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,229
Deposit?

178
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,276
You promised to sell me some shares.

179
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,989
- Of course! Take these to my room.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,992
Shall we sign the papers upstairs?

181
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,073
No, let's say your office tomorrow.
The shares will be ready then.

182
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,195
Fine.

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,190
Mr Wong,
I'll accompany you to your room.

184
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,111
- There's no need.
- I insist.

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,873
I'd really like a cup of coffee right now.

186
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,838
- Let's have a coffee, then.
- Fine.

187
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,590
- No coffee?
- I'd better go back to my room.

188
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,829
Back to your room.

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,275
Why don't you call the station?

190
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,989
- Call the station?
- In case they're looking for you.

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,594
- It's all right.
- Call to please me, then.

192
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,198
- I will.
- I'll wait here.

193
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,675
- I'll go to the ladies.
- I'll come.

194
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,591
- No, you go to your mother.
- OK.

195
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,479
- Why is he tagging along?
- He wants to.

196
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,790
- Don't let him.
- I'm doing my best.

197
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,708
Luming, let's go.

198
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,675
- What's up?
- Inspector Ho. Sort him out.

199
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,878
I'll be back soon.

200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,954
Kwong-On Bank, please.

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,192
Uncle, why are you here?

202
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,114
Admiring the lights.

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,111
Inspector Ho, Inspector Ho.

204
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,717
- You?
- There's a fight outside.

205
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,597
Can't you see I'm busy?

206
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,557
But you are the inspector.

207
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,471
Don't you lecture me. Yes?

208
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,995
Kwong-On Bank? Go away!

209
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,479
Sorry, not you.

210
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,437
- They're still here. Are you busy?
- No.

211
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,953
Then join me.

212
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,755
Why is he here?

213
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,159
Think of something.

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,436
I couldn't find you earlier.

215
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,390
I have something to say.
Where's Chen Wah?

216
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,311
He's just gone to the restroom.

217
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,078
We can't leave yet. Come, come.

218
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,878
Sit down and speak slowly.

219
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,949
I've no time.

220
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,553
Floating in three months!

221
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,315
They didn't sell as well
as they thought? Thank you.

222
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,872
- Excuse me.
- One moment. Yes, sir?

223
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,916
- Is Mr Wong living here?
- Yes.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,955
Is that...?

225
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,678
He's over there.

226
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,359
- A friend of yours?
- A small business matter.

227
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,589
Hey!

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,599
Nothing. I'm rich!

229
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,831
Finished work already?
Mr Kao has an easy life.

230
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,194
- Sit down for a chat.
- I'm still busy.

231
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,309
Inspector Ho? Is your eye better?

232
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,277
- Who are you?
- I hit you in the eye.

233
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,477
- You're confessing?
- Not exactly, I want your other eye.

234
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,229
Go, I'll chase you
to the ends of the Earth.

235
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,677
Stop, I'll get you!

236
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,909
What's the matter?

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,319
What's the matter?

238
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,589
I think the gangsters are fighting.
I'll take my leave of you.

239
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,398
Have dinner with us tonight.

240
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,799
We'll be there.

241
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,831
I'm not going to talk business
any more. I'll stay and have tea.

242
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,754
- Don't bring them here for tea.
- It's difficult to control them.

243
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,513
- You'd better stay here.
- Sit down again?

244
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,272
Take them to the room.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,390
I'd prefer to stay
and have tea and stay for dinner too.

246
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,674
All right.

247
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,432
Mr Kuo, the press.

248
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,588
- How did they get in?
- Bribery, I suppose.

249
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,671
And that's why I came to Hong Kong.

250
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,796
Is that so?
A photo, if you don't mind?

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,074
Fine, fine.

252
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,879
- Mr Wong.
- Chen Wah, I'm glad you're here.

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,111
Come, let's have a group photo.
Everybody join in.

254
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,951
- A photo, Dad?
- This way.

255
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,032
Good. Altogether. Altogether.

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,716
Ready, set...

257
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,994
Thank you.

258
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,438
Auntie, come and sit down.

259
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,118
- A moment. What paper are you with?
- The Sun.

260
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,316
- When will it be published?
- Tomorrow.

261
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,670
Get the flower, then we can go.

262
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,358
- Good luck.
- You're very busy.

263
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,432
- Do you really believe that?
- It's not a matter of belief.

264
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,875
Why haven't you introduced
your friend?

265
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,428
Why does he hide behind you?

266
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,274
He's shy. You must excuse me now.

267
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,511
- Chen Wah, I want to say something.
- What is it?

268
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,071
Madam Kao has consented
to a Shanghai wedding.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,995
In Shanghai! Congratulations!

270
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,153
Madam Kao, thank you
for your hospitality

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,151
and consent to this marriage.

272
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,798
You're very kind.

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,713
My trip is so brief
and I've missed so many people.

274
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,112
I suggest an engagement party
with all the Hong Kong dignitaries

275
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,474
and your friends.

276
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,393
What do you think?

277
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,836
- Chen Wah, what do you think?
- Me? I've no objection.

278
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,471
Then it's settled.

279
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,994
Good idea.
Kill two birds with one stone.

280
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,799
Mr Wong, please, excuse me.

281
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,759
Chen Wah, for an engagement in Hong Kong,
all the VIPs must be invited.

282
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,398
All right. You take care of it.

283
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,072
Did you get that?

284
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,753
Western style is more grand.
Eastern style is more relaxed.

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,354
Do your Chinese friends
outnumber foreign friends?

286
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,670
We have more Chinese
than foreign friends.

287
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,433
Cousin, cousin.

288
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,078
He's calling you.

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,914
Sorry,
shall we discuss the guest list?

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,831
Luming, come here.

291
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,911
We need to talk about it.

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,513
- Sorry.
- No, no, go.

293
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,555
Sit for a while.

294
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,112
Madam Kao, any other ideas?

295
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,473
Lots of foreign friends?

296
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,673
How are we to get VIPs to attend?

297
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,150
Nothing is impossible to you.

298
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,992
Thanks for the confidence.

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,516
Mr Wong is making such a big fuss
about everything.

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,591
It's all your fault.

301
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,795
Simple, you said.

302
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,475
Just get a suite, buy some
new clothes, a little make-up.

303
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,437
It's one thing after another.

304
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,355
Kidnapping reporters and businessmen.
Beating up police. This is a mess.

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,556
But you just said you were happy.

306
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,709
Shut up!

307
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,074
You started all this. Fix it!

308
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,075
It's a bit late to start blaming me.
You helped Madam Kao as well.

309
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,197
- Helping people is a good thing.
- Correct.

310
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,875
- But you must know your limits!
- You're just making it worse!

311
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,269
You are all right.
It's me that's wrong.

312
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,430
This is not a mistake.

313
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,195
It is. I have too much sympathy,
but not enough ability.

314
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,953
Trying to help Madam Kao
perform miracles.

315
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,431
You're right. I don't measure up.

316
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,797
Please tell her we've done all we can.
I've no more to give.

317
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,915
At this stage?

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,389
- When should I tell her?
- You'll ruin the marriage.

319
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,596
- Imagine we never helped her.
- That's rich.

320
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,194
Yes, I'm getting out now.

321
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,555
I won't tell her, I'm not so cruel.

322
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,914
- You...
- I won't.

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,989
- Tell her.
- No.

324
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,399
I'll tell her, then.

325
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,789
Uncle.

326
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,478
Auntie, Dad.

327
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,153
- We're not interrupting?
- Not at all.

328
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,508
- What's the matter?
- Mum says you're very kind.

329
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,198
You are very big hearted, so...

330
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,235
So, we'd like you to be godfather
to our first baby.

331
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,675
- Godfather?
- You wouldn't refuse us?

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,878
We won't keep you any longer.

333
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,474
Auntie.

334
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,148
Bye-bye, Uncle.

335
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,996
Godfather, what an idea.

336
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,911
Get all the bosses
and their women to pose as VIPs.

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,195
Why are you staring?
Is it a bad idea?

338
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,748
It's a good idea.
But they won't look the part.

339
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,829
Dress them up.

340
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,388
- I'll teach them etiquette.
- I'll do make-up.

341
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,199
- Go to work. I'll make some calls.
- Let's go.

342
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,759
Do you know what you're doing?

343
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,595
- What's up?
- He tried to run away.

344
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,715
Run away?

345
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,634
I can't cope. I just want to go home.

346
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,470
- How are you going to get there?
- By boat or train.

347
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,278
What about in a wheelchair?

348
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,916
I'm not going. I have work to do.

349
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,599
Let's go.

350
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,951
Everyone's assignment
is written here.

351
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,918
This is yours, remember it.
This is yours.

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,069
Take it easy.

353
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,233
I might be pregnant
and have to have an abortion.

354
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,676
You don't even know
who the father is. Stop fidgeting.

355
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,435
Please, you're ladies now.
You must be civil to each other.

356
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,670
She's always bad mouthing others.

357
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,149
She already has a gut,
and she's still eating.

358
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,356
Breathe in.

359
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,873
What are you looking at?

360
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,114
Straighten up. Remember your lines.

361
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,072
People! People!

362
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,316
Tong gave each of you
a piece of paper with your part.

363
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,311
Your name and what to say.

364
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,589
Remember your lines. Speak Mandarin.
Mr Wong is from Shanghai.

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,434
Don't start yet.

366
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,310
Just remember your part
and act like ladies and gentlemen.

367
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,153
Why should we?
He might be more vulgar than I am.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,753
Who are you?

369
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,319
The Secretary of Education.

370
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,994
Education?
How could he be more vulgar than you?

371
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,594
- Why?
- That's why.

372
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,308
Your face doesn't fit the part.
Who's the Chief Warden?

373
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,710
Who's got that paper?

374
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,236
You're the Chief Warden.
Why didn't you reply?

375
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,470
I don't know. I can't read.

376
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,312
Can't read?! What do you mean?

377
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,279
All right, you be the warden
and you be the secretary.

378
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,474
- You must be crazy!
- What's the matter?

379
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,118
He felt me up.

380
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,509
Help me out here, be civilised.

381
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,715
It was all a mistake.

382
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,593
- Bastard, molesting my bird!
- You dare to hit me?

383
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,193
Don't fight!

384
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,952
Let me go!

385
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,155
Stop it!

386
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,637
Stop acting like this!

387
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,639
Stop fighting!

388
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,989
Listen to me! Stop fighting!

389
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,599
Listen to me.

390
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,716
Aren't you tired
of all this fighting and killing?

391
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,588
This may be your only chance
in life to do a good deed.

392
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,355
You might not understand
why you have to help Madam Kao.

393
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,353
Just think - when you're old
and your children ask,

394
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,035
"Dad, what are your proudest
achievements in your life?"

395
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,917
What should you say?

396
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,150
Do you tell them you were a gangster,

397
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,550
opening brothels, casinos, racketeering...

398
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,039
Does this make you proud?

399
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,153
This may be the only thing
you can tell them.

400
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,836
- Do you understand?
- No!

401
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,199
Tong, Tong!

402
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,952
I'm here!

403
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,795
I told you they weren't to carry guns.

404
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,915
I did tell them.

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,719
Ask who else is carrying a gun!

406
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,791
Who's still got a gun?

407
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,995
Me!

408
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,676
Take all their guns away!

409
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,751
I told you not to and you still did.

410
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,354
"The Ritz"

411
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,313
Here's $5,000 from the Ho's
and $5,000 from me.

412
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,152
That's not too greedy, is it?

413
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,358
That's not greedy.
I'll give you the shares.

414
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,237
- Do you need to count it?
- No need.

415
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,153
Thank you.
When did the two reporters leave?

416
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,834
I went back to work.
I don't know when they left.

417
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,875
Sign here.

418
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,554
Mr Wong. Will there be anything else?

419
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,677
I'm going to a party tonight.

420
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,991
- Who's that?
- Mr Wong, the Shanghai magnate.

421
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,752
He's the multi-millionaire, Mr Wong?

422
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,989
Thank you.

423
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,596
Thank you, Mr Wong.
Thanks for looking out for me.

424
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,114
No need. You've been most attentive.

425
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,589
If we don't look out for each other,
who will?

426
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,511
How much did we spend last time?

427
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,716
- Don't worry about it.
- I insist!

428
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,955
Here's $2,000 for your trouble.

429
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,712
- So much money?
- Keep it.

430
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,195
It's chicken feed to me,
but it's a quite a bundle to you.

431
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,598
Remember, once the shares hit
two dollars, sell them.

432
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,398
- Double?
- Don't be too greedy.

433
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,713
I'll be rich.

434
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,274
I can't believe this bunch of paper
is so valuable.

435
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,237
It's only paper.

436
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,959
Remember, these shares
are in high demand.

437
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,190
Don't tell anyone I gave them to you.

438
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,511
Remember, once they've doubled,
sell immediately.

439
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,472
I'm leaving now.

440
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,508
30,000 shares?

441
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,195
Mr Wong. Mr Wong, sir.

442
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,636
What about the police club?

443
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,359
Oh, that?

444
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,469
It's a good thing
I have one cheque left.

445
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,836
Thanks very much, sir.
Spending more money.

446
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,759
There.

447
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,989
$80,000?

448
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,638
That's too much!

449
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,349
- It's only $65,000.
- That was my last cheque.

450
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
The next time I'm in town,
I'll write you another.

451
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,399
I'll rip this one up.

452
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,630
No need, I'll give you the change.

453
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,429
Change?
Where are you going to get $15,000?

454
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,873
I have it.

455
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,359
Can you keep a secret?

456
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,670
I've got some evidence money.

457
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,268
I'll get it for you.

458
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,670
Mr Wong, there's $13,000.

459
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,510
Add my $2,000, that makes $15,000.

460
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,113
Nephew, you are so clever.

461
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,478
Thank you on behalf of the Ho's,
the police and myself.

462
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,312
Thank you, thank you.

463
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,949
Such small things,
unworthy of mention.

464
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,748
Let go.

465
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,673
Till we meet again.

466
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,673
Mr Wong, let me see you out.

467
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,078
There's no need.
Look after your shares.

468
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,718
Don't let anybody see them.

469
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,999
Remember, double.

470
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,035
Double.

471
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,394
Lucky me.

472
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,115
Hey, you, stop!

473
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,913
Me? What's the matter?

474
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,116
Don't move.
Watch him and don't let him go.

475
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,270
I'm a friend of Inspector Ho.

476
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,828
Some friend! Great! Watch him.

477
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,629
So that's that.

478
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,755
Chief Inspector Ho.

479
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,993
What have you been doing?

480
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,629
There are so many missing persons
and you haven't found any!

481
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,994
We've got some leads.

482
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,631
The gang who's doing the kidnapping
is different from the extortion gang.

483
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,271
- What's the difference?
- Well...

484
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,918
Commandant.

485
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,194
Chief Inspector.

486
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,748
- Why didn't you knock?
- It's very urgent.

487
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,913
This discussion is very urgent.
We haven't received any ransom notes.

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,753
Fool! Even HQ has heard about this.

489
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,153
Find all the missing persons in three
days or one of us gets fired. See?

490
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,231
Get the car ready!

491
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,152
- Damn him!
- Chief Inspector!

492
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,271
Did you send men to the Ritz?

493
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,952
I did so, sir!

494
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,278
- Remember, you are responsible.
- Understood, sir.

495
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,315
Idiot!

496
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,433
It's me.

497
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,398
- You come in without knocking again?
- It's very urgent.

498
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,994
Urgent? Where have you been all day?

499
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,958
- I went to King's Hotel.
- I didn't tell you to go there.

500
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,315
But I found something out
about Mr Wong.

501
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,188
I tell you do one thing,
you do another. You disobey my orders.

502
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,511
- Hear me out first.
- You don't respect my authority.

503
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,555
But...

504
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,030
Why did you disobey my orders?
Don't you know my boss is after me?

505
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,588
- I know...
- Then why don't you go after them?

506
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,797
I am about to be fired -
and the rest of you, too.

507
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,916
Nobody is looking out for me.

508
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,559
Why are you here?

509
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,592
Obstructing justice.

510
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,477
That's a capital offence!

511
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,470
- Is that true?
- He's crazy.

512
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,551
Any leads on the missing persons?

513
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,154
- No, but we found Mr Wong...
- Nothing?

514
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,471
After all this time?

515
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,349
Idiot! And your mother
asked me to promote you!

516
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,468
Promote you to the heavens.
What's this about Mr Wong, then? Speak!

517
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,597
I found out he's not
one of Shanghai's ten richest men.

518
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,356
He isn't. I suppose you are.
Do you look the part?

519
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,876
Just say who he is. Go on! Go on!

520
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,236
'Bastard!'

521
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,278
Not only is he
one of Shanghai's richest men,

522
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,397
but he's one of the richest men
in all China!

523
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,953
Well done, well done,
that's very good indeed.

524
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,315
I don't need you to tell me that!
Get out!

525
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,279
'I must get away.'

526
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,039
Chief Inspector.

527
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,793
- You still didn't knock?
- Can I take some holiday?

528
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,155
- Holiday?
- Mother is sick.

529
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,673
- Is you father sick, too?
- No.

530
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
Get out! Don't ever come back!

531
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,595
- You look down. Was it that bad?
- I'm going on holiday.

532
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,638
Be smart, like me.
I've got some new leads.

533
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,994
Work hard and you'll get there.

534
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,435
Mr Wong, you're still here?

535
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,995
- I'll just see him off.
- Take Mr Wong back to the hotel.

536
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,675
I will, I will.
I'll take him wherever he wants to go.

537
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,196
Bye-bye, Mr Wong. Walk carefully.

538
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,559
Where are you taking me?

539
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,473
I know where I'm going.
I don't know about you.

540
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,317
Chief Inspector!

541
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,398
- Why does nobody knock any more?
- Sorry Chief.

542
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,950
I saw Kuo's men with guns at the Ritz.
Something's up.

543
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,314
Who are they?

544
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,511
Thieves, criminals,
all those on our wanted list.

545
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,755
Then why did you leave?

546
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,513
Get some men over there
and arrest them!

547
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,592
I'll get the warrant.

548
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,390
Why are you standing there?
Give me my hat.

549
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,360
What are you all staring at?
Follow us.

550
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,879
And that's the truth?

551
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,873
Yes. Apparently,
their people are at the Ritz.

552
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,757
What about the two boys we sent?

553
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,159
No news whatsoever.

554
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,074
It backs up what I said.
Kuo did take two of your men.

555
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,752
Why are you doing this?

556
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,830
I just want the killings to stop.

557
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,512
One, two, three, bow.

558
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,192
That was great.

559
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,113
This is a dress rehearsal.
Luming will be Wong.

560
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,150
Make an effort.

561
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,234
I'm Mr Wong. And you are?

562
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,438
I'm Miss Foxy,
the Rotary Chair person.

563
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,956
You're Miss Fox, the Rotary Chair person.
What is this Foxy?

564
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,314
That was my Mandarin.

565
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,674
Stick to Cantonese.

566
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,035
- I'm Mr Wong, and you are?
- I'm the Governor of Hong Kong.

567
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,113
You're not the Governor,
you're the Minister for Transportation.

568
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,838
I want to be Governor.

569
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,512
Why?

570
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,639
If he's Police Commissioner,
I've got to be Governor.

571
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,358
I must be Governor.

572
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,192
Don't take it so seriously.

573
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,272
I must outrank him. I'm the Governor.

574
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,833
He insists on being Governor.

575
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,751
Fine! Let him be Governor, then.

576
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,796
- Run through it again.
- One more time. Please, cooperate.

577
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,996
Boss, Mrs Shun wants to see you.

578
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,838
Once again. One, two, three and bow.

579
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,871
Boss,
the police have surrounded the place.

580
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,518
- Right outside?
- Yes.

581
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,074
What is it?

582
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,115
- The police have us surrounded.
- Police? How come?

583
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,432
They're waiting for Inspector Ho
to come with a warrant.

584
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,114
He must think
we're starting a gang war.

585
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,510
We can't leave and Madam Kao is waiting.
It's nearly time.

586
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,750
Oh, dear,
we'll be found out for sure.

587
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,239
This is bad.

588
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,719
The poor woman.

589
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,756
- What shall we do?
- Search me.

590
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,638
- What shall we do?
- He's the boss.

591
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,676
Come on, think!

592
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,829
What shall we do?

593
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,593
I'll go to the courthouse
to get Inspector Ho.

594
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,069
- You can't go out. What can you do?
- I don't know.

595
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,718
We'll have to play it by ear.

596
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,679
I'll go out the back way.

597
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,912
- What are you doing?
- The drinks.

598
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,355
Forget that. Go up and practise.

599
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,073
Tell Uncle I'm going to court.
I'll contact him when I meet Ho.

600
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,673
Tell him to wait for me.

601
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,033
Move on.

602
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,358
What are you doing there?

603
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,914
- What should we do?
- Ring Fei.

604
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,232
Push harder.

605
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,876
The boys must be looking for me.
Thanks.

606
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,120
He's gone to the courthouse to get Ho.

607
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,351
- All set?
- Yeah, we know what to do.

608
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,029
What's that?

609
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,352
They found the bodies of your men.
Kuo had them killed.

610
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,558
He killed my men?
Where is he? What's he up to?

611
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,790
He's gone to get Inspector Ho.

612
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,955
For what purpose?

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,316
Maybe he's working with the police.

614
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,078
Damn it! Let's go!

615
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,395
I've got to leave now.
I'll look your boss up after this.

616
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,673
- What now?
- I'm hungry.

617
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,478
- Me, too.
- Let's go.

618
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,157
I can't find him anywhere.

619
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,317
There he is. Let's go!

620
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,193
- My leg!
- My hand!

621
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,070
- You broke my pots! Pay up...
- Damn you!

622
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,349
Hold it! Don't run!

623
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,071
We've got you now.

624
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,195
Get ready.
The guests will be here soon.

625
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,350
Make sure there are enough drinks.

626
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,432
I'll see to it. Relax.

627
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,114
Problems?

628
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,637
No, they're rehearsing the entrance.
There's plenty of time. Don't worry.

629
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,354
- Where is he?
- Up there.

630
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,236
- Get him down.
- Bring him down.

631
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,273
Tiger,
sorry for not having tea with you.

632
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,516
Damn it! I liked you.

633
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,795
I promise to have tea with you,
but you've got to let me go now.

634
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,949
It's very urgent.

635
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,433
Let you go?
I sent two boys to invite you to tea.

636
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,992
- You killed them. Why?
- I didn't. I set them free.

637
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,353
Where's my gun?

638
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,753
Didn't you hear what I said?
I didn't kill them. They'll be back soon.

639
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,433
Brother Fei,
tell him I didn't kill them.

640
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,318
But you did.
The bodies have been found.

641
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,152
That's impossible.

642
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,835
Tiger, don't believe him. He's evil.
He's making fools of us both.

643
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,038
He never liked me anyway.
They'll be back soon, believe me.

644
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,917
Where are they, then?

645
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,356
- They must be on their way back.
- To avenge their deaths?

646
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,158
Damn it, don't string me along!

647
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,198
Tiger, believe me.
I didn't kill them!

648
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,793
Tiger! Tiger!

649
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,235
Can you kill me later?
I've got urgent business to attend to.

650
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,436
Shut up! I'll kill you now.

651
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,999
Here they are.

652
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,670
I told you I didn't kill them.

653
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,558
- Why aren't you two dead already?
- Not yet. He saved us.

654
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,279
- He set us free.
- Damn it, you scared me.

655
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,920
Tiger, I told you
I didn't lie to you.

656
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,834
So, you creep,
you want to be the boss?

657
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,232
Tiger, I did it for you.
I would make a much better boss.

658
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,392
There's no way you could be better!
Release him!

659
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,833
Take it easy!

660
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,232
Tiger, I hope you understand.
I did this for your own good.

661
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,677
From now on,
keep out of our family affairs.

662
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,834
Your family affairs! No problem.
I got him. Stop him if you can.

663
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,152
Tiger,
I will certainly have tea with you.

664
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,352
Brother Fei, as you pointed out,
this is a family affair.

665
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,714
Let's go and sort it out.

666
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,870
I've got urgent business, excuse me.

667
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,118
Don't think
you're going to leave here alive.

668
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,153
Tiger.

669
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,438
I won't interfere, but rules are rules.
I'll keep the guns for you.

670
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,314
Canton kid, have no fear.
I'll make sure there's no foul play.

671
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,996
But I might be dead by then.

672
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,951
Get him and the factory is yours.

673
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,308
Get him!

674
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,595
Out of the way!

675
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,832
Brother, you're good.

676
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,832
Stop. I've got to go.
Can we finish this later?

677
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,069
Grab him.

678
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,194
He's over there!

679
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,554
Pull the rope.

680
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,633
Thank you, Buddha!

681
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,548
Don't jump!

682
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,109
I told you not to.

683
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,278
Stop fighting!

684
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,198
Don't go away. It's your turn now.

685
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,319
You were great.

686
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,995
Brother Chen Wah.

687
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,834
You've done one thing right,
the factory hands are behind you.

688
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,037
You can have the factory
and we can be family again.

689
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,957
- Thank you, Chen Wah.
- I've got to go now.

690
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,873
Canton kid, I really admire you.

691
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,873
Your family affair is settled.
We've done our bit. Let's be friends.

692
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,439
I don't have time.

693
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:06,152
Still thinking of the beating I gave you?
Hit me back, then.

694
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,592
Go on, don't be afraid.

695
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,637
- Stand back!
- Don't move!

696
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,950
Great fistwork.

697
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,637
Canton kid, you fight really well.
Now, go on, slap me.

698
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,956
Good friends we shall be.

699
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,554
Friend, I've got to go now,
urgent business.

700
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,598
If anything happens, count me in.

701
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,874
Count your ass.

702
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,518
What's the hurry?

703
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,158
Shandong man, lend me your car.

704
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,437
- What?
- I'm borrowing your car.

705
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,635
- How was that?
- Perfect, just right.

706
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,316
Chief Inspector, you're wanted.

707
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,718
Inspector Ho.

708
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,191
Go out and keep watch.

709
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,999
Inspector, take your men away.
Inspector, please...

710
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,399
How did you get out?

711
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,913
- Inspector...
- Stand up!

712
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,959
Inspector Ho, please, remove them.
We're doing a good thing at the Ritz.

713
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,076
Putting you lot away
is the good thing.

714
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,792
What are you doing here?
I told you to find the missing men.

715
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,154
Sir...

716
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,800
The Attorney General
just chewed my ass!

717
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,395
From now on, your only job
is to find the missing persons

718
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,959
or you'll go missing!

719
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,797
I know the whereabouts
of the missing persons.

720
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,312
- Who's this?
- The owner of the Ritz.

721
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,355
Is that true?

722
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,635
Four reporters, two businessmen, right?

723
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,314
Yes,
this is why I brought him to see you.

724
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,549
Follow me.

725
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,509
You too.

726
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,519
The missing persons' case is most urgent,
we must deal with it first.

727
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,552
Order them to search the Ritz.

728
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,757
No, they're getting ready
for Madam Kao's party.

729
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,989
It's an order.

730
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,036
The missing are not in the Ritz.

731
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,348
Where are they?

732
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,433
Free my friends and I'll tell you.
First let me make a call.

733
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,751
- I can't...
- If I don't, they won't free them.

734
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,512
Things could get ugly.

735
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,989
- All right, make your call.
- Thank you.

736
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,909
- Hello?
- Luming.

737
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,833
- Tell Uncle to release them.
- The reporters?

738
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,198
Tell Madam Kao we can't come.
Tell the brothers it's all off.

739
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,471
What now? What now?

740
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,314
One more time. Make it better.

741
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,797
There's no need.
Everything's cancelled.

742
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,198
- Why did you kidnap them?
- To keep the secret.

743
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,999
- The secret of your crimes?
- Hold your tongue!

744
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,469
- What secret?
- A lady's secret.

745
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,278
What has she to do with you?

746
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,670
Nothing, really.
I just buy a rose from her every day.

747
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,548
I know nobody will believe me.

748
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,189
We believe you,
but we don't understand the kidnapping.

749
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,317
That's exactly why.
You won't understand.

750
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,154
You see, her daughter has a rich boyfriend,
they've just graduated.

751
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,719
They're getting married here.

752
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,519
This scared the mother,
so she lied about her background.

753
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,036
She's got a heart of gold
and would never lie.

754
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,590
When I arrived in Hong Kong,
she told me to be careful.

755
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,276
A conman had already taken my last cent.
I bought a rose for luck.

756
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:40,435
You ladies will understand the love
between a mother and her daughter.

757
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,875
So I kidnapped the men,
but they're OK.

758
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,839
I just wanted to help
keep her secret.

759
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,875
- You don't understand, do you?
- Not a word.

760
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,599
We don't know what you're saying.

761
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,633
All right, I'll speak more slowly.

762
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,237
There once was a young flower girl.
No, an old flower lady.

763
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,992
She has a daughter, and...

764
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,276
Dad, the guest...

765
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,948
Sorry, I'll see to Madam Kao.

766
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,192
Why aren't the guests here yet?

767
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,157
The car behind us broke down
and caused an almighty traffic jam.

768
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,470
That's why. They're on their way.

769
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,478
Sorry, we did our best.

770
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,756
I know what I must do.

771
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,191
How do we get out of this mess?

772
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,032
Did you say something?

773
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,598
Mr and Mrs Kao,
what's this all about?

774
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,355
I think...

775
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,273
by now...

776
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,234
you must have realised
something was wrong.

777
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,594
Mum, what's happened?

778
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,478
Everything has a solution.

779
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,157
I know you came to Hong Kong
to look into Belle's background.

780
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,789
You have good reasons for doing so.

781
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,159
Guests or no guests,
we can still have a good time.

782
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,196
Let's go out for some food.

783
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,197
- Come on.
- Let me finish.

784
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,195
Mr Wong.

785
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,632
I hope you appreciate the fact...

786
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,675
that Belle is extremely
important to me.

787
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,836
To make things easier for her...

788
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,434
I've done things
I never dreamed of doing.

789
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,596
Mum, don't be like that.

790
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,478
Tell us everything.
We'll sort it out.

791
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,074
I understand now.

792
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,789
Whatever you do...

793
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,557
you get what you deserve
in this life.

794
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,473
Madam, if it's about the guests,
sorry for the trouble.

795
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,518
I didn't realise it would upset you.

796
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,635
It's not that.

797
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,479
I wish...

798
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,037
my being Madam Kao...

799
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,352
If what you're saying has nothing
to do with the wedding,

800
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,317
there's no need to say it.

801
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,551
Mum, I want you to know
I love Belle whatever happens.

802
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,077
That makes it even more important
for me to say it.

803
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,631
I want you all to know...

804
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,996
I want you all to understand...

805
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,598
Music, music!

806
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,269
- I am not...
- The guests are here!

00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,877

We meet again.

Postmaster General and Mrs Nitton.

822
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,031
Why are you dressed like that?

823
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,315
The Attorney General lent it to me.

824
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,958
How did you get them to come?

825
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,429
I told them we'd be finished
without them.

826

What a happy night.

831
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,628
You finally did something good
on your own.

832
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,714
I wanted to do it, like everyone else,
but I didn't have the guts.

833
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,678
Why are you crying?

834
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,271
I'm going to the toilet.

835
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,913
Stop crying,
you'll ruin your make-up.

836
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,437
Do I look ugly?

837
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,309
Quick! The ship's about to sail.

838
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,675
"Former Chief Inspector Wanted

839
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,794
You bastard!

Come and see me in Malaysia,
if you dare!

841
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,758
You finally did a good deed.

842
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,114
You played your part.

843
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,675
Come back any time!

844
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,355
