MIRACLES

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,192
The Hansen factory is looking
for young apprentices.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,430
There are 250 vacancies right now.

7
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,196
The pay is $8 a month and you
are guaranteed a year's bonus.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,794
It's just two dollars to register.

9
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,235
- A job in Hong Kong?
- But $2 he said.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,835
You must be prepared
to work hard and long hours.

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,638
$2 dollars, that's too much.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,837
No need to push.
There are 250 positions.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,118
If you feel this is for you,
it's only $2 to register.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,631
They also need a bright lad
to work as a cashier.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,598
- Pay is $12 a month, any takers?
- I will.

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,669
Come this way.

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,314
- What are you good at?
- Kung fu and acrobatics.

18
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,278
- But can you use an abacus?
- No problem.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,554
- Guarantor?
- What?

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,473
- Have you got any money?
- Yes.

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,348
- It's $30. What's your name?
- Kuo Chen Wah from Canton.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,829
- Do I have to pay now?
- That's the deal.

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,150
Pay cash, you're in.
Still want it?

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,435
I only have $25.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,195
Pay the rest later.
Report for duty tomorrow at this address.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,594
Jobs galore!
Hurry, they're going fast.

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,750
You're really lucky.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,830
Line up over here!

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,437
Only $2 registry fee!

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,553
What are you doing here?
This isn't Hansen's cloth factory.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,755
Who took your $2?

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,435
The address is right,
but the Hansen factory doesn't exist.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,478
It's not easy to make a living
in Hong Kong.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,870
Leave now, you've all been conned.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,518
Leave, or I'll call the police.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,474
Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,599
- What do we do now?
- Call it a $2 lesson.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,116
We were lucky.
I saw some guy pay the man $30.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,476
- That was very bad luck.
- More money than sense.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,479
Hong Kong!

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,759
It's all arranged.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,637
- Be careful.
- Sure.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,675
Boss, you look bad.

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,910
Uncle Hai, I can't find his medicine.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,676
You forgot the boss's medicine?
One of you must have it.

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,159
Imbecile!

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,473
Pretending he's boss.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,279
They forgot your medicine.
We'll postpone the meeting.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,511
- We mustn't show any weakness.
- It's not that...

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,633
If Tiger's reasonable,
don't be too harsh.

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,473
You're too kind-hearted
for this business.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,870
In our business, it's them or us.

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,394
That's why I have
absolute faith in Fei.

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,357
He's vicious and cold-hearted.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,155
Sunglasses.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,437
- Late, as usual.
- I'm not late.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,308
You were early.

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,872
What's wrong, old man?
You're ill again?

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,555
Cut the small talk.
Why did you call me here today?

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,919
Fine.
Remember Yang - your partner, Mr White?

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,594
Sure I do, but he's dead.

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,276
Yeah, but he and I made a deal.
The Ritz would be split down the middle.

63
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,070
He may have said so, but I never did.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,154
Come on, calm down. You came to talk.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,152
I'm here because as Mr White,

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,314
I won't be forced into bargaining
with you pack of liars!

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,872
You're calling me a liar?

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,993
That isn't nice. Open fire!

69
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,277
- Are you all right, boss?
- Get him out of here.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,474
- Would you like to buy a rose, sir?
- No.

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,438
Don't refuse me
this early in the morning.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,475
No, thank you.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,109
Buying a rose from me
will bring you good luck.

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,474
- Your first time in Hong Kong?
- Yes.

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,391
Take care.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,471
I learnt my lesson yesterday.

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,030
I'm afraid you didn't.
Look at your suitcase.

78
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,632
As I said, take care, sir.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,639
Hey, wait a minute.

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,917
I will buy a rose after all.

81
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,270
- Let's hope your luck will change.
- I hope you're right.

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,355
Thanks!

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,435
Be careful.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,115
Get lost!

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,073
What now?

86
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,836
- Don't move!
- I'm just trying to help.

87
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,070
Thanks very much, young man.
Don't move!

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,034
Run for it!

89
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,358
- Boss, are you OK?
- How did we get into this mess?

90
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,000
Young man, could you help carry him?

91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,436
- Who are you?
- We'll pay you $100.

92
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,033
$100?

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,429
Over there!

94
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,075
- Where do I take him?
- Anywhere. Move!

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,309
Run!

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,828
- Where now?
- Ouch! That hurts.

97
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,639
Put me down.
You're hurting my stomach.

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,596
- Put him down first!
- OK.

99
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,718
- Boss, are you OK?
- You...

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,639
My...

101
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,516
This way.

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,511
How is your stomach?

103
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,231
Boss, how are you?

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
Tell me who is going
to take your place?

105
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,719
Let him have it.

106
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,031
- Let him have it?
- What's happening?

107
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,954
- Are you sure?
- I want him...

108
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,474
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,595
You all heard Mr White.
We must obey his wishes.

110
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,956
But we must get out of here.
Let's go, boss.

111
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,591
From now on, you're our boss.

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,033
Me?

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,954
Being our boss, you don't have to
worry where you live or how you live.

114
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,716
You still don't understand.
Look, you get to have elegant clothes.

115
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,553
You're always fighting,
it's a dangerous job.

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,476
- I might as well do it.
- What?!

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,236
Don't worry.
Just do as I tell you, you'll be OK.

118
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Why did the boss name this jerk?
You were his right hand man.

119
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,268
If I'm not the right man for the job,
we'd soon know about it.

120
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,557
If you're not up to it,
then who is?

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,229
Let's wait and see what happens.

122
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,790
Boss, any spare change?

123
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,393
Here, now scram.

124
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,596
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

125
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,193
Keep an eye on things.
We'll go in the back way.

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,111
What if nothing happens?

127
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,758
Then fix the car.

128
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,559
Young man, a rose for luck?

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,834
Get lost.

130
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,633
I'll buy a rose from her.
Hey, lady!

131
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,472
I'll buy a rose from you.

132
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,358
It's your lucky day, sir.

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,193
- There.
- That's very kind. I thank you, sir.

134
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,679
Let's go, boss.

135
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,916
- Why isn't Fei our new boss?
- You really want him up there?

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,877
Who else? You?

137
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,238
Fei's the only man,
otherwise it could be any one of us.

138
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,276
Why not you?

139
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,955
We've got him outnumbered.
He doesn't stand a chance.

140
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,429
If he's got the guts to fight,
he can show us.

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,716
I can't go through with this.
Don't force me.

142
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,349
We won't force you.
You can take the back stairway out.

143
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,235
- Thanks.
- But you must be careful.

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,399
Why should I be careful?

145
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,278
If you leave now,
we can't protect you.

146
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,591
If Tiger catches you,
they'll make mincemeat of you.

147
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,796
But I helped your boss, remember?

148
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,316
I couldn't figure out why you helped.

149
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,188
It's odd he chose you,
but I must obey his instructions.

150
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,235
I'm cursed whichever way I turn.

151
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,232
No problem. I'll look out for you.

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,076
Now you even look like the boss.

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,353
Here's your speech.

154
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,634
Let's go.

155
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,549
We'll test him.

156
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,789
Don't be afraid.

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,235
Brothers, at the request of Mr White,

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,392
I'm here to introduce your new boss,
Kuo Chen Wah.

159
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,998
Uhh... good day to you, friends.

160
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,039
I would like to...

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,072
I would like to...

162
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,071
Can't you talk without reading?

163
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,915
I don't know how to be your boss.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,356
In my opinion you shouldn't rob banks,
or do bad things

165
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,876
like racketeering, killing,
or breaking the law in any...

166
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,589
Our new boss
has got a great sense of humour.

167
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,194
Words are fine, but show us
what you're really made of.

168
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,438
- Show us what he's made of.
- Go on.

169
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,192
- All right?
- OK.

170
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,952
- Look out for him.
- OK.

171
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,148
Go on, then.

172
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,673
Over here, over here!

173
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,469
Don't be shy.

174
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,874
Come on!

175
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,439
Fatty, you be referee.

176
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,715
Settle down.

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,869
Move out of the way.

178
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,599
Ready? One, two, three...

179
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,355
Who burnt me?

180
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,634
Don't make excuses.

181
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,748
Well done, boss.

182
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,951
I tell you, somebody burnt me.

183
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,156
Arm wrestling doesn't prove anything.

184
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,435
Otherwise Tom would've been
boss long ago.

185
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,034
In this business,
you must be able to fight.

186
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
You fight him them.

187
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,151
You're on your own now.

188
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,594
We'll show him.

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,111
Is two against one too much for you?

190
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,391
Let me go!

191
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,839
Help him up.

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,509
Boss.

193
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,836
- The boss is the winner!
- Well done!

194
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,354
The boss is the winner.

195
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,509
"The King George"

196
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,953
The letter?

197
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,555
- And the paper?
- Here. Write sparingly.

198
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,269
If the boss finds out, he'll fire me.

199
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,352
I won't waste it.
Here's a rose for luck.

200
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,789
'I was at Mr Chow's party today.

201
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,952
'He was asking after you.

202
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,998
'When I got back to the hotel,
I received your letter.

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,470
'I am so happy that your school
friend, lan is so good to you.

204
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,473
'I am very happy for you,
I think he must be very handsome.

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,032
'If you're not too busy, I hope we
can meet in Shanghai later this year.

206
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,873
'We're going to a function
at the Indian Consulate tonight.

207
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,997
'No doubt it will be chicken curry.

208
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,470
'I'm sending you some more money
this month.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,394
'You're getting older now,
so you'll be needing a bit more.

210
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,712
'The weather's getting cold,
take care you don't kick off your covers.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,951
'The chauffeur has just arrived.
I've got to go.

212
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,793
'Sorry to write so little, Mum.'

213
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,839
So we're making a loss and breaking even?
Something must be wrong.

214
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,356
You don't know what Yang is like.
He tricked him in a game of chance.

215
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,513
He lost all his shares in the Ritz.
So I juggled the figures a bit.

216
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,830
Do we have to get involved
in shady deals?

217
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,708
Boss, I'm just following orders.
The brothers won't object if they're fed.

218
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,758
Can you make this restaurant
more profitable?

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,273
I won't run a casino.

220
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,072
A whorehouse, then?

221
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,757
Uncle? Sorry, but there's a Miss Yang
here to see you.

222
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,314
Come in. This is Uncle Hai.

223
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,838
Good day, I'm Luming Yang.
My father used to own half this place.

224
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,754
I believe he died in Shanghai
three months ago.

225
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,795
Yes.

226
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,351
That's why I've come to discuss
the business side of things with you.

227
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,910
This is Mr Kuo Chen Wah.
He's our new boss here.

228
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,790
My father gambled his share
of the restaurant away.

229
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,269
He asked me to find a way to repay you.

230
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,476
It's nothing. Forget it.

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,716
Wait.
He meant at your own convenience.

232
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,391
I've got some money here.
Can I give you that for now?

233
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,710
Your father owed us thousands.

234
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,113
I could work for you without pay.

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,235
As what?

236
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,551
I sang and danced
at a club in Shanghai.

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,393
- Why did you leave?
- The club closed.

238
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,948
It wasn't my fault.
I was very good.

239
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,636
One minute. I'll sing for you.

240
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,553
Hong Kong by night, never sleeps

241
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,835
The Pearl of the Orient that we are

242
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,948
Listen to the symphony of waves
and tides

243
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,150
- It's not much.
- I got it. Build her up.

244
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,789
- We'll open a nightclub.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

245
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,918
- Up there.
- One, two, three...

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,198
Be careful, be careful.

247
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,069
What's the total?

248
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,674
If I knew how to add,
I would have joined the Navy.

249
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,273
You're crazy!

250
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,318
It's someone for you.

251
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,436
Mr Jang.

252
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,549
Mister.

253
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,230
You're decorating?

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,711
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

255
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,637
Be careful!

256
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,711
Why are you taking so long?

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,951
If I knew how to write,
I would have joined the airforce.

258
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,993
Are you ready?
Now look at the camera.

259
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,035
Ready.

260
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,511
- Let's go in.
- Welcome!

261
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,830
- Put it there.
- Your reservations, sir?

262
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,912
- Tiger Lo needs no reservations.
- This way, Tiger.

263
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,634
So kind of you to come, Mr Tiger.

264
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,189
You've got a nice place here.

265
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,033
Let me introduce you to our new boss,
Kuo Chen Wah.

266
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,638
Kuo Chen Wah. You're not White, then.
I thought White was your father.

267
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,192
Miss Luming, hurry up.

268
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,391
To what do we owe
the pleasure of this visit?

269
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,517
Relax, this is a social visit.

270
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,514
I see you've spared no expense.

271
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,433
I'm ready to forget Yang's debts.

272
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,751
Give me half of the Ritz.

273
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,071
I think...

274
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,914
- Are you the boss here?
- No, he is.

275
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,675
Then shut up. Well?

276
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,028
Yang's debts are not our business.

277
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,475
You can see
we've spent a lot on the decor.

278
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,471
We don't need outside investment.

279
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a great surprise in store tonight.

280
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,874
Luming Yang of Shanghai,
star of Broadway.

281
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,235
I'm usually short-tempered,
but tonight...

282
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,719
Make way, make way!

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,270
- Get the lights on.
- Nobody move.

284
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,070
Stay in your seats. Stop the music.

285
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,720
- Spotlights off.
- Turn on the house lights.

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,310
The Chief Inspector Ho
of Hong Kong here.

287
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,156
Identity cards, ready, please.

288
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,915
- Mr Ho, you are disrupting the show.
- Inspector to you.

289
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,195
Inspector, we have a proper license.

290
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,271
And we have a proper search warrant.

291
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,713
I don't carry a card.

292
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,519
What are you saying?
No cards? Why?

293
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,876
- So what?
- Imprisonment, that's what.

294
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,675
How are you, sir?

295
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,832
- How's Mr Laughton, your boss?
- He's well, thank you.

296
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,993
You may leave.
These are all good people.

297
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,351
Have you made the check?

298
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,749
Inspector Ho,
you are disturbing our guests.

299
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,358
I will come here whenever I please.
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

300
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,031
- Are you the licensee?
- No, not me, him.

301
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,316
I'm Kou Chen Wah, the manager.

302
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,913
So you're the new boss?

303
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,788
It's our opening night.
Excuse us for any shortcoming.

304
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,393
Looks like a boss.

305
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,031
I won't disturb them,
but I would like a word with you.

306
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,189
No problem.

307
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,350
Of course.

308
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,835
Now what?

309
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,711
Stop searching.

310
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,189
Let's go.

311
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,508
Come upstairs.

312
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,832
Inspector Ho, please, sit down.

313
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,914
I didn't come here to sit down,
I came here because I saw something.

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,558
Saw something?

315
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,116
Something that doesn't belong here.

316
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,273
You must be mistaken,
everything here is bought and paid for.

317
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,920
- I mean you.
- Me? I don't belong here?

318
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,792
Yes, all the people downstairs
make a living through theft,

319
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,997
deceit and other foul means.

320
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,751
Don't argue with me.

321
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,795
I reckon...

322
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,318
amongst all these people...

323
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,958
the only person
who hasn't committed a crime yet...

324
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,196
I want to save you
from this den of iniquity.

325
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,513
- I want to do you a good turn.
- A good turn?

326
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,273
Yes, from now on...

327
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,955
if you can inform me
of Yang and Tiger's activities,

328
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,600
then I will put them behind bars.

329
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,069
Then you and I...

330
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,631
will create the biggest story
to come out of Hong Kong in its history.

331
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,317
I must wipe them out.
I hope you aren't one of them.

332
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,868
But I have been thinking of a gradual...

333
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,919
Don't reply now.
Think it over and give me a call.

334
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,116
I don't usually trust people,
but in your case...

335
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,270
Boss, some tea for Inspector Ho.

336
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,114
No need,
we won't be bothering you any further.

337
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,909
- What was that...?
- Sorry, I forgot my hat.

338
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,999
Continue.

339
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,759
- What did he say?
- He told me to behave.

340
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,273
He wouldn't say that.

341
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,875
He must think you are the only
innocent person here.

342
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,076
Did he ask you to do the right thing?

343
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,878
- No.
- Of course he did.

344
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,670
He must have asked you to rat on us
and do Hong Kong a great service.

345
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,751
He must have said
he didn't trust anyone

346
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,478
and you shouldn't miss the boat.

347
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,596
So you know what he told me?

348
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,193
Not just me. Everyone knows.

349
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,396
Even the door man.

350
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,272
Back to base!

351
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,836
Sorry about the interruption.
Continue the music.

352
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,474
Let's give Luming a big hand.

353
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,990
Ask your boss to have a drink.
This is all water under the bridge.

354
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,038
We don't want to start a war.

355
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,714
Very few people
are as peace-loving as you.

356
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,997
If I was boss, I'd prefer peace too.

357
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,675
Kuo is too young
and Hai is too sneaky.

358
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,228
- Pass on the message.
- If that's all, I'll leave.

359
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,678
All debts are paid.
Here are the IOU's.

360
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,398
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

361
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,756
- Tong's still out buying roses.
- What for? It's not a proposal.

362
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,159
Chen Wah.

363
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,037
What is it?

364
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,556
- Have you thought about the future?
- I have thought about it.

365
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,358
Everybody's waiting.

366
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,477
Wait till I come back.
Wait three years anyway.

367
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,908
Hey!

368
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,433
Hey!

369
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,475
Three years!

370
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,314
Don't you know the Black Tiger gang
had 7 bosses in three years?

371
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,476
I can't find Madam Kao.

372
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,073
Can't you go without roses?

373
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,358
- That's not the point.
- Fine, get started. Get in.

374
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,797
I wish you good luck.

375
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,279
Thank you, miss.

376
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,112
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Lovely.

377
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,556
You people cover the back alley.

378
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,234
- Rush in when I throw the cup.
- OK.

379
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,799
Wait a minute.

380
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,719
Tidy up.

381
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,832
Kid, you do have it.
Sit down, please.

382
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,515
Quick, stay alert.

383
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,398
Don't nag me again.

384
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,472
Now you're here,
some good will come of this.

385
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:22,240
Sign here, and you go home safely.
With not a hair missing.

386
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,436
Half of the Ritz?

387
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,830
Whatever has happened
between us in the past,

388
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,118
sign here and we'll be brothers.
Understand?

389
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,955
Yes, but...

390
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,512
Are you qualified to sign?
If not, shut up.

391
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,638
- I'll sign.
- Now you are talking.

392
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,994
With one more clause...

393
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,278
we get half your income from
the casinos then - unconditionally.

394
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,552
Repeat what you said, young man?

395
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,755
Say that again.

396
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,758
Go on.

397
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,869
You take half the Ritz,
we're entitled to half your assets.

398
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,113
Don't move!

399
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,677
Fools! Ten Shantung men
can't beat two Cantonese?

400
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,719
Useless morons!
What are you doing with your guns?

401
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,031
Put the guns away, you idiots!

402
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,355
Young man, if you've got the balls,
come outside with me.

403
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,995
If you're going to hit me, kill me.

404
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,273
You old rotten egg!

405
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,954
Boss is in trouble.

406
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,313
You're good, young one.

407
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,636
- Pick him up.
- Move it.

408
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,795
Let's go.

409
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,991
Don't push. I'll go myself.

410
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,516
- Go, quick.
- Hurry up.

411
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,870
Give me half the Ritz
and I'll set them free.

412
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,475
Let's go.

413
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,398
Police.

414
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,829
Finished fighting? Seems we're late.

415
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,956
What did you say, Inspector Ho?

416
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,351
Mr Tiger, was there
fighting going on here?

417
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,673
I don't understand your dialect.
Speak Cantonese.

418
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,239
Cantonese?

419
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,029
It seems there was a fight here.
I'm sure you weren't involved.

420
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,588
A fight? I didn't see anything.

421
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,517
- Nothing?
- No.

422
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,835
You saw nothing.
Are you under duress?

423
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,717
We were having tea and a chat.

424
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,591
Well, our tea and chats are over.
See you some other day.

425
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,795
Any time.

426
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,038
Tell me he threatened you
and I'll have him arrested.

427
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,510
Inspector Ho, I don't understand.

428
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,115
You're refusing to cooperate,
next time I may be too late.

429
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,715
Now I understand. Goodbye.

430
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,593
That's it, then. Let's go.

431
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,352
They were fighting.
Do you believe he was having tea?

432
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,589
I'm not blind.

433
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,954
Mission over.

434
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,359
Dismissed.

435
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,873
The Inspector saved the day,
not the rose.

436
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,757
I won't go anywhere without a rose.

437
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,875
Superstition.

438
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,071
Uncle, do we need to repair the car?

439
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,309
Yes, you and the car.

440
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,038
An overhaul is expensive.

441
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,914
I suspect Fei is behind
the whole thing.

442
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,319
You suspect him?

443
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,598
He's an old-timer and knows the ropes well,
yet he failed miserably.

444
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,398
So you question Fei's loyalty?

445
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,392
In our business,
there's one thing we can't forget...

446
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,757
trust no-one.

447
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,398
I don't like it.

448
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,596
You don't have much choice.

449
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,751
- Do you want this?
- No.

450
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,110
- Where are you going?
- To the States.

451
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,031
Without consulting me?

452
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,190
You never gave me a chance to talk.

453
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,714
You only have time for fights
and business.

454
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,918
You take a holiday. It's OK.

455
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,797
I'm not coming back.

456
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,278
What? Why?

457
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,192
- I want to get married.
- I told you, it's impossible.

458
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,113
With whom?

459
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,599
With Mr Lu.

460
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,275
His parents in the States are dying
for him to get married.

461
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,069
You think nobody wants me.
Don't try to stop me.

462
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,673
You can't leave!

463
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,230
- Why can't I go?
- You can't. Listen to me.

464
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,799
- You are rotten!
- Help me, please.

465
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,235
It's none of my business. Carry on.

466
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,356
If you leave what will happen to us?

467
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,796
All you care about is business.
You never have time for me.

468
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,075
Who do you think I am?
The piggy bank?

469
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,436
I never treated you like that.
Hey, help me out here.

470
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,555
What can I do?

471
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,473
- How do we treat her?
- As the piggy bank, of course.

472
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,835
He said it. Don't deny it again.

473
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,559
He's lying. Don't believe him.

474
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,835
Right, I lied.
What lies should I tell now?

475
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,515
Lies? You fool!
Lady, you know well how I treat you.

476
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,635
How do you treat me?

477
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,709
You know.

478
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,078
I don't know. You usually mumble,
I don't know what you're saying.

479
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,479
You're driving me crazy.

480
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,118
Lady, lady...

481
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,590
Lady, are you really going
to drop everything and leave?

482
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,558
It's now or never. Should I wait
till you are riddled with holes?

483
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,392
Fiddlesticks!

484
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,038
Did I say something wrong?

485
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,998
I just heard wrong.
It's none of my business.

486
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,753
None of your business?
All you do is drink. She's leaving.

487
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,558
That is my business. Stop her.

488
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,315
Lady, please, give me two more years.

489
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,799
You think I'd trust you?!

490
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,950
- I really mean it.
- You really mean it?

491
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,708
Let go of me!

492
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,311
Lady, lady, please, stay.

493
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,879
You lied to me.

494
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,349
No, I didn't.

495
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,955
I paid you back money
which my father didn't even owe you!

496
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,509
I worked hard for you. What have you
got to say for yourself?

497
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,272
I told him not to cheat you.

498
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,588
I've never objected.

499
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,193
He said the same thing.

500
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,955
At first, I didn't know you well.
Later, I didn't know how to begin.

501
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,235
The money is intact.
I'll pay you back.

502
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,153
So you cheated because he said so.

503
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,037
I didn't know you then.

504
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,951
Now you know how to shift blame.

505
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,473
Shut up, you!

506
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,677
Forget it. I don't want the money.
I'm going.

507
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,638
- Lady, listen to me.
- Let go of me.

508
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,749
Listen to me.

509
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,713
Boss.

510
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,074
Mr Lu wants to know
when we are leaving.

511
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,275
None of your business.

512
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,555
No, I've come to report
the engine's dead.

513
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,039
Tell him to go away.

514
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,189
How can they leave?

515
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,953
Yeah, how can they leave,
do I have to push them?

516
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,678
Tell Mr Lu to leave.

517
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,352
Tell Mr Lu to leave.

518
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,556
Tell him to leave, OK.

519
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,871
You depend on others for decisions.

520
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,837
Only when they are right.

521
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,354
- Lady.
- Let me go.

522
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,908
Lady, you can't go!

523
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,509
Don't go.

524
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,589
Give me a reason to stay.

525
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,796
A reason? What reason?

526
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,757
We don't act on reason.

527
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,671
You drink too much.

528
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,711
Are you all right? I'm really sorry.

529
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,274
I'm really sorry.

530
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,670
Boss, Mr Lu insists
on seeing Luming first.

531
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,990
- What then?
- Gun him down.

532
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,559
Shoot him dead.

533
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,029
- Let me get up.
- Please don't leave.

534
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,955
You can't trap her like a thief.
Kiss her, then she'll stay.

535
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,989
- Kiss her?
- And you refuse to listen.

536
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,433
I do, I do.

537
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,679
He'll leave now.

538
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,918
I'll go and clean the car.

539
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,790
Don't touch me.

540
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,671
Lady, I am sorry.

541
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,875
Baggage in hand? Going on holiday?

542
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,351
I tried to send your letter,
but I was caught and sacked.

543
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,477
- Where's the letter?
- The manager took it.

544
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,512
- Mr Manager.
- Manager, she wants to see you.

545
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,589
Yes?

546
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,355
You have a Shanghai letter
addressed to Mrs Kao, it's mine.

547
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,032
Yours?

548
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,352
But you don't live here.
How come there's a letter for you?

549
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,192
I used your headed note paper.

550
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,358
- Kick her out.
- Mr Manager, Mr Manager...

551
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,591
I'm in dire need of the letter.
Please give it to me.

552
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,798
I was wrong to use your letterhead.
I won't do it again.

553
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,474
I won't do it again.
Please, give me my letter.

554
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,028
Stop it. Is there a letter for her?

555
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,917
There was but I returned it.

556
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,671
No, that letter was non-returnable.

557
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,318
He's taking it to the post.

558
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,469
- Madam!
- My letter, my letter!

559
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,111
Go back to work.

560
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,990
Nothing. Sorry for the disturbance.

561
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,671
Thank you.

562
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,116
- Leave now.
- Thank you.

563
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,997
Thank you very much.

564
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,431
You've fixed everything.
I'm going to have some tea downstairs.

565
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,876
Let's shake hands and be friends.

566
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,157
I don't know
if he will accept your offer.

567
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,714
I don't think he's a bad person.

568
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,909
You think you know best.
We have a proverb, even pigs can fly.

569
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,879
So where are you from?

570
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,630
Me?
The most honest of Cantonese people.

571
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,792
Remember, morning tea.

572
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,438
I'd better be going.

573
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,115
Cantonese, Shandong people,
they're all the same.

574
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,993
I'll say it once more for you.

575
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,998
Chicken George used to work on the docks.

576
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,277
I know. He has hundreds
of dockers working on the harbour.

577
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,839
He is very powerful.

578
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,713
When you see him,
don't be too humble.

579
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,952
I know, the dockers are always
delivering goods to Wan Chai.

580
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,514
What are you up to? More business?

581
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,477
You know the Black Dragons have
invited me to dinner, I have to go.

582
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,996
When he's talking to me,
can you not look at him, please?

583
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,754
Boss, I got it.
I bought the chrysanthemum.

584
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,515
- A chrysanthemum? Are you new?
- Chrysanths' are flowers too.

585
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,431
You fool, go out and clean the car.

586
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,272
A flower is a flower.

587
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,831
Hurry up. Time's short.
No flowers. They're waiting.

588
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,478
Don't be so superstitious.

589
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,718
Let's go.

590
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,031
No, no rose, no meeting.

591
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,353
I know you're looking at him.

592
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,836
I'm glad you have your own ideas.

593
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,153
Boss, we can't find Madam Kao.

594
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,879
- I was told she's sick at home.
- Sick?

595
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,753
Mr Wah, this way please.

596
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,954
Mr Wah.

597
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,638
This way.

598
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,679
OK, the flower's here. We must go.

599
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,518
I've come to buy a flower.
Are you all right?

600
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,238
Take your medicine.

601
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,475
- Has she got a temperature?
- No, she feels cold.

602
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,799
It's not the flu. This is no use.

603
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,670
Give the boss a flower.
He needs it for luck.

604
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,311
Have you ever thought of giving
others some luck? You're inhuman.

605
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,917
Get a doctor here fast.

606
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,629
Boss, doctors are useless.
She's heartbroken.

607
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,271
Tell me who did it and he's dead.
Tell me and I'll cut him to pieces.

608
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,433
Tell me, I'll see if I can help.

609
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,519
Who is this?

610
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,477
That's her daughter.

611
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,313
I don't believe it.
She's so beautiful.

612
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,038
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

613
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,157
Forget about it.

614
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,118
Stop crying.

615
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,236
- I know. Her daughter's dead.
- Shut up.

616
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,152
Go and clean the car.

617
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,915
Hey, it's time now, we must go.

618
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,353
How can we leave?

619
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,471
The dockers may be offended.

620
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,915
- Let me buy the flowers first.
- Then buy them...

621
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,233
Mr Kuo, this is for you -
to bring you and everyone luck.

622
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,277
I hope you are all lucky.

623
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,030
You should be glad
you have such a pretty daughter.

624
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,792
Where is she?

625
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,432
Any way we can help?

626
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,594
Her daughter is studying in Shanghai.
She's coming back to see her mother.

627
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,875
Wonderful.
Does she have money for the ticket?

628
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,313
I'll buy it for you.

629
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,837
She's coming with her boyfriend
and his father

630
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,515
to discuss details of their marriage.

631
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,592
Madam Kao never let her know
about the flowers.

632
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,229
She left to study at a young age.

633
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,914
She was told not to worry about money

634
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,798
because her mother
is well known in Hong Kong.

635
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,472
She said she lived at King's.

636
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,951
Now if the daughter knows the truth,
she'll be very disappointed...

637
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,556
and if the father and son know,
there would be no marriage.

638
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,119
Tell me what I can do.

639
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,997
Only you can help.

640
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,389
You are the only one.

641
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,790
You are obliged to help her
as her rose brought you good luck.

642
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,108
How can I help her?

643
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,515
Easy, send her to King's
and give her a makeover.

644
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,392
Easy to say. That takes money.

645
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,079
We've raised some money for her.

646
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,355
Here's it is.
Do you think it's enough?

647
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,392
It's OK. There's no need for that.

648
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,392
I'll do whatever you say.

649
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,394
I have to leave.

650
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,475
- No need to worry, you have me.
- I don't know how to thank you.

651
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,957
You sort it out.

652
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,070
- Why bother with this?
- It's easy. I'm glad to help.

653
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,714
- This way.
- Miss Yang, everything's set.

654
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,756
Take care of Madam Kao.

655
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,912
So beautiful.

656
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,313
- Bring the things in.
- Yes.

657
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,399
Miss Yang, is everything OK?

658
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,517
Say yes if anyone asks
if Madam Kao lives here.

659
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,353
But say you don't know
if they ask about her.

660
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,029
Madam, welcome to your new home.

661
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,432
Chen Wah, over here.

662
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,911
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Very.

663
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,228
Money buys everything.

664
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,713
I really don't know how to thank you
for all this wonderful help.

665
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,394
- Mr Kuo loves to help people, right?
- Yes.

666
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,516
Miss Yang, all your people are here.

667
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,555
Come in.

668
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,755
Please.

669
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,398
Who are they?

670
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,917
This is the beautician, the tailor,
the hairdresser. All for you.

671
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,392
Afternoon tea is ready.

672
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,200
- Who's he?
- The butler.

673
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,554
The butler?

674
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,153
Mr Kuo, this way.

675
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,879
Madam Kao deserves a butler.

676
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,915
- Uncle, we're leaving.
- Thank you.

677
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,753
- You've everything under control?
- Absolutely.

678
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,192
- What?
- We need a husband.

679
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,192
- What husband?
- She said she had one.

680
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,111
- What should we do?
- Find her one.

681
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,919
Me, find her a husband?
Where will I get one of them?

682
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,672
Don't ask me.

683
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,398
Children mean a husband.

684
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,713
A husband?

685
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,109
Don't get me involved.

686
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,515
Miss, where will I find one?

687
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,512
Miss, I have the perfect candidate.

688
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,079
- Who?
- A friend of mine.

689
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,479
Is he suitable?

690
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,120
Never mind that, get him here fast.

691
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,673
Then you stay.

692
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,278
I'll play any part for money.

693
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,478
Follow me.

694
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,708
I'd sign anything to live here.

695
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,872
Mr Kuo, this is my friend, Mr Tong.

696
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,195
From now on, he's your boss.

697
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,794
Kuo Chen Wah, Mr Kuo.

698
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,358
Haven't we met before?

699
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,793
No.

700
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,916
Go over and greet Mr Kuo.

701
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,470
- Mr Kuo, how do you do?
- How do you do?

702
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,074
- I did meet you some time ago.
- Impossible.

703
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,514
Thank you. Gentlemen, Madam Kao.

704
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,158
She's your wife.

705
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,390
Don't be nervous. Relax.

706
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,115
Mr Kuo.

707
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,910
When are you going to introduce me?

708
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,039
Miss Yang,
this is the husband, Mr Tong.

709
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:07,309
You? Come here,
let's see you together. Not bad.

710
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,628
I just need clothes.

711
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,995
Have you finished yet?

712
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,390
- Luming, all done. Can I go?
- You may.

713
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,357
- We're leaving.
- Go home first.

714
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,232
You can't go just yet.

715
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,390
What? Is there anything else?

716
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,349
- We're meeting the ship tomorrow.
- I don't need to be there.

717
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,998
See this thing through.

718
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,037
- Right.
- OK, you can go now.

719
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,395
- Let's talk it over.
- Tea over there.

720
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,074
Why are you staring?
It's only Madam Kao.

721
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,116
I remember who he is.

722
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,718
I know who you are.

723
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,879
Let bygones be bygones.
I am the husband now.

724
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,518
- What is it now?
- Nothing.

725
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,474
What's the matter?

726
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,835
Nothing, I saved him once.

727
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,797
Let's have some tea.

728
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,039
The ship's docked, boss.

729
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,473
Hurry up.

730
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,033
We're all up front.

731
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,634
- What will Belle say?
- She will be delighted.

732
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,029
- I owe it all to you.
- It was nothing.

733
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,348
She's docking.

734
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,232
She's arrived.

735
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,033
Have you got it?

736
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,277
"Welcome, Mr Wong"

737
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,432
- Why is it so small?
- I was late back.

738
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,671
- Should have used a business card!
- Why are you late?

739
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,069
There's a bigger sign over there!

740
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,389
- There's someone else meeting Wong.
- If you can so can they.

741
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,994
Madam Kao is well known.

742
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,356
We can't let them meet her
or we'll be finished.

743
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,034
- What now?
- What now?

744
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,953
- We mustn't let them meet.
- Tell them to leave.

745
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,989
He bumped into me!

746
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,514
Remember, he's my teacher's
old friend, so behave yourself.

747
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,518
I couldn't get rid of them.
It's Inspector Ho.

748
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,113
You sort it out.

749
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,199
- Inspector you must listen.
- What is it?

750
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,430
Do you want to know
what Tiger is up to?

751
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,953
- What?
- Not here.

752
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,191
- In the station.
- I've come to meet the ship.

753
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,430
My information will be useless later.

754
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,077
Then tell me now.

755
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,593
I told you, not here.

756
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,272
Whisper it in my ear, then.

757
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,112
Forget about it.

758
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,951
- All fixed?
- Yes, taken care of.

759
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,032
- You two, follow me.
- OK.

760
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,589
Robbery!

761
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,429
He touched me up.

762
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,073
Don't get involved.
Hold up the banner.

763
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,118
Nobody's molesting you.

764
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,999
Hey, what a coincidence!

765
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,389
- How's the kid?
- Fine. What brings you here?

766
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,913
I'm looking for a fight.

767
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,438
- Where is Ma's money?
- I sent it.

768
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,509
You have?

769
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,431
Stop fighting!

770
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,112
Hit him!

771
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,316
Hit him! Hit him!

772
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,197
Go over there and kill him.

773
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,477
It's none of our business.
Hold the banner. Higher.

774
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,234
- Is Chief Inspector Ho here?
- That's me.

775
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,039
So it's you. You piece of shit!

776
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,638
- Why are you two up to?
- We're meeting the ship.

777
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,711
Not any more. After him!

778
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,476
Don't let him get away!

779
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,475
- Can you see her?
- No.

780
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,754
Do you recognise her?

781
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
There are so many people.

782
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,949
- Do you recognise her?
- I only saw her photo. I don't know.

783
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,275
- Can you see her?
- No.

784
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,959
Can you see her?

785
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,433
Belle.

786
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,712
- Belle!
- Mum! Mum!

787
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,399
That's Belle, my daughter, up there.

788
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,036
I see my mother. She's down there.

789
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,599
OK, OK, let's go.

790
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,636
- Which one is she?
- I'm not sure.

791
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,312
My dear daughter, she's back.

792
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,517
- Where is she?
- I'm not sure.

793
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,270
- Which one is she?
- I don't know.

794
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,557
Can you see?

795
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,359
I heard Mr Wong is very rich.

796
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,192
Take plenty of photos.

797
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,710
- What's that about?
- I'm not sure.

798
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,599
- Boss, boss.
- Let him go. What's the matter?

799
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,148
Two reporters have come
to interview Wong.

800
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,229
Reporters?

801
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,356
- Tie them up.
- OK.

802
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,272
That's against the law.

803
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,994
- We're detectives.
- What are you doing here?

804
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,197
We're reporters.
We've come to interview Mr Wong.

805
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,431
- We'd like a word.
- But the passengers are coming.

806
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,318
- We're not asking.
- Come or take a voluntary holiday.

807
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,550
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

808
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,273
Do I look all right?

809
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,713
You look fine.

810
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,394
Mum!

811
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,149
Belle!

812
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,350
Look, you did a good thing there.

813
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,158
This is just the beginning.

814
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,320
This is your stepfather.

815
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,114
- Introduce us to your friends.
- Right.

816
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,590
This is Mr Wong Hsin-chuan.

817
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,672
- Mr Wong, we've heard about you.
- This is my son.

818
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,512
How are you?

819
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,319
Thank you for looking after Belle.

820
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,631
It's she who looks after me.

821
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,678
It's too noisy here.
Let's go back to the hotel.

822
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,193
And this is?

823
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,430
- This is her cousin.
- Right, right.

824
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,715
- An Uncle on my mother's side.
- Uncle.

825
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,758
- This is my wife.
- Auntie.

826
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,513
Mummy, you never mentioned
this cousin before.

827
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,999
He was the black sheep in the family.
Marriage changed all that.

828
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,720
Mr Wong, Mr Wong,
let's go back to the hotel.

829
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,431
I'm meeting other friends here.

830
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,478
I've told everyone
to go to the hotel.

831
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,915
Let's go.

832
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,628
- Uncle?!
- Why weren't you introduced?

833
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,153
I'll start the car.

834
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,750
If you don't get a pay rise,
it could mean exploitation.

835
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,877
Exploitation makes you feel worthless
and that can lead to suicide.

836
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,872
Suicide means you're gone.
What do you think so far?

837
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,633
The missing reporters
are valuable employees.

838
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,950
I am your boss Laughton's old friend.

839
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,589
Stupid conjecture may lead
to your job disappearing!

840
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,158
I'm sorry, I just wanted to get
some background information on them.

841
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,078
Trying to put pressure on me.
I've a job to do.

842
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,193
Divide this.

843
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,396
- Miss Yang.
- Miss Yang.
