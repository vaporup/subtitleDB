1
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,267
Listen Hyuga.

2
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,411
Why don't you come to Tangou?

3
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,015
What?

4
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,353
It's my hometown.

5
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:24,285
We'll have Azumi come, too.

6
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:34,236
Tangou?

7
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:56,157
Sorry, Yae. I may not be
able to come to Tangou.

8
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,464
I thought this smell was familiar.

9
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:14,004
I guess my sense of smell
is as sharp as a dog's.

10
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,709
Who are you?

11
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:22,479
Me? I'm Bijomaru Mogami.

12
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,157
We just finished off three guys,
now a newcomer.

13
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:33,189
I hate to break up such a nice
romantic scene, but I want you to die.

14
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:36,527
She has nothing to do with us.
Let her go.

15
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:37,931
Sorry, no.

16
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:43,869
Being slashed before the girl you like
and exposing your misery

17
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,737
will increase your pain
and suffering all the more.

18
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:48,936
What did you say?

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,646
Have you ever thought of
yourself being slashed?

20
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:59,955
Blood comes gushing out.
No matter how much you endure,

21
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,692
it's useless, you know
you are going to die.

22
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:08,127
You want to die quickly, but you can't.
What will you think then?

23
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:16,036
One sword is broken.

24
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:20,437
That's no good.
Saru, loan your sword to him.

25
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,112
It's no fun slaying an enemy
who is not properly armed.

26
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:28,008
Don't worry.
We have no business with the girl.

27
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:55,744
I would be offended if you blame your
defeat on fighting with only one sword.

28
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:00,679
Do you know why this sword
does not have a hand guard?

29
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,183
I never defend. I will
immobilize you with one blow.

30
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,126
I was also taught to do as much.

31
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,193
I am totally thrilled!

32
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,654
You are quite quick.

33
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:10,215
But you failed to notice that
you are cut?

34
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:07,629
Don't come! Run!

35
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:16,942
Don't move! Stay and watch!
If you run, I will kil you.

36
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:24,016
It hurts, right?
Do you want to die quickly?

37
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,455
I won't let you die so easily.

38
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:42,870
Enough of that. The fight is over.

39
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,801
Monkey-face!

40
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,679
If you spoil my fun,
you will die, too.

41
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:55,650
Go ahead
Your bad taste creeps me out.

42
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:06,830
Hyuga!

43
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:15,535
Pity to leave her on her own.

44
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,732
Bijomaru!

45
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:25,708
What significance is there to kill
a girl who has nothing to do with this?

46
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:30,244
What significance is there to live,
anyway?

47
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,253
Shall we go?

48
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,196
The next one better be stronger!

49
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:46,002
If not, then I will fight against you!
You got that, Monkey-face?

50
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,673
He fought master fully.

51
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:20,197
We'll wait for Nagato here.

52
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:21,829
Yes.

53
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:47,353
He said you were sweet.

54
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,924
He wanted to stay with you
a bit longer.

55
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,202
Hyuga truly liked you.

56
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,340
What will you do now?

57
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,149
Will you seek revenge?

58
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,721
The friend of your enemy
will come to kill you.

59
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:50,758
A never-ending story. Will you
continue to kill each other forever?

60
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,736
There are many evil people in the world.
Someone has to kill them.

61
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:11,440
It doesn't have to be you.
Someone else can take care of it.

62
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:35,499
Frightenly good swordsman...
he's already killed one assassin.

63
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:43,405
But I can hardly like him.
In fact, I hate him.

64
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:51,121
Don't be so harsh. Saru,
I want you to do something.

65
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:55,089
The final showdown will be in Gamo.

66
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:08,329
- I wonder how they are doing.
- They are dead.

67
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:13,802
That's not true.
They will definitely come.

68
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,990
Master Gessai,

69
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,154
Kiyomasa is heading for Gamo.

70
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,656
Gamo?

71
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,730
It's a ship
He plans to leave Gamo by ship.

72
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,269
We must get him in Gamo, on land.

73
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:56,539
But the enemy is aware of our moves.
They won't sit still.

74
00:12:56,714 --> 00:13:02,812
I know. We have no choice
but to start the attack.

75
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:06,787
Take these.
They might be of use at some point.

76
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,886
- Great!
- Be careful.

77
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:14,697
If they explode too close to you,
you'll be blown to bits.

78
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,292
Don't touch me!

79
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,225
Farewell.

80
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:54,971
I am counting on you.

81
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:48,384
You have a beautiful face.
How much is your ass?

82
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,213
You want to die that much?

83
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,321
Don't kill our allies recklessly.

84
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,625
Money!

85
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,560
Do you want more money?

86
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,637
We need your help.

87
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:41,702
You guys help us a little, and
more money and rewards will be yours.

88
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,161
Look, when we cross those mountains,
it'll only take 5 days to reach Tangou.

89
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:08,232
I see.

90
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:13,737
You will get to see your
mother soon, Yae.

91
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:22,376
Mother...

92
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:28,616
You don't know your mother?

93
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,523
Ever since I was little,
I've been with Master and everyone.

94
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:48,509
- Put this on.
- Girl's clothing.

95
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:55,246
I prefer this. This is more convenient
for hiding my swords.

96
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:57,218
You are a girl.

97
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:00,323
- I'm-
- Girls don't talk like that!

98
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,379
Stay still!

99
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,920
There we go.

100
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,173
You look beautiful.

101
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,918
Don't say that!

102
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,491
Azumi.

103
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,368
The swords don't suit you.

104
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:38,612
I don't want to see another person die.

105
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,555
Kiyomasa is in the mansion.
Let's go.

106
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:58,897
Master!

107
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,948
Okay, spread out!

108
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,529
I won't let you get away!

109
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,406
My nose is that of a dog's.

110
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,076
It's me, assholes!

111
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,456
That bastard.

112
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,463
I'll get him.

113
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,389
It's incredible you made it this far.

114
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,656
Why won't you finish him off?

115
00:25:57,157 --> 00:26:00,251
If I kill him, he won't be of any
use to us as bait.

116
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,255
Did you say bait?

117
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:10,367
A few more assassins need
to be killed.

118
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,087
Master!

119
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,591
Ukiha!

120
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:23,258
Run, run away.
Wait for the next opportunity!

121
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:27,897
Run away, I want you to
complete your mission.

122
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,214
What are you doing? Run away quickly.

123
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,854
Don't worry about me. Go, go!

124
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,020
Run!

125
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:45,461
Smells nice.

126
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,505
Be quiet.

127
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,815
How fortunate we are on
a mountain like this.

128
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:07,682
Which one should I pick?

129
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,193
Stop it.

130
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:20,858
Stop it? Okay, I'll stop it. I pick you.
Taro, I'll give you this one.

131
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:38,466
No matter how much I try to escape...

132
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,576
...I can't avoid it.

133
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,012
Even if I don't want to kill...

134
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,348
...I am forced to kill.

135
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,014
You bitch!

136
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,307
I'm sorry, Yae...

137
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,989
I have no...

138
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,024
...choice but this.

139
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:38,934
If it weren't for Master,
I would never have lived.

140
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:09,798
He will protect you.

141
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,903
He always will.

142
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,283
I am going to wait for you.

143
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:36,019
I'll be waiting for you in Tangou.

144
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:27,206
If you hadn't been injured,
our fight would have been more fun.

145
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:38,681
It's a pity I can't stay and fight
your assassins.

146
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:48,659
Saru, I'll leave the rest to you.

147
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,811
Assassins are not going to show up
no matter how long we wait.

148
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,321
Such heavy security
for a few assassins.

149
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:18,826
General Kanbei is too cautious.
I'll be back.

150
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,229
Hey wait a minute.
You just took a break a while ago.

151
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,769
It's my turn now.

152
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,239
Let's decide with this.

153
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,312
- I'll bet on tails.
- Then I'll bet on heads.

154
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:22,817
I hear the strongest one
is still alive.

155
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,959
I can't wait.

156
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,800
Hey old man,
are you still alive?

157
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,441
Stop it.

158
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:54,652
You annoy me constantly.

159
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,935
Are you ready to die now?

160
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:24,922
Do you really think someone will come
and rescue a dying old man like you?

161
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:29,288
Huh, old man?

162
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:32,991
She's already here.

163
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:27,750
Azumi.

164
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:29,821
Don't come! Don't!

165
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:38,353
No, you must come.
Otherwise, he will die.

166
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,925
Damn you!

167
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:38,400
Wow! Incredible,
she is just incredible

168
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:39,563
Hey! Samurai bastards!
Who are you aiming at?

169
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:43,767
Damn it, who do you think we are?

170
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:48,108
Just because you're Samurai,
don't act so damned important.

171
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:52,172
This is bullshit!
This is our town!

172
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:55,480
Never mind about her, let's get them!

173
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:27,646
This is getting to be fun!

174
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,820
What the hell is your problem?

175
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:37,852
This fire ball will blow
everyone up into pieces.

176
00:48:19,932 --> 00:48:22,730
Let's ignite this!

177
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:25,635
Oh, no...

178
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:16,073
I am delighted.
No one is left to disturb us.

179
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:04,493
How splendid!
I didn't even scratch you.

180
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:25,244
This is the first time I've had
to defend.

181
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:26,873
You are wonderful.

182
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,192
Why not die?

183
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:43,909
Master.

184
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:56,618
It's over. Everything is over.

185
00:54:59,331 --> 00:55:03,825
Ukiha and Nagara are both dead.

186
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,672
But I'm still here.

187
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:18,406
There is no further mission
that you need to pursue.

188
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:32,125
From now on, live as you wish.
Survive and keep on living.

189
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,792
Master,
I don't know what to do without you.

190
00:55:40,238 --> 00:55:44,641
You never used to cry.

191
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,879
It's so quiet.

192
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,230
Master.

193
00:56:15,507 --> 00:56:16,997
Master.

194
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,405
No, don't.

195
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,813
Master!

196
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:10,688
Where do the stars go during the day?

197
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:21,701
Time to eat!
Let's go!

198
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,779
The stars are always there.

199
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:41,454
You can't see them during the day,

200
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:45,687
but the stars are always watching
over us from up above the sky.

201
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:55,606
Even if we get separated one day,
we will always be together.

202
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,244
I'll be watching over you at all times.

203
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,045
Kanbei.

204
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:20,682
It's been a stimulating journey.

205
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:27,221
Saru is not back yet.
We can't let our guard down.

206
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:37,498
I can't be scared of assassins!
When it's time to die, you die.

207
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,175
Don't worry.

208
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:52,784
Lord, you won't die so easily.
Your luck is too strong.

209
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:54,748
Kanbei,

210
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,957
the time has come for war.

211
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,726
That stupid old Ieyasu...

212
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:05,831
we will blow him up into pieces.

213
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:23,249
You have done well in protecting me.

214
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:25,686
Once we get home,

215
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:29,485
I'll take you to
a hot spring for some rest.

216
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,736
Masterful!

217
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:54,850
Lord!

218
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:48,455
Nagara.

219
01:03:51,863 --> 01:03:53,956
What are you doing?

220
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:18,718
We are the only two left.

221
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:23,187
What shall we do now?

222
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:34,863
Nagamasa Asano, Kiyomasa Kato...
the next tar get is Masayuki Sanada.

223
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,942
This time, we'll probably be killed.

224
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:44,506
We are not going to die.

225
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,113
We will survive.

226
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:50,718
Everyone is with us.

227
01:04:58,362 --> 01:04:59,659
Let's go.
