1
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,110
It's you again, Nagara.
Get yourseIf together!

2
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,177
Damn!

3
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,256
You use your muscle to
swing your sword,

4
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,858
so you give in to
the weight of the sword.

5
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,492
Learn from Azumi. The strength comes
not from muscIe, but from speed!

6
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,061
Where is Azumi?

7
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,896
Oh yeah, she's not here.
She was just her e a while ago.

8
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,566
Yeah, she often disappears.

9
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,271
Azumi! Azumi!

10
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:37,527
AZUMI

11
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:46,034
I wonder how far this sky goes.

12
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:59,481
It'll be any day now when we cross that
mountain and enter the outside world.

13
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:04,620
That's right. We are going to
pursue our mission then.

14
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,728
Excellent...

15
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,233
Yes, we are always going
to stick together.

16
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,363
Can't wait to leave this
mountain and raise some heIl!

17
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,066
I can't see any stars.

18
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,738
Of course you can't.
It's still daytime.

19
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,712
Stars only come out at night.

20
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:31,151
Then where are they during the day?

21
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,488
Time to eat!

22
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,735
I'm starving.

23
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,912
We're starving!

24
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,186
Master, isn't this a bit overcooked?

25
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,989
Fresh water fish tastes better
when it's burnt like this.

26
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,655
- Nagara.
- Yes, Master.

27
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,858
You're soaking wet.
What happened to you?

28
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,233
We were training in
underwater combat.

29
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,033
Master, he lost again today.

30
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,631
- He fell into the river.
- He lost and fell into the river.

31
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,007
Skip your meal today.

32
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,812
No food, no mission,
you have no chance.

33
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,714
- What do you mean, fools?
- Hey, stop.

34
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,950
Let's get him.

35
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,658
Hey, let's eat.

36
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,128
- Come, hurry up.
- Ouch, that hurts.

37
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,694
Lately I'm beginning to see
who's the strongest.

38
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,202
Either Nachi or Azumi are
number 1 and 2...

39
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,467
Azumi is fast, and Nachi is strong.

40
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,775
Ukiha and Hyuga are an even 3;

41
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,979
the rest of us are more or less the same.

42
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,881
I think I am one of the strongest,
wouldn't you all agree?

43
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,117
Hey, is that your only response?

44
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,824
Nachi, that looks cool.

45
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,764
Good luck charm,
is it supposed to work?

46
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,541
Something like this only works
for someone who believes in it.

47
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,669
Then it won't work for me.

48
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,045
Yeah, welI, you're a monkey.

49
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,413
I don't want to hear that from a
frog-face like you.

50
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,483
He's a frog, a frog!

51
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,179
We are going to leave this mountain.

52
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,447
Leave? This Mountain?

53
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,827
Do you really mean it, Master?

54
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:58,466
At last, the time has come for us
to carry out our mission.

55
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,400
Yes.

56
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,146
Finaly, we'll all get to
carry out our mission.

57
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
Is this your son?

58
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:24,347
Our Lord Tokugawa won the war,
yet all this misery is left behind.

59
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,086
It's time we put an end to such wars.

60
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:37,664
We must try everything possible
to build a peaceful nation.

61
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:47,403
I doubt very much that the
Toyotomi Allies will retreat now.

62
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:53,510
Most likely this conflict and chaos
will continue for some time to come.

63
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,348
Unless we eradicate ambitious warlords
trying to take over the nation,

64
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,558
we will never see any peace here.

65
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,325
Gessai.

66
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,702
Assassins are the answer.

67
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,069
Train a group of master assassins
and have them exterminate

68
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,577
every single warlord who intends
to cause conflict.

69
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:33,649
Priest Tenkai, I, Gessai, swear on
my life to accomplish your wish.

70
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:03,581
Azumi, wake everyone up
and bring them to the clearing.

71
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:27,476
I had acknowledged your potential
when you were yet very young,

72
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,547
and have trained and brought up
all ten of you.

73
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,686
Your skills in the martial arts
already exceed

74
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,690
by far those of warriors
in the outside world.

75
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:51,969
The time has finally come for you
to go to the outside world,

76
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,266
unknown to you since you
were brought here,

77
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,603
and use your skills to
perform your duty.

78
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,445
You all grew up and trained together,

79
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:07,185
thus you all know one another truly
well and have strong bonds.

80
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:17,695
Now, make a team of two
with the one you like best.

81
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,754
Azumi.

82
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,339
Are you done?

83
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,143
Listen to me well.

84
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,408
The mission that will be given
to you from this moment on

85
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,354
will be most severe and rigorous.

86
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:48,052
An assassin is unable to
choose whom to kill.

87
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,426
Depending on your mission,
sometimes you must kill a child,

88
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,524
or a great and respected person.

89
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:03,139
The way of the assassin is to have a
mind of steel and to become inhuman:

90
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:09,675
thus, I give you this final test.

91
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,675
Slay each other.

92
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,017
Slay your teammate.

93
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,890
Kill!

94
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,896
The one who loses this fight
and loses his life has no aptitude

95
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,369
to pursue the mission that
lies ahead of us.

96
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,469
The weak-minded one who
can't kill his friend

97
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,175
will not be able to pursue
his mission either.

98
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,511
The winners of this fight
should terminate their counterpart

99
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,640
and come back to the hut.

100
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,375
Should you think of escaping
without fighting,

101
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,350
you must know that you
cannot survive.

102
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,225
Begin!

103
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,655
It's Master's order.

104
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,829
We have no choice.

105
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,665
Nagara! Come!

106
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,403
I want to pursue my mission.

107
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,876
I trust that you do, too.

108
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,476
Nachi.

109
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,259
One of us will be left alive
and pursue our mission.

110
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,129
Nachi.

111
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,513
Nachi, don't do it!

112
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,250
Azumi. This is our destiny.

113
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,851
Get ready!

114
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,393
Azumi...

115
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,672
You have become really strong.

116
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,132
Nachi.

117
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,906
Take this...

118
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,841
This is crazy!

119
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,055
Why?

120
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,069
Why?

121
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,942
Why?

122
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,053
I don't know why either.

123
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,250
But if we try as hard now as they would
have tried in pursuing our mission,

124
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,923
their deaths won't be in vain,
right, Master?

125
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,887
So this is a village.

126
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,758
Master.

127
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,828
Aren't we going to help?

128
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,538
- Master.
- Don't move, don't get involved!

129
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,546
How come? We can easily
get rid of them.

130
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,619
You have an important mission.

131
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,285
This is no time to be mixed up
in a trifling matter.

132
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,109
They will all be massacred.

133
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,977
Don't draw your sword unless
it is your mission to do so.

134
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,952
Isn't it our mission to slay those
kinds of bad guys?

135
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,184
Master!

136
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:43,230
Why, why not? Why, Master?
Why couldn't we kill them?

137
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,141
Merely kiling a hundred bandits
will not change this nation.

138
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,560
As always, well done.

139
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,833
These kids have grown up
to be pretty sharp.

140
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,208
What's going on?

141
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,577
I brought a letter from Priest Tenkai.

142
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,068
<i>Guys, good luck.</i>

143
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,801
Who was that?

144
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,504
He is a Ninja called Nagato.

145
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,010
Throughout this grave mission,
he will be in and out,

146
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,951
but always moving along with us.

147
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,980
What does it say?

148
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,087
"The following three warlords
Nagamasa Asano, Kiyomasa Kato"

149
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,756
"and Masayuki Sanada will not
regard the battle"

150
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:52,269
"of Sekigahara as the ultimate
defeat of the Toyotomi."

151
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,797
"They claim the young prince, Hideyori,"

152
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,842
"to be the true loyal successor
to the head of the nation."

153
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,468
"They press for the leadership
of the nation to be"

154
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,412
"returned to Toyotomi
once he becomes an adult."

155
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:09,351
"These three are dangerous rebels
who will harm Togugawa."

156
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,488
"They should be eliminated."

157
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,201
Hey, girl. What are you doing?

158
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:26,766
Stop right there.

159
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,572
It's a young girl on her own.

160
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,480
It's okay.

161
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,915
Yes, sir.

162
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,219
What a pretty girl she is, isn't she?

163
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,933
What are you doing?

164
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:01,499
Can't you see what I'm doing?
I'm fishing.

165
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,405
Fishing?

166
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,274
Haven't you ever fished?

167
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:24,158
Oh, I see, you have never gone fishing.

168
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,127
Fishing is fun.

169
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,967
And, when I am fishing like this,

170
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,907
I can for get about all of the terrible
things that go on in this country.

171
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:44,775
Moreover,
if you catch a big fish like this,

172
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,750
you can boast for the rest of your life.

173
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:54,584
Furthermore, a couple of fish from
this pond will make you full.

174
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:01,156
So you are hungry,
and you want to eat a fish.

175
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,647
This is how you catch a fish.

176
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,659
What the hell's she doing?

177
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,792
Kill him now!

178
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:41,201
That's enough. Let's go!

179
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:48,642
Well, you are very amusing.
What is your name?

180
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,777
Azumi.

181
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:53,910
What's yours?

182
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,987
Girl, you'd better watch
how you talk to our lord.

183
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:05,493
My name is Nagamasa.
Nagamasa Asano is my name.

184
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:15,033
You are the one that wants
to start another war.

185
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,696
Why?

186
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,771
Such a young girl.

187
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,941
What a pity.

188
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:56,106
I feel sorry for you...

189
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,758
Are you sure about that?

190
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:25,974
Yes, sir. Asano clan is concealing the
fact, but Nagamasa was assassinated.

191
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:35,575
All of the guards were killed.
How did they do that?

192
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,456
Who are these assassins?

193
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,293
They must be of the Ieyasu clan.

194
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,655
Lord...

195
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,398
If I may say so,

196
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,498
we do not have any proof
that they are of the Ieyasu clan.

197
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,133
Proof?

198
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:09,248
Ever since Ieyasu won the victory over
the Ishida Forces in Sekigahara,

199
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,656
Ieyasu has been acting as though he has
the whole nation under his thumb.

200
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,556
The regime belongs to
our prince Hideyori Toyotomi.

201
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:29,737
Nagamasa, Masayuki Sanada
and I had pressed him

202
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:35,840
to return the regime to prince Hideyori.

203
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:47,985
The result is Nagamasa's assassination.
I am next on the list.

204
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:55,229
I am quite aware of that.
Please remain cautious, my Lord.

205
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,425
What?

206
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:07,034
This talk of proof and caution, Kanbei,
what happened to your warrior's way?

207
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:20,383
Kanbei, it will be too late
once my head is cut off.

208
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:26,524
I, Kanbei, will not die after you,
my Lord.

209
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:34,836
I, Kiyomasa Kato, am not
intimidated by any enemy.

210
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,940
Ieyasu is a stupid fool.

211
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,775
If all the warlords of the Toyotomi side
unite to fight against Ieyasu,

212
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,977
he doesn't stand a chance.

213
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,719
I am troubled
with a temperamental boss.

214
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,588
- Saru.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,164
We'll let them kill our Lord.

216
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,339
Azumi!

217
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,763
It's a signal. They got Kiyomasa!

218
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,994
Okay, let's go.

219
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,396
They would be happy up in heaven for us.

220
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:29,902
But Master, they weren't tough at all.

221
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,368
Those slowpokes were no match for us.

222
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,703
It's not that they weren't tough,
it's that you are too strong.

223
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,672
That's why you can't easily show
your strength outside of our mission.

224
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:47,316
That Ninja who looked like a monkey,
he was funny, wasn't he?

225
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:52,352
Ninja? Has anyone received
any cut from their weapons?

226
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,694
Master, there's no way any
Ninja can get us.

227
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,790
Ninja or any other, no one will
be our match.

228
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,663
Right.

229
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,636
But be careful, Ninjas daub
poison on their weapons.

230
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,831
Poison?

231
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,541
Even if it's just a pinch of poison,
it may take your life.

232
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:12,281
Oh, man, that's scary
Hey, Azumi, are you alright?

233
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,575
What's the matter, Azumi?

234
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:21,623
I was wondering if that Nagamasa
we killed the other day,

235
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,153
and this guy today,
are they truly bad guys?

236
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,422
What are you talking about?
What's gotten into you?

237
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,330
But we don't know a thing about
the guy we killed.

238
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:35,632
He must have friends like we do.

239
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,832
No time for silly nonsense, Azumi.

240
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:42,503
They have to be bad guys, otherwise,
why would we have to kill them.

241
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,347
Right, Master?

242
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,411
No need to ask such a question.
Enough of this nonsense.

243
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,122
- Have a mind of steel.
- Be quiet!

244
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,324
Just eat!

245
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:08,031
We have completed our mission.
I'm going to take a piss, then.

246
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,787
Well done in finding a double
who looked exactly like me.

247
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,467
Can you kill those assassins next time?

248
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,173
Definitely, my Lord.

249
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,786
Kanbei...

250
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:50,705
It amuses me to see your failure,
but the fun is over now.

251
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,589
Saru...

252
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,619
Yes, sir.

253
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,755
We will start the attack this time.

254
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,024
It hurts

255
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,110
I made a hole.

256
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,052
That's cool!

257
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,850
Big brother,
you're very strong.

258
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,927
- You're not so bad yourself.
- I know.

259
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,458
Right everyone, right?
Hey old man...

260
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:30,737
Listen big brother, I think I should
open a hole in the left,

261
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,773
that would look awesome.

262
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,675
You dumb ass! If you keep
doing stupid things like that,

263
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,507
mom will get angry.

264
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,509
No, I am scared of our mom.

265
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,348
- She is scary!
- I'm scared of our mom.

266
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,122
Watch your step.
It's slippery with blood.

267
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,826
- I'm back you guys.
- You're back.

268
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,034
I brought a client.
He got a job for us.

269
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,370
Brother, he looks like a monkey.

270
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:12,573
- Oh, oh, he got mad.
- So, what's the job?

271
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,355
As a matter of principle,
I don't read letters.

272
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,159
These are horrible assassins.

273
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:35,068
As soon as you find them,
kill them without a word.

274
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,663
It reads like that.

275
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,203
This is the drawing.

276
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,616
Sorry, they're a bit slow.

277
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,251
This girl is cute.

278
00:49:52,356 --> 00:50:04,291
So, one girl, one old man, guys,
one, two, three, four...

279
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,164
...that's it?

280
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:11,638
Don't underestimate them.
They are tough, very tough.

281
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,336
We, Sajiki brothers,

282
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,346
have nothing to complain about
if we can kil and make some money.

283
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,628
She is very beautiful.

284
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,441
Oh, look over there.

285
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,973
Master, can we go take a look?

286
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,943
Yes, go and have some fun.

287
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,593
That was great.

288
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,735
Yes, thank you, thank you.

289
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,148
My name is Hyuga.

290
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,978
I am Yae.

291
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,243
Great.

292
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,048
- You guys are better than us.
- Please, join our troupe.

293
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,052
Have you trained yourself
since you were little?

294
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,612
Yeah, you can call it training.

295
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,624
Hyuga, are you guys performers?

296
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:22,422
No, but we've been living
up in the mountain, so we are flexible.

297
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,596
I see. We've also been doing this
ever since we coud remember,

298
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,170
but we're not as good as you.

299
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,533
Since you could remember?

300
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,402
Yes.

301
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,473
That's just like us.

302
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,711
This is beautiful.

303
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,917
It's from a foreign country.

304
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:46,748
A foreign country?

305
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,985
Yes, beyond the ocean.

306
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:55,592
Come on, pack up quickly.
The sun will go down soon.

307
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,961
Yes, boss.

308
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,928
Are you leaving?

309
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,905
We are leaving tomorrow at noon.
We are traveling performers.

310
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,807
If we perform the same act in the
same place, we won't have an audience.

311
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:13,181
No, I'll come tomorrow,
and every day after that, to see you.

312
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:20,122
Thank you. But I have been living
like this since I was little.

313
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,223
Stay well.

314
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,263
I'll see you again someplace.

315
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,009
Come on.

316
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,718
Hyuga, let's go.

317
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,460
How are the Sajiki brothers?

318
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:06,825
The Sajiki brothers are
chasing the assassins.

319
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,732
They've confirmed the
whereabouts of the enemy.

320
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:18,576
I have little confidence in those dim
- witted brothers to kill the assassins.

321
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:29,385
I know. Those Sajiki brothers
are just meant to be the first attack.

322
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:40,598
Saru, go to the prison
in Nishikawa.

323
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,406
You mean to get that guy out?

324
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,072
Eye for an eye.
Poison for poison.

325
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,085
Amagi, Hyuga, time to wake up.

326
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,819
Get up.

327
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,999
Oh no, I slept in.

328
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,074
Master, can I go out for a while?

329
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,006
Where to?

330
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,204
I want to see the street
performers one more time.

331
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,439
Oh, that sweet one.

332
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,718
I think I can learn from her
movement for my technique.

333
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,445
Don't fall for a girl in a
traveling company.

334
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,851
Shut up!

335
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,386
Well, Master, may I go?

336
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,189
We're leaving at noon.
Come back by then.

337
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,931
- I'll go with you, too.
- Me, too.

338
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,264
Amagi, aren't you coming?

339
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,736
They are in a playful mood.
Are you sure it's okay, Master?

340
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:02,383
Hey, Amagi, wake up!
How long do you need to sleep?

341
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,843
I thought we were to meet
tomorrow evening.

342
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,248
Things don't look good.

343
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:33,280
What?

344
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:38,215
They killed Kiyomasa's double
and not Kiyomasa himself.

345
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:43,721
The enemy is onto us.
They've sent a party of pursuers.

346
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,362
Master, what's wrong?

347
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,404
We've been deceived.

348
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,766
What?

349
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:03,002
Kiyomasa is still alive.
We killed his double.

350
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,513
Go get everyone.
We are leaving at once.

351
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,755
Amagi, I've been
telling you to get up.

352
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,836
Amagi, what's wrong?

353
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,610
Why didn't you say anything?

354
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,523
- They are gone.
- Oh well.

355
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,062
Hyuga!

356
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,154
Yae was so sweet.

357
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,191
You're fond of Yae, aren't you?

358
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,027
I wanted to spend a little more
time with her.

359
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,035
I finally met someone I liked.

360
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,576
They may not be too far yet.

361
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,181
Let's go. Come

362
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:51,015
Oh that's it! Let's look for them.
Come on, let's go.

363
00:59:52,322 --> 01:00:02,721
I'm sorry, Master.
I can still do it. Our mission...

364
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,426
Enough. Don't talk.

365
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:20,207
I messed up. I swore I would work...
as much as all of our dead comrades.

366
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,215
They were a lot of fun.

367
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,413
Yae, I know who you like.

368
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,881
Who? Azumi?

369
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,858
No, I am talking about the guy.

370
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,125
What are you talking about?

371
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:36,323
You can't hide it.
I know these things very well.

372
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:42,331
Even if you fall in love, he's a
traveler and so are we.

373
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,301
You'll never see him again.
Such romances don't stand a chance.

374
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,750
Are these them?

375
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,354
The ages are right on the mark.

376
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,057
And there is an old man too.

377
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:07,462
One, two, three, one two three, one...

378
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,058
Aren't there too many?

379
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,893
There are more girls,
and not enough boys.

380
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:19,470
A rough count will do.
By the way, do you see them?

381
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,940
These girls are incredible.

382
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:31,517
No two ways about it,
they are the assassins.

383
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,857
- They don't look like the drawing.
- A rough resemblance will do.

384
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:40,018
Excuse me, sirs.
What can we do for you?

385
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,777
Where are you going.

386
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,257
Where are you headed?

387
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,233
You're cute.

388
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:31,774
Come, I won't do anything.
You sure are pretty.

389
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,343
What's your name?

390
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,116
Tell me your name.

391
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,991
Let me touch you a little.

392
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,364
Get this out of the way.

393
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:18,157
Damn, brother.
What a waste.

394
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,627
Nisai, don't you go too far.

395
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,570
Don't waste your life.

396
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,697
Don't come near me.

397
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,582
Give it back.

398
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:49,481
You scared me.

399
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,755
Stay back.

400
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,200
They look like the assassins too.

401
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,568
That's them, brother.

402
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:12,910
She is cute.

403
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:18,344
Are you pursuing us?

404
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,648
Yes. You're getting the idea.

405
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:33,394
They have nothing to do with us!

406
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:40,067
We kill whoever we like...

407
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,808
Oh, I see.

408
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,779
Then you have no
complaints if you get killed.

409
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,584
You are gorgeous.

410
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,054
You fool!

411
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,028
Hyuga!

412
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,231
You are truly cute.

413
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,171
That hurts!

414
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,809
It's not over, yet!

415
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,857
Now you got me.

416
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,119
Saru.

417
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,851
I have a job for you.

418
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:14,291
If you accept my offer, then all of
your past crimes will be for gotten.

419
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:28,974
If you get me out of here,
that means many more people will die.

420
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,687
What have you been doing
at a time like this?

421
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,795
You killed someone?

422
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,092
Our swords are only for the mission!

423
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,328
You don't understand!

424
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,931
The performers were attacked
instead of us.

425
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,566
They had our drawing.

426
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,242
So Yae and-

427
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,073
We must leave here immediately.

428
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,842
Kiyomasa is still alive.

429
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,543
We killed his double.

430
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,811
What did you say?

431
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,982
Amagi, what's wrong?

432
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,556
Ninja's poison got him.

433
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,736
Say it isn't so.

434
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,928
Let's go. Quick!

435
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,641
Let's go?

436
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,909
Master, what about Amagi?

437
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,110
Amagi won't last.

438
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,776
Master, what are you talking about?

439
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,184
You are going to leave him behind?

440
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,716
We can't do that!

441
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,555
Why do you think we have
worked so hard until now?

442
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:57,159
Damn it, I am totally confused!

443
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,732
Have you for gotten that we live
only to carry out our mission?

444
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:14,679
We killed our dear friends, and stood by
when villagers were murdered.

445
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,648
Killing an enemy we don't hate is
one thing,

446
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:24,050
but not saving innocent people
from dying...

447
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,262
What is our mission, then?

448
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:39,670
After everything we've been through,
how can we leave Amagi here?

449
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,457
Master!!

450
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,531
Who are you aiming your sword at?

451
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,063
Withdraw your sword, Ukiha

452
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:15,600
Your sword can't even kill
an insect at this moment.

453
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,671
It's like swinging a mere stick.

454
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,075
You are no longer an assassin.

455
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,730
Amagi.

456
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,877
Sorry.

457
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,626
Go...

458
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,562
...please go.

459
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,531
Don't be silly, Amagi.

460
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,987
Amagi!

461
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:43,895
Amagi!

462
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,560
Why did you do that?

463
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,402
I'll walk you...

464
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,200
to the main road.

465
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,176
Good bye.

466
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,582
Good bye.
