1
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,561
It is the summer of 1945...

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,563
3 1/2 years after the war...

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,066
between Japan
and the Allies began.

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,734
Despite initial successes...

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,736
the Japanese have seen
the tide of battle...

6
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,196
turn against them.

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,741
The Americans have leapfrogged
across the Pacific...

8
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:36,245
sweeping the Japanese
before them.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,747
Japan's lmperial fleet
has been neutralized...

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,249
its air force overpowered.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,252
From the island air bases
they now control...

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,129
the Americans' B-29
Flying Fortresses...

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,258
are able to strike
at the Japanese home islands.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,135
A systematic
fire-bombing campaign...

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,471
is launched against cities
and industrial centers.

16
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,765
It is the most devastating
attack...

17
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,350
against civilian targets
ever carried out.

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,773
Meanwhile, in America...

19
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,608
Robert Oppenheimer
and other scientists...

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,278
have spent three years
working in secrecy...

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
to develop a new type of bomb.

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,948
They have at last succeeded.

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,783
But their achievement is not yet
known to the world...

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,785
and certainly not
to the citizens of Hiroshima...

25
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,995
in the summer of 1945.

26
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,965
All clear!

27
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,301
The enemy has gone!

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,804
All clear!

29
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,390
Well, c'mon!

30
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,517
All clear!

31
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,574
- I'm still hungry.
- I am, too.

32
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,826
We've got work to do first.

33
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,830
Father, is this wheat
almost ready for harvesting?

34
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,833
I can't wait.
I'm gonna eat so much bread!

35
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,503
Bread and bread and bread
until I throw up.

36
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,631
Noodles! I'm gonna eat
noodles till I burst!

37
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,300
- Gen.
- Uh-huh?

38
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,302
- Shinji.
- Yep?

39
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,803
Look at it, boys.

40
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,807
Its life begins in
the coldest season of the year.

41
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,810
The rain pounds it,
the wind blows it...

42
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,313
it's crushed
beneath people's feet...

43
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,982
but still the wheat
spreads its roots and grows.

44
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,400
It survives.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,070
So, let the wheat
be an example to you, my boys.

46
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,238
Right?

47
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,156
We're sick of
that dumb ol' story.

48
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,658
Sick of it, are you?

49
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,661
- Yay!
- Yay!

50
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,373
Ha ha ha ha ha!

51
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,043
- Yay!
- Yay!

52
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:52,047
- Ayee!
- Ayee!

53
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,550
Hiyah!

54
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,593
You do my mother and me
great honor by coming here...

55
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,304
and wishing me well
in my service to the emperor.

56
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,307
Fight bravely, Oyama. Banzai!

57
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,554
I'm off to join the army now...

58
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,138
You get filthy blanket...

59
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,015
Their dishes
are made of metal...

60
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,809
So are the chopsticks...

61
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,396
One small scoop of rice
in a tiny bowl...

62
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,483
A bowl of rotten rice
with some bugs on top.

63
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,486
I'm hungry.
I'm so hungry I'm dizzy.

64
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,988
I'm so hungry...

65
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,365
I could eat a whole goat!

66
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,994
If you've got a ration stamp,
today's your lucky day.

67
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,663
The soup's even got
rice in it today.

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,376
Look at that!

69
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,045
I haven't seen
this much rice in weeks!

70
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,512
Hey!

71
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,557
Father,
can we have some soup, too?

72
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm sorry, boys. Not today.
There's no more ration stamps.

73
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,521
You'll just have to be patient.

74
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,857
- We're hungry.
- We're starving.

75
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,525
Get outta my way!

76
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,527
What makes you think
you can cut in line?

77
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,905
- You wait your turn, or I'll...
- What?

78
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,534
Who made you soup monitor, huh?

79
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,329
- How dare you?
- Get him!

80
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,707
Hit him hard right in... Wait!

81
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,709
Isn't that terrible, Father?

82
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,712
Grown men fighting over
a bowl of soup.

83
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,590
If they're gonna fight,
it should be over some fish.

84
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,677
Mother! We're home!

85
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,554
We're back!

86
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,225
Did you miss us?

87
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,560
What's to eat? I'm starving.

88
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,729
There might be something.
Let's see.

89
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,116
You were hiding something
up there, weren't you?

90
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,576
Sweet potato!

91
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,079
Wait a minute, Shinji.
Aren't ya gonna share it?

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,122
- No!
- Come back here!

93
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,667
It's not yours!

94
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,585
No! You'll just eat it all!

95
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,046
Gimme it! I'm not kidding!

96
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,549
- No! No! No!
- Shinji!

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,051
Who do you think you are,
you little runt?

98
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,595
- Come here!
- No! Get away!

99
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,889
That does it! Stop!

100
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,600
Stay away!

101
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,936
We're supposed to share,
and you know it.

102
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,105
Don't you dare!

103
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,315
Give it to me!
You're gonna get it!

104
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,945
Ow!

105
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,822
Shinji, you're such a...

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,701
Brat!

107
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,668
You're gonna be so sorry!

108
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,715
OK. Now give it!

109
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,681
Hey. That's mine.
Give it, Eiko.

110
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,684
You know that this is
supposed to be for her.

111
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,188
- What do you mean, for her?
- Why'd she give it to us?

112
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,647
She was just being nice.

113
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,151
Mother needs to be strong
for the baby that's coming.

114
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,196
If you eat this potato,
the baby will die.

115
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,032
Now, do you both still want it?

116
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,159
Eiko, go on,
it's all right, dear.

117
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,994
Let your brothers have it.

118
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,329
But, Mother, it's not fair.

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,164
The baby needs it
more than they do.

120
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,665
Here. You take it.

121
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,753
Please, eat it for the baby.

122
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,265
Stop it, you two. Come on.
You'll get something later.

123
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,688
You know, dear,
it's a terrible thing...

124
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,691
having to watch
children go hungry.

125
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,694
And what's worse, there's hardly
any food to be bought...

126
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,321
even if we had the money.

127
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,698
We'll just have
to be patient, that's all.

128
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,243
- Ah!
- What?

129
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,704
Don't worry. It's just our baby
moving around in there.

130
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,248
It tickled me.

131
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,708
What, again? You know what
that means, don't you?

132
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,252
It's strong... a healthy one.

133
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,296
It's a healthy one, all... Ooh!

134
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,882
It's got spirit.

135
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,259
What're you laughing at?

136
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,136
The baby's moving.
It wants to come out.

137
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,931
It's moving? But how?
It hasn't been born yet.

138
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,732
It moved again.

139
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,734
That's funny. You know what?

140
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,736
I think it must be a boy.

141
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,864
You can never tell
until it's born.

142
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,074
Well, I can't wait.

143
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,744
Oh, you just want another
little brother to boss around.

144
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,913
Well, you can't
have this one, Gen...

145
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,083
'cause if it's a boy,
he's gonna be my little brother.

146
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,586
So I suppose you'll
boss him around...

147
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,421
and I'd hate to think
what you'll teach him.

148
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,089
It'd frighten me half to death.

149
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,426
Ha! See?
You'd be a bad example.

150
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,305
No, I wouldn't.

151
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,348
I didn't mean it.

152
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,851
I was only joking.

153
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,853
You're a good boy, Shinji.

154
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,480
I know you'll be
a good brother to the baby.

155
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,114
When's it coming?

156
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,492
Come out, little brother.
Hurry it up.

157
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,355
Children, wake up!

158
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,815
Attention! Attention!
Air raid!

159
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,317
Go to your shelters at once!

160
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,819
Air raid! To your shelters!

161
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,949
Everyone in the shelter.
Eiko, bring your brothers.

162
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,825
Oh, no.

163
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,869
Come on, Gen. We've got to go.

164
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,997
Wake Shinji up. Come on.

165
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,958
Shinji, come on.

166
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,254
Just leave him to me, Eiko.
I'll wake him up.

167
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,177
Wowww! Rice, Shinji!

168
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,470
Look at it all!

169
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,806
And see? Noodles... lots of 'em!

170
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:21,974
Where?

171
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,183
Real noodles?

172
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,685
Hey. What's going on?

173
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,186
This bowl's empty!

174
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,480
You ate 'em all!

175
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,195
We're supposed to share.

176
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,363
Get off!

177
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,865
Share what?

178
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,741
The noodles.

179
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,744
What is going on here?

180
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,374
Dunno.

181
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,792
What are we doing?

182
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,437
Hurry up, boy.

183
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,398
Suppose you want one
to land on your head...

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,442
is that what you want?

185
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,944
Bet it's just another spy plane.

186
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,405
They never drop bombs on us.
We're too boring.

187
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,907
How can you say that?

188
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,327
Have you forgotten the child
from the 400 block who was shot?

189
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,939
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya,
Osaka...

190
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,941
They've come against
all the big cities...

191
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,692
and bombed them into ruins.

192
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,696
It's serious, Gen. I won't
have you making light of it.

193
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,199
There's one thing
that bothers me.

194
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,453
It's like you said,
every major city around us...

195
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,039
has been bombed over and over
again, but never Hiroshima.

196
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,798
The enemy has gone!
All clear! The enemy has gone!

197
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,217
Ha! Told ya!

198
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,385
All clear!

199
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,888
Return to your homes!

200
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,140
I knew it was just a spy plane.

201
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,852
So I had to wake up and
get out of bed for nothing?

202
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,985
All safe and sound... Ohh!

203
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,863
Mother! Are you all right?
Is it the baby?

204
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,865
Kimei, what's wrong?

205
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,492
Just a little dizzy.

206
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,828
- Kimei!
- Mother!

207
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,997
Boys, go fetch the doctor!

208
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,165
Right!

209
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,001
- Eiko, make up the bed.
- Yes, Father.

210
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,004
Kimei, hang on.
It won't be long.

211
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,048
The doctor should
be coming in no time.

212
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,387
Hey, Gen, is Mother gonna die?

213
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,015
Oh, no!
Mother's dying, isn't she?

214
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,727
Shinji, shut up!
Mother's not going to die.

215
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,410
Wake up, Doctor! Wake up!

216
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,245
Our mother needs help!

217
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,289
Hurry up!
It's really important!

218
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,167
She's got my little brother
in her tummy!

219
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,046
Slow down, boys. Slow down.

220
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,049
I'll die of a heart attack
before we get there.

221
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,051
You should've thought of that
before you got so fat.

222
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,511
Our mother's sick, and if you
don't make her better...

223
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,720
you'll be sorry.

224
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,061
Will she be all right?

225
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,064
She's suffering from
severe malnutrition.

226
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,567
If she gets plenty to eat,
her strength will return...

227
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,277
and she should be fine.

228
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,740
Of course,
that's easier said than done.

229
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:11,245
It seems we don't have enough
food or medicine for anybody.

230
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,996
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,252
This is serious.
We've got to do something.

232
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,380
This is really serious.
We've really gotta do something.

233
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,133
What is it, Eiko?
What's the matter?

234
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:10,637
It's just that the last of
the rice is gone, Father...

235
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,432
and we have no money
to buy any more.

236
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,642
Don't worry.
Something will come along.

237
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,019
We'll find the money.

238
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,647
We just have to keep at it
and finish our work.

239
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,025
Then maybe we'll get paid
what we're owed.

240
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,486
Eiko, you mustn't overdo it.
You're not very strong.

241
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,031
Oh, I'm all right.

242
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,533
I'm sure.

243
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,016
Hey. Come here, Gen.

244
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,392
What is it?

245
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,520
Has anybody ever eaten a worm?

246
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,896
Eaten a worm?

247
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,397
Like a caterpillar?

248
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,399
I don't know.

249
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:08,070
If they won't make you sick,
then Mother could eat them.

250
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,203
Idiot!

251
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,914
Good morning, boys.
I heard noises last night.

252
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,082
Hi, Mr. Pak.

253
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,875
Everything all right?
Has the baby come?

254
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,377
Our mother's sick.

255
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,380
The doctor,
he said she's got malnutrition.

256
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,715
That's terrible, and just when
she needs all her strength.

257
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:32,219
Somebody once told me carp's
blood is the best thing...

258
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,388
for a woman in her condition.

259
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,390
Huh?

260
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,892
Carp? Like the fish?

261
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,102
Yeah?

262
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:51,238
Gee, I sure didn't know any of
that stuff about carp's blood.

263
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,032
If we could catch one for her,
Mother would get all better.

264
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,535
So, let's do it!

265
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,036
Yes, sir!

266
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,416
Sergeant!

267
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,917
Captain!

268
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,419
Move out!

269
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,004
Company, forward!

270
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,623
Rats!

271
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,790
Hold still!

272
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,000
Move over!

273
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,796
Look, Shinji.
Look at all the carp.

274
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,298
And they're so big.

275
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,800
Scan the perimeter, Sergeant.
Any sign of the enemy?

276
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,763
Negative, sir.

277
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,018
Hey! Look! Look!

278
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,146
I think I caught one.

279
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,814
That was fast.
He must be hungry, too.

280
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,318
He almost pulled me in!

281
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,114
He's a big one!

282
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,574
Really big!

283
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,827
Hang on, Shinji. Don't let go.

284
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,036
I won't.

285
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,579
I'm going in after it.

286
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,058
Got him, Shinji! See?

287
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,561
I can't believe it! Victory!

288
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,482
Now let's take him home.

289
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,068
Don't forget to tell Father
who caught it.

290
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,074
Get out of here!

291
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,663
Dirty little thieves!

292
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,790
Let go of that fish!

293
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,088
You hit Gen!

294
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,598
You can hit me again, sir.

295
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,059
Really, you can hit me
as much as you like.

296
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,564
Go on, but just let us keep
the fish when you're done.

297
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:31,940
Please, sir.

298
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,151
That's right!

299
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,737
You can hit me as much
as you want, too.

300
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,905
But give us the fish.

301
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,406
Go on. I'm ready.

302
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,755
Will you tell me why you boys
want that blasted carp?

303
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,256
It's for our mother, sir.

304
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,258
She's going to have a baby,
and she's not very well.

305
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,179
And Mr. Pak said carp blood's
the only thing that'll help her.

306
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,143
Without it, my mother
will get worse or even...

307
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,188
You wouldn't want my mother
to die, would you?

308
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,276
Oh, please, help us.

309
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,195
Please save her.

310
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,660
You won't?

311
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,288
Oh, no!

312
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,501
You're a mean old fart,
aren't you?

313
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:37,506
Her ghost will come back
and haunt you till you die!

314
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,100
How does the old saying go?

315
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,644
Be good to your parents
while you can.

316
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,231
Very well. Keep it.

317
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,988
Take the carp along
to your mother, please.

318
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,990
You mean it, really?

319
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,993
Remember, old man, if you lie,
you'll go straight to hell.

320
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,788
Funny, I was just about to say
the same thing to you two.

321
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,570
If you boys stole it, you know
just what I'll do to you.

322
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,031
We didn't.
The old man gave it to us.

323
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,532
Don't you believe us?

324
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,534
Cook it and give it to Mother.

325
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,037
It's the best thing for a woman
in her condition.

326
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,499
Hurry up and cook it... now.

327
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,086
Eiko, you heard him.

328
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,505
OK.

329
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,565
Will Mother get better now?

330
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,276
I hope she will.

331
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,071
You boys shouldn't have
to worry about such things.

332
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,240
I'll just have to work harder.

333
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,535
I'd like to know
if we'll ever have enough food.

334
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,702
Will we?

335
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,039
Yes, son, when the war is over.

336
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,958
When will it be over?

337
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,962
It won't be long.
Japan has all but lost the war.

338
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,006
Why do we keep on fighting
if we've lost the war?

339
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,009
Why? Because our government
is run by madmen.

340
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,512
They're just stupid, crazy.
All of them.

341
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,014
Father, you shouldn't
say stuff like that.

342
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,225
They might call you
a traitor or something.

343
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,477
Traitor, coward...
those words mean nothing to me.

344
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,521
Actually, come to think of it...

345
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,273
I'm proud if they want
to call me those things.

346
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,526
This war can't be right...

347
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,488
but it's only the cowards
like me who dare say it.

348
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,032
If there were
only a few more like us.

349
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,034
You know, sometimes it takes
more courage...

350
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,496
not to fight than to fight,
to not want to kill...

351
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,874
when all around you
are calling out for blood.

352
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,418
That's real courage in my book.

353
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,421
If you boys remember nothing
else that I teach you...

354
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,382
I hope you'll remember that,
all right?

355
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:32,222
- Hey, Father?
- What is it?

356
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,016
I just wanted to say
I love you, Father.

357
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,060
Yeah, I want to say
I love you, too, Father.

358
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,228
I know.

359
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,232
Are you sure you don't mind?

360
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,152
I should be sharing this
with all of you.

361
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:46,653
Don't be silly, Mother.

362
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:49,156
You're not well,
and you're eating for two now.

363
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,866
You're right.

364
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,409
Well, how is it?

365
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,578
It's delicious.

366
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,918
Why the big grin, son?

367
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,295
A secret.

368
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,729
Shinji, what did you say
to make Mother cry?

369
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,607
All I did was ask if I could
suck on the fish bones...

370
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,234
when she was done with them.

371
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,902
You're kidding.
You asked her that?

372
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,321
- Yeah, that was it.
- Idiot!

373
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:33,450
What was that for? How come
you're always hitting me?

374
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,244
Hurry up, Shinji. Come on.

375
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,747
You big bully, Gen. Father!

376
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,917
Eiko! Eiko!

377
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,752
Yes, Mr. Pak?

378
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,422
I brought a little something
for you and your family.

379
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,632
Take it.

380
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,719
- Rice!
- It isn't much.

381
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:54,972
Mr. Pak...

382
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,642
Thank you.

383
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,815
We sure did a good job getting
that carp, didn't we?

384
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:08,318
Yeah, Mother'll be
all better again in no time.

385
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,238
Hello, is anybody home?

386
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,712
Never thought that old grouch
would come to our house.

387
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,964
I bet he's gonna
tell Father all about...

388
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,008
how we tried to steal his carp.

389
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,010
Father'll get mad, won't he?

390
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,721
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

391
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,600
The boys will be punished, sir.
I assure you.

392
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,603
Oh, no, please.
You misunderstood me.

393
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,730
I didn't come here for that.

394
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,232
I admire the boys.
Such high spirits.

395
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,735
Such devotion
to you and their mother.

396
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,237
You have good sons there,
Nakaoka.

397
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,239
I envy you...

398
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:58,076
though I'm sure they're
quite a handful at times.

399
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,578
What'll we do?

400
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,581
What do you think?
Prepare to get hit.

401
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,083
He wouldn't do that, would he?

402
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,920
- There you are.
- Shinji.

403
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,505
Well, then?

404
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,798
Come in and sit down.

405
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,159
Told ya.

406
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:51,046
Never thought I'd be getting
a piece of cake out of this.

407
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,590
Hey, we did good, right?

408
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,967
Yeah.

409
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,053
That old fisherman
is not so bad after all.

410
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,097
I ought to let him
join our platoon.

411
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,266
I might give him a medal.

412
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,113
At 2:45 a.m.,
three American B-29s took off...

413
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,115
from an air base on Tinian
in the Marianas.

414
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,117
Two of them
were observation planes.

415
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,618
The third was the Enola Gay...

416
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,245
named after
the captain's mother.

417
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:30,836
Mother, leave the washing to me.
You're still not well.

418
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:35,382
It's OK. If I rest too long,
I'm liable to get lazy.

419
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,885
Father, isn't this the greatest
boat you ever saw?

420
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,387
- Gen made it for me!
- Did he really?

421
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,890
The minute
he's home from school...

422
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,850
we're going to take it
to the river.

423
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,520
Are you? Won't that be fun?

424
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:51,398
Enemy planes again?
It's so early.

425
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,873
All clear!

426
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,375
The enemy has gone!

427
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:14,338
All clear! The enemy has gone!

428
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,340
Another spy plane, I betcha.

429
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,843
Well, that's a B-29 vapor trail.

430
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,304
Look how clear the sky is.

431
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:24,056
It'll be hot today.

432
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,059
Weather observation plane
Easerly calling Enola Gay.

433
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,560
Calling Enola Gay.

434
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,437
Weather's fair and clear
over Hiroshima.

435
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,147
Conditions favorable
for bombing.

436
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:36,443
Roger. Enola Gay getting ready
to drop on target.

437
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:48,372
I better get going or
I'll be late for school.

438
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,374
You're coming right home
after school, OK?

439
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,376
We're going down
to the river, right?

440
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,585
Right!

441
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,630
- Promise?
- Promise!

442
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,272
Father, Eiko, come here!
Look at this!

443
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,274
What is it? Good heavens.

444
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,277
Look at all the ants.
Where are they coming from?

445
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,280
- I've never seen so many.
- I wonder why?

446
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,205
B-29.

447
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:31,456
Yeah?

448
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,961
- Gee, and it's all alone.
- What's it doing?

449
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:42,509
- Probably a spy mission.
- It's very strange.

450
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:45,554
Why isn't the air raid siren
going off?

451
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:47,014
I don't know.

452
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,958
Altitude 3,600 feet.

453
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,961
Fixed on target. Release bomb.

454
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,172
Roger. Releasing bomb.

455
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,992
Wow, what happened?

456
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,910
How'd I end up here?

457
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,913
Guess they finally decided
to bomb us.

458
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,081
Ugh!

459
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:45,586
What a mess.

460
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,045
I'm coming!

461
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,756
Hang on.

462
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,551
She's dead!

463
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,137
Hey!

464
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,014
Somebody, hel...

465
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,406
Is anybody here?

466
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,235
Am I dreaming?

467
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,695
Are they ghosts or what?

468
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,078
Fire!

469
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,208
My house is on fire!

470
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,252
Oh, please, not my house!

471
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,172
I'm coming. Father! Mother!
Eiko! Shinji!

472
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,720
Hey, Shinji, where are you?

473
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:23,267
Is anyone here? Where are you?

474
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,393
Father!

475
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,563
Please, somebody, help us!

476
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,730
That's Mother's voice!

477
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,859
Somebody help me! Hurry!

478
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,236
Mother, what happened?

479
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,780
Oh, my sweet boy, you're alive!

480
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,782
Hurry, Mother, get us!

481
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,075
It really hurts!

482
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,495
Shinji! Eiko! Father!

483
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,916
Hurry, Gen.
Help me lift this beam!

484
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,126
Yes, Mother.

485
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:54,256
Hurry up, Gen!
It's getting hotter.

486
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,300
Hang on.

487
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,260
Do it fast!

488
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:00,262
It really hurts bad!

489
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,264
It's so hot!

490
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,266
Hurry, Gen! I'm scared!

491
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,561
Hurry, Gen! I'm scared!

492
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,275
It won't move.

493
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:16,320
We'll get them out! We have to!

494
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,780
That's enough. Go on.
Get away.

495
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,325
What are you saying?

496
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,827
Get out now. Go while you can!

497
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,331
No, darling, no!
I won't! Never!

498
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,832
Kimei.

499
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,294
Listen to me. You've got
to go while you still can!

500
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,838
Never! I would rather die!

501
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,341
Kimei,
you're talking like a fool.

502
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:38,842
You've got Gen and the baby
to think of now.

503
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:41,094
No, I won't!

504
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,805
I will never leave you!

505
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:47,267
Gen, you know what
you have to do now, son.

506
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,311
What do you want me to do,
Father?

507
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,855
You get your mother
out of here now!

508
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,818
No, Father, I won't do it!

509
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,362
I'm scared! Gen!

510
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,826
Oh, Mother, please, Mother...

511
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,369
I'm so weak.

512
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,330
Oh, why couldn't I be stronger?

513
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:09,832
Gen!

514
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:14,294
It's up to you to look after
your mother and the baby.

515
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,799
They're going to need you, boy.

516
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,262
I know you'll do your best.

517
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,688
No, no! I won't go!

518
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:37,359
I want to stay here and die!

519
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,154
Oh, it's getting hotter!

520
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,447
Mother, where are you?
It's really, really hot!

521
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,950
I have to go to him!

522
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,451
Where is everybody?

523
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,954
Mommy!

524
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:52,040
Mommy!

525
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,710
Shinji!

526
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,681
They're all burning up.

527
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,518
My family... burning.

528
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,448
They're burning like a bonfire.

529
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,949
Are you all right, Mother?

530
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:31,705
Mother,
Mother, we've got to go now.

531
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:34,416
Come away from there! Hurry!

532
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,919
Mr. Pak! Mr. Pak!

533
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,420
Gen, is that you?

534
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,923
Here, leave your mother to me.

535
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,090
Hurry.

536
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,425
Come on. Get moving.

537
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:25,259
Children, grab on
to any floating pieces of wood.

538
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,263
Keep your heads above the water.

539
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:30,764
That's it. That's it.

540
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:35,769
Wha... No! Hang on, children!

541
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,188
Hang on!

542
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,275
Well, you should be safe
here for the moment.

543
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,277
Gen, I have to go now.

544
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,280
Take care of your mother.
Good luck.

545
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,781
Thanks, Mr. Pak.

546
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,284
What's the matter, Mother?

547
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,286
It's coming now.

548
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:53,495
The baby?

549
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,289
You must try and find
a doctor or a midwife, Gen.

550
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,665
All right.

551
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,793
And I'll need a basin
that will hold lots of water...

552
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,671
and some strips of any clean
cloth you're able to find.

553
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,173
Right.

554
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,717
A pair of scissors and thread.

555
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,802
What are the scissors for?

556
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:12,806
Somebody will have to cut
the cord.

557
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:15,809
Is there a midwife
or a doctor around anywhere?

558
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:21,773
Is anyone a doctor?
I need a doctor!

559
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,818
Listen to me!
My mother's having a baby!

560
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,945
Doesn't anybody know a doctor?

561
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,948
Everything's gone crazy.
There's nobody to help me.

562
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,950
What'll I do now? What'll I do?

563
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,828
I'm sorry, Mother.

564
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,832
I looked everywhere, but I
couldn't find anybody to help.

565
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,000
No one.

566
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:43,003
Well, we'll do it ourselves.

567
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:46,048
You and me, Mother?
But that's impossible!

568
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,550
You must try, my boy.

569
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:51,053
All right, I'll try.

570
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,846
First of all, fetch some water.

571
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,056
Got it!

572
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,857
Be sure to have
some rags ready, Gen.

573
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,819
You'll have to wash
the baby when it's born.

574
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,363
Don't worry. I'm ready.

575
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:28,841
You've got to be very careful
about holding up its head.

576
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,884
Hey, this baby
doesn't look like me.

577
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:35,389
It's a girl, Mother, but it
really looks like a monkey.

578
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,852
All babies do. You did, too.

579
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,313
Well, I guess she'll turn out
to be real pretty then.

580
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,400
Listen here, baby.

581
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,902
I'm the one
who brought you to life...

582
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:51,405
so you better thank me
when you grow up...

583
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:55,993
and you better do everything
I tell you to do, OK?

584
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:01,915
They're going
to need you now, boy.

585
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,917
It's up to you
to look after them now.

586
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,919
It's going to be a boy!

587
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,922
And he's going to be
my little brother!

588
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,924
Father, are you out there?

589
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:14,928
Eiko! Shinji!

590
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,432
The baby's here, everybody!
Can you see her?

591
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,933
It's a girl!

592
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,560
You were wrong, Shinji.
It's a girl!

593
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:31,445
Oh, why aren't you here?
Father! Shinji!

594
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:34,448
She's the prettiest baby girl
in the whole world...

595
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,450
and you never saw her.

596
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:40,454
Gen, give her to me.
Let me hold her.

597
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:44,958
Take a good look around,
little one.

598
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,461
Look closely. You see?

599
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:53,467
This is the war
that killed your father.

600
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,969
Remember it.

601
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,481
What in the world?

602
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,482
It's raining.

603
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:11,985
Stop it, stop it.

604
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,489
What?

605
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,199
That's not right.

606
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:21,703
Mother, have you ever seen rain
that's black like this?

607
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:24,498
This black rain began falling...

608
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,501
on the northwest section
of the city.

609
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:31,505
The impact
of the bomb's blast...

610
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,507
had sent dust, debris,
and radiation...

611
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,509
high into the atmosphere...

612
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,512
where it gathered
in a gigantic, lethal cloud...

613
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:41,515
before returning to the earth
as radioactive rain.

614
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:44,726
The bomb that had
fallen on the city...

615
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,771
detonated with a destructive
force of 20,000 tons of TNT...

616
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:50,774
and generated temperatures
an excess of 4,000 degrees.

617
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:54,319
Some 60% of the city
had vanished.

618
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,739
But the damage
did not end there.

619
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,242
The people of Hiroshima
did not know it yet...

620
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:03,078
but the bomb's after-effects,
such as the black rain...

621
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,581
would bring them
many years of suffering.

622
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:22,556
Those people,
they make so much noise.

623
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:25,058
How am I supposed to sleep?

624
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,519
Perhaps if we took them
some of our water.

625
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,281
Here.
This is some water. Drink.

626
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,539
Go on. There's more
where this came from.

627
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,586
Look at that woman.

628
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,589
She's dead!

629
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,092
I don't understand.

630
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,140
Why? What's making them die?

631
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,100
They died when they drank.

632
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,603
Could something be wrong
with the water?

633
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,107
We've got to stop them
from drinking the water.

634
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,609
You're right.

635
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,125
Mother, what are we going to do?

636
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,127
Well, let me see now.

637
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:38,257
We've no place to go, really.

638
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,133
Our relatives will be dead...

639
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,761
or if not, they'll be
no better off than we are.

640
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:46,640
Frankly, son, I don't know what
we're going to do.

641
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:50,644
I'm finding it difficult
to think clearly.

642
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:53,772
There, there, now.
I don't have any milk.

643
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,775
That's bad, Mother.
Babies need milk to live.

644
00:46:56,817 --> 00:47:00,654
We've eaten nothing for 3 days,
and my milk has dried up.

645
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,823
When mothers go hungry,
their babies go hungry, too.

646
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:08,162
I really must try to find
some food, for her sake.

647
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:11,331
You just leave everything to me.

648
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,333
What do you mean?
What can you do?

649
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,336
It's up to me
to see we have food.

650
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:23,177
Father said it's up to me now.

651
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:26,180
I won't ever let you die.
You won't have to worry.

652
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,390
I'll protect you!

653
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,352
But where am I going
to find food around here?

654
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,813
Hey,
where did you get that rice?

655
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,857
My mom and baby sister
are hungry.

656
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,859
There's army trucks
distributing food.

657
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:40,861
You haven't seen them?

658
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,363
Oh, that's great.
Where are they?

659
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,699
Ah, forget it!
Find 'em yourself!

660
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,368
I got this rice
down by the bridge.

661
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,870
By the bridge?
I know where that is.

662
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,247
An army truck, right?

663
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:59,588
Wait!
Do you have any more rice?

664
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,725
Dead bodies. Nothing else.

665
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,227
Get that fire started.

666
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,938
We've got to burn them
before they rot.

667
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,738
My God.
There's just so many of them.

668
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,448
When will it stop?

669
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,242
The smell's awful.

670
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,953
There must be more dead people
here than live ones.

671
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:45,300
Hey, look at this...
a fireman's hat.

672
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,773
Those soldiers are so mean.

673
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:05,654
They're just treating
those people like bags of trash.

674
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:13,787
It's almost like
they never lived at all.

675
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,207
Maybe this is what hell's like.

676
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:31,805
Look at all these damn maggots.

677
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:35,267
I didn't even notice them.

678
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,811
When they start
moving around in there...

679
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,271
it itches like crazy.

680
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,315
Do you think it's all right
to eat them?

681
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,817
Are you crazy? It's not time
to talk about food.

682
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,778
Please, can somebody help me?

683
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,824
Is there anyone here
who can help feed my baby?

684
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,869
She needs milk. She's starving.

685
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:59,333
Oh, please, will you...

686
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:12,346
Please, isn't there anybody who
can help me with a little milk?

687
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:13,847
My baby is starving.

688
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:17,267
Be quiet! Let it die!
It's better off!

689
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,770
Kill it! Kill it!

690
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,730
You're mad to say that!

691
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:24,441
All right, then.
I will kill it for you!

692
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:27,361
Give it to me! Give it to me!

693
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:29,905
No! Please! Not my baby!

694
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,289
There, little one.

695
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:44,837
Eat now. Take all I have.

696
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,672
You still have milk.

697
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,883
I can't believe I really
said those terrible things.

698
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:52,886
It's just that your baby
reminded me of my own.

699
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,180
She's dead now, over there.

700
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:58,141
I have no one to drink my milk.

701
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:02,396
Your baby's welcome
to have all I have left.

702
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:03,897
Thank you.

703
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,900
You're lucky, my child.

704
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:09,069
So very lucky.

705
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:14,950
Everybody's dead.
Everything's gone.

706
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,914
How come you're shivering
when it's so hot?

707
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,916
Do you feel sick or something?

708
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,920
I'm freezing. Must've caught
a chill from the rain.

709
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,922
Hey, I think you wet your pants.

710
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:32,134
Shut up, you brat!
What are you talking about?

711
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,012
Blood!

712
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,931
Must've sat in something.

713
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,434
Hey, somebody
cut holes in your hair!

714
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:43,270
Listen, kid, I'll cut holes
in you, if you don't...

715
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,441
My God. What's happening?

716
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:57,451
Mister, what's wrong?
Do you need some help?

717
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:58,452
What's wrong? Hey!

718
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,956
Help!

719
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,920
I need help!

720
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,964
Get up!

721
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,966
I've got you.

722
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,969
Come on, up!

723
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:22,434
You know, I don't think
it's going to work.

724
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:35,405
There! That's a pretty clever
stretcher, huh?

725
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,325
Hang in there, soldier.
You'll be fine.

726
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:44,540
Hello! Does anybody know
where the hospital is?

727
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,511
Please help me.

728
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,014
Tend only to those who
show some chance of recovery.

729
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:02,516
Yes, sir.

730
00:53:02,558 --> 00:53:04,518
We don't have
enough medicine for them...

731
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,520
let alone all these others.

732
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,440
Hey, somebody should
look at this soldier.

733
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,526
He's real bad, I think.

734
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,027
Another one.

735
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,531
Tell me, boy,
was he vomiting blood...

736
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,950
and complaining
that he was cold?

737
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:23,453
Right. I guess that means you
know what's wrong with him.

738
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:25,956
No use looking at this one.

739
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,083
This soldier's dead.

740
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,543
God help us.

741
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,087
Is it possible that one bomb
could have done all this?

742
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:34,548
The initial explosion
of the atomic bomb...

743
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,466
claimed more than 100,000 lives.

744
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:38,552
But that was only the beginning.

745
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,053
The radiation remained...

746
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:42,556
contaminating soldiers
cleaning up the city...

747
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:45,058
as well as those relatives
of the victims...

748
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,476
who came looking for them.

749
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,061
For years afterwards...

750
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:52,065
these people would suffer
from leukemia and cancer...

751
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:56,570
part of the collateral damage
inflicted by the bomb.

752
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,606
God help us.

753
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:38,111
Is it possible that one bomb
could have done all this?

754
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:43,617
Damn it! Damn it!

755
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,496
Huh? What's this?

756
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:52,042
Rice!
But it looks like charcoal.

757
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:55,128
This must've been
some kind of storehouse.

758
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:00,133
What a waste! All this rice
for people to eat...

759
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:03,136
and it's been burnt
to a crisp! Damn it!

760
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,824
Underneath, it's OK!

761
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:25,659
I found a gold mine!

762
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:29,246
Ha! There's more rice
than we'll be able to eat!

763
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,167
Ha ha! Hooray!

764
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,672
Found some pickles, too.

765
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:42,176
Mother, you and the baby will
never have to be hungry again!

766
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:45,179
Gen, you've done well.
Thank you.

767
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,682
Well, I see
you got the camp all set up.

768
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,184
She's sleeping, huh?

769
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:53,187
Hey, isn't it time we came up
with a name for her?

770
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,690
I think you're right.
Our daughter should have a name.

771
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,694
There are more and more
fires all the time.

772
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,196
They're burning the dead.

773
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:04,198
There are so many dead, Mother.

774
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,700
- So many.
- It's horrible.

775
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:08,702
Yes, it is, Gen.

776
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,707
- Mother.
- What?

777
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:17,211
I hope she always has
lots of friends.

778
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:20,255
I know what...
let's call her Tomoko.

779
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,926
Yes. That means friend.
Very good.

780
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,720
Well, OK. It's all set, then.
You're Tomoko.

781
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:28,722
Gen, what's happened
to your hair?

782
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:30,224
Those bald spots.

783
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,267
What are you talking about?

784
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:35,270
My hair!

785
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,772
My hair!

786
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:50,244
This soldier's dead.
God help us.

787
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:53,080
Is it possible that one bomb
could have done all this?

788
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,248
Gen!

789
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:57,251
Don't let it happen to me,
Mother!

790
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,753
I don't want to die!

791
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:01,255
There, there, my little one.

792
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,257
You're not going to die,
do you hear?

793
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:05,384
You are not going to die.

794
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:07,261
After the bombing
of Hiroshima...

795
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,764
the United States
issued an ultimatum...

796
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,766
calling on Japan to surrender...

797
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:16,270
and threatening to drop a second
atomic bomb if it did not.

798
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,273
The Japanese high command
ignored the warning.

799
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:24,778
They made certain the extent
of the damage to Hiroshima...

800
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:29,366
was little reported.

801
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:30,826
Three days later
on August 9th...

802
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,828
another B-29 appeared
in the sky above Nagasaki.

803
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,854
Japan's high command
was convinced at last.

804
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,981
On August 15th,
the emperor Hirohito...

805
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,525
in the first public address
made by a Japanese sovereign...

806
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,028
announced
that the war was over.

807
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,043
Yes, Mother?

808
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:05,045
Your father, sister,
and brother...

809
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,048
they've all been taken away
from us, haven't they?

810
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,051
That's right.
All of them are dead, Mother.

811
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,561
What's the matter, mister?
Why are you crying?

812
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:24,064
The emperor announced it
on the radio just now.

813
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:27,067
Japan has been defeated.

814
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:31,071
We've lost the war.
We've surrendered.

815
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:34,449
Tell me, why now?
Why not before?

816
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:42,583
It's all right.
Come on, Mother, cheer up.

817
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:45,586
We're going to be OK. Trust me.

818
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,589
I've already started planning
what to do.

819
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:53,093
And I know the first thing
we're going to need... a house.

820
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:57,097
August 15, 1945.

821
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:01,477
Japan officially surrenders
to the Allied powers.

822
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:07,608
Don't cry, Tomoko.
Hush now, hush.

823
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,611
I still don't have
enough milk for her.

824
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,613
We'll have to find some for her.

825
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,615
She needs milk,
not this rice soup.

826
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,617
I never thought it possible...

827
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:20,621
but we're running out
of rice, too.

828
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,624
Come and eat now.
Hand her to me.

829
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,128
If I could only find some kind
of work, but it's hopeless.

830
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,088
We're in quite a fix.

831
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,635
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

832
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,138
What are you doing?

833
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,140
Who are you?

834
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:41,391
Hey!

835
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:45,646
Come here, you little thief!

836
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:46,855
Gotcha!

837
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:54,655
If I weren't so hungry,
I'd beat you to a pulp.

838
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:57,658
So what? Don't you think
we're hungry, too?

839
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,035
Huh?

840
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:03,539
Mother, look at this boy.

841
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,666
Look at his face.
Show her your face.

842
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,042
What are you doing?

843
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:14,174
Whoever Shinji is, I'm not him.

844
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:15,634
I thought you were
my little brother.

845
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:16,802
I'm not!

846
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:19,805
No, of course you aren't.
He's dead.

847
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:22,683
My name is Ryuta Kondo.

848
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:25,602
I haven't eaten all week.

849
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:29,106
Then I smelled your rice.
I couldn't help it.

850
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:31,191
Where's your family, Ryuta?

851
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,694
They were all killed
in the explosion.

852
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:37,197
You look exactly like
my little brother Shinji.

853
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:39,116
Well, I'm not. I'm Ryuta!

854
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:42,578
Here. You can have my rice,
if you want it.

855
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:45,080
You'd give it to me?

856
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,248
Take it.

857
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,917
You mean I can have all of it?

858
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,127
Sure.

859
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,090
Slow down.
You'll make yourself sick.

860
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,593
No.
You might want it back again.

861
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,094
I won't want it back. Really.

862
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,221
Why should I believe you?

863
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:03,390
Will you relax?

864
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,893
Where have you lived
since the bomb fell, my boy?

865
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:08,854
Out in the open.

866
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,398
If you're still hungry,
you're welcome to finish mine.

867
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:13,567
Sit down.

868
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:15,402
You really mean it?

869
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:23,619
Mother, he even behaves
like Shinji. It's amazing.

870
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,121
It is remarkable, Gen.

871
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:30,751
I've heard it said everyone has
five doubles of him or herself.

872
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:34,254
Still, that he should have
found us, it's uncanny.

873
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:36,298
Hmm, is there any more?

874
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,925
There's nothing in there.

875
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,305
Somehow it seems
like he belongs here.

876
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:45,891
I know what you mean.

877
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,309
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

878
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:50,145
Well, you know we're having
a difficult enough time...

879
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,356
making ends meet as it is...

880
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:54,650
but still,
if Shinji were alive...

881
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,652
So, it's all right then?

882
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,784
Wow, that was the best!

883
01:03:03,826 --> 01:03:07,287
I almost don't even feel hungry.

884
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:10,457
We've been thinking. Would you
like to have a home again?

885
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,334
Yeah, you want to stay here?

886
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:14,837
And live with us?

887
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:17,214
Be part of our family?

888
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:18,632
Stay and live with you?

889
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,720
I won't be much help.

890
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,306
I'm only a kid,
but I can give you a back rub.

891
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:28,350
Daddy always said
I was a good back rubber.

892
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,602
That's very kind of you,
but you don't have to.

893
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:33,605
We're not asking for anything
in return, child.

894
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:35,649
You'll just be
one of the family.

895
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:38,318
Really? Gee, thanks.

896
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,195
I...

897
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:45,325
OK, stop it. Stop crying.

898
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:48,328
You're going to wake up
Tomoko if you...

899
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,164
Now we've got two of them
howling.

900
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,332
That's all right.
You go right on and cry.

901
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,667
I don't worry about her.

902
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,252
Your baby looks funny.
Is it sick?

903
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:57,713
Yeah. Malnutrition.

904
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,131
That means she's not
getting enough to eat.

905
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:02,342
She needs milk.

906
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:05,512
Hey, I've got an idea.

907
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,724
Hey, will anyone give us a job?

908
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:10,767
Anybody got a job for us?
Any job at all?

909
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:11,935
Anybody?

910
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:13,103
Hello!

911
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:15,606
Any job at all!

912
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,066
Nobody looks very interested,
do they?

913
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,068
No, big brother.

914
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,613
Wait a minute.
What did you call me, Ryuta?

915
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:24,615
Big brother.
What's wrong with that?

916
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:25,991
Nothing! Say it again.

917
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:27,159
Big brother.

918
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,368
Again!

919
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:32,247
Big brother. Why?
Do you like being called that?

920
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,666
A lot!

921
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,127
You want me to say it
some more then?

922
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,921
Big brother!

923
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:40,923
My big brother Gen!

924
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:44,384
Hey, listen, everybody.
This is my big brother!

925
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:45,594
Idiot!

926
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:48,388
You boys, did you mean it...

927
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,681
when you said you'd take
any kind of job?

928
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,642
Yep. You've got something?

929
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:54,353
Yes, I believe I have...

930
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,646
if you boys would like to
make 10 yen a day.

931
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:57,523
Ten yen? You bet, mister!

932
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,399
Ten yen?
Yeah, of course we would.

933
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:01,819
Well, then, come with me.

934
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:06,657
- Is this your house?
- You must be a millionaire.

935
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:08,534
Hush, keep your voices down.

936
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,955
Daddy's found two more boys.

937
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:14,540
They'll run away,
just like the others.

938
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,709
This is where you will work.

939
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,753
Peuw!

940
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:21,797
It really stinks.

941
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,298
What's in here?

942
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,716
Smells like an outhouse!

943
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:28,720
It's full of worms and flies.
Is that guy dead?

944
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:30,055
Yecch!

945
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:33,392
Seiji, I've found two more boys
to look after you.

946
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:36,103
Ask them to do anything.
They're being paid well enough.

947
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:39,398
- Wait, Eizo.
- Look after him well.

948
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:40,566
Come back!

949
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,568
Can't we talk for a while?

950
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,111
Brother!

951
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:51,577
I knew they'd do that.

952
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,120
They'll be gone in no time.

953
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:56,081
They stuck him in there
until he dies, I guess.

954
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,750
Disgusting.
What should we do about him?

955
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:01,086
Ten yen will buy a lot of milk.

956
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:02,254
Sure will.

957
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:03,422
Hey, you buzzards!

958
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:05,591
- Does he mean us?
- Looks that way.

959
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:09,011
Get these maggots off me
and clean up around here. Now!

960
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,637
Yes, sir!

961
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,097
Whatever you say!

962
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,765
The worms crawl in,
the worms crawl out...

963
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,267
The worms play pinochle
on your snout...

964
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:16,768
And when you see
the hearse go by...

965
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:20,105
You'll know that you're
the next to die.

966
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:22,441
They usually run off by now.

967
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:23,901
Those boys are crazy.

968
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:27,279
Girls, I've told you
to stay away from your uncle.

969
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,615
Do you want to be infected?

970
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:32,284
My dear,
I'm tired of his being here.

971
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:34,119
Seiji should be in a hospital.

972
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:37,873
The hospitals are overflowing
with bomb victims like him.

973
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:39,333
Don't be silly.

974
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:40,834
With your money,
he'd have the best of care.

975
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:44,296
You must try not to resent
his presence in our home.

976
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,840
He's my brother and therefore
my responsibility.

977
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:49,051
Oh, you are such a hypocrite.

978
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,886
You know you loathe going
near him as much as I do...

979
01:06:50,928 --> 01:06:53,305
and it's no wonder.

980
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,723
He stinks. He looks ghastly.

981
01:06:54,765 --> 01:06:56,600
He's always roaring
and shouting like a savage.

982
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:58,727
The neighbors act like
we live in a haunted house.

983
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:01,355
At least think of the girls,
if nothing else.

984
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:04,650
It will be a blessing
for all of us if he dies soon.

985
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,570
Little idiot!

986
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,074
What was that all about?

987
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:14,868
Were you trying
to tear my skin off?

988
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,328
I try to be careful...

989
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,580
but those maggots keep getting
stuck in the scabs like glue.

990
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,998
I don't want to hear it!

991
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,002
You have to be more careful,
you little buzzard.

992
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:25,546
Listen here...

993
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:27,464
You think anyone will stop me
if I wring his neck?

994
01:07:27,506 --> 01:07:28,674
Wait. Calm down.

995
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:32,177
Fetch me that gray book
on the desk, buzzard.

996
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,263
Stop calling me that.

997
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:35,681
My name's Gen.
I'm not a buzzard!

998
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:38,142
That's right! Me, neither.
And my name's Ryuta Kondo.

999
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:41,353
You're nothing but scavengers
living off my rotting flesh.

1000
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:42,855
Buzzards, all of you!

1001
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:44,690
You're no different
from the others.

1002
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,943
Wait! Don't forget the 10 yen!

1003
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,195
Right! Allow me!

1004
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:51,864
Here.

1005
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,786
Now go get it.

1006
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:00,581
Oh, my, you dropped it.

1007
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:03,542
Bring me some water over here.
I'm thirsty.

1008
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:06,295
Here's your book.

1009
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:07,963
Pick it up.

1010
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,131
Leave it there!

1011
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,883
We'll never get our 10 yen now.

1012
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,385
Oh, forget about the 10 yen.

1013
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,679
It's nowhere near enough!

1014
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,764
Take that!

1015
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,850
And that!

1016
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:24,104
You're just a spoiled brat,
even if you are a grownup.

1017
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:27,566
Now I know why they stuck you
out here all by yourself.

1018
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:28,901
We're leaving!

1019
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:30,652
Yeah. We quit!

1020
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:32,988
Wait. Don't go!
Gen, Ryuta...

1021
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:36,950
Calling us by our names
is not going to help.

1022
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,494
It's too late.

1023
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:42,998
I'm sorry I hit you.

1024
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:45,501
No, no. I'm glad that you did.

1025
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:48,462
Come on!
You like being slapped around?

1026
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,672
That's kind of weird.

1027
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:52,299
You want to hit him this time?

1028
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,509
My pleasure.

1029
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,970
That's right, that's right.
Hit me. I won't mind.

1030
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,015
Wait a minute. It's
not normal to want to be hit.

1031
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:03,435
When you've gone without human
contact as long as I have...

1032
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:06,230
you're grateful
for anything, even a slap.

1033
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,273
Funny how people change.

1034
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:10,818
My brother and his family
used to be fond of me...

1035
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,945
before the bomb did this to me.

1036
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:16,240
Now they've all left me
out here to die.

1037
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:17,950
My only visitors...

1038
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:20,452
are the people my brother
has paid to look after me...

1039
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:23,455
and none of them has ever
lasted very long.

1040
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:26,959
You were the only ones that
treat me as something more...

1041
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,460
than a freak or a corpse.

1042
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:31,588
You treated me like
a human being, and I'm grateful.

1043
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,722
- Ryuta.
- Yeah, big brother?

1044
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:43,183
- You go tell Mother where I am.
- And you?

1045
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,561
I'll stay here for a while, OK?

1046
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,855
I understand.
I'll tell her. Bye!

1047
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,985
I'm here. Don't worry.
I'm not going to run off.

1048
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:54,987
Thanks.

1049
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,196
Stop that.

1050
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:58,866
Come on, Seiji, no more crying.

1051
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:01,326
The only way
you'll ever get better...

1052
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,954
is to laugh a little,
like this.

1053
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:05,998
Like what?

1054
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,833
Don't do that!

1055
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,751
This!

1056
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:18,927
The boy's right.
I can't just give up.

1057
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:22,514
I never thought
I'd be able to paint again...

1058
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,934
but I won't know if I don't try.

1059
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,616
It's no use! I can't!

1060
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:42,576
Sure you can. You can do it!

1061
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:45,537
Yeah, keep trying.
Don't give up now!

1062
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,249
All right, I'll try.

1063
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:03,722
There's 100 yen for you.

1064
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:05,557
One hundred?

1065
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,476
Zowie!

1066
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:10,062
I might almost say
that it's a miracle...

1067
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:12,564
what you
have done for my brother.

1068
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:15,150
I'm very grateful to you
for making him happy again.

1069
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:17,611
Seriously?
My brother said that?

1070
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:20,447
Uh-huh,
and he gave us enough money...

1071
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,658
to buy all the milk
we'll ever need.

1072
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,661
You deserve it.
You two will come again?

1073
01:11:25,702 --> 01:11:27,955
Sure,
we'll come to check up on you.

1074
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,164
Remember, never give up!

1075
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:32,084
Don't worry, you have my word.
I never will.

1076
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,127
You two have shown me
that nothing is impossible!

1077
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:36,630
Oh, we like sweet potatoes...

1078
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,715
We like 'em a lot...

1079
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:41,510
We like 'em baked
all soft and hot...

1080
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,595
We eat so many
that our tummies get big...

1081
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:48,851
And we fart, fart, fart,
like a couple of pigs...

1082
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:52,604
What do we do like
a couple of pigs?

1083
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:54,356
Fish here! Fresh fish!

1084
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,652
One at a time!

1085
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:03,782
All right, who wants some?

1086
01:12:03,824 --> 01:12:05,242
Milk, ladies and gentlemen!

1087
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:08,120
I've got it,
and it's yours for a price.

1088
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:10,122
Who wants milk?

1089
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,623
Powdered milk!
Better than fresh!

1090
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:13,125
Really. Straight from America.

1091
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:16,378
Well, don't be shy.
Anyone want some?

1092
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:20,132
Excuse me.
I'll take some of that milk.

1093
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:23,552
Yeah? You got any money on you,
little boy?

1094
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,179
Sure, I've got money.

1095
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,555
See?

1096
01:12:26,597 --> 01:12:29,057
The kid's got the cash,
all right.

1097
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:33,145
Tomoko, I hope you're hungry,
'cause we're coming...

1098
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:37,566
with lots and lots of milk!

1099
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:38,901
We got the milk!

1100
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:43,113
Lots of it!

1101
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,491
The milk patrol to the rescue!

1102
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,884
Mother!

1103
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:05,385
Hello!

1104
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:09,056
Look! You'll never guess
what we've got.

1105
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:12,434
Milk! So much milk!

1106
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:13,936
We bought it in the market.

1107
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:16,939
It's in cans from America.
It's better than fresh.

1108
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:18,607
Yeah, just look at all of it.

1109
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,027
Tomoko should be so glad.

1110
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:25,739
Mission accomplished, Captain.

1111
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:26,782
Good work, soldier.

1112
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:28,242
Banzai!

1113
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:32,704
Company eyes left!

1114
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,790
Look, Mother,
all the milk you'll ever...

1115
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:02,818
Dear boys, too late.
Too late!

1116
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:21,086
Tomoko, open your eyes.

1117
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,172
No, you can't die!

1118
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,048
You can't die, little sister.

1119
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,009
No! We've got
all this milk for you.

1120
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,136
Couldn't you wait
just a little longer?

1121
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:44,776
Don't go, little sister.

1122
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,403
Don't go!

1123
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:51,074
How can you leave
without saying good-bye?

1124
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:56,288
It's not fair!

1125
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:57,998
I did everything I could!

1126
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,794
Why couldn't she have waited?

1127
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:21,897
Father, Eiko, Shinji,
I couldn't save Tomoko.

1128
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:23,982
I'm sorry.

1129
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,243
You know,
I heard this man saying...

1130
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:19,872
the grass won't grow here again
for another 70 years.

1131
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:21,874
Do you think that's true?

1132
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:25,127
It's hard to believe
it's possible.

1133
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:28,005
What's going to happen to us?

1134
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:34,595
Are you going to be sad forever,
big brother?

1135
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:37,389
At least we're still alive,
aren't we?

1136
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:38,807
Don't worry, I'll catch it.

1137
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,225
I got it!

1138
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:46,899
Hey, get over here.
Look what I found! Come here!

1139
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,192
What is it?

1140
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,319
Look! Something's growing!

1141
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,989
Yeah, it's wheat!
The wheat's coming up again.

1142
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:58,702
Its life begins in
the coldest season of the year.

1143
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,705
The rain pounds it,
the wind blows it...

1144
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,916
it's crushed
beneath people's feet...

1145
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:06,293
but still, the wheat
spreads its roots and grows.

1146
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,128
It survives.

1147
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,130
Learn from it, boys.

1148
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:13,967
Grow big and strong
and let nothing beat you down.

1149
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:16,094
Can you see it, Father?

1150
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,930
The wheat's growing again.

1151
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,683
Good old wheat.

1152
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,435
Nothing could kill it.

1153
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:25,729
Not the fires, rain,
or diseases. Nothing.

1154
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:29,775
Who said it wouldn't grow
for 70 years? Ha ha!

1155
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:30,943
What a stupid!

1156
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,695
Hey, what's happening
to your head?

1157
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:37,741
My hair! I can feel it.
My hair's growing back again.

1158
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,952
Hey, maybe Tomoko gave you
all her hair when she died.

1159
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:41,453
You think?

1160
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:44,540
- My hair. Tomoko?
- She won't be needing it.

1161
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,416
Yeah, maybe you're right,
little brother.

1162
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,169
This way I'll always have
part of her with me forever.

1163
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:52,965
Isn't it great?
The wheat's growing...

1164
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:55,133
your hair's growing,
and even...

1165
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:57,511
No. Nothing down there yet.

1166
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,179
You idiot!

1167
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:01,515
I'm going to tell Mother!

1168
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:07,479
Don't worry, Father.
I'll never give up.

1169
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,523
I'll grow up big and strong...

1170
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:11,233
and you'll be proud of me,
you'll see.

1171
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:17,489
Come right home
after school, OK, big brother?

1172
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,658
Don't forget, OK?

1173
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,452
'Cause we're going down
the river, right? You promise?

1174
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,839
What's that you're making,
Gen, a boat?

1175
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,048
Yeah.

1176
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:43,515
OK, Shinji,
here's your boat. You ready?

1177
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:46,393
We're finally going to put it
in the river like we said.

1178
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,986
You ready, Ryuta?

1179
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,154
Ready!

1180
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:58,322
How about you, Mother? Ready?

1181
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,531
Ready.
