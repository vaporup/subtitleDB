00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,400
GEORGE ORWELL's
Memorable Fable

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,600
Animal Farm

3
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,500
To the world we all know,

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,200
which may or may not be
the best world possible,

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,200
once again
spring time had come.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
But all the magical spring
was not enough

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,800
to conceal the misery
of Manor Farm.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Once striving and fruitful,
the farm and its owner

9
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,800
Mr. Jones
had fallen on evil days.

10
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,200
This set by problems
of his own making,

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Mr. Jones
had turned to drink.

12
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,100
And for his misery
he had found
fine company.

13
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,900
On the evening
our story begins,
it was later than usual

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,600
when Mr. Jones came home
from drinking
to make his rounds.

15
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On this night,
all the animals
had agreed

16
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,600
that as soon as
Mr. Jones was in bed,

17
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,300
they would gather
in the main barn
for a secret meeting

18
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,000
called by Old Major,

19
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,000
the prized boar hog,
who because of his years

20
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,000
was regarded as by far
the wisest of the animals.

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,600
The other pigs
started first
for the meeting,

22
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,000
being clever and
found to taking the lead.

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
They were followed
by Boxer,

24
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,863
the largest and strongest
of the horses

25
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:30,650
and his devoted friend
Benjamin, the donkey.

26
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:36,474
All the other animals
great and small
were anxious to get there,

27
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:39,808
for such a meeting
has never been held before.

28
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:25,800
Old Major had been ailing
and now he had made known,
there were some things

29
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,888
he wanted to say
to his fellow animals
before it might be too late.

30
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,432
It took a while for all
to find their seats.

31
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,321
The pigs have taken up
the best positions

32
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,728
immediately in front of
the platform.

33
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,188
Among them, Snowball,
determined
to get a good view.

34
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:09,984
And Napoleon,
equally determined
and even less polite.

35
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,298
Dear...
What was that?

36
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:21,825
No.

37
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,546
No it wasn't Mr. Jones.

38
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:38,485
And at last, everyone
could be settled
to hear Old Major.

39
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:48,351
My dear friends,
I have lived
a long live.

40
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:54,314
I have had much time
to thought as I lay
alone in my stall.

41
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:06,938
I won't be with you much longer,
and before I die, there is something
I want to tell you.

42
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:15,700
Few of us will ever know
the blessings
of a peaceful old age.

43
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:23,948
You Boxer, when you have given
the last of your great strength...

44
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,082
what then?

45
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:38,400
Whatever we produce
is taken from us,
stolen from us, and sold.

46
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,345
Our children are born
to cold and hunger.

47
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:55,685
Look at them while you can.

48
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:05,312
You porkers,
do you know what the future
holds for you?

49
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:13,536
Do we deserve such a fate?

50
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:18,025
Is this farm too poor
to support us all?

51
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:23,674
No comrades!
When the farm is rich,

52
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:28,028
we would never get
our rightful share
from Farmer Jones.

53
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:34,821
Who has only seen your tyrant,
and we shall be rich and free!

54
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,500
Comrades,

55
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Revolt!

56
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:01,800
But remember:

57
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:08,692
when you have
got rid of Jones,
don't adopt his vices!

58
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,865
We animals are brothers.

59
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:20,097
Large or small,
clever or simple,
fur or feathers,

60
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:27,326
now and forever,
all animals are equal!

61
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:52,054
The very next morning,
sooner perhaps than
Old Major would have predicted,

62
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,403
the animals
found their situation
quite unbearable.

63
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,648
And so, almost before
they realised it,

64
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,825
the animals have
fought and won.

65
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,820
They had casualties to mourn,

66
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,459
and those who died
left children
to be cared for.

67
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,865
But Manor Farm was theirs
and they lost no time

68
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,884
in destroying everything
that reminded them
of hateful Mr. Jones.

69
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,356
When it came to
Mr. Jones' house,
the animals hesitated.

70
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:41,585
Napoleon showed the way,
but Snowball took the lead

71
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,856
in entering the place
where their
tyrant had lived.

72
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,161
The animals were all agreed,
that Jones' house
was no place for them.

73
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,314
All that is,
except Napoleon.

74
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,444
Meantime, Snowball
lead the other animals
in organizing a new society,

75
00:21:24,644 --> 00:21:29,432
which they now named
Animal Farm.

76
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,885
So that all
might see and agree,

77
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:40,935
the laws of Animal Farm
where inscribed
in a prominent place

78
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:43,558
to be remembered
and obeyed forever.

79
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,108
NO ANIMAL SHALL
SLEEP IN A BED

80
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,728
NO ANIMAL SHALL
DRINK ALCOHOL

81
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,986
FOUR LEGS GOOD
TWO LEGS BAD

82
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:03,929
Wings count as legs.

83
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:16,074
Four legs good,
two legs bad.

84
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:22,574
NO ANIMAL SHALL
KILL ANOTHER ANIMAL

85
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:26,732
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL

86
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,671
Tending farm by themselves
posed problems for the animals,

87
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:04,155
but the pigs could
figure a way around
every difficulty.

88
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:49,853
Boxer was the
admiration of everybody.

89
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,536
He had been
a hard worker
in Jones' time.

90
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:55,604
But now he seemed more
like three horses in one.

91
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:06,227
Instructed by Snowball,
other animals worked out
the rest for themselves.

92
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:09,438
And the farm work
was done like magic.

93
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:17,000
The success
of their efforts
delighted everyone,

94
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:21,074
including the sly Napoleon
and his constant companion,
fat pig Squealer.

95
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:48,000
That summer the animals,
without any help
or any interference,

96
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:51,856
made a going proposition
of Animal Farm.

97
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:15,829
The fields yielded richly
and they were cut and gleamed with
diligence and devotion.

98
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:35,264
With the harvest safely home,
the animals had time
to think of the future

99
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:41,407
and at a meeting in the big barn,
many resolutions were put forward.

100
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:45,106
It was always the pigs
who made the resolutions.

101
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:52,610
Comrades,
our first five month plan
is a farmwide triumph

102
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:57,779
and the time has come
to spread the glorious news,

103
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:02,701
so that our
downtrodden comrades
on other farms

104
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:09,227
will break their chains
and join the
animal revolution.

105
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,515
Go!
Tell them on there's an Animal Farm
to the world!

106
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,704
Some animals,
content with their luck,

107
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:56,639
were unimpressed
by tales of
peace and plenty.

108
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,501
Others,
happy in their
own surroundings,

109
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,774
were alarmed
of the thought of
any change.

110
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,652
But wherever they were having
a bad time, animals listened
with interest.

111
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:11,845
In certain quarters,
the rebellious behavior
of a lot of dumb animals

112
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:15,461
caused indignation,
much conversation,

113
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:18,000
but nothing was done about it,

114
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:21,500
for the drunken Mr. Jones
and his cronies
did not know what to do.

115
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:28,435
Snowball felt that
education was
the animals' next necessity.

116
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:31,346
Some of the animals
were brighter than others,
of course.

117
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:32,175
Four legs good,
two legs bad.

118
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:37,662
Snowball set himself
to solve the problem
of power on the farm.

119
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,897
And so did Napoleon.

120
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,684
In January
there came
bitterly hard weather.

121
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:13,597
Inexperienced management
brought shortages
to Animal Farm,

122
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,657
but Snowball continued
his thinking
for the future.

123
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,552
And in such thoughts,
he was not alone.

124
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:44,532
Comrades,

125
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:49,635
I have prepared
a new plan for
Animal Farm.

126
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,228
Here it is.

127
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,591
All it needs is your votes.

128
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:04,154
At first,
we will have to
work more and eat less,

129
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,262
but my plan
will bring us
electricity.

130
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:16,399
It will mean
a warm pound in winter,

131
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:22,790
a light in every stall,
sty and roost.

132
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,907
Luxury for all!

133
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:36,309
Comrades, in one short year,
Animal Farm will be
the finest in the world.

134
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:40,474
Dreams, dreams.

135
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:47,580
A vote for my plan
is a vote for
a live beautiful.

136
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,785
It's a lie.

137
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:53,407
I promise you a 4 day week.

138
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:54,285
Gush!

139
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:58,198
- Perhaps a 3 day week.
- Nonsense!

140
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,610
A one day week.

141
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:11,816
With Snowball disposed of,

142
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:15,055
Napoleon
stepped up confidently
to take charge of Animal Farm,

143
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:19,541
and fat pig Squealer
became his obedient
follower and assistant.

144
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:30,278
Comrades,
Snowball is a traitor.

145
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,576
What was he really planning?

146
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:40,043
To bring back Jones.

147
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:47,095
Now let's have
no more of these
useless meetings.

148
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:55,417
From now on,
I'll protect
your interests!

149
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:58,813
And I'll make
your decisions!

150
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:09,787
Let me show you
my plan for
Animal Farm.

151
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:19,317
For legs good,
two legs bad.

152
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:25,427
And so the windmill
was started after all.

153
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,629
Nothing could have been
achieved without Boxer,

154
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,452
whose strength was greater
than that of all the other
animals put together.

155
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:34,386
Superintended by the pigs,
all the animals
worked long shifts

156
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,593
which lasted
from dawn till dusk.

157
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,686
Rations were shortened for the workers,
but the pigs

158
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,829
by virtue of
their brainwork

159
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,855
were plentifully provided for.

160
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:08,369
But the greatest inspiration
came from Boxer,

161
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,430
who with his friend Benjamin,
worked early and late,
in season and out.

162
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:36,451
One evening after working
long and late as usual,

163
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:39,509
Boxer and Benjamin
made a curious discovery.

164
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,918
Word of what now went on
at night in Jones' house

165
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,638
spread quickly to Animal Farm.

166
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,653
Some of the animals thought
they remembered
the law against beds,

167
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:20,129
but obviously
they where mistaken.

168
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:49,772
And now, other changes
in the laws of Animal Farm
were in store.

169
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:01,277
- Those ungrateful
beasts of yours.

170
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:05,008
- Cheer up!
They won't last...

171
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,024
Another winter
will bring them
to their knees.

172
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:11,426
- Anyway where are they going to buy
the things they need?

173
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:14,984
In Mr. Jones' circle
the subject of shortages
at Animal Farm

174
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,728
was a popular one.

175
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:22,207
And the sharp trader named Whymper
was just the sort
to do something about it.

176
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:30,041
Comrades, our leader,
as wise as he is beloved,

177
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:33,027
has decided to trade
with the outside world.

178
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:39,000
Not for gain of course, that would
be unworthy of our noble principles.

179
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:43,138
You hens,
are to have the honor of
making the first contribution:

180
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:44,545
all your eggs.

181
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:52,207
I know how proud you are
of this privilege.

182
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:05,306
The chickens
seemed to remember
Old Major saying

183
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:07,102
that their eggs should
never be taken from them.

184
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,463
The innocent suffered with the guilty
and the chicken's uprising
was short lived.

185
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:55,694
Comrades,
I have made
a terrible discovery.

186
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,619
There are
traitors among us.

187
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:10,471
Yes comrades,
in league with
Jones and Snowball

188
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:17,370
to destroy Animal Farm.

189
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:25,415
Who else is guilty?

190
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:28,805
Stand up and confess!

191
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:29,100
NO ANIMAL SHALL KILL
ANOTHER ANIMAL
WITHOUT CAUSE

192
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,205
The revolution is now complete.
We have no more use
for that song.

193
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,427
See it is now forbidden

194
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
under penalty of death.

195
00:48:14,511 --> 00:48:18,460
Trade between Animal Farm
and the outer world
now became quite brisk.

196
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:40,757
As might be expected,
Mr. Whymper's profits
inspired others

197
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:42,763
to seek their share.

198
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,689
Or at least
give vent
to their jealousy.

199
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:51,435
- Animal Farm seems
to be making money
for Whymper.

200
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:09,440
- Who ever heard of
animals running a farm.

201
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,570
- Have you seen their windmill?

202
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:17,275
- Come on and
let's kick 'em out.
- Yes, kick 'em out.

203
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,689
The original owner
was not invited
to join this movement.

204
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:28,643
His neighbours
let him know
his day was done.

205
00:49:54,935 --> 00:49:58,501
Comrades,
the enemy has mobilised
all his forces against us.

206
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:03,872
We must save Animal Farm
from its enemies
at all costs we have.

207
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,313
Now is the time to fight,
to die for Animal Farm...

208
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Victory!

209
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:02,696
Now began the
heartbreaking job
of rebuilding.

210
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:06,991
And as before,
Boxer and Benjamin
worked hardest of all.

211
00:55:08,146 --> 00:55:12,417
By now, supervision
of the work by pigs
was hardly necessary,

212
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:15,493
so they had time
for less laborious
pursuits.

213
00:55:47,988 --> 00:55:50,234
Long after
the other animals
left the job,

214
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:54,127
Boxer and Benjamin
worked on and on,
giving their all

215
00:55:54,327 --> 00:55:57,299
year in, year out.

216
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:21,000
A new generation of pigs
grew up,

217
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:24,254
endowed with what was
considered odds and graces
very flattering to Animal Farm

218
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:27,649
and it's presiding genius.

219
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,315
But still
the windmill
was not finished

220
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:47,180
and Boxer's injured foot
got worse instead of better.

221
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:23,387
It looked as though
Boxer were dead
but he wasn't, not quite.

222
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:30,525
Boxer is hurt badly,
he will never work again.

223
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:31,610
What do we do?

224
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:35,270
While Napoleon and Squealer
made plans for Boxer,

225
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,720
Benjamin predicted
he could look forward
to a well earned rest and retirement.

226
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:53,329
Next day
the windmill work
went on as usual,

227
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:55,885
but now without Boxer.

228
00:58:59,634 --> 00:59:03,049
And during the morning,
what appeared to be
an ambulance arrived.

229
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,693
Only Benjamin suspected
it wasn't an ambulance.

230
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:40,734
The other animals
finally recognised
the death wagon

231
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:43,236
from Mr. Whymper's
glue factory.

232
01:00:57,408 --> 01:01:00,286
I was with him
right to the end,

233
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,585
his last words were:

234
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:07,627
forward comrades,
long live Napoleon.

235
01:01:13,206 --> 01:01:15,795
And for the wicked rumour that Boxer
was sold to a glue factory

236
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:19,532
our belived leader
would never do that.

237
01:01:19,978 --> 01:01:22,360
Long live Napoleon!

238
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:27,406
Long live Napoleon!

239
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:53,967
And that night,
the pigs drank
to Boxer's memory,

240
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:57,759
and the whisky
they had bought
with Boxer's life.

241
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,025
Years passed,

242
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:07,785
the seasons came and went.

243
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,462
The short animal lives fled by.

244
01:02:11,616 --> 01:02:13,858
The completed windmill
stood as a monument

245
01:02:14,058 --> 01:02:16,632
to its builders' fate
and sacrifice.

246
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:23,255
But the animals' revolution
was only dimly remembered.

247
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:27,305
Outwardly Animal Farm
appeared prosperous.

248
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:32,241
But the animals themselves
were no better off,
with the exception of the pigs

249
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:34,949
and their supreme leader
Napoleon.

250
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,000
This pig-run enterprise

251
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:55,500
now had many of the frills
of real civilization.

252
01:02:56,017 --> 01:02:59,128
And one fine day,
pig delegates
from far and wide

253
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:03,046
arrived to Animal Farm
to celebrate
the coming of a new era.

254
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,939
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL

255
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:10,000
BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE
MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS

256
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:24,936
When reports
of this great change
reached them,

257
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:27,779
other animals
everywhere were incredulous.

258
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,500
Dismayed and indignant,
they headed toward Animal Farm
from all directions,

259
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:36,406
instinctively uniting
once again in common cause.

260
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:57,242
Loyal followers!

261
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:04,616
On farms
owned and operated
by the pigs

262
01:05:04,816 --> 01:05:09,217
there is order and discipline.

263
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:17,494
All of the animals
do more work and eat less
than on other farms.

264
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:24,000
With this, I will encourage you
to make your loyal animals

265
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:28,348
work even harder
and eat even less.

266
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:37,702
To a greater Animal Farm.

267
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:42,494
To peace and plenty
under pig rule.

268
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:09,340
To the day when pigs
own and operate farms everywhere.

269
01:06:16,902 --> 01:06:20,993
To the animals, it now seemed
that their world,
which may or may not

270
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:24,000
some day become
a happy place to live in,

271
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:27,022
was worse than ever
for ordinary creatures.

272
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:31,107
And another moment had come
when they must do
something about it.
