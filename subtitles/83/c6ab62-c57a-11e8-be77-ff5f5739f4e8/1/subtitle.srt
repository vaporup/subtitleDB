- We'll take you off the network.
- OK.

168
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,840
Because I guess there were
some complaints about people

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,367

and finding some really...

172
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,651
I noticed you put in a transfer
order for the Lasser Glass.

173
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,167
- Yeah, as a repair.
- Oh.

174
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,084
I thought Warren said no repairs.

175
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,924
He changed his mind.

176
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,522
Got to be honest, I'm really
just waiting for an explanation

177
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,728
for the corpse print-outs.

178
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,286
I know things have been
strange at times.

understand that part of my life.

to third-party repair houses.

186

Oh, yeah, the buyer wants his guy
to look at it before it ships.

- But we both know you'd do it better.
- No argument there.

I'm 23 years old.

267
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,647
I'm with my brother,

268
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,484

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,491
He's 21 years old.

It's 4:15pm on October 13th,

272
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,926
and we are at 2705 Hawthorne Way.

273
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,369
I'll begin by detailing my precautions
before I place and uncover the glass.

274
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,255
There are three cameras, each
on its own independent power circuit,

275
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,931
so if any anomalies occur,
there can be a lucid, objective record.

276
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,095
I have private land lines for today's
experiment, along with my cell phone.

277
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,600
And I will now ask
my brother for his phone,

278
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,843
so that I can control
all electronic devices.

279
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,371
I just got this, you know.

280
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,891
Thanks, Timbo.

281
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,401
This alarm is set to go off
every 45 minutes

282
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,608
to remind me to change
the tapes in the cameras.

283
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,326
This alarm is set to go off
hourly to remind us to eat.

284
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,324
And we're fully stocked
on water to prevent dehydration.

285
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,005
Now, as for the house itself...

286
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,561
each room is fitted
with its own thermostat,

287
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,166
from which data is collected by software
designed to track and record

288
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,840
temperature fluctuations in hospitals.

289
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,735
Any temperature changes greater
than five degrees in either direction

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,683
will set off an alarm.

291
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,490
A third precaution is also in place,

292
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,768
but I'll get into that
in a few more minutes.

293
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,002
So...

294
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,043
The purpose of today's experiment

295
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,487
is to prove that the object
behind me, the Lasser Glass,

296
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,803
is home to an observable,
predictable supernatural force.

297
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,401
There's no scientific equivalent
for the word "haunted,"

298
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,246
so we'll just say this object is
responsible for at least 45 deaths

299
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,528
in the four centuries
of its recorded existence...

300
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,802
Can I just stop you for a second?

301
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,883
Don't ever turn off a camera.

302
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,966
Sorry.

303
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,127
The origin of the
Lasser Glass is unknown,

304
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,288
so I can't provide a complete history,

305
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,286
but the trail starts in London in 1754.

306
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,569

the 17th Earl of Leicester,

307
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200

over his fireplace, and...

- Everything's fine.

312
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,895
I know this is silly to ask,
but could you try to call on the hour?

313
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,809
It's about seven past.

314
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,806
- Uh... Sure.
- I'll talk to you in 53 minutes.

315
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,611
And I love you.

316
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,128
I'm expecting regular calls
from my fiancé, Michael Dumont.

317
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,203
I told him I'm nervous to be
spending time with my recently

318
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,175
un-incarcerated brother,
with instructions...

319
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,361
- to notify the authorities immediately
- Wow.

320
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,851
If I do not answer the phone.

321
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,685
- In the room.
- Nothing personal.

322
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,606
So, in 1755, Philip Lasser was
found in their grand fireplace.

323
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,560
Burned beyond recognition.
While his estate was dismantled

324
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,415
and scattered
throughout southern England,

325
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,807
one of the family's stewards claimed
to see Philip reflected in the mirror.

326
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,128
An allegation apparently taken
seriously enough to warrant

327
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,169
a Church investigation into the house.

328
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,288
The glass, thereafter known
as the Lasser Glass,

329
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,966
is sold in public auction in 1758.

330
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,090
The next known owner
is an American rail road tycoon,

331
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,607
named Robert Clancy, 1864.

332
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,081
Clancy apparently weighed
over 300 pounds.

333
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,322
In fact, while attending
university in Connecticut,

334
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,090
he was known as
the South Windham Whale.

335
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,925
He hung the glass
in his ballroom in Atlanta.

336
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,447
Later that year,
Robert Clancy is photographed

337
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,602
by a local newspaper and, uh...

338
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,001
Well, he's dropped a few pounds.

339
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,283
His obit was printed a few weeks later.
Doesn't list a cause of death.

340
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,046
Unfortunately,
he and his estate and the glass

341
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,727
are presumably destroyed in Sherman's
march to the ocean in 1865.

342
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,571
And after that, the glass is lost.

343
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,246
Until it resurfaces
in turn-of-the-century New England.

344
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,927
The next case of note
is Mary O'Connor, 1904.

345
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,650
She hung the mirror
in her private bathroom.

346
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,122
Two weeks later, her niece Beatrice
finds Mary dead in the bathtub.

347
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,966
Now, the official coroner's report lists
the cause of death as, get this...

348
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,168
...dehydration.

349
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,688
The woman died of thirst while soaking
in a full tub for three days.

350
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,243
The next case of note is Alice Carden
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1943.

351
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,370
Neighbors reported hearing screams
and loud bangs from the house.

352
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,410
The police found the children
drowned in a locked cistern.

353
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,971
Alice herself was in the nursery,

354
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,730
and both of her legs
are completely shattered.

355
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,202
Her left arm is broken in four places,
and six of her ribs are crushed.

356
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,887
In her right hand is a large hammer
she's been using to break her own bones.

357
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,566
They find her just as she's going
to work on her skull.

358
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,842
Her right arm, though,
is completely unharmed.

359
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Because she needed it.
To wield the hammer.

360
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,531
Alice later says she believed she was
tucking the children into their beds

361
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,966
as she sealed them into the cistern.

362
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,281
She never recovers from her injuries.

363
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,440
And, oh, the family kept
several dogs at the farm,

364
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,484
including an Australian shepherd
for the children.

Called you a murderer.

Look, Kaylie, we were just kids.

374

We made up a scary story
so we wouldn't have to accept the fact

375
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,482
that our father was a murderer. He was.

He was a sick man who
tortured and killed our...

Starved to death in his own bedroom.

380
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,370
The mirror was hung over his dresser.
He had a pet Dalmatian.

381
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,289
1965, California.

382
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,250
The mirror hangs in the lobby
of the Hill Trust Bank in San Diego.

383
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,444
A ten-year teller, Marcia Wicker,
locks her manager in the bank vault

384
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,126

through a live power line.

In her nightstand, they find
every single one of her teeth

388
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,201
in a little plastic bag
and a pair of bloody pliers.

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,885
OK then. In 2001,
Mom and Dad bought that new couch.

Same year, Grandpa had a heart attack,
Robbie Schultz got hit by a car.

And our cat ran away.

Oliver Jeffries. 1971.

434
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,804
A teacher at Manhattan's
Duhame Academy,

435
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,371
where the mirror hung
in the central lecture hall.

436
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,966
One morning he reportedly ran
at the mirror with a fireplace poker,

437
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,685
shouting about how it needed
to be destroyed,

438
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,127
but he never struck a blow.
According to the students,

439
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,691
he stood there quietly
for almost a minute

440
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,684
before walking out
of the hall and into traffic.

441
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,401
