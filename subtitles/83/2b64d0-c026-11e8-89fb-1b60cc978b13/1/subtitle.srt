1
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:33,659
HAPPY TIMES

2
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:10,339
The ones I saw before
were all too skinny.

3
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,939
Looked like kittens.

4
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:18,059
I told the matchmaker straight out,
no skinny women for me!

5
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,019
I like them fleshy, nice and warm!

6
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,699
What does a man my age need?

7
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,619
Somebody to keep me cozy!

8
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,179
I've been married twice.

9
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,019
I like a woman with experience!

10
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,579
I've also got two kids.

11
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,499
Two kids?

12
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,059
I love kids!

13
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,299
The more the merrier!

14
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,979
Shall we start planning
our wedding?

15
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,419
So you agree?

16
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:53,219
Let's make our wedding
a real event!

17
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,539
Of course!

18
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,699
We can't just go through the motions.

19
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,019
I agree.

20
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,899
Everyone knows me...

21
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:04,099
I can't be a cheapskate.

22
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,979
We'll need 50 grand.

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,859
That's about right!

24
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,379
You've got 50 grand?

25
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,619
I shouldn't have a problem getting it.

26
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,099
I'll figure it out.

27
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,299
No problem.

28
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,739
Old Zhao's back
to borrow money!

29
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:26,179
- How do you know?
- Look, he's coming.

30
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:30,779
He's trying to get hitched again.
This is the 18th time!

31
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,259
Hasn't worked out once!

32
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,819
He still owes me money!

33
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:38,059
I've gotta get out of here.
Tell him I'm not home.

34
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,179
Fu! Stop!

35
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,899
Fu! Stop pretending
you don't hear me!

36
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:08,419
Zhao, what's wrong?

37
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,699
Stop it! You saw me.

38
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,779
- I didn't.
- Stop playing stupid!

39
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,139
You must know I need cash.

40
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,699
Engaged again?

41
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,099
I finally found one.

42
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:23,419
Look at her!

43
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,419
Big and round.

44
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,939
- Japanese?
- No, Chinese.

45
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,219
Don't you like skinny women?

46
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,819
But they never like me!

47
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,379
She does, she wants to get married.

48
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,259
- Really?
- She told me so.

49
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,859
- No strings?
- She said we need 50 grand.

50
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,379
50 grand! Did you say okay?

51
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,659
Of course.

52
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,419
If you haven't got it, why bullshit?

53
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,299
If I didn't bullshit,
I'd be up the creek!

54
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,139
Find someone else to help.

55
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,099
Come on.

56
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,259
Help your old teacher.

57
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,379
You're the only one I can turn to.

58
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,619
Zhao! Zhao!

59
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,539
I've got some money.

60
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,259
- Money!
- Where from?

61
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,739
Look!

62
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,659
From this?

63
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,219
Here's the woods
behind our factory...

64
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,139
...isn't there an old bus there?

65
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,459
For 7 or 8 years.

66
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,259
Every day, young lovers
stroll back there...

67
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,059
...with no place to unwind!

68
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,979
We'll clean up that bus...

69
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,299
...the lovers can use the place.

70
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,219
We'll charge them.

71
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,739
Me sell tickets?

72
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:27,939
Exactly.

73
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,379
I even have a name
for the place.

74
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,779
We provide a service for these kids.

75
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,819
We'll call it the
"Happy Times Hut."

76
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,379
Forget it!

77
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:37,659
This is a public area.

78
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,579
Who'd pay for this?

79
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,539
Why not be rewarded
for our hard work?

80
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,419
What I'm saying is...

81
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,299
...who in their right mind
would pay to go into an old bus?

82
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,699
You're just sitting
home anyway.

83
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,739
No matter what we charge,
it's money.

84
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,459
I'll never get married this way.

85
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,899
You may get someone
who'd pay...

86
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,659
...200 or 300 in one shot.

87
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,979
Who'd do that?

88
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,619
You'd have to be crazy!

89
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,459
Anyway I don't have the money.

90
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,739
If you don't like my idea,
my hands are tied!

91
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,459
You're using that color?

92
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:42,899
How come it reminds me of
a public toilet?

93
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,779
Stop painting!
Public bathrooms are this color.

94
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,619
You're right!

95
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,939
I found this paint in the dump.
It's all they had!

96
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,099
What do you expect for free?

97
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,659
Let's try this one.

98
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,259
It's so loud.
It's like "all night long" red.

99
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,659
That's it!

100
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,179
Keep them awake
long enough to pay.

101
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,739
Let's go with the "all night long" red.

102
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,019
"All night long" it is!

103
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,939
All right!

104
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,819
Not bad at all.

105
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:23,259
A good fix- up and it looks like new.

106
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,979
I still don't feel good about this.

107
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,819
There you go again.

108
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,019
We've got a good,
clean place here.

109
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,579
So people can unwind.

110
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,979
What are you worried about?

111
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,539
Remember why we're doing this.

112
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,659
- Wow!
- Who fixed this place up?

113
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,139
What a romantic color!

114
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,779
It's even got a name:
"Happy Times Hut."

115
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,059
Not bad?

116
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,619
Come in. Have a look.

117
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,379
You two did this?

118
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,979
There's a collection box?

119
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,859
Give what you want, you decide.

120
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,539
Have some water.

121
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,539
Don't worry.

122
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:12,539
We already checked.
You can't see in from outside.

123
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:15,099
Not a bad place to get out of the sun.

124
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,929
Excuse me, sir!

125
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:33,649
Did you fix this place up?

126
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,569
What do you want?

127
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,169
Nothing, just wondering why?

128
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:40,049
What's inside?

129
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,649
Nothing. It's not mine.

130
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:47,089
C'mon, we just want to have a look.

131
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,649
It's mine. But I'm off work.

132
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,729
Sir, let us take a look.

133
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,089
Just a peek.

134
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,889
You can't see a thing.

135
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,369
A collection box.

136
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:09,489
"Let your conscience be your guide."
Pretty unique.

137
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:28,049
Sir, are you going to just sit there?

138
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,529
I always sit here.

139
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,529
Don't you want to get some fresh air?

140
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,489
Am I in your way?

141
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,289
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,249
What are you up to, then?

143
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,129
Nothing.

144
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,009
Trying to bribe me?

145
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,889
Your years are catching up with you,
old man.

146
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,729
Giving you ideas.

147
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,329
I just wanted you
to buy us some stuff.

148
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,649
What?

149
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,529
A watermelon.

150
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,489
A big one.

151
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:07,729
A 100- yuan watermelon?

152
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,649
I don't have anything smaller.

153
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,849
Thanks for helping us out.

154
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,529
Sorry I haven't called,
I've been swamped with work.

155
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,609
At the hotel.

156
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:21,169
No, I opened it up with a few colleagues.

157
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,049
Why would I mention it
on our first date?

158
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,849
It's the busy season.

159
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,409
Oh, yeah, it makes money!

160
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,609
No matter how much I'm worth,
I won't forget you.

161
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,169
You're the reason I work so hard.

162
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,289
- Do you sell roses?
- 2 yuan each.

163
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,249
- How much?
- 2 yuan each.

164
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:44,209
Too expensive!

165
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,449
What other flowers
make a good gift?

166
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,689
That depends.

167
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,969
Women want roses.

168
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,249
It's a woman all right.

169
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,169
Then roses.

170
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,089
Anything cheaper?

171
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,769
Look at you, you're a disgrace!

172
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:31,569
We'd be better off if you died!
Feeding you is a waste!

173
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,529
Mom, some grandpa is here!

174
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,409
So soon!

175
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,969
What do you mean grandpa?
Call him uncle.

176
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,449
Have a seat. Excuse me
while I change clothes.

177
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,889
How old are you?

178
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:46,169
Can you fix my game?

179
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:51,449
No problem.
Was your mom yelling at you?

180
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,329
No, at her.

181
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,289
Your sister?

182
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,809
She's not my sister.
My mom didn't have her!

183
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:00,849
Whose is she?

184
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,929
Can't you hurry up, grandpa?

185
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,529
Don't call me grandpa.
Call me uncle.

186
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:08,009
So hurry up, uncle!

187
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,369
Okay, okay.

188
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,169
Roses for me?

189
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,729
- Must've been expensive.
- 2 yuan a dozen.

190
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,889
I mean, 2 yuan a stem.

191
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,089
Where should I put them?

192
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,169
When the party leaders
visit sick people on TV...

193
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,849
...they put the flowers
beside the bed.

194
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,569
Good idea.

195
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,689
Okay, then.

196
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,529
Sorry you had to hear me
yelling at the kids.

197
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,769
My stepdaughter really drives me nuts!

198
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,449
The day we got divorced,
her father flew the coop.

199
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,409
Took all my money too.

200
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,289
He agreed to pay child support.

201
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,129
I haven't seen a penny.

202
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,649
I do everything for her.

203
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:06,969
You have a kind heart.
If it were me...

204
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,529
...I'd get her father to take her.

205
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,009
Turn her out?
How'd that look?!

206
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,809
I'd be known as,
"The wicked stepmother!" "Evil woman!"

207
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,889
Let them say what they want.

208
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,489
You've got to look out for yourself.

209
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,089
A strange thing
happened at work today.

210
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,209
What?

211
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,529
A guest gave one of our employees
a 100-yuan tip.

212
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,169
Everyone is rich these days.

213
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,289
He said, "I'll be back soon!"

214
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,169
So your hotel is doing well?

215
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:40,209
It all comes down to the name.

216
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,889
I came up with it myself.

217
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,049
Just like the two of us
when we're together...

218
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,969
...I call it "Happy Times."

219
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,009
- Are you happy right now?
- Can't you tell?

220
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,929
Tell her it's dinnertime.

221
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,889
Why me again?

222
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,929
How else is she supposed to know?

223
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,209
Hurry up!

224
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,329
- So many dishes!
- I hope you like them.

225
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,449
Don't kick the door!

226
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,649
This kid needs some manners.

227
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,329
Dinnertime!

228
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,889
Please, help yourself.

229
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,569
- Here, have more.
- I'll help myself.

230
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,529
- This is your Uncle Zhao.
- Hi.

231
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,609
Go on, eat up.

232
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,809
Try some vegetables.

233
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:48,729
- Eat up.
- It's good.

234
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,769
Don't be polite.

235
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,529
Kids...

236
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,489
...always stealing from each other.

237
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:13,009
Stop playing. Eat!

238
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,569
We had a letter from Dad.

239
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,129
Why didn't I see it?

240
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,449
You weren't home.

241
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:20,929
Where's the letter?

242
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:23,889
Mom, I wasn't home either.
I played soccer.

243
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,809
Soccer?

244
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,369
You're a soccer player?

245
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,329
Excuse me while I read this.

246
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,449
What did my dad say?

247
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,249
Nothing, eat.

248
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,689
Tell me what he said.

249
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,249
Nothing. Eat your dinner.

250
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,649
Here's...

251
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:57,809
You keep it.

252
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,889
You eat with your left hand?

253
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,329
Ever since I was a kid.

254
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,649
What about when you write?

255
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,129
I do everything else right-handed.

256
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,049
Chopsticks too?

257
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,209
Not really.

258
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,809
- Tough, isn't it?
- I still can.

259
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:20,889
Get some ice cream for uncle too.

260
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,849
- No, thanks.
- Hey, Mom, he doesn't want any!

261
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,329
He's too polite to ask.

262
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,929
Ice cream is for kids.

263
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,009
Why don't you give her a cup?

264
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,569
No way! Ice cream is expensive!

265
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,369
Mom bought it for me.

266
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,569
Who ever said that?
Each of you gets one.

267
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,729
You're getting so selfish.

268
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,689
Go on, eat.

269
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,489
- Take care.
- Okay.

270
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:57,369
- Call me.
- I will.

271
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,649
Don't think just because we have company,
you can eat the good stuff!

272
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,529
You're listening to TV too!

273
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:10,849
Go! Wash the dishes!

274
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,049
Shall we put him to bed?

275
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,969
Let him sleep.

276
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,969
Your leg will fall asleep.

277
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,809
It's not... convenient with him here.

278
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,809
I can't move him anyway.

279
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,089
I'll help you.

280
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,649
- What's she doing?
- Going to the bathroom.

281
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,489
Like that?

282
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,009
Yes.

283
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,609
Does she know I'm here?

284
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,129
How could she know?

285
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,689
I should probably go.

286
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:23,249
Just be quiet.

287
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,609
Let me ask you...

288
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,489
How big is it?

289
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,849
When you say "it"...

290
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,969
...do you mean the hotel?

291
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,529
The hotel.

292
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,489
You want to bring us customers?

293
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,329
No need! Business is booming!

294
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:20,129
Don't worry about me.

295
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,129
I'm not worried about you...

296
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,729
...what about us?
- What do you mean?

297
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,289
Having her around
isn't convenient.

298
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,449
Can you find her
a job at your hotel?

299
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,649
No, out of the question.

300
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:34,929
What's wrong with you?

301
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,889
I haven't even finished talking...

302
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,529
And all you say is "no"!

303
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,329
I didn't mean anything by it...

304
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,449
...you tell me, what can she do?

305
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,929
Nothing really.

306
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,009
Just give her some chores!

307
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,569
Let her clean the bathrooms, whatever.

308
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,489
You don't have to pay her.

309
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,329
Just give her some food.

310
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,329
No, I really...

311
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:01,089
Don't think that
I'm dumping her off on you.

312
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,569
That's not my intention.

313
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,649
Take just now for instance...

314
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,129
...was it convenient when...

315
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:10,769
...she barged in on us like that?

316
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:13,329
The hotel is a joint investment.

317
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,529
I'll talk it over with the other owners.

318
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,369
Aren't you the general manager?

319
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,929
Can't you decide things like this?

320
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,809
You're the one who came up with
"Happy Times."

321
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:29,409
But I wrote, "Hut," not "Hotel!"

322
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,729
No sense arguing.

323
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,000
"Hut" and "Hotel" are almost the same.

324
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:37,379
Anyway, help me find the girl a job!

325
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,979
Hey, she asked you, not me!

326
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:42,419
You're the big shot manager.

327
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:45,059
Besides she can't work anywhere else.

328
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,419
What should I do?

329
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,939
What a mess!

330
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,419
Is this girl completely blind?

331
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,979
If she weren't...

332
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,179
...she wouldn't need our help.

333
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:01,499
So she can't see a damn thing?

334
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,419
- It should be a snap then!
- How?

335
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,179
Her weakness can play
into your strength.

336
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,019
She's blind,
you can tell her whatever you want.

337
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,099
And my strength?

338
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,379
Being a good bullshitter!

339
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,859
Stop messing with me!

340
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,379
Everyone knows...

341
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,779
...you talk out of
both sides of your mouth!

342
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,179
The only way to the altar
is to keep deceiving her!

343
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,819
Bring the girl to the old bus...

344
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,899
...tell her it's our hotel.

345
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:30,459
Beat-up places are
all the rage these days!

346
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:33,019
Say that our style is returning
to the simple life.

347
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,219
I don't think you should
be looking for work.

348
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,219
It's nice staying at home.

349
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,299
Why do you want a job?

350
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,899
I'm talking to you!

351
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,699
Why should I stay there?

352
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,259
It's still your home.

353
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,459
It's not my home!

354
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,939
Then what are you doing
living there?

355
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,259
You should be grateful!

356
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,419
They're nice to you.

357
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,739
You all hate me!

358
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,259
Hate you?

359
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,139
If I hate you so much...

360
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,499
...why would I give you a job?

361
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,339
You're only doing it for her!

362
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,499
What a mouth on you!

363
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,259
I'm over 50 years old, what's wrong
with doing something for a woman?

364
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,619
You wanted out
of that house anyway.

365
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:37,019
You should blame your father for this.

366
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:44,619
Would a real man ditch
his own daughter?

367
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,899
He never should have gotten married.

368
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:53,659
Leaving his child
for someone else to take care of!

369
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:55,579
He doesn't pay child support!

370
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:58,139
You can't blame
your stepmother for...

371
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,979
Hey, where are you going?

372
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:08,899
Why'd you get off here?

373
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:12,619
What if that bike ran into you?

374
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,139
Hey, I'm talking to you!

375
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:17,339
Don't touch your watch,
I know what time it is.

376
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,259
What's wrong with you?

377
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,459
- I'm not going to your hotel.
- Why?

378
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:23,779
None of your business!

379
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,219
How's it none of my business?

380
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,859
- I promised your mom...
- She's not my mom!

381
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:30,179
Okay, my girlfriend then.

382
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,459
We agreed that I give you a job.

383
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,619
If you don't go, what do I tell her?

384
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,939
- You really don't want to go?
- No!

385
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,339
That's just fine!

386
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,259
There's nothing great
about my hotel anyway.

387
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,779
But do me one favor,

388
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,299
Tell her the hotel was nice...

389
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,819
...but you didn't want the job.

390
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:56,379
- Can you do that?
- No!

391
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,339
Why not?

392
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,779
It's not that hard to do.

393
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:02,139
Then you tell her!

394
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,619
Stubborn kid!

395
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,619
Why are you so difficult?

396
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,539
You can't blame my dad!

397
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,739
I was wrong, okay?

398
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,899
Do you know how hard it is
for a man my age to find a wife?

399
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,059
By chance I met your mom and...

400
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,979
She's not my mom!

401
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,939
Okay!

402
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,099
She trusted me to find you a job...

403
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,939
...and I end up screwing up the whole thing.

404
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,819
I beg you.

405
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,979
Come work at my hotel.

406
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,219
If you don't like it, leave.

407
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:46,299
That way, at least I did
what she asked me to.

408
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:47,779
All right?

409
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,699
What am I going to do with you?

410
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,899
Will you please go with me?

411
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,459
Name?

412
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:02,299
We're filling out an application for you.

413
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:05,499
All employees must fill it out.

414
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:07,979
The guy talking to you
is Manager Fu.

415
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,619
He's in charge of daily operations.

416
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,539
From now on, call him Manager Fu.

417
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,459
- Okay, go ahead!
- Name?

418
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:15,739
Wu Ying.

419
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:18,699
- Wu Ying, that's spelled W... U...
- Got it.

420
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,339
Ying as in yellow.

421
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,899
How do you write that?

422
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,059
Like this!

423
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:30,939
Oh, okay, I've got it!

424
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:33,859
I'm so used to the computer,
I forgot how to write!

425
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,779
- Age?
- 18.

426
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,099
You're 18?

427
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,059
Don't be suspicious.
18 is 18!

428
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:41,339
Education?

429
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:43,699
Elementary school,
but I didn't finish.

430
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,739
Was it a school for the blind?

431
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:47,619
No, I could still see then.

432
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:51,299
So you lost your sight later?

433
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,739
You have to put all this in?

434
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,659
We need to know all about you...

435
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,219
...to give you a suitable job.

436
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,259
That's right!

437
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:00,899
Explain what happened to your eyes.

438
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,539
When I was little I had a brain tumor.

439
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,339
It swelled and put pressure
on my optic nerve.

440
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:11,859
At first I had a headache...

441
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,859
...so bad that I couldn't sleep.

442
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,419
Then, my face started to go numb...

443
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,739
...I lost all feeling...

444
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,859
...on one side of my body.

445
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,419
My vision started to go.

446
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,659
At first
I could still see colors and light...

447
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,979
...but gradually I went completely blind.

448
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,339
Let's go on.

449
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,179
Tell us about your mother.

450
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,859
She's been gone a long time now.

451
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,899
When did you lose her?

452
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:47,699
Back when I could still see.

453
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,979
So we'll write down
that she's deceased.

454
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,419
We're very interested...

455
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,659
...in learning just when
your father and that...

456
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,579
...that woman got divorced?

457
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,139
Do you know...

458
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,699
...whose fault it was?

459
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,259
Now you're being nosey.

460
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,299
No, this is relevant information!

461
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:13,339
When we recruit new staff members...

462
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,699
...we need to know everything!

463
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,419
We can't ignore their background.

464
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,979
What if her family comes
and makes trouble?

465
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,579
Go ahead, tell us whose fault it was.

466
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:27,459
You should explain.

467
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,019
Just to clear this up.

468
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,459
Tell us exactly what happened
with your father.

469
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:38,259
They started arguing the day
we moved into her apartment.

470
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,539
They'd argue all day and night.

471
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,059
Sometimes they got into fights...

472
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,299
...and threw things all over the place.

473
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,859
No one could reconcile them.

474
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:52,379
Finally, my dad left.

475
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,099
- Did she ever hit him?
- Where'd your father go?

476
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:00,739
Far away, to Shenzhen.

477
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,939
He said when he had enough money...

478
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:07,779
...he'd come back for me
and cure my eyes.

479
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,139
This isn't the main building
of Happy Times Hotel.

480
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:22,499
This branch is in a secluded
wooded area.

481
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:24,339
Can you smell it?

482
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,739
Fresh air!

483
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,819
Can you tell?

484
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,219
The scenery is beautiful!

485
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,779
But the design isn't anything fancy.

486
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:38,379
It's made up of old buses.

487
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:43,619
The older the bus,
the higher the rate.

488
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,419
It's all about the simple life.

489
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:51,179
I got this idea listening to customers.

490
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,859
Rich people love it!

491
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,419
Your job is easy.

492
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,379
You just wait outside.

493
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:04,019
When the guests leave,
you tidy up.

494
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,779
Once you're done, you come back out.
That's all.

495
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,739
I'll bring you lunch
from our employee cafeteria.

496
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,819
Wait a second!

497
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:32,899
Sir, how come you're
hauling that bus away?

498
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,459
- We're cleaning up this area.
- Who told you to do this?

499
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,339
The boss.

500
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:40,539
- Where are you taking the bus?
- No idea.

501
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,419
What are you going to do here?

502
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:44,379
Beautify the area.

503
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:50,179
What's wrong with you guys?

504
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:52,659
How many times do I have to tell you?

505
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:55,299
Keep me informed of everything.

506
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:59,139
Didn't we decide to start in 2 weeks?

507
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,899
So how come you're here?

508
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:05,499
Aren't I the boss around here?

509
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:09,979
I want a full report!

510
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,099
Now get back to work!

511
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,779
What a mess!

512
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,259
We were planning some renovations...

513
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,859
...but they showed up early.

514
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,619
You can't start work today.

515
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,419
Renovations will take a week or two...

516
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:31,099
...so you'll have to wait.

517
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:34,179
When you go back,
explain it all to her.

518
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:35,619
I'm not explaining anything!

519
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:38,179
Just tell her what happened.

520
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,019
You tell her!

521
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,019
She'd never believe me.

522
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,579
Why should she?
I don't even believe you.

523
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,699
Why don't you believe me?

524
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,619
It sure didn't sound like it.

525
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,259
- Like what?
- People doing renovations.

526
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:57,379
What do you know about renovations?

527
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,579
We're not putting up wallpaper here.

528
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,139
This is a huge job.

529
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,619
It's not your average hotel.

530
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,899
We're working with a group of buses.

531
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,459
We weren't happy with the location...

532
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:15,259
...so that crane you heard was
moving the buses to a new one...

533
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,539
...understand?

534
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,099
We are also planting flowers
and grass...

535
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:21,659
...to liven up the area.

536
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,259
It will still take a month or two...

537
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,699
...you know, for the grass to grow,
the flowers to bloom.

538
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:30,659
Explain all this to her.

539
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,219
I'm not saying anything!

540
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,419
Then don't!

541
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,139
But don't shoot your mouth off, either.

542
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,579
Excuse us!

543
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,579
Be careful!

544
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,419
How come you're back?

545
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:51,339
Hands off! That's my piano!

546
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,899
Mom gave this room to me!

547
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,259
Get out! Scram!

548
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,419
Get out!

549
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,219
I don't have room for her.

550
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,699
Do I look like I have
a place to put her?

551
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:05,379
I replaced her old furniture
with new stuff.

552
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,339
You can't expect me
to change it back?

553
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,459
Of course not.

554
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,459
Now you're talking sense.

555
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,419
Come and check out my new place.

556
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:18,179
It's got a great vibe.
You'll feel it.

557
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:21,179
Right now I can't feel a thing.

558
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,339
I'm in one hell of a bind.

559
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,659
Do you have a massage room
at your hotel?

560
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:27,819
A massage room? What for?

561
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,899
Every hotel today
has a massage parlor.

562
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,499
She studied massage,
she's pretty good.

563
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,379
Open a massage parlor.

564
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:40,459
All you need is a room and a bed.

565
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:43,019
Who knows, she might
even bring a profit.

566
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,339
No way. You don't know
what my hotel is like.

567
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,899
Listen, it's a good idea.
It's settled!

568
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:52,939
But nothing's set up.

569
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:57,019
- She's leaving!
- Leaving?

570
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,139
Well, go after her!

571
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,539
But don't bring her back to me!

572
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:50,579
What the hell are you doing?

573
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,779
What if you got hit?

574
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:58,139
Hold it right there!

575
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,179
What are you trying to pull?

576
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,339
How'd you run so fast?

577
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,059
You scared the hell out of me!

578
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,899
Why were you standing out there?

579
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,059
What, are you sick of living?

580
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:15,499
If you want to kill yourself,
at least tell me first!

581
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:17,419
How am I supposed to explain this?

582
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,219
What's wrong with you?

583
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:21,299
Standing in the middle of the street!

584
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,819
What if you got hit?

585
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,499
What were you thinking?

586
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,659
Say something!

587
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,699
Okay, you're right!

588
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,579
We leave in the morning and now...

589
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:41,059
...you don't even have a place to stay!

590
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,659
She did go too far!

591
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,899
Don't cry!

592
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:51,339
Do you have any relatives here?

593
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:58,419
You can't go off to your father broke.

594
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:03,499
And he can't come get you right away.

595
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,699
Come with me, okay?

596
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,099
Come back with me.

597
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,099
I'll set up a massage room.

598
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,059
So you can work.

599
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,499
I know you don't trust me...

600
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,419
...but I'm different from her.

601
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:26,939
I'm disappointed in her too.

602
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,779
What do you say?

603
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:31,659
Come back with me?

604
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:32,979
Don't cry.

605
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,579
- This is your apartment?
- Yes

606
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,779
Where's the refrigerator?

607
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:54,099
Don't have one.

608
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,659
A general manager would
have a refrigerator.

609
00:35:56,899 --> 00:36:01,139
This is, uh, one of our
employee apartments.

610
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:04,299
Didn't you say this was yours?

611
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,819
My employees and I are one big family.

612
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:08,779
Their place is my place.

613
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,979
- So where do you live?
- I live...

614
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:13,939
...in a luxury villa.

615
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,019
Most of my neighbors are foreigners.

616
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,339
I turned on the water heater.

617
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,099
When you're finished...

618
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,179
...turn this faucet.

619
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,019
Don't burn yourself.

620
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:07,179
I've got a guest staying with me.

621
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:08,979
Can you lend me a room?

622
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,379
Did you ask your buddies?

623
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,579
They're overcrowded themselves.

624
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:16,779
Isn't that office of ours empty?

625
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:19,139
That office is all sealed up.

626
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:20,659
Any others?

627
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,819
They're off-limits.

628
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,379
What should I do?

629
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,619
How about I stay at the workshop?

630
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:33,819
Nobody's working there.

631
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:37,259
Okay. It's going to be demolished
soon anyway.

632
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,179
- So you agree?
- Yes.

633
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:41,739
- I'm approved?
- Sure.

634
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,299
What's the rush?

635
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,219
Why move this damn thing anyway?

636
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:59,659
Push! Harder!

637
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,539
Watch your fingers!

638
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,299
Not bad...

639
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:19,499
...it's starting to look like a room.

640
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,419
Not bad.

641
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,779
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Wait!

642
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,819
Once the girl feels the sheet metal,
she'll know it's a fake!

643
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,419
We have to figure out something.

644
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,059
What?

645
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,019
Well, next...

646
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,539
...we probably should...

647
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:38,059
...make this place...

648
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:41,939
Have you ever been to
a massage parlor?

649
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,579
- Nope.
- You?

650
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,099
- Never in my life.
- And you two?

651
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,299
- Never.
- Me neither.

652
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:52,219
Then why waste time yapping?
Let's go look at a real one.

653
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:06,899
Forget this place, too high-class.

654
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:12,619
Too fancy for us.

655
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:43,379
- What's this?
- For breathing.

656
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,779
It's huge!

657
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,899
You said to make it
as big as a sink.

658
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:55,899
I said make it the size of a face.

659
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:57,419
Didn't you say sink?

660
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,819
No one can possibly
fall through the hole!

661
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:12,379
Not this side. It's too wide.

662
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:20,259
Feel with your eyes closed.

663
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:24,939
It's just like the real thing.

664
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:29,419
Not bad at all.

665
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:33,939
Something's not right.

666
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:36,459
What are we missing?

667
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:39,059
Our place is more spacious.

668
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:41,339
No, it's not that.

669
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:42,819
What's missing?

670
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:44,019
They had 2 beds...

671
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,739
- We're missing sound.
- What?

672
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:48,659
Sound, noise!

673
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:51,739
It's too quiet here.

674
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:56,339
Why did the other place have
so much noise?

675
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,499
That place was located
right on the main street!

676
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,299
So, there's no sound.
What's the big deal?

677
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,059
Don't be ridiculous!

678
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,099
It's got to seem real.

679
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:11,699
If the girl is with a client
and it's dead-quiet...

680
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,259
...who will believe
it's a real massage parlor?

681
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,099
We can't move an entire street
over here!

682
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,939
Li, don't you have
a boom box at home?

683
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,339
Take it to a massage parlor
and record the street.

684
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:28,979
We'll hit 'play',
and the problem will be solved!

685
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,179
On my wedding day...

686
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,019
...all of you will sit
at the head table with me.

687
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,859
Tomorrow when the clients come,
everything will go according to plan.

688
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:42,379
Oh, no.

689
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,459
Who is she going to massage tomorrow?

690
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:50,059
We don't have any clients lined up.

691
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:54,459
What are you laughing at?

692
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,899
I can't bring strangers
to this place.

693
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:59,059
If they say anything to the girl...

694
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,619
...our work is wasted.

695
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,459
You're my friends.
Come back tomorrow for a massage.

696
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:08,379
Come back tomorrow?

697
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,939
You don't have to work.

698
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:13,779
You get a free massage.

699
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:17,619
Won't she be able to feel it's
the same people over and over again?

700
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:22,739
Tell the girl she's so good,
you're back for more.

701
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,299
Right. This massage stuff
gets addictive.

702
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:30,419
Why thank me?
It's all for us, isn't it?

703
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:32,979
She starts tomorrow.

704
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:36,139
She's staying at our employee dorm.

705
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,099
Nice place.

706
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:43,859
Anyway, I just hope you understand
why I'm doing all this.

707
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,539
You know what
my feelings are for you.

708
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:55,219
I told you to record street noises.
What's this?

709
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,899
The street at the entrance
to the massage parlor.

710
00:43:58,059 --> 00:43:59,739
This is the street?

711
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,739
Does this sound like
a street to you?

712
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,699
I recorded it on the street.

713
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,219
Where'd you put the mike?

714
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:08,139
Here's the street
and here's the massage parlor...

715
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:09,459
...I put the box here.

716
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:11,979
You pointed the mike
in the wrong direction!

717
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:13,259
Then I'll do it again.

718
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,619
Too late!
She'll be here any minute.

719
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:17,739
Play it from the other side
of the workshop...

720
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,539
...we'll see how it sounds.

721
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:20,499
Hurry!

722
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,179
Farther!

723
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:27,979
Keep going!

724
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:32,459
That's good!

725
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:35,059
They're here.

726
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:02,969
Right now we're going
in the main entrance.

727
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:05,649
A steel gate, be careful!

728
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:08,169
We're in the hallway.

729
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,009
Feel this,
over here is an arched doorway.

730
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:14,609
They really fixed the place up nice.

731
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:18,409
Feel this.

732
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:24,849
Linen wallpaper.

733
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:28,049
Turn here.

734
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:31,769
Once you come in,
you make 2 lefts.

735
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:33,769
This is the first.

736
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:36,329
Feel here.

737
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,929
Left again,
we're at the end of the hallway.

738
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:45,209
Check it out...

739
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:46,889
...it's a really big room.

740
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:58,309
- This massage room is huge.
- Well, our hotel is huge.

741
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,109
A real high-class joint.
This is the massage bed...

742
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:05,349
...it's a first-rate bed.

743
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:10,189
The hole's so big.

744
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:12,909
Whatever we do...

745
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,509
...we do it big.

746
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,749
I'm ready to start now.

747
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,629
I'll wait here for the customers.

748
00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:23,869
Relax! I'll bring a customer
when one arrives.

749
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:25,469
Manager Zhao!

750
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:29,429
- How do I look?
- Pretty good.

751
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:31,469
This is my best outfit.

752
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:34,109
I save it for special occasions.

753
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:36,669
I want to make a good impression.

754
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:38,069
Do you like it?

755
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:40,309
Yes. It's very pretty.

756
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:49,909
You're getting massaged
so I can get married...

757
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:52,469
If you're not paying, we're leaving!

758
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:56,069
Wait, I just need to figure this out.

759
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:59,429
You guys enjoy everything
while I foot the bill, is that fair?

760
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:01,909
Cough up your share!

761
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,309
How much?

762
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,269
10, 20 yuan will do.

763
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:06,509
How about 2 or 3?

764
00:47:06,669 --> 00:47:08,469
Are you kidding?
At least 5!

765
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:11,669
Fork over the cash!

766
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,789
I'd pay if I wanted to get married.

767
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,789
Keep it down! I'll pay.

768
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,989
When it comes to money,
you all go nuts!

769
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:23,789
How can you expect them to pay?

770
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:26,989
You dropped some.

771
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:31,349
Don't keep it
to buy a bottle of soy sauce!

772
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:35,349
Little Wu, I've got a customer for you.

773
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:37,789
This is Professor Li
from the Teachers College.

774
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:40,429
A faithful customer.

775
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:42,349
Hello, Professor Li.

776
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:45,309
This is Little Wu.

777
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:49,389
She came to us highly recommended.

778
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:52,589
This is your tip.

779
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,709
Go ahead. I'll be going.

780
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:07,349
I'm sorry, Professor Li.

781
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:12,429
The hole's too big.
Your head must be uncomfortable.

782
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:20,149
Professor Li,
you used to come here often?

783
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:23,949
Who massaged you?
A man or a woman?

784
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:27,789
Am I rubbing too hard?

785
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:30,989
Just let me know.

786
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,059
How was it?

787
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:47,339
Keep it down!

788
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:49,859
I thought I'd died
and gone to heaven.

789
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:54,379
You were right.
The hole should be as big as a face.

790
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:55,979
My head had nowhere to rest.

791
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,339
It fell right into the hole.

792
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:59,499
- You're really an idiot.
- Why?

793
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:02,019
You didn't act like a real client.

794
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,619
She asked you questions
but you didn't answer.

795
00:49:04,899 --> 00:49:07,139
I didn't know what to say.

796
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,099
Tell her anything.

797
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:12,179
Don't tell me you don't know
how to make small talk?

798
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:14,819
Since you know everything,
you go next.

799
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:16,739
Yeah, Niu, you're next.

800
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,939
Zhao, you go in with me.

801
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:25,739
I'm the general manager.
I'll give it away if I go in every time.

802
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,739
Don't talk too much.
Pull yourself together!

803
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,439
You look like a bum,
not a restaurant manager!

804
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:44,179
He's worse than me.

805
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,819
Since when has he ever
kept his mouth shut?

806
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,259
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself!

807
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:50,659
Let's go look!

808
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:52,539
Keep it down!

809
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:06,459
Manager Zhao, is there
an ice cream shop around here?

810
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:07,939
You want ice cream?

811
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:10,419
I made money today.
I'll treat you.

812
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:11,659
I can't let you pay.

813
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,579
There's a place.

814
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,619
I'll go buy the ice cream.

815
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,539
Wait here.

816
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:20,539
Can I help you?

817
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,019
How much is the cheapest ice cream?

818
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:24,499
- 25 yuan.
- For how much?

819
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:25,859
One scoop.

820
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:27,539
- How big is it?
- About this big.

821
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:30,019
25 yuan for that?

822
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,099
That store was closed,
so I bought you a popsicle.

823
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,859
- Thank you.
- Eat first, before we go.

824
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:58,499
Here, have a seat.

825
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:11,539
Is this Beida Street?

826
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,739
Yeah. It is.

827
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:14,859
Is it very crowded?

828
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,699
Oh, yeah.

829
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,459
What's everyone doing?

830
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:22,819
Some are going home,
others are taking their kids out...

831
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,939
...for a walk or going shopping.

832
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:29,819
What's on your mind?

833
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:33,059
Manager Zhao, it wasn't easy
for you to find me this job.

834
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:35,619
I promise I'll work hard.

835
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:38,819
When I save some money,
I'll find my dad.

836
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:44,379
We agreed that once he had enough money,
he'd take me to cure my eyes.

837
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:47,139
You think I can be cured?

838
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:49,699
No question.

839
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:53,539
Guess what I want to see most
once I regain my sight.

840
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:54,699
Your dad, of course.

841
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,739
I want to see you too.

842
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:59,779
Why do you want to see me?

843
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:01,259
I want to see what you look like.

844
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,139
You're pulling my leg.

845
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,979
- No, really.
- I'm not easy on the eyes.

846
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:10,819
What do you imagine
I look like?

847
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,739
Can I touch you?

848
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,219
Touch me?
Anyone can tell that way.

849
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:17,859
Here, little head, skinny bones.

850
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,339
I'll try.
You tell me how close I am.

851
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:23,659
- Let's try. Should we stand up?
- Okay.

852
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:27,459
This is my head.

853
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:30,659
- Your hair is so short.
- Anyone could tell that.

854
00:53:30,979 --> 00:53:35,179
- How come you're so short?
- Short? How about now?

855
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:37,699
I wasn't standing up straight.

856
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,259
- You have thick eyebrows.
- Right.

857
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:41,539
Huge eyes!

858
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:44,099
Do I have bags under my eyes?

859
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:46,659
Suitcases!

860
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:47,979
Naughty girl.

861
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:48,259
I'll give you 40 yuan.

862
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,179
I paid over 500.

863
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:53,179
That set is worthless.

864
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:54,659
It works fine.

865
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:57,219
If it doesn't,
I won't pay you a penny.

866
00:55:57,259 --> 00:55:58,539
40 yuan is a good deal.

867
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:08,739
- What color is this dress?
- It's a flower pattern.

868
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,059
What kind of flowers?

869
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:16,859
Well... the dress is red.
The flowers are...

870
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:18,739
...they're sunflowers.

871
00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:22,659
- Are they golden yellow?
- Right, with white petals.

872
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,139
And what kind of red?

873
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:29,659
Deep red, like a big apple.

874
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:31,579
A big red apple.

875
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,859
- That's my favorite color.
- Well, that's exactly how it is.

876
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:38,819
- Are there a lot of flowers?
- Tons, too many to count.

877
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,139
Is it too flowery?

878
00:56:40,419 --> 00:56:42,659
Oh, no, it looks great.

879
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,619
I was afraid it might be
too small.

880
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:47,139
I have a good eye after all.

881
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:50,259
- Thank you, Manager Zhao.
- No need to thank me.

882
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:53,739
I'll cut back on coffee
and that'll be that.

883
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:27,939
Come here!

884
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,219
It stopped playing.

885
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:36,419
What's wrong?

886
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:58,139
- How much do you need?
- A thousand or two.

887
00:58:58,219 --> 00:58:59,619
Well, which is it?

888
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:00,899
2,000.

889
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,179
Fill out this form.

890
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:03,459
Thank you.

891
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,299
I keep coming back...

892
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:08,579
...I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate your help.

893
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:11,139
- Will I get the money right away?
- There is no money.

894
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:13,059
No money!

895
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,339
You have to wait.

896
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:15,619
It's an emergency.

897
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:17,379
The union has money now?

898
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,099
Even the factory doesn't have funds.

899
00:59:20,979 --> 00:59:23,459
So this form is useless.

900
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,059
How come nobody went in?

901
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:29,019
- We're waiting for you.
- What for?

902
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,339
To hand out the tip money.

903
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:34,619
To tell you the truth, I'm broke.

904
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,979
Zhao, we just figured out...

905
00:59:39,499 --> 00:59:41,219
...how much all this
will cost you.

906
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:43,459
Pretty soon you'll be in trouble.

907
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:46,979
Each of us gives her
5 yuan per tip...

908
00:59:47,299 --> 00:59:49,539
...at twice a day,
that's 50 or 60 yuan.

909
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:51,459
In 10 days that adds up
to 5 or 6 hundred.

910
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:53,379
Over 1000 yuan a month.

911
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:54,659
Plus her salary...

912
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:56,579
...meals, and everything else.

913
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:58,499
You'll end up at 2000 a month.

914
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:01,099
2000 yuan!

915
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:03,419
You can't afford her.

916
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:06,179
Guys, I need you to help me out here.

917
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:08,099
Can you spare any extra dough?

918
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:09,939
We can scrape together a little.

919
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:11,939
But it can't last forever.

920
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:14,539
You know we're all retired...

921
01:00:14,939 --> 01:00:16,419
...and don't have money to spare.

922
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:20,699
She's a good kid.
We all like her...

923
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:22,179
...but there is nothing more
we can do.

924
01:00:22,259 --> 01:00:24,099
Tell her the truth.

925
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:28,579
Sooner or later you'll have to.

926
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:31,179
We're getting nowhere like this.

927
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:34,979
We can't stay all day long here.

928
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:39,459
Better to tell her now.

929
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:50,339
- Not a single person showed up today?
- Right.

930
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,539
I wonder what happened.

931
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:57,939
Little Wu?

932
01:00:58,019 --> 01:00:59,939
We need to talk.

933
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:03,059
Manager Zhao,
I want to tell you something too.

934
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,059
Really? Go ahead.

935
01:01:05,379 --> 01:01:06,979
I don't want to work here anymore.

936
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:09,539
You want to quit?

937
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,459
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

938
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:16,579
No reason.

939
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,419
Do you want to go back home?

940
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:21,699
No.

941
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:22,979
Then where are you going to go?

942
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,179
I don't know yet.

943
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:30,699
Why suddenly decide to quit?

944
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,219
Manager Zhao,
please don't worry about me.

945
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,139
I just don't want this job anymore.

946
01:01:35,379 --> 01:01:37,699
At least tell me
where you plan on going.

947
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:42,179
I haven't figured that out yet.

948
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:47,739
Just take me to the bus station.
I'll leave by myself.

949
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,859
No way! You're our employee.

950
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:54,979
We're responsible for you.

951
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:56,899
You can't just up and leave.

952
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:59,139
We'll have a meeting
to decide, okay?

953
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,139
Did we give ourselves away?

954
01:02:07,259 --> 01:02:10,979
That's impossible!
We've been so careful.

955
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:14,819
Maybe she wants to go
to Shenzhen to look for her dad.

956
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,019
She needs money for that.
Shenzhen is pretty damn far.

957
01:02:18,419 --> 01:02:19,939
Does she want to go home?

958
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:21,859
She said no.

959
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,859
If she wants to go, let her.

960
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:27,419
It'll save us trouble
and save you money.

961
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:30,779
But if she leaves, will that hurt
your thing with Chunky Mama?

962
01:02:30,899 --> 01:02:31,939
For sure.

963
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:37,619
But the point is whether something
might happen to the girl.

964
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:39,779
Do you think she might kill herself?

965
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:41,619
Kill herself?

966
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,619
Jump out of a building,
or run into traffic.

967
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:47,499
- Nonsense!
- She'd never do that!

968
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:50,659
Don't brush it off so lightly.

969
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:54,539
You never know
what she may be thinking.

970
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:58,339
Hey, that reminds me.

971
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:03,459
Two days ago I was at her home
when she suddenly lost her temper...

972
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:05,259
...and stormed downstairs.

973
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,299
I followed her.

974
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,219
Guess where I found her?

975
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,019
Standing...

976
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:15,419
...in the middle of the street.
It was dark and cars were everywhere.

977
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:18,779
If I arrived a minute later,
she might have been hit.

978
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:22,019
We definitely can't let her go.

979
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:25,019
For sure.

980
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,499
If something happens...

981
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:28,419
...we'll all be screwed.

982
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:31,619
He's 100% right.

983
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:36,019
It's no longer just my business.

984
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:38,659
If the cops come fishing around...

985
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:41,859
...they'll question my girlfriend.

986
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:45,699
She'll tell them the girl is here.

987
01:03:46,299 --> 01:03:48,259
Then you'll all be called in.

988
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:51,299
After all,
this whole place is a scam.

989
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:56,579
As soon as the police see it,
we're all screwed.

990
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:00,419
We can't let her leave.

991
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:03,659
But how can we keep her?

992
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:08,099
Where do we get the money
to pay her?

993
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,659
I have a new idea.

994
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:13,699
Since this concerns all of us...

995
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:17,699
...you all should take responsibility
and put out some cash.

996
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:20,219
If everyone coughs up a little...

997
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:22,179
...we can keep things going.

998
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:26,019
We'll see how things go and...

999
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,939
...decide what to do from there.

1000
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:32,419
First things first,
convince her to stay.

1001
01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:34,979
Go talk to her.

1002
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:37,179
We can't let anything happen to her.

1003
01:04:37,259 --> 01:04:38,819
We discussed it.

1004
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:42,659
Little Wu, you really can't go.

1005
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,859
Everyone feels your work...

1006
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,939
...is top-notch.

1007
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:52,259
They're reluctant to part with you.

1008
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:56,139
Besides, all your customers are here.

1009
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:59,299
They said if you leave,
they won't come back.

1010
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:02,259
I'll lose my customers.

1011
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:05,459
Especially Professor Li.

1012
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:08,259
The same goes for Mr. Niu.

1013
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:10,819
They really like you.

1014
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:13,379
They all do.

1015
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,259
I like them, too.

1016
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:17,859
If so, why leave?

1017
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:22,339
You've got to stay.
See how things go.

1018
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:25,459
If things aren't good, then go...

1019
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:27,459
...but if everything
goes smoothly...

1020
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:30,979
...there's no reason to leave,
am I right?

1021
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:33,899
Zhao! Zhao!

1022
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,379
- Who is it?
- It's me, Auntie Liu. Are you asleep?

1023
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:40,299
How come you're here?

1024
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:46,459
Money?

1025
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:48,579
- Did they all pitch in?
- Take a look.

1026
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,499
This must have been...

1027
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:52,859
...a lot of trouble
to scrape together.

1028
01:05:52,939 --> 01:05:54,979
My God, what is this?

1029
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,539
Close your eyes and feel it first.

1030
01:05:57,859 --> 01:05:59,219
You can't tell it's fake.

1031
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:03,299
You want to tip her with this?
Are you kidding?

1032
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:05,859
Aren't you broke?

1033
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:07,779
I know this is a hopeless plan...

1034
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:10,259
...but it'll work for now.

1035
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:11,659
How?

1036
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:13,459
Try it first.

1037
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:16,099
We have no options.

1038
01:06:20,499 --> 01:06:22,499
Can you feel the difference?

1039
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,059
I can't.

1040
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:26,979
The question is, can she?

1041
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:30,179
If we can't, how could she?

1042
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:32,539
So we tip her with paper money.

1043
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:35,579
Do you have a better idea?

1044
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,779
We use this stuff from now on?

1045
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,779
For the next few days.

1046
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:43,619
I'll switch it once I find
some real money.

1047
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:46,819
Two bills per person, okay?

1048
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:48,739
Who's first?

1049
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:51,299
It was her idea.

1050
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:53,859
I have to go first
because it was my idea?

1051
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:56,419
You guys know
I can't keep a secret.

1052
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:58,339
We can't risk sending her.

1053
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:00,899
- Who went first last time?
- Li.

1054
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:03,459
Go on, Li!

1055
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:07,059
I'm not going first!
Isn't this dishonest?

1056
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:10,299
We've been lying to her
from the beginning.

1057
01:07:10,379 --> 01:07:13,059
We'll be fine if she thinks
it's real money.

1058
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:18,179
And what if she can tell?

1059
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:22,019
Tell her it's a mistake
and you'll bring her tip tomorrow.

1060
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,819
Crumple it up a little bit...

1061
01:07:25,899 --> 01:07:27,139
...otherwise it feels too new.

1062
01:07:40,659 --> 01:07:42,499
Did you tip her?

1063
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,419
As soon as I went in.

1064
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:46,139
We got up there too late.

1065
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:49,499
Could she tell it wasn't real?

1066
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:52,099
If she could,
she would've said something.

1067
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:55,299
How did you give it to her?

1068
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:57,859
As you said...

1069
01:07:58,099 --> 01:07:59,139
...I crumpled it up.

1070
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:02,299
I put it in my pocket
and went in calmly.

1071
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:04,259
You have to pretend
everything is normal.

1072
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:09,419
Just slowly take it out
and put it in her hand.

1073
01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:11,939
- How many fake bills did you give me?
- Two.

1074
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:15,179
Damn! I gave her
my own real money.

1075
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,259
That money was
to buy milk for my kid.

1076
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:21,539
Pay me back!

1077
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:24,739
I'm not the one
who made the mistake.

1078
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:26,659
I have to get it back.

1079
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:31,579
How could you be so cheap?

1080
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:34,339
She gave you a massage,
let her keep it.

1081
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,579
You made me go first!

1082
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:41,059
I'll pay you back, all right?

1083
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:49,059
That's for you. Your tip.

1084
01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:51,619
Thank you.

1085
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:55,899
I watched her the whole time.

1086
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:57,379
Keep it down!

1087
01:08:57,579 --> 01:08:58,659
She couldn't tell.

1088
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:00,619
We saw it from up there.

1089
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:01,899
Now we can relax.

1090
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,739
We can support her
like this for years.

1091
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:48,459
- What's going on?
- We've succeeded!

1092
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:50,339
We did it!

1093
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:53,339
Each of us went in twice...

1094
01:09:53,419 --> 01:09:55,499
...and gave her at least 3 bills.

1095
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,019
He even gave her 5.

1096
01:09:58,219 --> 01:10:00,579
Didn't I only give you 2 each?

1097
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:03,579
I went home
to get some more paper.

1098
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,739
You're making a circus out of this!

1099
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:08,299
You'll blow our cover.

1100
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:10,819
What's more,
if you keep going in like this...

1101
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:12,739
...she'll be able to tell.

1102
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:14,699
Impossible.

1103
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:17,659
The first time, we all went in order.

1104
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:20,859
The second,
we went in a different order.

1105
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:22,099
She couldn't tell!

1106
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:24,939
You think you're so smart.
You gave her your own money before!

1107
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:26,859
You could ruin everything.

1108
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,379
She may already know.

1109
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:39,419
Little Wu, I heard you had
a lot of customers today.

1110
01:10:39,499 --> 01:10:43,499
I don't know why,
they just kept coming.

1111
01:10:43,899 --> 01:10:45,979
Good tips?

1112
01:10:46,059 --> 01:10:47,739
They gave a lot!

1113
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:51,179
- No problems?
- Not at all!

1114
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:54,379
- You put the money away?
- It's all here.

1115
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:58,619
- How much do you think you made?
- Several hundred!

1116
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,539
They were generous today!

1117
01:11:00,619 --> 01:11:04,619
This is the first time
I've ever made so much money.

1118
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:07,179
Now I can rest easy.

1119
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:10,139
Just tell me when
you want to make extra money.

1120
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:13,699
We have a great future ahead.

1121
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:20,379
I want to take you
and Manager Fu to dinner.

1122
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:22,299
But I won't let you pay.

1123
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,459
It wasn't easy to make that money.

1124
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:27,019
Save it!
Tonight is my treat!

1125
01:11:27,419 --> 01:11:32,139
Wouldn't it be great
if every day could be like today?

1126
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:35,099
Don't worry!

1127
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,179
Customers love you.

1128
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,579
We haven't even advertised yet.

1129
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:43,619
When we get the word out,
there will be even more.

1130
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:46,779
We get along fine like this.

1131
01:11:46,859 --> 01:11:50,699
Thanks to you,
we have a loyal clientele.

1132
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,219
We take old customers
and turn away the rest.

1133
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:55,139
Manager Zhao plans
everything out well.

1134
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:58,299
He says it depends on you.

1135
01:11:58,379 --> 01:12:02,179
If you don't feel well,
we'll send in fewer people.

1136
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:05,419
But when you want
to make an extra buck...

1137
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,339
...we'll have them
lining up at the door!

1138
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:10,539
We control the flow,
just give us the word!

1139
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:14,219
Manager Zhao,
I want to figure something out.

1140
01:12:14,299 --> 01:12:18,219
If I make 500 a day,
how much can I make in a year?

1141
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:20,539
Let's figure it out.

1142
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:23,819
500 a day, 10 days, 5000.

1143
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:26,499
30 days in a month, 3 x 5 is 15,
that's right.

1144
01:12:26,619 --> 01:12:28,459
So that's 150,000.

1145
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:30,979
- Fu, help me out here.
- 180,000 a year.

1146
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:34,539
150,000 for 10 months, plus
another 2 months comes to 180,000!

1147
01:12:34,579 --> 01:12:36,059
For one year?

1148
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:39,219
180,000!
How much money is that?

1149
01:12:39,379 --> 01:12:41,019
Are you sure you're right?

1150
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:44,339
Have I ever made a mistake
when it comes to money?

1151
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:48,859
Good heavens!

1152
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:50,779
So much money!

1153
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,299
You wouldn't even know
how to spend it.

1154
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:55,219
What would you do with it?

1155
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:58,419
I'd go to Shenzhen
to find my dad.

1156
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:00,739
So he could take me
to cure my eyes.

1157
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:03,539
If they can't do it in Shenzhen,
we'll go to Hong Kong.

1158
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:06,659
If not in Hong Kong,
we'll go to America.

1159
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,459
They'll be able to cure
my eyes in America, right?

1160
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:14,419
No question!
What a place America is!

1161
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:17,019
Enough with your blind worship
of America!

1162
01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:21,499
With 180,000,
doctors in Beijing will fix your eyes.

1163
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:24,059
And you want to go to America!

1164
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:25,299
Here's to 180,000!

1165
01:13:25,419 --> 01:13:27,139
You're wrong again!

1166
01:13:27,219 --> 01:13:31,499
Let's drink to Little Wu
finding a cure!

1167
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:32,379
Bottoms up!

1168
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:36,179
- Here, the glass is over here.
- Raise your glass.

1169
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,139
Kid, let's drink!

1170
01:13:44,459 --> 01:13:47,939
Manager Zhao, could you read
my father's letter to me?

1171
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:52,779
- You saw it before.
- Yes.

1172
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,499
I never trusted that woman.

1173
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:56,059
- Do you trust me?
- Yes!

1174
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:57,339
Let me have a look!

1175
01:13:58,099 --> 01:14:01,139
Since you trust me,
I'll read you the letter.

1176
01:14:08,339 --> 01:14:11,939
"Of the 5,000 yuan
I borrowed from you...

1177
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:14,619
...I lost almost 4,000...

1178
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:19,019
...4,000 in the stock market."

1179
01:14:19,499 --> 01:14:21,019
So there's over 1,000 left.

1180
01:14:21,299 --> 01:14:23,419
"Because of this...

1181
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:26,139
...I can't return the money right now.

1182
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:31,219
I put aside a portion of it
for my living expenses.

1183
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:35,059
Things are expensive in Shenzhen.

1184
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:38,219
But I'll return that 5,000 yuan
to you soon.

1185
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:42,499
Trust me, I've always been
a man of my word."

1186
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:43,779
That's it!

1187
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:47,219
- What else did my dad say?
- That's it!

1188
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:53,619
You heard it all. He borrowed
5,000 from my girlfriend.

1189
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,059
And he lost it on stocks.

1190
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:57,459
Only 1,000 yuan left.

1191
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,779
He didn't mention me?

1192
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:01,059
Nope!

1193
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:04,499
Are you sure?

1194
01:15:04,659 --> 01:15:06,459
Let me see.

1195
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:11,419
There is a part about you.

1196
01:15:11,499 --> 01:15:12,859
On the back.

1197
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:15,219
He wrote so small!

1198
01:15:15,299 --> 01:15:16,339
What did he say?

1199
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:18,899
You read it.

1200
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:21,939
- You want me to read it?
- See the back.

1201
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,099
Listen!

1202
01:15:24,259 --> 01:15:26,579
The characters are all squished.

1203
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:29,219
I can't make heads or tails of it.

1204
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:31,139
How about this...

1205
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:34,339
...I'll take it and read it
once I have my glasses.

1206
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:36,819
Then I'll tell you what he said...

1207
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,099
...first thing tomorrow morning, okay?

1208
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:43,739
That's fine.

1209
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,339
Can I come see you?

1210
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:48,259
No need?

1211
01:15:49,059 --> 01:15:52,099
You mean not ever?

1212
01:15:53,059 --> 01:15:54,019
Why?

1213
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:58,499
You can't just change your mind.
What's going on?

1214
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,379
Are you serious?

1215
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:02,339
Then I'll come right...

1216
01:16:32,499 --> 01:16:33,699
It's Zhao.

1217
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:36,259
So that's Zhao.

1218
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,339
I'll put away the flowers.
You two chat.

1219
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:42,339
- Who's he?
- My boyfriend!

1220
01:16:42,379 --> 01:16:43,619
Then who am I?!

1221
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:47,019
I told you over the phone.
We broke up!

1222
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:49,059
We've been together for so long...

1223
01:16:49,099 --> 01:16:51,619
- How can you do this?
- Stop yelling!

1224
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:53,699
- Who's that guy?
- Out. I'll explain!

1225
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:56,819
You really move too fast!

1226
01:16:57,939 --> 01:16:59,979
At least tell me why?

1227
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:03,939
Why? Because you're nothing
but a liar!

1228
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:05,059
Liar?

1229
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:08,339
You still deny it?
What are you still lying for?

1230
01:17:08,739 --> 01:17:10,899
I checked you out, mister!

1231
01:17:11,179 --> 01:17:13,419
You don't own any Happy Times Hotel!

1232
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:16,579
You've been jiving me from day one!

1233
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:17,939
For instance...

1234
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:21,779
You've been wearing that same shirt
since the day we met.

1235
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:23,299
Is this your only one?

1236
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,979
And you call yourself a manager!

1237
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:28,139
What garbage dump
did you dig those roses out of?

1238
01:17:28,259 --> 01:17:30,499
They were dead the next morning!

1239
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:32,019
Let me explain.

1240
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:37,059
You're right about
the Happy Times Hotel...

1241
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:38,379
...it was hauled away.

1242
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:43,299
This is the only nice shirt I have,
but I wear it for you.

1243
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:44,819
As for the flowers...

1244
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:49,219
...I bought them for 2 yuan
and trimmed them myself.

1245
01:17:49,259 --> 01:17:52,059
But believe me, my intention
to marry you was sincere.

1246
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:53,779
Do you know what I hate most?

1247
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:56,299
Men that lie!

1248
01:17:56,419 --> 01:18:00,139
Have you ever said
an honest word to me?

1249
01:18:00,219 --> 01:18:03,419
If you're broke, just say so.

1250
01:18:03,499 --> 01:18:06,979
Who'd marry you?
You'd sell your wife for the cash.

1251
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:09,099
How could I sell you off?

1252
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:11,699
So there's no hope for us?

1253
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:12,699
Right!

1254
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:15,419
- Let me talk to him!
- No way!

1255
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:18,379
- Hell, I was here before that guy.
- What do you mean?

1256
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:21,419
I already married him.

1257
01:18:21,499 --> 01:18:26,299
We're protected by law now,
so give it up!

1258
01:18:26,379 --> 01:18:28,099
Don't call me again!

1259
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:29,619
From now on, I don't know you!

1260
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:33,379
You go your way, I'll go mine!

1261
01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:37,939
By the way, bring that girl back.

1262
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:41,139
She won't trouble you anymore.
My man can handle things.

1263
01:18:41,419 --> 01:18:42,979
Take my advice...

1264
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:46,339
...be honest and speak the truth!

1265
01:18:56,779 --> 01:18:59,019
So I'm a liar, am I?

1266
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:03,499
In the end I'm nothing
but a no-good cheat!

1267
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:06,059
Hello!

1268
01:19:07,459 --> 01:19:09,939
I may be a cheater, but...

1269
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:14,899
How could she do it?

1270
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:18,099
Everything was going fine!

1271
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:23,139
If I hadn't gone over there,
I wouldn't even have known!

1272
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:27,059
I show up...

1273
01:19:28,259 --> 01:19:30,899
...and she's kissing him!

1274
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:36,659
I saw them kiss!

1275
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:40,899
Disgusting!

1276
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:46,299
I wanted a chunky one
to keep me warm and toasty!

1277
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:48,819
She's cold as a fish!

1278
01:19:49,779 --> 01:19:52,339
And she has the gall
to look down on me?

1279
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:57,659
Look at her fat ass!

1280
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,059
A pig!

1281
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:02,000
Look at yourself,
you big, chunky porkroll!

1282
01:20:02,379 --> 01:20:05,099
And you look down on me!

1283
01:20:05,179 --> 01:20:06,659
Look down at your fat ass!

1284
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:07,819
What are you saying?

1285
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:10,139
Let's go. He's drunk.

1286
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:12,699
You got a problem?

1287
01:20:13,299 --> 01:20:14,619
Looking for a beating?

1288
01:20:16,419 --> 01:20:19,139
It's my own business!

1289
01:20:20,099 --> 01:20:23,379
I said that fatso is
a pathetic excuse for a person!

1290
01:21:18,739 --> 01:21:21,179
Excuse me.
Do you have a pen and paper?

1291
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:26,699
Thank you.

1292
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:05,279
Doctor!
Where's the guy just hit by a car?

1293
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:06,979
You mean a truck?

1294
01:23:07,059 --> 01:23:08,819
- Right.
- Who are you?

1295
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:11,099
- We work with him.
- He's in the emergency room.

1296
01:23:13,019 --> 01:23:15,299
- Doctor, how is he?
- Who?

1297
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,219
The guy who got hit by a truck.

1298
01:23:17,299 --> 01:23:20,559
In the recovery room.
He's still unconscious.

1299
01:23:21,299 --> 01:23:22,339
Will he make it?

1300
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:23,759
Any of you related to him?

1301
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:26,279
We work together.

1302
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:28,139
Where are his relatives?

1303
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:30,539
He doesn't have any.

1304
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,899
- Doesn't he have a daughter?
- No.

1305
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:37,059
He's never even been married.

1306
01:23:37,259 --> 01:23:38,619
He must have a daughter.

1307
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:40,299
This is a letter he wrote to her.

1308
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:43,599
We found it in his pocket.

1309
01:23:56,979 --> 01:23:59,459
I know what happened.

1310
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:00,539
Doctor, can we see him?

1311
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:01,659
Across the hall.

1312
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:03,819
Over there?

1313
01:24:14,659 --> 01:24:15,539
Zhao.

1314
01:24:20,459 --> 01:24:21,339
Zhao.

1315
01:24:25,219 --> 01:24:26,419
It's me, Fu.

1316
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:32,219
We've all come to see you.

1317
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:36,859
Zhao.

1318
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:41,819
You were fine yesterday,
How could this happen?

1319
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:48,819
I know what you'd
want me to do.

1320
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:52,539
First thing tomorrow morning,
I'll read this to Little Wu.

1321
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:57,219
Don't worry,
I'll tell her it was from her father.

1322
01:24:58,819 --> 01:25:01,619
Little Wu! Little Wu!

1323
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:10,899
- She's not here.
- Where did she go?

1324
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:14,479
"Please listen to the tape."
Hey! There's a tape here!

1325
01:25:14,559 --> 01:25:16,439
Look, isn't this hers?

1326
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:29,559
Manager Zhao, by the time
you hear this recording, I'll be gone.

1327
01:25:30,599 --> 01:25:33,559
Don't look for me,
you'll never find me.

1328
01:25:34,519 --> 01:25:36,699
The past few days,
I wanted to leave.

1329
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:38,659
It was a difficult decision.

1330
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:43,779
But now I think it's for the best.
I won't trouble you anymore.

1331
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:50,139
During our time together,
I know I've been a burden to you all.

1332
01:25:50,419 --> 01:25:53,339
But at the same time,
I experienced so much.

1333
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:55,899
How should I put it?

1334
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:57,579
Manager Zhao.

1335
01:25:58,079 --> 01:25:59,539
I suspected the massage room...

1336
01:25:59,619 --> 01:26:02,499
...was fake from the beginning.

1337
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:04,819
I knew you were all acting...

1338
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:07,419
...so I played my part.

1339
01:26:07,639 --> 01:26:09,979
I didn't want to let you down.

1340
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:12,579
I know you were all
trying to help me.

1341
01:26:12,979 --> 01:26:15,619
Even though you have no money.

1342
01:26:15,699 --> 01:26:18,259
You all tried so hard to hide the truth.

1343
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,859
I never once felt deceived.

1344
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:23,419
Instead, I felt happy.

1345
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:26,619
Honest, those days with you...

1346
01:26:27,219 --> 01:26:29,859
...were the happiest of my life.

1347
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:33,699
Those were our happy times together.

1348
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:36,759
Manager Zhao...

1349
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:41,339
...I knew the money you gave me
towards the end was fake.

1350
01:26:41,459 --> 01:26:45,859
Maybe none of you could feel
the difference...

1351
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:49,019
...but how could you expect me not to?

1352
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:52,259
Even though the money was fake...

1353
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:55,379
...your intentions were genuine.

1354
01:26:55,459 --> 01:27:02,539
I'll keep that paper money forever.

1355
01:27:04,739 --> 01:27:05,699
Manager Zhao...

1356
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:07,619
...deep down I know...

1357
01:27:08,419 --> 01:27:10,819
...my eyes will probably never be cured.

1358
01:27:11,779 --> 01:27:13,299
But don't worry...

1359
01:27:13,379 --> 01:27:15,899
...I'll never give up on life.

1360
01:27:16,419 --> 01:27:19,099
I'm sure many more difficulties await me.

1361
01:27:19,299 --> 01:27:21,019
But when those times come...

1362
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:24,859
...I will think of you
and I'll be able to pull through.

1363
01:27:25,379 --> 01:27:28,059
Good-bye, Manager Zhao...

1364
01:27:28,259 --> 01:27:31,259
This tape recorder is for you.

1365
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:34,259
It's been with me for a long time.

1366
01:27:34,339 --> 01:27:38,339
Whenever I feel sad,
I listen to music.

1367
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:42,019
If something makes you sad...

1368
01:27:42,099 --> 01:27:45,179
...listen to some music,
and you'll feel better.

1369
01:28:11,299 --> 01:28:12,259
Manager Zhao...

1370
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:17,139
...by the time you hear
this recording I'll be gone.

1371
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:20,579
Don't look for me,
you'll never find me.

1372
01:28:21,859 --> 01:28:25,019
My dear daughter, how are you?

1373
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:28,219
I've wanted to write you
for a long time.

1374
01:28:28,419 --> 01:28:32,059
Since I've been so busy at work,
trying to save money...

1375
01:28:32,259 --> 01:28:34,419
...I haven't had time.

1376
01:28:34,499 --> 01:28:36,579
I'm sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me.

1377
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:38,899
Your dad really misses you.

1378
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:40,979
I wonder how you've been doing.

1379
01:28:41,059 --> 01:28:44,259
Have you gained any weight?

1380
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:46,139
I bet you're getting taller.

1381
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:51,059
Everything in Shenzhen is going fine,
except for a few problems.

1382
01:28:51,139 --> 01:28:52,579
Making money isn't easy.

1383
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:57,699
But I'm sure I'll do well eventually.

1384
01:28:58,379 --> 01:29:01,819
I work so hard to make money
for one thing only...

1385
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:03,899
...so I can get your eyes fixed.

1386
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,739
No matter how difficult things
may be or how exhausted I am...

1387
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:10,299
...I'll find a way to cure your eyes.

1388
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:14,099
When I have enough money,
I'll bring you to Shenzhen.

1389
01:29:14,379 --> 01:29:15,979
If not Shenzhen...

1390
01:29:16,099 --> 01:29:22,379
...wherever they've got the best hospitals,
that's where we'll go.

1391
01:29:22,499 --> 01:29:26,259
When your eyes are better,
you'll see your daddy again.

1392
01:29:26,979 --> 01:29:29,419
You'll see all the things you missed.

1393
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:31,459
You'll go back to school.

1394
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:34,539
This is a promise.

1395
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,459
Please believe in your dad...

1396
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,779
...and in yourself too...

1397
01:29:38,379 --> 01:29:41,019
...believe your eyes will get better.

1398
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:44,139
Wait for me to come get you.

1399
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:47,339
No matter what happens,
keep your chin up...

1400
01:29:47,499 --> 01:29:49,139
...don't feel depressed.

1401
01:29:49,219 --> 01:29:52,499
A lot of things in life
don't go your way.

1402
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:55,019
You may run into difficulties...

1403
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:57,459
...and you may feel alone.

1404
01:29:57,539 --> 01:29:59,499
But none of this matters.

1405
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:04,379
Don't ever lose confidence
because of temporary setbacks.

1406
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:05,819
Stay strong.

1407
01:30:05,899 --> 01:30:09,499
Have confidence and keep going.

1408
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:13,579
If you believe in yourself,
you can conquer any obstacle.

1409
01:30:13,899 --> 01:30:17,819
Trust your father who loves you.

1410
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:22,539
Everything will get better,
it really will.
