1
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:28,318
(Train whistle)

2
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,878
(Bell ringing)

3
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:17,078
- Thank you, Jason. On time.
- You bet!

4
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,358
Link.

5
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,967
Link Appleyard!

6
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,965
- Oh, Miss Hallie.
- Hello, Marshal.

7
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:29,522
- Howdy, Mr Senator.
- No, no. Rance. Rance.

8
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,843
Rance... Sure glad you could come.

9
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,799
Your wire caught us in St Louis.
Thank you.

10
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:40,204
My buckboard's right over there.
Now, Jason, give me that box.

11
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,078
You knew they were coming!

12
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:46,166
That's the first time you ever
kept a secret! Blabbermouth!

13
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,085
- Anybody worth a line in the paper?
- A line?

14
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,006
You blasted fool, that's
Senator Stoddard and his wife.

15
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,561
You can fill
your newspaper with them!

16
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,240
Hi, Lydia. Charlie Hasbrouck.
Emergency!

17
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:06,565
Tell the editor Senator Stoddard
and his wife just got here!

18
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,404
That's right! Thanks!

19
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,438
Hey, that's a nickel!

20
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,603
Charge the Shinbone Star!

21
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:27,678
(Charlie) Hey, Senator!
Senator Stoddard, ma'am.

22
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:31,436
Could you give me an interview?
Exclusive, like. A scoop!

23
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,445
(Chuckles) Shinbone Star...

24
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:38,036
Well, now, son, I, uh... All right.

25
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:42,285
I'll give the interview, but
only for one reason. One reason...

26
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:46,320
Dutton Peabody - founder,
publisher, editor-in-chief

27
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,006
of the Shinbone Star once fired me.

28
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,119
I'll be fired
if I don't get this interview.

29
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,158
Is it true you're going to?

30
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:55,925
Uh-oh. Here he comes now.

31
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:03,196
Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise
and an honour, sir!

32
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,523
- Maxwell Scott, editor of the Star.
- How do you do, Mr Scott?

33
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,445
- This is Mrs Stoddard.
- A pleasure, ma'am.

34
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:12,684
What brings you back, sir?
Is it true you're going to run?

35
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,763
Oh, no. Hold on, Mr Scott.

36
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:18,880
Who am I giving this interview to?
You or this young fellow here?

37
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,885
- Who asked first, by the way.
- I sure did.

38
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:25,078
If you're a good reporter you'll
invite them into our office,

39
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,958
out of the sun and dust.

40
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,477
He's right. Best way to make a man
talk is to make him comfortable.

41
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:34,566
Well, it's back in business
again, politics.

42
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,680
Link, why don't you take Hallie
for a little ride around town?

43
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,797
Lot of changes, huh?

44
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,726
I'll go with these fellows
and mend a few political fences.

45
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,361
(Train whistle)

46
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,075
I notice you're not wearing the star.

47
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:57,799
Oh, shucks, Miss Hallie.

48
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:01,556
They haven't elected me
Town Marshal for a dog's age.

49
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:05,361
I reckon the only one of us
from the old days still working

50
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,602
is the senator!

51
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,007
Place has sure changed.

52
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,084
Churches, high school,

53
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:17,118
shops.

54
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,045
Well, the railroad done that.

55
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,036
Desert's still the same.

56
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,646
The cactus rose is in blossom.

57
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,276
- Maybe...
- (Train whistle)

58
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:39,806
Maybe you'd like
to take a ride out desert way

59
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,042
and maybe look around.

60
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:44,996
Maybe.

61
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,083
Hyah!

62
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,919
You knew where I wanted to go,
didn't you?

63
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,404
Well, you said you wanted
to see the cactus blossoms.

64
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,598
There's his house down there,
what's left of it.

65
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:35,603
Blossoms all around it.

66
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:44,075
He never did finish that room
he started to build on, did he?

67
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,719
No, uh...

68
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,759
Oh, well, you know all about that.

69
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,603
There's a lovely one there.

70
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,716
- (Horse neighs)
- Whoa.

71
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:41,365
Well, gentlemen, I promised myself
this trip I would not talk politics,

72
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,922
and look here, that's just about
all I've been doing.

73
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,721
Surely you're going to Capitol City
and talk to the assembly?

74
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,406
Not this trip.
This is purely personal.

75
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:55,201
Purely personal? That isn't
good enough for my readers.

76
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:58,159
Why did you come to Shinbone?
No mystery, is there?

77
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,084
No.

78
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:02,766
No, there's no mystery.

79
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,877
I'm here to go to a funeral.

80
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,918
Funeral?

81
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,162
Who's dead, sir?

82
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,198
No, sir. I...

83
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,486
A man by the name of Tom Doniphon.

84
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,087
Oh, there's my good wife. I'll...

85
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,687
I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen.

86
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,524
Tom Doniphon?

87
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,805
- Hello, Clute.
- Why, Rance!

88
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,839
Ransom Stoddard!
And Miss Hallie!

89
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,082
Gosh, Senator, I didn't think...

90
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,925
Why didn't you let me know
they was coming?

91
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,640
Gosh, I'd have had
a real bang-up funeral.

92
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,997
Folks from all over,
everywhere, would have come.

93
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,635
The county's
gonna bury him, you know.

94
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,485
I won't make a nickel out of it.

95
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,686
Pompey?

96
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,205
Miss Hallie.

97
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:20,442
Pompey, I'm sorry.

98
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,922
Uh, maybe you'd like to...

99
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,720
Where are his boots?

100
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:50,442
Well, I thought... They was
an awful nice pair of boots,

101
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,796
almost brand-new, and I thought...

102
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:56,999
Put his boots on, Clute...
and his gun belt and his spurs.

103
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:01,120
He didn't carry no handgun, Rance.
He didn't for years.

104
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,158
Yeah, sure.

105
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:34,919
Sir, I don't wish to intrude...

106
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,879
but a United States senator is news.

107
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:42,557
I'm the editor of a newspaper
with a state-wide circulation.

108
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,598
I've got a responsibility

109
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:48,481
to know why you came
all the way down here to bury a man.

110
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:52,679
You can't say his name was
Tom Doniphon and leave it at that.

111
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,922
Who was Tom Doniphon?

112
00:11:54,967 --> 00:12:00,246
He was a friend, Mr Scott,
and we'd like to be left alone.

113
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,800
Scott, let's go.

114
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm sorry, Senator.
That's not enough.

115
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,956
I have a right to have the story.

116
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,440
Yes, I guess maybe you have.

117
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:43,523
Of course, this story
not only concerns me.

118
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,196
Old Pompey in there, Link...
they were part of it.

119
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,796
But I suppose I'm the only one
who can tell it true.

120
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,805
I read about the old days
in the paper's files.

121
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:57,044
- There was no mention...
- You're a young man!

122
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,600
A young man.

123
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,400
You only know it
since the railroad came.

124
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,917
A lot different then.
A lot different before, Mr Scott.

125
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,559
A lot different.

126
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:10,395
First time I came to Shinbone,
I came by stagecoach.

127
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,642
A lot like that one right there.

128
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:15,524
Well...

129
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,966
Hmm.

130
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,998
Could be the same one.

131
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,077
Could be the same one.

132
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,397
Overland?
Say, I think it is the same one!

133
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,438
Well, I declare.

134
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,642
Well, I declare.

135
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:39,885
I was just a youngster,
fresh out of law school,

136
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:43,806
bag full of law books
and my father's gold watch,

137
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,361
$14.80 in cash.

138
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:52,639
I had taken
Horace Greeley's advice literally:

139
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:55,724
"Go west, young man, go west,

140
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:59,885
"and seek fame, fortune, adventure."

141
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,477
Stand and deliver!

142
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,037
Shotgun, shuck your shells.

143
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,958
Throw down the cash box.

144
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,126
Now!

145
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,364
All right.
Get the passengers out of the coach.

146
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,366
Looks like slim passenger pickings,
but lift their wallets anyway.

147
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,356
- I'll take that pin, too.
- No. Please.

148
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,477
My dead husband gave it to me.

149
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:23,758
- Please!
- A widow, huh? I'll take it anyway.

150
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:27,595
Take your hands off!
What kind of men are you?

151
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:29,763
This kind, dude!

152
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:36,439
Now, what kind of man are you, dude?

153
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,763
I am an attorney-at-law,

154
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,879
and I'm duly licensed
by the territory.

155
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:47,602
You may have us now,
but I'll see you in jail for this!

156
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,399
Jail?

157
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,846
(Chuckling)

158
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,444
- (Widow screams) Stop it!
- Get him out of here!

159
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,717
Get in that coach! Go on, move!

160
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,565
Get in there! You, too!

161
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:02,837
- Come on, inside!
- He could die out there!

162
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,878
We'll send him flowers!

163
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,838
Chico, cut the leaders!

164
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,639
(Horses neighing)

165
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,038
Hyah! Hyah!

166
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,878
Get going!

167
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:36,084
Put that stuff in here
and get to your horses. Hurry!

168
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,719
A book?

169
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:40,846
Law?

170
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,198
Lawyer, huh?

171
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,886
Well, I'll teach you law...

172
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,918
Western law.

173
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,438
Let's get out of here.

174
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,126
Come on. Come on!

175
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,965
(Piano playing in saloon)

176
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,838
Hallie!

177
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,640
Hallie! Wake up, gal!

178
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:19,806
Tom Doniphon! It's five-thirty in
the morning! What's wrong with you?

179
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:23,044
We've got a man down here
ambushed... Am-bushed!

180
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,760
Like to die
if we don't get care for him.

181
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,604
Oh.

182
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,921
- It's the man from the hold-up.
- That's right.

183
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,006
How did you know?

184
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,800
Stagecoach stopped by
to notify the marshal.

185
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,724
Link Appleyard?

186
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,601
Don't stand there gossiping.
Get him inside. Pompey!

187
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,797
Think you can make it, pilgrim?

188
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,838
Pick him up, Pompey.

189
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,638
Put him on the couch.

190
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,758
Tom...

191
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,638
he's hurt real bad.

192
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,158
Thanks, Pompey.

193
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,403
Poor man.

194
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,563
Beaten, whipped, and kicked,

195
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,075
and just for trying
to protect a woman.

196
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:10,076
- How's that again?
- Stage driver told us all about it.

197
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:16,280
Well, Pompey, looks like
we got ourselves a ladies' man.

198
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,604
Hallie, we...

199
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,683
- Get some bandage.
- But...

200
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,036
I'll take care of him.

201
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,640
Hey...

202
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,599
Pilgrim, you're gonna need
a couple of stitches.

203
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,797
Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby.

204
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,997
If he's sober, bring him back.

205
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,518
Oh.

206
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:53,957
Nora, sorry to bust in
on you like this. He's in trouble.

207
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,601
Such a beating.

208
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,683
This is just simply terrible.

209
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:01,605
By golly,
I'm going to get the marshal.

210
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:05,640
You want coffee?
I make some breakfast. Hallie?

211
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:13,844
Whoa! Take her easy there, pilgrim.

212
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,843
You all right?

213
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,958
Here we are.

214
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,518
Drink this.

215
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:58,084
- Is that coffee?
- Ja, coffee... and aquavit.

216
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:01,199
- Swedish brandy. Good for you.
- Oh. Oh, no.

217
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:02,965
I don't care for that.

218
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,965
Here, you must drink.
That make you feel better.

219
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:12,638
It ain't mannerly out west
to let a fellow drink by himself.

220
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,355
- All right if I smoke, ain't it?
- Sure. Go right ahead.

221
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,882
Good. Now you will feel stronger.

222
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,918
Thank you, ma'am.

223
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,879
Took my watch.

224
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:56,237
My money's gone...
every cent I had in the world.

225
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,801
Well, don't fret about that,
pilgrim.

226
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:02,840
You can... eat here
until you get back on your feet.

227
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:06,675
- My credit's still good, Nora?
- Ja, Tom.

228
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,566
Lie down. Please lie down.

229
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,837
No. No, not now.

230
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:19,726
Not now. I...
I... l've got something to do.

231
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,040
(Whispering) Got something to do.

232
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,877
What... what did you say
his name was?

233
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:32,363
The... the man
with the silver-knobbed whip?

234
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:36,241
I said Liberty Valance,
but if that's what you got to do,

235
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:39,404
you better start packing a handgun.

236
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,882
A gun? I don't want a gun.

237
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,203
I don't want a gun.
I don't want to kill him.

238
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:49,715
I want to put him in jail.

239
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,086
Oh.

240
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:55,159
I know those law books
mean a lot to you,

241
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,799
but not out here.

242
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,919
Out here,
a man settles his own problems.

243
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:05,486
Yeah, but do you know
what you're saying to me?

244
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,166
You know, you're... you're saying

245
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:12,837
just exactly
what Liberty Valance said.

246
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,600
What kind of community
have I come to here?

247
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,445
You all seem to know about
this Liberty Valance.

248
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:23,002
He's a no-good, gun-packing,
murdering thief,

249
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,596
but the only advice you give me
is to carry a gun.

250
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,797
Well, I'm a lawyer!

251
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,919
Ransom Stoddard, attorney-at-law.

252
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:35,801
And the law is the only...
the only...

253
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,001
A little law and order around
Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone.

254
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,719
All right, Hallie.

255
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:48,761
(Voices outside)

256
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:53,039
Arrest this man! Arrest him!
Nobody seems to want...

257
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:54,600
Well.

258
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,684
Here comes Mr Law and Order himself.

259
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,922
- He's hurt bad.
- Ohh.

260
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,959
What are you dragging me
here for, Peter?

261
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:07,000
Ain't being up all night on account
of this hold-up business...

262
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,601
- Well, who's this?
- The man from the hold-up.

263
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,435
- I knew I shouldn't have come over.
- Wait a minute, Marshal.

264
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:18,446
Now, see here, Tom, if he's got
a formal complaint to make,

265
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,478
he should make it to me.

266
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,644
He just wants you
to put Liberty Valance in jail.

267
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:25,723
Yeah, Liberty...

268
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,520
Liberty Valance?
Do you think I'm crazy?

269
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,364
Tom, let me out of here.

270
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:34,559
Hallie thinks he's right.
You'd better listen. He's a lawyer.

271
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:37,440
Somebody better listen
to somebody about him!

272
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:39,443
(Speaks Swedish)

273
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,684
Shh, Mamma, Liberty Valance
rides into town...

274
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:47,562
As long as he behaves himself
in this town, I ain't got no, uh...

275
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,518
Jurisdiction.

276
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,479
Yeah, what he said.
I ain't got none of it.

277
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,087
You all know
I'm only the Town Marshal.

278
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:59,166
What Liberty does out on the road
ain't no business of mine.

279
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,562
Ain't that right, Mr Lawyer?

280
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,404
Well, I...

281
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:08,400
Technically, I suppose the hold-up
is a territorial offence.

282
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,563
You mean I'm right?

283
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:12,563
Yes, Marshal, you're right.

284
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:17,727
I knew it! I knew we'd be friends
the minute I stepped in here!

285
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:22,045
Now, you folks all know that,
well, the jail's only got one cell,

286
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:25,079
and the lock's broke,
and I sleep in it.

287
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:28,915
I should have known nothing would
happen when you came in here.

288
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,879
Now get out,
you big old fat water buffalo!

289
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:35,522
- We got work to do!
- Hallie, I ain't ate yet.

290
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:40,960
Nora, I could sure use a snack
of six or seven of those eggs,

291
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:45,683
and maybe a side order of bacon
and... hey, is that flapjack batter?

292
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:47,558
On the cuff. Sit down.

293
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,075
- Papa, get your pants on!
- Oh, yeah.

294
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,846
Get out of the way! Sit down!

295
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,444
(Tom) Hallie?

296
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:02,325
You know, you look mighty pretty
when you get mad.

297
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:07,526
Like I say, you can eat here
till you get back on your feet.

298
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,319
May I have your name?

299
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:13,957
Doniphon. Tom Doniphon.

300
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:17,920
Forget what I said
about buying a gun.

301
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,844
You're a tenderfoot.

302
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:24,085
Liberty Valance is the toughest man
south of the Picketwire...

303
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,924
next to me.

304
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,681
(# A Hot Time
in the Old Town Tonight)

305
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:54,037
# Whoo-hoo!
Hot time in the old town tonight!

306
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,964
# Whoo! #

307
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:09,924
(Laughter)

308
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,838
(Women laughing)

309
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,957
- Boo!
- Mr...

310
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:56,726
- (Laughter)
- Mr Peabody!

311
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,519
Evening, Marshal.

312
00:28:58,567 --> 00:28:59,966
Oh!

313
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,519
Whoa!

314
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:07,001
(Cackles)

315
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,926
Did you know that Liberty Valance
is in town tonight?

316
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:14,640
I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed

317
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,645
if I didn't know
what everybody else knows.

318
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:21,043
I don't know what to do,
Mr Peabody, I swear.

319
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,647
Do what you're paid to. Run him out!

320
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:25,882
Run him out... Liberty Val... Me?

321
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:28,885
- My advice to you as, uh...
- Coroner.

322
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:33,079
- And, uh, your personal pos...
- Physician!

323
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:37,166
Is to get your supper
and go to bed. No charge.

324
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,682
Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.

325
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:53,836
Hallie, my love, where are you?
I await you, my dear.

326
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,720
Good evening.
Saturday night, Mr Peabody.

327
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:01,158
Better order early before those
drunks come from across the street.

328
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:06,042
Hallie, please. The proprieties
concerning the cutlery.

329
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:08,157
How many times have I told you,

330
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,756
the fork goes to the left
of the plate, the knife goes...

331
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:14,037
You superstitious or something?

332
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,997
What are you having to eat?

333
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:18,878
Uh, the usual.

334
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:22,317
Steak, beans, potatoes,
and deep-dish apple pie.

335
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,641
(Man) Three steaks
with a lot of black.

336
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:29,566
(Hallie) All right.
(Man) Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.

337
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:31,563
All right, Kaintuck!

338
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:35,077
Three steaks,
burnt black for the Lazy J boys.

339
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,961
Heavy on the beans.
Usual for Mr Peabody with fixings.

340
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:40,759
(Peter) Steak...

341
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,559
beans, potatoes.

342
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,086
And deep-dish apple pie.

343
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:48,120
Someday, he'll order something
different, and we'll all faint.

344
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,836
Goodness, Rance,
aren't you finished yet?

345
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:01,277
No wonder if your mind isn't on it.
Let me help.

346
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,683
Hallie, I found it. I'll show...
No, my hands are wet.

347
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:07,480
Get the book.
Come on, take the book a minute.

348
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:09,882
Nora, Peter,
come here and hear this.

349
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,838
Now, get the book.

350
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,163
Now, that place right here
where it says,

351
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,801
"Under the law of this territory."

352
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:19,758
Hallie, you read it out loud.

353
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,879
I got Liberty Valance
exactly where I want him.

354
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,679
Just exactly where I want him.

355
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,446
What's the matter?
Go ahead. Read it.

356
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,718
I can't.

357
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,320
What?

358
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,484
You... well, why not?

359
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:40,963
Well, I... never had
the schooling, that's why not.

360
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,280
Well.

361
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,758
You mean you can't read at all?

362
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:56,800
No. I can't read, and I can't write.

363
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,485
Here, take your book.

364
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,041
For heaven's sakes,
isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?

365
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,918
Oh, no.

366
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:06,004
- Hallie...
- Not enough beans on it.

367
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,197
Hallie, I'm sorry.

368
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,158
Hallie.

369
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,198
I... I could teach you.

370
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,396
What for? What good has
reading and writing done you?

371
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:24,166
Look at you. In an apron!

372
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:28,236
(Bell rings)

373
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,039
Be right with you, boys.

374
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,363
I do look funny in this.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

375
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:37,605
She'll get over it. What is
reading and writing for a girl?

376
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,366
She'll make a wonderful wife
for the man she marries.

377
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:44,685
Yeah. And if Tom Doniphon is smart,
he pops the question to Hallie

378
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:49,118
before some busybody I am married to
upsets his, uh... bag of apples.

379
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,239
Aw, you!
Eat supper before come the drunks.

380
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:55,085
- But I'm not finished.
- Go sit down! Eat!

381
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,398
(Men yelling)

382
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,796
Well, what you cooking,
steak and potatoes?

383
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:24,681
I'm hungry. Could I impose
upon your hospitality?

384
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:28,117
Just a couple of those steaks
and no beans.

385
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,125
Hey, Marshal.
You're the man I'm looking for.

386
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,635
Shh. Not so loud.

387
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,678
And double on the potatoes.

388
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:39,037
One steak for one marshal
on the cuff.

389
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:44,886
Marshal, I was wrong the other day,

390
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:47,646
but I've been reading up,
and there it is.

391
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:51,157
I'll draw up the complaint,
take care of the details,

392
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,517
but you do have jurisdiction,
it says so right there.

393
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:58,446
The next time he sets foot
in this town, you arrest him.

394
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,682
Anything you say, Mr Stoddard.

395
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:05,402
I'll be tickled to death to...

396
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:09,007
What was that? Arrest who?

397
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,526
Liberty Valance.

398
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:13,764
Arrest Liberty Val...

399
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:16,605
You mean Liberty Valance?

400
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:20,242
Just when I was starting
to get my appetite back.

401
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:22,881
- A lot of black-eyes.
- Right, right.

402
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,806
Steaks for the Brophy boys
with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.

403
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,680
- They're sober tonight, too.
- Burn four.

404
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,201
Here's the supper for Rance.

405
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:47,242
- Thank you, Hallie.
- Oh, sit down!

406
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:50,279
The way you pop up
every time a girl speaks to you!

407
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,717
- You get in the habit.
- Rance, do you think I could?

408
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,998
I mean, grown-up and all?
Could I learn to read?

409
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:00,039
Why, sure you can, Hallie.

410
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,918
Why, there's nothing to it.

411
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,765
It'd be eas...
Can you learn to read?

412
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,798
Why, I can teach you.

413
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:09,486
A smart girl like you?
Of course you can.

414
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:11,199
Do you want to try?

415
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:14,319
It's awful worrisome
not knowing how.

416
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,927
I know the Good Book
from preacher talk,

417
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,845
but it'd be a soul comfort
to read it myself.

418
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,764
Hallie, I'll teach you how.

419
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:24,844
In no time,
you'll be reading everything.

420
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:28,163
Well... Well...

421
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:31,836
Hallie, can I have
just one more steak?

422
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,441
One steak on the cuff!

423
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,797
(Hallie) All right, all right.

424
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,167
Excuse me. Oh...

425
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,680
- Nora, did you hear the news?
- No.

426
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:08,844
- Rance'll learn me to read.
- "Teach me to read."

427
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,003
Er, teach me to read.

428
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:15,557
I cannot say my ABC in Swedish.

429
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,916
Maybe you can teach me in English.

430
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,435
Sure, Nora.
You can be my second pupil.

431
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,842
Hal's my first. You'll be my second.

432
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:25,560
Peter, you hear that? Peter!

433
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,764
Well, pilgrim,

434
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,275
I see you're still
protecting the ladies.

435
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:35,364
Why, Tom, look at you.
You're all dressed up.

436
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,524
- It's Saturday night.
- Don't you look handsome!

437
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:42,355
- Oh, uh, I brought you a present.
- Tom!

438
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,875
Prettiest cactus rose
I ever did see.

439
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:47,282
It is a beauty. Look at it, Nora.

440
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:51,366
- Should look nice in your garden.
- But it should go in now...

441
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:55,366
- I'll be pleased to plant that.
- Oh, thank you, Pompey.

442
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:58,444
Oh, the Hash outfit just arrived.
Burn eight.

443
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,606
Not too close
to the ocotillo bush, Pompey.

444
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:04,046
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:11,441
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-At-Law."

446
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,606
You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.

447
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,320
You really aim
to hang that up outside?

448
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,483
That's why I painted it.

449
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,995
Well, take some advice, pilgrim.

450
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:27,325
You put that thing up,
you'll have to defend it with a gun,

451
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,165
and you ain't exactly the type.

452
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,763
Comin' up.

453
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,445
Well, thank you.

454
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:42,515
A girl needs six hands on Saturday
night, and it's so hot. Look at me.

455
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:46,480
Any more colour and you'd be
prettier than that cactus rose.

456
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:49,724
Why, Tom, that's mighty flattering.

457
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,806
Burn me a good, thick one, Pete,
meat and potatoes.

458
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:57,123
- Hello, Kaintuck.
- Evening, Tom.

459
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,999
Oh...

460
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:05,038
- Tom.
- Object to company, Mr Peabody?

461
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,726
Not to yours, Tom.
Sit down, sit down.

462
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:14,840
I suppose you know
who's across the street?

463
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,237
Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.

464
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:22,757
He won't like what
the town's been saying about him

465
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:24,445
and that hold-up.

466
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,165
How about you, Kaintuck?

467
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,959
- I'd like a st-st...
- Steak?

468
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,759
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well-burnt.

469
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:34,321
- And d-d-dee...
- Deep-dish apple pie.

470
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,801
- Yeah.
- Coming up.

471
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:41,640
Mighty nice girl, that Hallie.
Mighty pretty.

472
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,882
I agree with you, sir.

473
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:45,565
Just told her so.

474
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:48,519
What? Do I hear wedding bells?

475
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:53,402
- When can I print the story?
- Don't rush me, Mr Editor.

476
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:56,280
- Don't rush me.
- Oh.

477
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:03,445
There's your cactus rose.
Sure is pretty.

478
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:05,364
Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.

479
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:08,126
- Go in and get supper.
- Thank you, ma'am.

480
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh, Rance.

481
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,356
Look at that. Isn't that
the prettiest thing you ever saw?

482
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,796
Yeah, it's very pretty.

483
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:25,162
Did you ever see a real rose?

484
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,924
No.

485
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,445
But someday if they dam the river,
we'll have water

486
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,478
and all kinds of flowers.

487
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:36,324
(Peter) Hallie!

488
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,405
When you finish the dishes,
will you help wait tables?

489
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:48,359
- Sure.
- Washing dishes is enough for him.

490
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:53,037
- A man waiting on tables?!
- Well, no, I'd be glad to help.

491
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:55,043
Be glad to.

492
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:56,281
I thought we was busy.

493
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,360
(All chattering)

494
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:07,438
(Chattering stops)

495
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,684
Well, these steaks look done
just right for us.

496
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:41,402
You cowhands ain't in no hurry
to eat, are you?

497
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,517
Well, I am!

498
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:49,764
I g-g-guess
we could do with another drink.

499
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:54,599
That's right neighbourly
of you, partner.

500
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,717
(Man laughing)

501
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,477
Especially after all the lies

502
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:04,724
I hear folks been saying
about Liberty Valance.

503
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:08,877
(Peter) Oh, wait a minute!

504
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:12,567
One of Mamma's pies for Tom.

505
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,604
Well... (Chuckles)

506
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:33,721
Lookee at the new waitress.

507
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,758
(Laughter)

508
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,198
(Laughter)

509
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,602
That's my steak, Valance.

510
00:41:56,727 --> 00:42:00,561
You heard him, dude. Pick it up.

511
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,722
- No!
- (Tom) Pilgrim, hold it.

512
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:07,726
I said you, Valance. You pick it up.

513
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:10,565
Three against one, Doniphon.

514
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:14,638
My boy Pompey in the kitchen door.

515
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:21,046
(Cocks rifle)

516
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,723
I'll get it, Liberty.

517
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,166
(Grunts)

518
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:31,478
I said you, Liberty.

519
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,842
You pick it up.

520
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:40,283
What's the matter?
Everybody here kill-crazy?

521
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:41,680
Here!

522
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:46,041
There!

523
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:47,561
There!

524
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:52,005
Now! It's picked up!

525
00:42:56,567 --> 00:43:00,480
Why don't you get yourself
a fresh steak on me?

526
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,197
Show's over for now.

527
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:13,645
Try it, Liberty.

528
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:15,325
Just try it.

529
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,165
Well, get out!

530
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:25,318
(Piano playing in saloon)

531
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,963
(Gunshots and screaming)

532
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,804
(Horses neighing)

533
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:56,564
(Glass breaks)

534
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:01,565
(Gunshots)

535
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,806
(Tom) Now, I wonder
what scared him off.

536
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:16,283
You know what!
The spectacle of law and order here

537
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:19,205
rising up out of the gravy
and the mashed potatoes!

538
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:22,045
All right, all right,
you made your point.

539
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:24,157
The gun scared him off.

540
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:26,926
Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom.

541
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:29,401
Why did you interfere?
He tripped me.

542
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,119
It was my steak.

543
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,601
And you would have
killed him for it!

544
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:37,276
Or he would have killed you -
over one measly steak!

545
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:41,400
- That's why I picked it up!
- Thanks for saving my life, pilgrim.

546
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:43,438
That isn't why I did it!

547
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:47,321
Nobody fights my battles.

548
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,078
Rance, I'm sorry.

549
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:36,198
Peter, I'm not in the habit
of eating my steak off the floor.

550
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,435
Well, cool off, pilgrim.

551
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,876
It's all over. Nobody got hurt.

552
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:47,680
It is not all over,
and everybody here knows it.

553
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,878
- He'll be back.
- He will, but not after me.

554
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:52,485
After you, pilgrim.

555
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:55,837
(Peabody) And you can't
shoot back with a law book.

556
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,798
What Peabody's saying is,

557
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:01,396
if you want to stay healthy,
there's two ways to do it.

558
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,042
Buy a gun or leave the territory,
is that what he meant?

559
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,555
- That's it, pilgrim.
- By golly...

560
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:11,156
I'd hate to see you go.
You're news, Mr Stoddard,

561
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:14,165
and you've been news
ever since you hit town.

562
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:17,119
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-At-Law."

563
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:21,843
Oh. I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings out there.

564
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,718
Hey, I'll tell you what.

565
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:25,564
You decide to stick around,

566
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:29,236
and I'll let you hang this thing
outside the newspaper office,

567
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,721
rent-free, for as long as it lasts.

568
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:33,359
No.

569
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:36,399
No. The first time
Liberty rides into town,

570
00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:40,281
he'll shoot it to pieces,
and the whole newspaper office.

571
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:42,318
How about that, Mr Peabody?

572
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,677
Well, uh... that'd be news.

573
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,922
I accept your offer, Mr Peabody.

574
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,879
How about letting me
hang that up tomorrow?

575
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:53,521
Huh? Tomorrow?

576
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,240
- Uh... well, of course.
- Thank you.

577
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:58,084
Why not?

578
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:05,002
I'm staying,
and I'm not buying a gun either.

579
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,117
Well, good luck, pilgrim.

580
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,878
Oh, Hallie,
I'll be out of town for a while,

581
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:15,725
north of the Picketwire,
horse-trading.

582
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,038
Goodbye, Tom.

583
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:25,325
Oh, and take note
of what goes on around town

584
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:27,323
because by the time I get back,

585
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,086
there won't be
no newspaper to read it in.

586
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:03,042
Well, any news?

587
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:05,317
Hansons had a baby boy, eight pounds.

588
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,165
- But not twins?
- Not twins.

589
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:11,040
Here, I got this list
of voters for you.

590
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:14,397
There are 37 new registrations
over last year,

591
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,086
and not one single one
needed a lawyer.

592
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,766
Oh. 37, huh?

593
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:23,038
Well, by golly!
If we can only get them to vote,

594
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:25,726
maybe we can handle
those cattle barons

595
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:27,997
from across the Picketwire, huh?

596
00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:51,475
Well, did...
did you write this, Mr Peabody?

597
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:53,966
Yeah.

598
00:48:56,487 --> 00:48:58,478
Well, this is great.

599
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:02,325
You like it?

600
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,358
This thing's just great.

601
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,926
Well...

602
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:11,962
(Peabody) As my old boss,
Horace Greeley, used to say,

603
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:14,123
"we'll tear their hearts out."

604
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:18,843
I'll be right there.

605
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,840
Let me have this.
I'll use it in class.

606
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:29,286
Well...

607
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:34,885
Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.

608
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:38,761
A teacher should never
be late for class. Take your seats.

609
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:41,765
Well, this is quite a turnout
this morning.

610
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,718
We have more pupils every day.

611
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,758
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning, Rance.

612
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:47,923
- How are you feeling?
- Just fine, fine.

613
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,959
- Your head cold?
- Oh, no, no. I have a...

614
00:49:52,807 --> 00:49:56,800
Excuse me. I just wanted
to see how Julietta was doing.

615
00:49:56,847 --> 00:50:00,044
- Julietta's doing fine.
- Oh, gracias, señor.

616
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:03,124
How's the rest of my family
doing in reading?

617
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,079
Well, Hallie's in charge
of the kindergarten.

618
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:09,199
Hallie, why don't you
run through the ABCs?

619
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:15,203
All right, you ready?

620
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:20,081
One, two, three.

621
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:24,006
# A, B, C, D, E, F, G

622
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:27,835
# H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

623
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:31,596
# Q, R, S and T, U, V

624
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:35,526
# W, X and Y and Z

625
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:39,526
# Now I know my ABCs

626
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:43,082
# Tell me what you think of me #

627
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:45,925
(Rance) Well, that was just fine,
just fine.

628
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:49,039
Well, I see a couple more
new pupils back there.

629
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:53,842
Highpockets, Kaintuck, you fellas
really serious about readin'?

630
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,560
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.

631
00:50:56,607 --> 00:51:01,078
Uh... well, Miss Ha-Ha-Hallie,

632
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,687
she talked
such a right smart argument

633
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,766
to the Lazy J b-b-b...
the boss of the Lazy J...

634
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:11,800
Well, he just up and told
all the hands to c-c-cut the cards

635
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:15,522
to see who come to sc-sc-sc-school,
and I lost.

636
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:19,355
I see. Well, we'll try...
Good morning, Mr Carruthers.

637
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:23,366
Good morning. Caught him
playing hookey again, fishing.

638
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,284
Catch anything, Herbert?

639
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:28,558
- No, sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.

640
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,360
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.

641
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,126
For the benefit
of those of you just starting...

642
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:37,477
uh, none of us in here smoke,
Mr Carruthers.

643
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:40,719
(Rance) Thank you.

644
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,918
For those of you
who have just started,

645
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,243
I might explain to you
that we've begun the school

646
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,847
by studying about our country

647
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:53,242
and, uh, how it's governed.

648
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:56,438
Now, let's see.
Well, now, Nora...

649
00:51:56,487 --> 00:52:01,117
Would you tell the class what you've
learned about the United States?

650
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:11,003
The United States... is a republic...

651
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:15,080
and a republic...

652
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:18,756
is a state... in which...

653
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:21,798
the people are the boss.

654
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:25,079
That means us.

655
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:28,840
And if the big shots in Washington

656
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:31,401
don't do like we want,

657
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:34,200
we don't vote for them,
by golly, no more.

658
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:36,761
- Any more!
- Any more.

659
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:40,004
(Rance) That's fine, Nora.
That's just fine.

660
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:43,403
Now, I wonder
if anybody in class remembers

661
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:46,678
what the basic law
of the land is called.

662
00:52:46,727 --> 00:52:48,445
You remember I told you

663
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:51,445
it had to be added to
and changed sometimes

664
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:53,478
by things called amendments.

665
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:57,236
Does anybody remember?
Julietta, your hand's always up.

666
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:00,120
Here, l-let's...
Pompey, you try this one.

667
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:08,205
It was writ by Mr Thomas Jefferson
of Virginia.

668
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:12,286
- "Was written", Pompey.
- Written by Mr Thomas Jefferson.

669
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:16,286
- He called it the Constitution.
- Declaration of Independence.

670
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:22,880
Uh, it begun with the words, uh...
"We hold these truths to be," uh...

671
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:25,885
- Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.

672
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:29,522
Uh, "self-evident that... that..."

673
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:32,320
(Rance) "That all men
are created equal."

674
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:36,245
(Rance) That's fine, Pompey.

675
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:38,847
I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.

676
00:53:38,887 --> 00:53:42,926
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.

677
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,527
- Thank you.
- This law also states

678
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,843
that the governing power
rests with the electorate.

679
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:52,482
Now, that means you,
that means the people.

680
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:57,157
And you exercise this power through
the vote. Now, then. Yes?

681
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:59,641
Con permiso, los gentlemens?

682
00:53:59,687 --> 00:54:01,359
Huh? Oh!

683
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:05,759
Well, uh, Hallie?
Go right ahead, Hallie.

684
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:11,643
Now, here is the best textbook in
the world. It's an honest newspaper.

685
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:16,124
This is the Shinbone Star,
Dutton Peabody, Editor in Chief.

686
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,204
And reading this ought to
bring home to everybody

687
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:22,205
the importance of using that vote.

688
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:25,478
Now, the headlines say,
"Cattlemen fight statehood.

689
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,518
"Small homesteaders in danger."

690
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:31,958
It says clearly that if big ranchers
north of the Picketwire River

691
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,522
win their fight to keep this
territory in open reign,

692
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,478
then all your truck farms

693
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:41,884
and your corn, the small shopkeepers
and everything,

694
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:45,966
the future of your kids,
it will all be all over, be gone!

695
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:49,044
And they call upon you
in this article...

696
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,922
they call upon you to unite
behind a real strong delegate

697
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,755
and carry this fight to Washington
if necessary.

698
00:54:57,807 --> 00:54:59,525
Hello, Tom.

699
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,797
Welcome back. You want to join us?

700
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,838
I'm looking for Pompey.

701
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:08,005
I've been away three weeks, and
there's no sashes or doors in yet.

702
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:12,916
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.

703
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:16,562
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...

704
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:20,680
What I got to say to you
will be a whole lot rougher.

705
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:24,276
The good editor here
has written some noble words,

706
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:27,876
and you read 'em good,
but if you put that paper out,

707
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:31,237
the streets of Shinbone
will be running with blood.

708
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,404
Why are you against this,
Tom, you of all people?

709
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,645
Aren't there more votes
south of the Picketwire than north?

710
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:41,997
That's right, but votes
won't stand up against guns.

711
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,481
Guns? What guns, Tom?

712
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:48,600
You think Valance stays away
from here cos he's scared of you?

713
00:55:48,647 --> 00:55:51,878
He's recruiting hired guns
for the big ranchers.

714
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:53,406
- Julietta.
- Sí?

715
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,199
Take the little ones home.

716
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:56,726
- Oandale!
- Oandale!

717
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,120
Come on.

718
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:01,842
Hallie, it would be a good idea
if you dismissed class.

719
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:04,959
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.

720
00:56:05,007 --> 00:56:06,565
(Rings bell)

721
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:09,167
Class dismissed!
Same time tomorrow.

722
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:11,516
(Carruthers) You get to the store.

723
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:17,087
This could get worse
than the sheep wars.

724
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:20,881
- Will they start anything here?
- It's already started.

725
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:24,283
Valance and his men
crossed the river yesterday,

726
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,921
killed old man Holiday and his son.

727
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,765
- You know that for a fact, Tom?
- I do.

728
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:33,720
They tried to bushwhack me,
unfortunately for one of them.

729
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,122
You gonna put that
in your newspaper?

730
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,397
It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.

731
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,802
Print that,
he'll kill you, sure as hell.

732
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:43,839
(Link) You think
they'll come here, Tom?

733
00:56:43,887 --> 00:56:46,799
They'll be here,
tomorrow or the next day,

734
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,237
according to how much
who-hit-John they consume,

735
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:54,883
but election day, pilgrim, you can
depend on it, they'll be here.

736
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,918
Hallie, go back where you belong.

737
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:59,435
I don't want you
in no shooting gallery.

738
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:01,796
Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.

739
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:04,998
What I do and where I go
is none of your business.

740
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,003
You don't own me.

741
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,923
Like I said, Hallie,

742
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:12,561
you're awful pretty
when you get mad.

743
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,484
Hal.

744
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:35,241
Rance, after all you've taught us,

745
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:38,757
how can you say
we should knuckle under now?

746
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,923
You heard what Tom said.

747
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:44,437
When force threatens,
talk's no good any more.

748
00:57:49,647 --> 00:57:51,444
Hallie...

749
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,524
Hallie, you go find Tom
and make it up to him.

750
00:57:56,567 --> 00:57:57,966
He...

751
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,396
He's only trying to protect you.

752
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,004
(Bell rings gently)

753
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,796
Rance.

754
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:43,361
Rance!

755
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,244
Better let him go, Hallie.

756
00:58:49,287 --> 00:58:52,359
Why? Where's he going?

757
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,285
He's gonna need
all the practice he can get.

758
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:59,722
Practice? What are you talking about?

759
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:06,156
I might as well let you know now.

760
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:10,200
When he decided to come in with me,
I let him have a gun of mine.

761
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:14,923
He's been going out in the country
twice a week, practising, ever since.

762
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:20,679
You mean he's going to face up
to Liberty... Liberty Valance?

763
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,126
Rance?

764
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:24,522
That's the only way I can figure it.

765
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:27,877
He never would discuss it.
He just... keeps on...

766
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:30,758
practising.

767
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:41,725
Tom! Tom Doniphon!

768
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,119
(Tom) Hey, professor.

769
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:53,599
Where you going?

770
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:00,757
I want to talk to you.

771
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:03,321
- Tom, I'm going...
- Hyah!

772
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:28,042
Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.

773
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,682
Well, all right, Tom,
what are you trying to tell me?

774
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:39,480
I'm telling you
that Hallie's my girl.

775
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm building that new room and porch
for her for when we get married.

776
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:49,717
Tom, everybody pretty much
takes that for granted.

777
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:53,282
Everybody except Hallie, maybe you.

778
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,887
That's a damn lie, and you know it.

779
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,684
Then why did she come to me
fretting herself sick

780
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:06,720
because you were gonna get killed
facing up to Liberty Valance?

781
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:10,043
- I never told her.
- Well, Peabody did.

782
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,282
I think you're bluffing.

783
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:16,957
I'm not bluffing about anything.
Wait a minute, Tom. What?

784
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,360
Pompey.

785
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:21,967
Bring two or three
of those paint cans.

786
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:31,244
- You got a gun?
- Yes...

787
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,084
Get it.

788
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:41,684
Come on.

789
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,158
All right, gunslinger.

790
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,278
Hit that can.

791
01:01:55,647 --> 01:01:58,036
Pretty far.

792
01:01:58,087 --> 01:01:59,600
Pilgrim...

793
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:03,479
- You got to cock it first.
- I forgot.

794
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:09,118
(Horses whinnying)

795
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:13,961
Balance it light in your hand
and don't jerk the trigger.

796
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:16,840
- Squeeze.
- You don't have to coach me.

797
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:29,124
(Tom) Pompey... bring me those cans.

798
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:33,397
Give me that thing.
I'll show you how easy it is.

799
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:36,477
Take these cans...

800
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:38,802
put 'em on those three posts.

801
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:42,324
Go ahead.

802
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:50,155
That's it. That first post.

803
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:52,357
- There?
- That's right.

804
01:02:57,647 --> 01:02:59,638
Not there!

805
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:01,166
On the far post.

806
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,278
That's right.

807
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,842
Put that last one in the middle.

808
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:17,802
Pilgrim!

809
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:34,036
I hate tricks, pilgrim,

810
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:37,284
but that's what you're up against
with Valance.

811
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:40,567
He's almost as fast as I am.

812
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:50,163
I don't like tricks myself,
so that makes us even!

813
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:57,525
Hey, pilgrim.

814
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,842
You forgot your popgun.

815
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:02,639
(Pompey laughs)

816
01:04:17,447 --> 01:04:19,483
I got you, Lyde.

817
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:21,483
Ruf McMard.

818
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:22,960
Highpockets.

819
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:24,998
Kaintuck. Kaintuck!

820
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:27,038
Leave the jug.

821
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,244
(Nora) Ohh.

822
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:43,040
Well, Hallie, I am so proud of him!

823
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,043
(Sobbing)

824
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:48,921
Dutton Peabody
exercising his franchise.

825
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:52,277
- (Clerk) Dutton Peabody.
- Ransom Stoddard.

826
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:56,081
Rance, we'll need you
for some of that legal stuff later.

827
01:04:56,127 --> 01:04:59,403
Ransom Stoddard,
attorney-at-law. Check.

828
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,646
Peter Ericson, American citizen.

829
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,245
Ah, go on in, Pete.

830
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:06,879
See you for supper, Pete?

831
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:08,326
Yeah.

832
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:10,845
(Pete) Hey, Tom! Tom!

833
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,525
Yeah, Pete?

834
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,957
- Tom, look, we need a statehood!
- I agree.

835
01:05:16,007 --> 01:05:17,998
- A statehood!
- I agree.

836
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:23,083
- Herbert.
- Yes, sir?

837
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,004
You're too young to vote.

838
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,083
(All shouting)

839
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:48,043
(Peabody) Greetings.
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.

840
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:50,476
- (Banging glass)
- The usual, Jack.

841
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:52,358
Bar's closed.

842
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,558
The bar is closed,
Mr Editor, during voting.

843
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:57,757
You can blame your lawyer friend.

844
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:01,516
He says that's one of
the fundamental laws of democracy.

845
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:03,444
No exception.

846
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:06,081
No exceptions for the working press?

847
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:09,676
Oh, that's carrying democracy
much too far.

848
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,123
- A small beer.
- Bar is closed.

849
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:15,158
Give me that bung starter.

850
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:18,596
Since when is beer-drinking...

851
01:06:18,647 --> 01:06:20,444
Tom. Tom!

852
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,998
All right. Settle down!
Sit down, everybody!

853
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:29,357
- Come on. Settle down.
- Settle down.

854
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:31,477
Settle down.

855
01:06:31,527 --> 01:06:36,203
Well, since our legal authority
closed the bar on us,

856
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:41,082
I propose that Ransom Stoddard,
attorney-at-law,

857
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:43,322
come up here and run this meeting.

858
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,040
- I second the motion!
- I third it!

859
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,282
(Man) Ransom. There he is.
There he is.

860
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:12,005
(Rance) All right.
All right. All right.

861
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:16,837
All right, now, if that's what
you want, I can show you the rules.

862
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:21,925
The meeting will come to order.
Settle down please, huh?

863
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:25,277
Mr Peabody, would you keep
a record of the meeting?

864
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:28,046
Oh, Rance, please.
There are other men...

865
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,282
- Give me a drink!
- Bar's closed.

866
01:07:30,327 --> 01:07:33,876
- A beer's not drinking!
- Bar's closed.

867
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:37,203
- Before we start...
- Sit down, Doctor, please!

868
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:40,319
- (Laughter)
- I have a pencil right here.

869
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,720
Thank you.

870
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:47,080
Now... you, uh,
you all know why we're here.

871
01:07:47,127 --> 01:07:49,687
We're here to elect two delegates

872
01:07:49,727 --> 01:07:54,596
because a growing population south
of the Picketwire entitles us to two.

873
01:07:54,647 --> 01:07:59,402
These two delegates will represent us
in the convention for statehood.

874
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:01,438
(Cheering)

875
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:05,719
You know the issue.

876
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:10,045
The cattle interests want to keep
this territory an open range.

877
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,362
(Crowd) No!

878
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:16,366
Ruled by their high-handed ideas,
whatever they are.

879
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:19,365
And we - that means
everybody in this room -

880
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:22,479
- we're for statehood!
- (Cheering)

881
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,004
We want statehood

882
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:29,642
because it means the protection
of our farms and fences

883
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:33,885
and it means schools for our children
and progress for the future!

884
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:35,599
(Cheering)

885
01:08:35,647 --> 01:08:38,798
- Can I get...
- Shut... Just sit down, please.

886
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:42,123
(Rance) Now we'll proceed
with the nominations.

887
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:45,436
You can nominate
as many as you feel like,

888
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:48,684
and in order to show you
how this procedure works,

889
01:08:48,727 --> 01:08:50,763
I'm going to step out of the chair.

890
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:53,640
That's parliamentary law,
you can do that.

891
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:58,807
I'll step out of the chair
and make the first nomination.

892
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:01,042
I'd like to nominate

893
01:09:01,087 --> 01:09:03,885
a man I think
is the only man in Shinbone

894
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:08,284
who has the qualifications to lead
us in our fight for statehood.

895
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:11,319
I could stand up here
and talk about him all day,

896
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:15,645
but I know everybody here could too
and that's not necessary.

897
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:18,599
I nominate Tom Doniphon.

898
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:33,642
(Tom) Come on, sit down!

899
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:35,325
Sit down!

900
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:39,603
Stop sucking on that cigar
and put that pencil away

901
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:42,161
because I refuse the nomination.

902
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:45,085
- You can't refuse now!
- Oh, yes, I can,

903
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:48,597
because I got other plans,
personal plans.

904
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:52,242
Mr Attorney...
Go on with your meeting.

905
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,640
(Crowd) Ohh.

906
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:56,604
(Horses approaching)

907
01:10:07,367 --> 01:10:11,042
You don't live south
of the Picketwire. You got no vote.

908
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:13,555
I live where I hang my hat.

909
01:10:26,247 --> 01:10:29,159
(Valance) Come on, move!
Out of the way!

910
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,085
(Valance) Get out.

911
01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:42,960
Well, hash slinger, what are you
looking so high and mighty about?

912
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:46,522
He's running this here meeting,
or hadn't you heard?

913
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:48,558
The whole shebang.

914
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:52,561
I'd like to nominate the chairman,

915
01:10:52,607 --> 01:10:57,283
Mr Ransom Stoddard, as delegate
to the territorial convention.

916
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:58,726
Wait a minute...

917
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,519
I second that nomination,

918
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:04,526
not only because he knows the law,
but he throws a good punch.

919
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:08,196
Now listen, all you sodbusters,
you hard-rock farmers.

920
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:12,206
- I aim to be the delegate.
- You don't live south...

921
01:11:12,247 --> 01:11:14,317
Floyd, say your piece like I said.

922
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:16,562
I nominate
Liberty Valance for delegate.

923
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:19,758
- I second the nomination.
- Move the nominations be closed.

924
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,638
Now, wait a minute.

925
01:11:21,687 --> 01:11:24,155
That ain't legal,
is it, Mr Attorney?

926
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:25,640
No.

927
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:29,760
We need two good delegates
to Capitol City, Valance.

928
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:33,766
Two honest men.
We've got one in you, Mr Stoddard.

929
01:11:33,807 --> 01:11:36,275
You looking for trouble, Doniphon?

930
01:11:36,327 --> 01:11:38,283
You helping me find some?

931
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:49,162
- You heard my motion, dude!
- All right. Put his name down.

932
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:51,482
Liberty Valance, address unknown.

933
01:11:51,527 --> 01:11:54,803
- Have I got a right to speak?
- Go ahead, Highpockets.

934
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:59,477
What about Mr Peabody? He can read
and write and he runs the newspaper.

935
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:01,518
Yeah, and when he's drinking,

936
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,480
why, he can talk the ears
off of a w-w-wooden Indian.

937
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:08,564
- (Laughter)
- I second the motion.

938
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:11,163
No...

939
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:13,163
No! I...

940
01:12:13,207 --> 01:12:15,437
No, you don't. No!

941
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:19,924
I'm a newspaperman,
not a politician!

942
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:24,245
No, politicians are my meat!
I build 'em up. I tear 'em down.

943
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:27,040
But I wouldn't be one.
I couldn't be one!

944
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:30,477
- It would destroy me! Give me a...
- Bar's closed.

945
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:32,085
(Laughter)

946
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:36,200
Good people of Shinbone,
I... l... l'm your conscience.

947
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:39,717
I'm the still, small voice
that thunders in the night.

948
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:42,964
I'm your watchdog
that howls against the wolves.

949
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,601
I'm... l'm your Father Confessor!

950
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:48,081
I... l... l'm...

951
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,005
- What else am I?
- Town drunk?

952
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:53,038
(Laughter)

953
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:56,043
(Rance) Dutton Peabody.
Write it down.

954
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:58,317
I move the nominations be closed.

955
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,676
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?

956
01:13:00,727 --> 01:13:02,206
(All) Aye!

957
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:05,683
(Rance) Now we'll proceed
with the election.

958
01:13:06,927 --> 01:13:10,681
You sodbusters are a brave bunch
when you're together,

959
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:12,718
but don't vote any way now

960
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:15,884
that you'll regret later
when you're alone.

961
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:23,922
All those in favour of...
Ransom Stoddard as delegate,

962
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,958
raise your hands.

963
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:27,998
(All) Aye!

964
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:32,480
All those in favour of Liberty
Valance, raise your hands.

965
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,156
All those in favour of Dutton
Peabody, raise your hands!

966
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:49,196
(All) Aye!

967
01:13:49,247 --> 01:13:52,000
- This calls for a drink!
- The bar's closed.

968
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:54,720
According to Mr Stoddard,
the bar's closed.

969
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,555
- Anything further on the election?
- No, the election's finished.

970
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:00,598
Then the bar is open.

971
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:02,319
(Cheering)

972
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,483
(Piano playing)

973
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,958
That vote don't mean a thing.

974
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:14,682
Stay out of this. He's been hiding
behind your gun long enough.

975
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:16,638
You got a choice, dishwasher.

976
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:20,236
Either you leave town,
or tonight be on that street alone.

977
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,246
You be there,
and don't make us come and get you.

978
01:14:38,647 --> 01:14:42,196
Well... he called it plain.

979
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:46,678
Too bad you didn't
come to me sooner with that gun.

980
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:52,278
Pilgrim.

981
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:53,999
Come full dark,

982
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:57,084
Pompey will be at the Swedes' place
with a buckboard.

983
01:14:57,127 --> 01:14:59,322
Why don't you get out of town?

984
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:02,884
Thanks.

985
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:37,244
"Liberty Valance defeated."

986
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,403
"D-E-F-E-E?

987
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:42,917
"E-T-E-D?"

988
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:44,446
Ohh.

989
01:15:44,487 --> 01:15:48,241
The unsteady hand betrays, huh?

990
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:52,485
Hmph. What's the matter, Mr Peabody?!

991
01:15:54,327 --> 01:15:56,636
Are you afraid, huh?

992
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,645
The answer is indubitablyably...

993
01:16:03,087 --> 01:16:04,600
yes.

994
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:12,967
No courage left.

995
01:16:14,687 --> 01:16:19,886
Well, courage
can be purchased at yon tavern.

996
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:23,846
But have we credit?

997
01:16:23,887 --> 01:16:27,482
Huh? That is the question.
Have we credit?

998
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:30,962
Well...

999
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:33,362
credit is cheap.

1000
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:41,001
Wait for me... old servant
of the public wheel.

1001
01:16:42,927 --> 01:16:45,760
Our shining hour is yet to come.

1002
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:48,486
Oh.

1003
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,556
As for you, Horace Greeley...

1004
01:16:57,607 --> 01:17:03,125
go west, old man, and grow young
with the country.

1005
01:17:04,807 --> 01:17:06,798
(Woman singing)

1006
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:18,681
Ohh!

1007
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:21,605
Don't do that, Mr Peabody.

1008
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:23,126
Why are you out here?

1009
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:26,842
Don't you know that everybody
has to get off the street?

1010
01:17:26,887 --> 01:17:30,482
My inalienable right...
the pursuit of happiness.

1011
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:34,839
Sure, but don't go to the saloon.
Liberty Valance is back there.

1012
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:38,277
You should hear
what he's swearing to do to Rance.

1013
01:17:38,327 --> 01:17:40,966
And he ain't
leaving you out, either.

1014
01:17:41,007 --> 01:17:43,760
Go in and let the Mexican fill that.

1015
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:48,278
But I doubt if my credit is good with
these Spanish-American gentlemen.

1016
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:49,919
Sure, it is.

1017
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:53,323
He's my wife's step-uncle
by her sister's marriage.

1018
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:56,962
But please say something nice
about me in your paper?

1019
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:59,123
My dear friend, Link Appleyard?

1020
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,079
The fearless,
fighting marshal of the west?

1021
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:06,643
(Laughs) Your name will go down
in history with Buffalo Bill!

1022
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,245
(Cheering)

1023
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:20,440
(Hallie) Mr Peabody's drunk as
a skunk over in that Mexican joint.

1024
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:23,445
- He ain't eating tonight.
- Hallie!

1025
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,762
"Isn't" eating tonight, remember?

1026
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:29,356
Isn't, ain't,
what difference does it make?

1027
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:33,366
Ain't going to be school any more
with you leaving tonight.

1028
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:39,164
(Pompey) Good evening, folks.

1029
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:41,960
Mr Rance,
I have the buckboard out here.

1030
01:18:42,007 --> 01:18:44,919
I'll be waiting for you,
if you need me.

1031
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:49,323
Go, Rance. Go now, while you can.

1032
01:18:49,367 --> 01:18:51,927
Nora and Hallie
can finish the dishes.

1033
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:55,479
Ja, Rance.

1034
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:59,042
Go. Please go.

1035
01:19:00,087 --> 01:19:02,760
I owe you
for three days' room and board.

1036
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:06,959
I... I just want
to square my account.

1037
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,919
I want to square my account
before I go.

1038
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:32,236
And those in England now asleep
shall think themselves accursed!

1039
01:19:32,287 --> 01:19:35,518
They were not here whilst any lives

1040
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:39,719
that fought with us
on St Crispin's Day.

1041
01:19:42,447 --> 01:19:45,837
But when the blast,
the blast of war,

1042
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:51,325
blows in our ears
and we summon up...

1043
01:19:54,647 --> 01:19:56,603
Liberty Valance.

1044
01:19:57,287 --> 01:19:59,243
And his vermidons!

1045
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:11,279
Liberty Valance taking liberties
with the liberty of the press?

1046
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:13,716
Had your supper yet, Peabody?

1047
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,485
My supper?

1048
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:17,757
No. That's a splendid idea!

1049
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:32,716
Well, you can start by eating this.

1050
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:36,280
- That's a poor joke, Liberty!
- Eat it!

1051
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:38,283
Eat it!

1052
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,761
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

1053
01:20:41,727 --> 01:20:43,126
Eat it!

1054
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,158
He's dead!

1055
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,759
(Laughing)

1056
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:04,005
(Women screaming)

1057
01:22:17,407 --> 01:22:19,318
(Valance) Hyah, hyah!

1058
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:52,439
Mr Peabody?

1059
01:22:57,247 --> 01:22:58,999
Rance?

1060
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,484
Rance Stoddard?

1061
01:23:14,087 --> 01:23:15,884
(Footsteps)

1062
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:23,876
- Mr Peabody.
- Help me get him up.

1063
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:32,245
- Where's Doc Willoughby?
- In the saloon.

1064
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:34,164
Go and get him.

1065
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:36,516
(Peabody) Rance?

1066
01:23:36,567 --> 01:23:38,364
Rance!

1067
01:23:47,007 --> 01:23:49,123
I sure told that...

1068
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:51,476
Liberty Valance...

1069
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,995
about the...

1070
01:23:54,047 --> 01:23:57,642
freedom of the press.

1071
01:24:09,727 --> 01:24:11,524
Marshal?

1072
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:34,483
Marshal...

1073
01:24:36,847 --> 01:24:39,919
You tell Liberty Valance
I'll be outside.

1074
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,278
- Pompey!
- Miss Hallie?

1075
01:25:30,327 --> 01:25:32,602
- Where's Mr Tom?
- Down the road...

1076
01:25:32,647 --> 01:25:35,366
Get him!
Rance is out front with a gun!

1077
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:36,965
Yes, ma'am.

1078
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,363
(Willoughby) You've heard
of Gettysburg. 240 amputations...

1079
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:44,480
(Link) Doc, Mr Peabody's awful hurt.
He needs you at his office.

1080
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:46,916
(Valance) Somebody
have an accident?

1081
01:25:48,807 --> 01:25:52,641
So that's it. Another one
of your accidents, huh, Valance?

1082
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,803
I'm waiting for the day
when they call me for you.

1083
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,079
Paid in advance.

1084
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:02,678
(Laughter)

1085
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:08,958
$10 into the cans.

1086
01:26:09,967 --> 01:26:14,882
Liberty, what you did to Mr Peabody,
ain't that enough?

1087
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,157
Ain't that enough what, Mr Marshal?

1088
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:19,004
You know that Stoddard

1089
01:26:19,047 --> 01:26:23,006
couldn't shoot the hat off his
own head with a gun in his hand.

1090
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:26,323
Oh, you mean,
he's got a gun in his hand, huh?

1091
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:30,406
I'm calling you, Valance.
Kings and threes.

1092
01:26:31,127 --> 01:26:32,719
Good hand...

1093
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,598
but not good enough.

1094
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:38,245
Aces and eights. Thank you.

1095
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:42,041
If you gun him down,
it'll just be pure murder.

1096
01:28:03,807 --> 01:28:06,685
Well, Mr Professor,
I thought you left town.

1097
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:09,400
What are you doing out here?

1098
01:28:09,447 --> 01:28:11,677
I'm waiting for Liberty Valance.

1099
01:28:11,727 --> 01:28:13,843
Why doesn't he come out?

1100
01:28:13,887 --> 01:28:16,720
Well, th-that's none
of our b-b-business.

1101
01:28:19,047 --> 01:28:21,766
You heard him say
he had a gun, right?

1102
01:28:21,807 --> 01:28:24,446
- I didn't say that!
- That ain't murder.

1103
01:28:24,487 --> 01:28:27,081
That's clean-cut self-defence.

1104
01:28:27,127 --> 01:28:29,357
You heard him call me out, right?

1105
01:28:29,407 --> 01:28:31,125
Well, didn't you?

1106
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:34,283
Now get out of my way.

1107
01:28:37,447 --> 01:28:39,915
Hash slinger, are you out here?

1108
01:28:41,287 --> 01:28:44,757
I'd say that
was Liberty Valance there now.

1109
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:46,798
Wouldn't you?

1110
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:50,757
- Yes, I would.
- We be seeing you, Mr Stoddard.

1111
01:29:05,127 --> 01:29:07,516
Come closer where I can see you.

1112
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:17,081
Get out of that shadow, dude.

1113
01:29:26,687 --> 01:29:28,279
(Man laughing)

1114
01:30:00,767 --> 01:30:04,123
You got two hands, hash slinger.
Pick it up!

1115
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:14,278
(Valance laughing)

1116
01:30:28,527 --> 01:30:30,358
All right, dude...

1117
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:35,079
this time, right between the eyes.

1118
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:52,522
Liberty?

1119
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,400
Liberty? Liberty!

1120
01:31:12,727 --> 01:31:14,638
Hey, Doc! Doc!

1121
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:17,846
(Floyd) Liberty!

1122
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:57,240
It's Liberty! He's hurt!

1123
01:31:57,287 --> 01:31:58,686
It's Liberty!

1124
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,205
Whisky, quick.

1125
01:32:04,247 --> 01:32:06,158
Here, sir.

1126
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:19,919
Dead.

1127
01:33:09,447 --> 01:33:15,044
(Sobbing) Rance, if it had been you
instead of Valance, I would...

1128
01:33:15,087 --> 01:33:17,681
Oh, no, Hallie.

1129
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:20,036
Hallie.

1130
01:33:20,087 --> 01:33:22,885
I can't help it.

1131
01:33:22,927 --> 01:33:25,566
This feels so guilty.

1132
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:29,280
I didn't... I didn't
want you to run away.

1133
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:31,158
I wanted you to stay.

1134
01:33:31,207 --> 01:33:34,643
Oh, he might... I'm sorry.

1135
01:33:34,687 --> 01:33:36,678
- Forgive me.
- Hallie...

1136
01:33:38,527 --> 01:33:40,518
Hallie, please don't talk.

1137
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,727
(Door opens)

1138
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:04,524
I'm sorry I got here
too late, Hallie.

1139
01:34:05,487 --> 01:34:09,036
You got yourself
out of that fix real handy.

1140
01:34:11,487 --> 01:34:13,398
I'll be around.

1141
01:34:20,007 --> 01:34:22,840
(# Mexican music)

1142
01:34:38,927 --> 01:34:41,964
(Men singing) # La da da
da da da da da

1143
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,601
# La da da da da da da da... #

1144
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:47,036
(Woman) Oay! Oandale!

1145
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:50,079
- Tom! Tom, Liberty...
- I know.

1146
01:34:50,127 --> 01:34:52,243
(Singing continues)

1147
01:35:02,967 --> 01:35:07,040
(Man) Liberty wasn't gonna kill him,
just nick him a little.

1148
01:35:08,047 --> 01:35:11,676
Just gonna make a pass.
You saw that!

1149
01:35:11,727 --> 01:35:14,287
That lawyer shot him in cold blood!

1150
01:35:14,327 --> 01:35:18,798
- Now, that ain't the way we saw it.
- It was murder! Pure murder!

1151
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:22,157
And I say if the Marshal
don't put Stoddard in jail,

1152
01:35:22,207 --> 01:35:24,767
we ought to
take care of him ourselves!

1153
01:35:24,807 --> 01:35:27,162
I say we ought to hang him!

1154
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:30,643
That's right! Hang him! Give him
a rope necktie and let him swing!

1155
01:35:30,687 --> 01:35:35,556
Can't a man get a drink
around this town in peace?

1156
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:43,081
- No one's bothering you.
- You are!

1157
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:50,598
(Tom) Marshal!

1158
01:35:54,567 --> 01:35:57,206
What are you gettin' paid for?
Drag this scum out!

1159
01:35:57,247 --> 01:36:01,763
Kaintuck and Highpockets,
I deputise you to give a hand.

1160
01:36:01,807 --> 01:36:04,799
Hand me that
b-b-bung st-st... That's it.

1161
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:12,439
(Link) Tell those ranchers north
of the Picketwire that hired you

1162
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:16,036
that me, Link Appleyard,
run ya out of town,

1163
01:36:16,087 --> 01:36:19,557
and I'll do it again
if you ever come back!

1164
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:27,242
Now look, Pompey, you know I...

1165
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:29,278
Who says he can't?

1166
01:36:30,047 --> 01:36:32,038
Pour yourself a drink, Pompey.

1167
01:36:32,087 --> 01:36:35,966
- I don't drink no drams, Mr Tom.
- I said take a drink.

1168
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:39,886
No. We got a mare in foal
and horses to feed and water.

1169
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:41,997
Come on home.

1170
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:43,560
Home.

1171
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:48,723
Home sweet home.

1172
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:52,680
You're right, Pompey.
We got plenty to do at home.

1173
01:36:54,127 --> 01:36:57,722
Well, what are they
paying you guys for? Play!

1174
01:36:58,407 --> 01:37:01,080
Be merry! Sing!

1175
01:37:06,887 --> 01:37:08,878
Leave me be!

1176
01:37:14,927 --> 01:37:17,316
(Tom) Hyah! Hyah!

1177
01:37:18,967 --> 01:37:20,639
Hyah!

1178
01:37:22,447 --> 01:37:24,244
Hyah!

1179
01:38:25,407 --> 01:38:27,682
(Horses neighing)

1180
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:31,479
Mr Tom!

1181
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:39,324
(Neighing)

1182
01:38:40,927 --> 01:38:42,918
(Wood creaking)

1183
01:38:59,887 --> 01:39:01,320
(Tom coughing)

1184
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:03,642
The horses, Pompey.

1185
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,484
The horses.

1186
01:39:11,887 --> 01:39:15,004
(Pompey) Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1187
01:39:28,447 --> 01:39:30,165
(Band playing)

1188
01:40:12,087 --> 01:40:15,124
- Hello, sir! How are you?
- Hey!

1189
01:40:18,287 --> 01:40:20,881
Handy Strong! By golly, you made it!

1190
01:40:20,927 --> 01:40:22,918
Yeah! Thanks to Doc Willoughby.

1191
01:40:22,967 --> 01:40:25,037
Here. Let me pin this on you.

1192
01:40:25,087 --> 01:40:27,760
Say, that's him, huh?

1193
01:40:27,807 --> 01:40:29,559
(Whispering)

1194
01:40:32,247 --> 01:40:36,286
- This must be Ransom Stoddard.
- Rance, this is Handy Strong.

1195
01:40:36,327 --> 01:40:39,046
How do you do, sir?
It's quite a city here.

1196
01:40:39,087 --> 01:40:41,806
It's not much
by your eastern standards,

1197
01:40:41,847 --> 01:40:45,920
but that railroad station there
leads straight to Washington.

1198
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:48,162
Oh... oh.

1199
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:50,879
Come on, Rance.

1200
01:40:53,967 --> 01:40:55,958
(Band continues)

1201
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:10,044
Order! Order! Order!

1202
01:41:10,087 --> 01:41:11,918
Order!

1203
01:41:11,967 --> 01:41:14,037
Order! Order!

1204
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:17,238
- (Band stops)
- Order! Order!

1205
01:41:17,287 --> 01:41:19,198
Order!

1206
01:41:20,247 --> 01:41:23,364
Order! Quiet!

1207
01:41:23,647 --> 01:41:26,115
Order! Quiet!

1208
01:41:28,047 --> 01:41:31,722
The roll call having been completed

1209
01:41:31,767 --> 01:41:35,806
and the delegates
recognised and seated,

1210
01:41:35,847 --> 01:41:39,522
this session
of the territorial convention

1211
01:41:39,567 --> 01:41:42,798
is hereby declared open.

1212
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:45,599
(Banging gavel)

1213
01:41:45,647 --> 01:41:47,638
Order!

1214
01:41:48,647 --> 01:41:50,444
Order!

1215
01:41:51,687 --> 01:41:53,837
Mr Chairman.

1216
01:41:56,287 --> 01:42:02,681
The chair recognises the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle...

1217
01:42:02,727 --> 01:42:06,515
soldier, jurist, and statesman.

1218
01:42:07,727 --> 01:42:12,801
Mr Chairman, fellow delegates...

1219
01:42:12,847 --> 01:42:14,803
ladies...

1220
01:42:14,847 --> 01:42:16,883
and gentlemen,

1221
01:42:18,327 --> 01:42:22,798
I came here
with a carefully prepared speech,

1222
01:42:23,967 --> 01:42:28,324
but this is no time for oratory.

1223
01:42:34,007 --> 01:42:38,603
Let me speak to you from the heart.

1224
01:42:40,167 --> 01:42:44,445
I come before you
to place in nomination

1225
01:42:44,487 --> 01:42:49,720
the name of a man
more qualified than any other

1226
01:42:49,767 --> 01:42:53,237
to represent you in Washington.

1227
01:42:53,287 --> 01:42:57,041
Oh, you ill-advised.

1228
01:42:57,087 --> 01:43:00,443
Oh, you poorly counselled.

1229
01:43:00,487 --> 01:43:05,322
Fly not in the face
of heaven's handiwork.

1230
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:09,155
Join with us in supportin' the man

1231
01:43:09,207 --> 01:43:12,597
who for five terms in Congress

1232
01:43:12,647 --> 01:43:18,836
has kept this
great territory inviolate.

1233
01:43:18,887 --> 01:43:24,280
I nominate
for the territorial delegate

1234
01:43:24,327 --> 01:43:28,559
to the Congress of the United States

1235
01:43:28,607 --> 01:43:34,159
the Right Honourable
Custis Buck Langhorne.

1236
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:36,357
(Cheering and music)

1237
01:43:49,967 --> 01:43:52,435
(Band plays Home On The Range)

1238
01:43:58,047 --> 01:43:59,685
(Chairman) Order! Order!

1239
01:43:59,727 --> 01:44:01,479
(Booing)

1240
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:16,406
Now that you got your rope on him,
hang the horse thief!

1241
01:44:16,447 --> 01:44:18,517
(Laughter)

1242
01:44:24,327 --> 01:44:26,204
(Chairman) Order! Order!

1243
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,356
(Band plays fanfare)

1244
01:44:37,407 --> 01:44:40,877
(Chairman) Order! Order!

1245
01:44:43,447 --> 01:44:46,041
Order! Order!

1246
01:44:46,087 --> 01:44:50,046
This is a convention,
not a rodeo, Langhorne!

1247
01:44:53,767 --> 01:44:56,156
Mr Chairman! Mr Chairman!

1248
01:44:56,207 --> 01:45:00,598
The chair recognises
its old friend...

1249
01:45:00,647 --> 01:45:05,084
that distinguished member
of the fourth estate...

1250
01:45:05,127 --> 01:45:09,245
founder, owner,
publisher and editor

1251
01:45:09,287 --> 01:45:11,676
of the Shinbone Star...

1252
01:45:11,727 --> 01:45:16,243
Mr Dutton Peabody, Esquire.

1253
01:45:20,087 --> 01:45:23,238
Thank you, Mr Chairman,
for those kind words,

1254
01:45:23,287 --> 01:45:25,243
but tell them the whole truth.

1255
01:45:25,287 --> 01:45:27,118
Founder, owner, editor

1256
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:29,362
and I also sweep out the place.

1257
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:32,126
(Chairman bangs gavel)

1258
01:45:32,167 --> 01:45:35,125
Fellow delegates, like all of you,

1259
01:45:35,167 --> 01:45:40,639
I have listened in awe and admiration
to the magnificent oratory

1260
01:45:40,687 --> 01:45:44,396
of the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle...

1261
01:45:44,447 --> 01:45:46,085
the cattlemen's mouthpiece.

1262
01:45:46,127 --> 01:45:49,005
The lowing herd is still with us.

1263
01:45:50,647 --> 01:45:54,356
But, uh, seriously,
under the spell of his eloquence,

1264
01:45:54,407 --> 01:45:57,763
I could see once again
the vast herd of buffalo

1265
01:45:57,807 --> 01:46:01,322
and savage redskin
roaming our beautiful territory

1266
01:46:01,367 --> 01:46:04,962
with no law to trammel them
except the law of survival,

1267
01:46:05,007 --> 01:46:07,919
the law of the tomahawk
and the bow and arrow.

1268
01:46:07,967 --> 01:46:11,277
And then, with
the westward march of our nation,

1269
01:46:11,327 --> 01:46:14,125
came the pioneer
and the buffalo hunter,

1270
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,158
the adventurous and the bold,

1271
01:46:16,207 --> 01:46:19,119
and the boldest of these
were the cattlemen

1272
01:46:19,167 --> 01:46:23,365
who seized the wide-open range
for their own personal domain,

1273
01:46:23,407 --> 01:46:27,605
and their law
was the law of the hired gun.

1274
01:46:29,887 --> 01:46:34,756
But now, now,
today have come the railroads

1275
01:46:34,807 --> 01:46:36,638
and the people.

1276
01:46:36,687 --> 01:46:40,236
The steady, hard-working citizens,

1277
01:46:40,287 --> 01:46:46,920
the homesteader, the shopkeeper,
the builder of cities.

1278
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:49,561
We need roads to join those cities,

1279
01:46:49,607 --> 01:46:52,724
dams to store up
the waters of the Picketwire,

1280
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:55,645
and we need statehood
to protect the rights

1281
01:46:55,687 --> 01:46:59,282
of every man and woman,
however humble.

1282
01:47:00,607 --> 01:47:03,519
And how do we get it?
I'll tell you how.

1283
01:47:03,567 --> 01:47:06,559
We get it by placing our votes
behind one man.

1284
01:47:06,607 --> 01:47:10,486
One man!
And we have that man with us here.

1285
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:15,965
He is a man who came to us
not packing a gun,

1286
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:21,127
but carrying instead
a bag of law books.

1287
01:47:21,167 --> 01:47:26,287
Yes. He is a lawyer and a teacher.

1288
01:47:26,327 --> 01:47:28,795
The first west of the rosy buttes.

1289
01:47:28,847 --> 01:47:31,805
But more important, he is a man

1290
01:47:31,847 --> 01:47:34,919
who has come to be known
throughout this territory

1291
01:47:34,967 --> 01:47:41,122
in the last few weeks as
a great champion of law and order.

1292
01:47:41,167 --> 01:47:46,878
Ladies and gentlemen,
I nominate as your delegate and mine

1293
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:53,002
to the Congress at Washington,
the Honourable Ransom Stoddard!

1294
01:47:53,047 --> 01:47:55,720
(Band playing)

1295
01:47:55,767 --> 01:47:58,486
(Cheering and booing)

1296
01:47:59,767 --> 01:48:01,917
(Chairman banging gavel)

1297
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:11,362
- (Band stops)
- Let's have order!

1298
01:48:13,047 --> 01:48:15,163
Get going, Starbuckle.

1299
01:48:15,207 --> 01:48:17,198
(Cheering and booing)

1300
01:48:20,807 --> 01:48:23,844
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

1301
01:48:23,887 --> 01:48:25,798
Thank you.

1302
01:48:27,447 --> 01:48:29,278
Well...

1303
01:48:29,327 --> 01:48:32,524
I see this demonstration,

1304
01:48:32,567 --> 01:48:35,445
but I can't believe my eyes.

1305
01:48:35,487 --> 01:48:39,321
Is it possible
that such a representative body

1306
01:48:39,367 --> 01:48:44,441
of honest, hard-working Americans
can endorse a candidate

1307
01:48:44,487 --> 01:48:47,126
for the Congress
of our beloved country

1308
01:48:47,167 --> 01:48:51,558
whose only claim to the office
is that he killed a man?

1309
01:48:51,607 --> 01:48:53,677
Do you call Liberty Valance a man?!

1310
01:48:53,727 --> 01:48:55,718
(Crowd shouting)

1311
01:48:57,047 --> 01:48:59,561
Order! Order!

1312
01:48:59,607 --> 01:49:01,837
Hear me out!

1313
01:49:03,407 --> 01:49:07,161
Who is this Ransom Stoddard?

1314
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:09,801
And what qualifications has he

1315
01:49:09,847 --> 01:49:14,523
that entitle him to aspire
to such great office?

1316
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:22,042
We are told he's a lawyer,
an attorney-at-law,

1317
01:49:22,087 --> 01:49:24,965
an officer of the court.

1318
01:49:25,007 --> 01:49:28,761
Yes, but what kind of lawyer?

1319
01:49:28,807 --> 01:49:34,086
A man who usurps the function
of both judge and jury

1320
01:49:34,127 --> 01:49:37,358
and takes the law into his own hand.

1321
01:49:37,407 --> 01:49:40,444
(Shouting and booing)

1322
01:49:42,887 --> 01:49:44,878
(Chairman bangs gavel)

1323
01:49:44,927 --> 01:49:48,442
Quiet! Quiet!

1324
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:53,796
What other qualifications
has he, then?

1325
01:49:53,847 --> 01:49:56,805
The blood on his hands?

1326
01:49:56,847 --> 01:50:00,123
The hidden gun beneath his coat?

1327
01:50:00,167 --> 01:50:04,365
The bullet-riddled body
of an honest citizen?

1328
01:50:04,407 --> 01:50:06,443
- Honest citizen?!
- Liberty Valance?

1329
01:50:06,487 --> 01:50:09,797
You call Liberty Valance
an honest citizen?

1330
01:50:09,847 --> 01:50:13,681
Is this your fearless champion
of law and order?

1331
01:50:13,727 --> 01:50:15,206
Mr Chairman!

1332
01:50:15,247 --> 01:50:18,842
I tell you,
the mark of Cain is on this man,

1333
01:50:18,887 --> 01:50:22,163
and the mark of Cain
will be on all of us

1334
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:25,756
if we send him
with bloodstained hands

1335
01:50:25,807 --> 01:50:28,799
to walk
the hallowed halls of government

1336
01:50:28,847 --> 01:50:31,645
- where Washington...
- Mr Chairman!

1337
01:50:31,687 --> 01:50:33,086
Silence!

1338
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,197
- Mr Chairman!
- Order! Order!

1339
01:50:35,247 --> 01:50:38,364
...yes, and Lincoln still live...

1340
01:50:38,407 --> 01:50:43,162
- immortals in the memory of man.
- Mr Chairman!

1341
01:50:43,207 --> 01:50:45,562
(All shouting)

1342
01:50:52,047 --> 01:50:53,036
Rance! Rance!

1343
01:50:54,607 --> 01:50:57,121
(Chairman) Order! Order!

1344
01:51:01,367 --> 01:51:03,278
Pilgrim.

1345
01:51:06,887 --> 01:51:08,878
Where are you going?

1346
01:51:08,927 --> 01:51:11,316
I'm going home, Tom.

1347
01:51:11,367 --> 01:51:14,165
I'm going back east where I belong.

1348
01:51:23,687 --> 01:51:27,760
Valance couldn't make you run away.
What is it now, pilgrim?

1349
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:30,002
Your conscience?

1350
01:51:30,047 --> 01:51:33,403
Isn't it enough
to kill a man with...

1351
01:51:33,447 --> 01:51:35,836
without trying
to build a life on it?

1352
01:51:35,887 --> 01:51:39,926
You talk too much. Think too much.

1353
01:51:39,967 --> 01:51:44,518
Besides,
you didn't kill Liberty Valance.

1354
01:51:47,647 --> 01:51:49,285
What?

1355
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:51,522
Think back, pilgrim.

1356
01:51:55,127 --> 01:51:57,925
Valance came out of the saloon.

1357
01:51:57,967 --> 01:52:02,165
You were walking toward him
when he fired his first shot.

1358
01:52:02,207 --> 01:52:04,004
Remember?

1359
01:52:16,007 --> 01:52:16,996
(Gunshot)

1360
01:52:17,047 --> 01:52:19,038
(Valance laughs)

1361
01:52:26,527 --> 01:52:27,516
Pompey.

1362
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:34,847
(Valance) All right, dude...

1363
01:52:34,887 --> 01:52:39,119
this time, right between the eyes.

1364
01:53:02,727 --> 01:53:04,399
But...

1365
01:53:04,447 --> 01:53:06,802
But, Tom, why did you do it? Why...

1366
01:53:06,847 --> 01:53:10,362
Cold-blooded murder,
but I can live with it.

1367
01:53:10,407 --> 01:53:13,797
Hallie's happy.
She wanted you alive.

1368
01:53:13,847 --> 01:53:17,237
- But you saved my life!
- I wish I hadn't.

1369
01:53:19,287 --> 01:53:21,562
Hallie's your girl now.

1370
01:53:23,487 --> 01:53:26,638
Go on back in there
and take that nomination.

1371
01:53:26,687 --> 01:53:29,042
You taught her
how to read and write.

1372
01:53:29,087 --> 01:53:32,204
Now give her something
to read and write about!

1373
01:53:44,527 --> 01:53:46,882
(Cheering)

1374
01:53:46,927 --> 01:53:50,124
(Band plays Hail! Hail!
The Gang's All Here)

1375
01:54:07,327 --> 01:54:09,716
Well, you know the rest of it.

1376
01:54:11,287 --> 01:54:14,484
I went to Washington,
and we won statehood.

1377
01:54:15,567 --> 01:54:17,683
I became the first governor.

1378
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:22,881
Three terms as governor,
two terms in the Senate,

1379
01:54:22,927 --> 01:54:25,725
Ambassador to the Court
of St James,

1380
01:54:27,607 --> 01:54:30,075
back again to the Senate,

1381
01:54:30,127 --> 01:54:33,961
and a man who,
with a snap of his fingers,

1382
01:54:34,007 --> 01:54:37,761
could be the next vice-president
of the United States.

1383
01:54:42,367 --> 01:54:45,040
You're not going to use the story,
Mr Scott?

1384
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:46,998
No, sir.

1385
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:53,079
This is the west, sir.

1386
01:54:53,127 --> 01:54:56,642
When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend.

1387
01:54:56,687 --> 01:54:59,076
He's right, Rance.

1388
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:02,318
(Train whistle)

1389
01:55:19,727 --> 01:55:21,922
It's getting late, Hallie.

1390
01:55:26,087 --> 01:55:30,603
We'll keep in touch with you,
Pompey. I promise.

1391
01:55:30,647 --> 01:55:33,081
But, Mr Rance...

1392
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:34,958
Pork chop money.

1393
01:55:53,287 --> 01:55:55,084
Hallie...

1394
01:55:56,767 --> 01:56:00,680
Hallie, would you be too sorry...

1395
01:56:00,727 --> 01:56:04,322
if, once I get the new
irrigation bill through...

1396
01:56:05,567 --> 01:56:10,357
Would you be too sorry
if we just up and left Washington?

1397
01:56:11,887 --> 01:56:18,963
I... I sort of have a hankering
to come back here to live.

1398
01:56:20,047 --> 01:56:23,483
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...

1399
01:56:25,127 --> 01:56:28,244
If you knew how often
I'd dreamed of it.

1400
01:56:29,127 --> 01:56:31,277
My roots are here.

1401
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:34,757
I guess my heart is here.

1402
01:56:36,047 --> 01:56:38,277
Yes, let's come back.

1403
01:56:40,447 --> 01:56:44,486
Look at it.
It was once a wilderness.

1404
01:56:44,527 --> 01:56:46,802
Now it's a garden.

1405
01:56:46,847 --> 01:56:48,838
Aren't you proud?

1406
01:56:52,047 --> 01:56:57,121
Hallie, who put the cactus roses
on Tom's coffin?

1407
01:56:58,687 --> 01:57:00,678
I did.

1408
01:57:06,847 --> 01:57:10,635
Here, I got a brand-new spittoon...
uh, cuspidor, Hallie.

1409
01:57:10,687 --> 01:57:14,600
And the engineer's got a full
head of steam in this bucket.

1410
01:57:14,647 --> 01:57:18,322
We'll make 25 miles an hour
or bust a boiler trying.

1411
01:57:18,367 --> 01:57:22,201
And... heh heh!
We wired ahead to Junction City.

1412
01:57:22,247 --> 01:57:23,999
They'll hold the Express.

1413
01:57:24,047 --> 01:57:27,596
In two days and nights,
you'll be back in Washington.

1414
01:57:27,647 --> 01:57:32,163
Thank you, Jason. I'll write
to the officials of this railroad

1415
01:57:32,207 --> 01:57:36,758
and thank them for their kindness
and for going to all this trouble.

1416
01:57:36,807 --> 01:57:38,638
You think nothing of it.

1417
01:57:38,687 --> 01:57:42,123
Nothing's too good for
the man who shot Liberty Valance.

1418
01:57:54,887 --> 01:57:57,242
(Train whistle)
