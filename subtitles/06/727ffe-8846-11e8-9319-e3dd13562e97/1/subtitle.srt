1
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,793
10 minutes, just 10 minutes to go

2
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,495
we'll make it, no sweat

3
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,981
Eight, seven...

4
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,246
Six, five...

5
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,186
Four...

6
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,450
Three...

7
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,524
Two...

8
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,490
One!

9
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,925
Happy New Year!

10
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,373
The first fatal accident this year

11
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,537
happened at 12 midnight in London...

12
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,509
two blocks from Trafalgar Square

13
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,678
where the 1997 countdown took place...

14
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,177
Mum, it's Dad!

15
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,653
Rubbish, it's not your Dad

16
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,557
Look, it's really Dad!

17
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,357
Can't you tell it's Dad?

18
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,196
Shut up! It's not him!

19
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,362
Dad's doing business in Hong Kong.
How can he be in England?

20
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,670
- But it's true, look!
- This is not him!

21
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,406
Mum, what are you talking about? Look!

22
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,937
We've got to go to London right now

23
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,509
This is not true and I am not going!

24
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,556
- Happy new year, mate
- Same to you, mate

25
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,202
So, you're saying, that the deceased
gentleman was your father...

26
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,595
but the woman who was with him
at the time of the tragedy...

27
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,666
was not your mother

28
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,440
Well, I mean... yes...

29
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:57,450
So, who was she then?

30
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,652
She's my mother

31
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,125
Sir,
this is the young lady from Hong Kong

32
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,694
And your father couldn't come either,
I suppose

33
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,833
Yeah

34
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:16,067
Hi, I'm his son, are you her daughter?

35
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,336
Are you two related in any way?

36
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,483
Listen, I don't know him,
and he doesn't know me

37
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,184
Only my mother knew his father

38
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,512
and that's about it

39
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,245
You understand now? That's all

40
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,224
They didn't just know each other,
sweetheart

41
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,684
We checked with
the Royal Hong Kong Police...

42
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,059
and were informed

43
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,563
that they had a joint bank account
in Hong Kong...

44
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,268
and they had a house there
under both their name

45
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,800
Their personal belongings

46
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,592
You may take
your respective parent's bodies

47
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,626
home after the autopsy...

48
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,522
Or you can have the bodies cremated here
in London

49
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,592
But it'll be a lot less complicated and

50
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,473
everybody will be
a lot less miserable...

51
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,575
if you have the bodies cremated here
in London

52
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,640
But it's up to you

53
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,557
God of hope and giver of all comfort...

54
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:47,292
We commend to your tender care those
who mourn the loss of loved ones

55
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,191
Give them the peace
that passes all understanding...

56
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,068
and make them to know that...

57
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:58,473
neither death nor life can separate them
from your love

58
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,150
We have entrusted Raphael and Vivien
to God's merciful keeping...

59
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,650
and we now commit their bodies
to be cremated

60
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,824
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

61
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:18,495
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

62
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,959
through our Lord, Jesus Christ...

63
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,298
who died, was buried,
and rose again for us

64
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,530
To Him be glory for ever and ever

65
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,742
Amen

66
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,917
I'd like to go to... 138 Pokfulam Road

67
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:55,891
What "flam"?

68
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,796
Quick! what's this?

69
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,129
I can't read your hand-writing

70
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,396
Driver, please reverse a little

71
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,735
Miss, this is not even a pick-up zone

72
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,466
And you have the nerve to ask me
to reverse?

73
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,173
Do as I say

74
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,541
The meter's leaping anyway

75
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,806
You'll buy that, Brother?

76
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,882
I want to go to Hong Kong U...

77
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,149
What 'You'?

78
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,445
Hong Kong... Hong Kong University

79
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,946
Hong Kong University, that's a big place

80
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,287
Step aside, I'll do the talking

81
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,925
The house is not far past HKU

82
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,824
Just before Queen Mary Hospital,
turn into a downhill road

83
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,487
And go right up to the end, that's it

84
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,831
You, remember to lock up

85
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,696
The house isn't yours alone

86
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,598
You look so dumb

87
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,036
Remember to go to the lawyer's office
at Prince's Building tomorrow

88
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,042
Do you know where Prince's Building is?

89
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,072
It's in Central

90
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,810
Do you know where Central is?

91
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,415
Look, I was born in Hong Kong

92
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,708
I know where Central is, OK?

93
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,912
If you're born in Hong Kong,
don't speak English, show-off

94
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,037
I hate that girl

95
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,204
I hate this city.
I hate this whole damn thing

96
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,235
What the hell am I doing here anyway?

97
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,841
That girl is just like this city...

98
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:23,945
a bunch of flashes

99
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,311
and inside nothing

100
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,823
Gotta finish everything as soon as
possible and get the hell out of here

101
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,886
Hong Kong, my ass!

102
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,312
Well, Uncle Derek?

103
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,542
Just call me Derek

104
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,014
Though I'm your Dad and Mum's friend,

105
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,756
first name will do

106
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,955
Then please go on, Derek

107
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,927
In fact
I've known about their affair all along

108
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,522
Once I was thinking one day

109
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,097
I'll be handling their divorce cases

110
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,935
Yeah, Mum says
you're most good at divorce cases

111
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,101
A connoisseur!

112
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,729
I handle all divorce cases

113
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,136
that make cover stories
of Gossip Weeklies

114
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,770
You knew my Dad very well?

115
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,239
Of course, as well as could be

116
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,438
We went to university together

117
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,310
as fellow Greenhorns,
ragged by "Seniors"

118
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,811
It's like going through
the Vietnam War together

119
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,553
How could I not know him well?

120
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:04,227
We are the champions! We are the heroes!

121
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,055
We are the Ricci boys!

122
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:13,929
We are the champions! Champions are we!

123
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:19,506
We are the heroes, always will be!

124
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,575
Ho Sai Hall girls, pretty and sexy

125
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,978
Ho Sai Hall girls want to be my wife

126
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,318
Born beauties, but all as so lonely

127
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,952
Attracting bugs, rats, cockroaches rife

128
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,177
Raphael gave all
he'd got in doing anything

129
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,280
Sometimes even the boys felt
he's going too far

130
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,413
That time the Seniors

131
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,782
wanted to stub his pride

132
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,850
They punished him to use 50 dirty words

133
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,356
in one sentence...

134
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,785
and to yell it out in public

135
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,194
Every word had to be a swear word,
that's tough

136
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,834
In HKU's history only James Wong,

137
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,936
Andrew Wong and your Dad did it

138
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,592
Vivien was punished by her Seniors too

139
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,166
She had to go to a designated store
to buy ice-cream...

140
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,896
and give to
the Chairman of Ricci Hall Association

141
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,030
She's not allowed to take a ride
but to walk back up

142
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,040
And the ice-cream must not melt

143
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,405
It was August-September weather!

144
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,052
You rag freshmen this way now,
they'd sure complain

145
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,898
It's no big deal

146
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,062
No big deal? It's very big deal

147
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,499
Human Rights Law,
Equal Opportunities Commission

148
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,695
Environmental Protection Department...

149
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,328
They'd definitely sue your pants off!

150
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,939
On second thought,
if you want to sell the house...

151
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,670
you'd better wait till your parents
return and confirm by signature

152
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,746
Lest you two have any arguments again

153
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,946
But you can put it on the market now

154
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,150
Ask them to come back

155
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,251
when you've finalized the terms

156
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,184
Well, whatever

157
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,222
David, remember to take Buster with you
when you go

158
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,283
Maggie, please bring Buster in

159
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,584
Buster? Who's Buster?

160
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,721
You mean they've even got a kid...

161
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,228
No, Buster is the puppy
your Dad and her Mum kept

162
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,165
Every time they went abroad
they left him with me

163
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,497
Quiet, don't be naughty

164
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,000
Why me? Why not her?

165
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,877
Well, "see a man about a dog", right?

166
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,179
Come on, Buster, be good...

167
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,685
- Hubby, there's a lot of leakage stains.
- S'that so?

168
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,822
The leak-proof here is lousy

169
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,955
Wife, d'you think there're termites here

170
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,724
No, we've lived here so long and

171
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,328
haven't seen one termite. Relax

172
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,759
But this house is very tattered

173
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,156
Course not, it's only 5 years old

174
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,231
The paint on the wall's a bit cracked

175
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,165
just whitewash it. Relax

176
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,033
Renovating this place will cost a lot

177
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,137
Course you've got to brush up a bit
before moving in

178
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,140
Madam, this place suits your fancy?

179
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,581
This place is out of the way,
and this shack is worn-down

180
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,046
Cut the price

181
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,381
Madam, come on

182
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,249
It's a quiet surrounding
See the beautiful seaview?

183
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,516
It's hard to find in Hong Kong

184
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,023
Miss,
we're just an ordinary household...

185
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,789
buying a house to live in.
Our kids are small

186
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,295
This is a remote spot

187
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,059
Don't ask for too much

188
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,733
Quiet surrounding and nice view?

189
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,234
That's good for keeping a concubine,
means nothing to us

190
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,868
Forget it then, We're not selling!

191
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,111
OK, Miss, meet you half-way,
I'll up$0.2M

192
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,505
Not selling! Not selling! D'you hear?

193
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,476
Young man, you're a sensible one.
How about this shack?

194
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,314
You heard? This shack's not for sale now

195
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,716
Go shack-up elsewhere

196
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,384
Let's go, wife.
Our money's good for any house

197
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,859
Scumbag!

198
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,623
People nowadays are so foul mouthed,
all babblers

199
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,488
Yeah, your Mum's hardly a concubine,

200
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,759
at most a mistress

201
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,297
Why don't you dry up? So what's your Dad

202
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,870
Gigolo? Paramour? Or home-breaker?

203
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,835
And don't forget
your Dad and my Dad were friends

204
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,804
"Thou shalt not covet thy friend's wife"
know that one?

205
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,573
Don't you try to intimidate me
with big words

206
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,077
How d'you know it wasn't your Mum

207
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,742
who seduced my Dad?

208
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,444
How dare you suggest my Mum's a seducer?

209
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,590
Say it again and I'll sue you for libel!
Lunatic!

210
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,587
I don't know what you are talking about

211
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,886
Banana, stop speaking English

212
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,123
It's out of fashion

213
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,333
Now we go for mother tongue teaching.
Practice your Putonghua

214
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,328
Who cares what's fashionable
in Hong Kong?

215
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,732
You ugly Hong Kongers

216
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,535
rude and money-grabbing

217
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,902
I don't know
why my Dad would fancy your Mum

218
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,103
Got to be bad taste!

219
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,508
I don't know
what my Mum saw in your Dad either

220
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,045
loud bugger

221
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,409
Who're you calling bugger?

222
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,141
You and your Dad and your dog

223
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,080
limp and loud cur!

224
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,417
Buster! Shit!

225
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,764
Buster, no!

226
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,431
Come on... come on

227
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,799
Hey, no!

228
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,973
What a dog! Be careful!

229
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,385
Uncle, please page Room 432 for me

230
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,185
Just call me Henry

231
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,589
They've been calling me
Henry for 52 years

232
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,161
432, please come to Reception

233
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,629
432, please come to Reception

234
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,994
She seems to be out

235
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,440
Right, what's the dog doing here?

236
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,969
He belongs to 432

237
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,508
I'll leave him here

238
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,769
Please give him to her, OK?

239
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,037
No can do. Dogs're not allowed here

240
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,978
It's against the rule, you know?

241
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,911
I don't really care.
I've enough trouble as it is, you know?

242
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,756
Young man, relax,
I'll figure it out for you, OK?

243
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,919
Rules are sometimes made to be broken

244
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,057
Take the female residents in the past,
after midnight...

245
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,665
Henry, please page 432 again
Come on now

246
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,531
What's the hurry?

247
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,098
You must be courting 432

248
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,498
What's that?

249
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,112
432 is the daughter
of she who used to be 403

250
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,141
And 403 was an even more popular girl

251
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,317
613 and 809 of Ricci Hall went up
to the roof all the time...

252
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,149
to teach her play ball they said

253
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:50,024
613 is now in Legislative Council,
a fence-sitter

254
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,231
It's 20 years ago

255
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,435
Ah, time for dinner

256
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,958
Dressed like that for High Table Dinner?
How time's changed!

257
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,564
Please be seated

258
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,006
I'd like to introduce
our guest speaker this evening...

259
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,708
Doctor Bernadette Tsui

260
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,686
The dilemma of a modern educated woman

261
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,823
in an ever changing society...

262
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,459
is often reflected in the difficulty
of forming any positive orientation...

263
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,301
Comprehendeth I not a single word
of yon banana's utterance

264
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,609
It giveth me fright stupendously

265
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:52,076
Fear thee not, for she be nought
but a stupendous stupid one

266
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,710
For you

267
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:22,973
Thanks

268
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,650
What gift doth young hero present?

269
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,111
It be a thornless rose

270
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,916
Barn dance on Saturday night, OK?

271
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,182
Call me and we'll talk about it later

272
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,188
Your Ho Tung Hall phone is always busy

273
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,687
Come on, say you'll come

274
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,695
Go first, hurry

275
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,444
See you Saturday.
This flower is a pledge

276
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,979
It's only Wednesday.
How can it last till Saturday?

277
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,809
Put an aspirin in the water everyday

278
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,387
and it'll last

279
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,286
I don't believe it.
The Medic boys taught you that?

280
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,618
The English Literature boys did

281
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,495
It's a deal, OK?

282
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,899
An aspirin a day, while he is away

283
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,574
Thank you. Thank you

284
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,854
Woolly Susie! Hey, Woolly Susie!

285
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,788
What're you doing here?

286
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,024
To give you back this dog

287
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,699
Nuts, it's not mine

288
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,666
He belongs to both of us

289
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,671
Buster was kept
by both my Dad and your Mum

290
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,867
He belongs to both parties

291
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,139
Listen, man's belongings to the man

292
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,178
woman's to the woman

293
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,179
This dog is male. He goes to the man

294
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,777
How can you tell he's male?

295
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,510
I can't even tell if you're a girl?

296
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,244
What? You having male menopause?

297
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:49,190
Take him back I don't want him

298
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,086
Buster!

299
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,129
Where shall we sup?
Kwan Yick Street

300
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,290
Called your Ho Tung girl already

301
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,263
Really? Is she gorgeous? Of course

302
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,597
Look out, a dog!

303
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:07,734
Buster! Buster's knocked down!

304
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,406
You hit a pup! Get down and look

305
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,741
Clumsy fool, don't you know how to pedal

306
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,244
Buster's bleeding! What shall we do?

307
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,649
Is there a vet nearby?

308
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,813
There's one down in Water Street

309
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,919
Taxi, I'll call a taxi...

310
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,461
It's just downhill. It's faster to cycle

311
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,029
- Can I borrow your bike?
- Sure, take it

312
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,993
Taxi!

313
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,831
Go to hell!

314
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,632
It's just down the road

315
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,034
- Wait for me!
- Come on

316
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,815
Remember to return after use
to Ricci Hall C-9

317
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,811
- Okay
- Okay

318
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,818
Help! You sure you can handle this?

319
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,147
Yes, shut up

320
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,621
- I'm scared!
- Don't worry

321
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,200
It's come to, alright.
Bring it back tomorrow for follow-up

322
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,344
Sorry to have kept you so late

323
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,439
It's OK.
Tell your girl friend to make it rest

324
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,852
She's not my girl friend

325
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,145
Sorry, your sister?

326
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,683
She's not my sister either

327
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:30,051
Whatever. By 1997, everyone's a comrade

328
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,095
- Right, thank you
- You're welcome

329
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,495
Buster Baby

330
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,328
You must be obedient

331
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,405
Your masters are gone, never coming back

332
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,508
If you're disobedient,
nobody'll keep you, you know?

333
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:55,752
Now you're left on your own, you hear?

334
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,224
Buster, why did they go just like that?

335
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,360
Without even saying goodbye

336
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,134
They didn't love you,
so you've got all those hang-ups

337
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,739
Is everything they keep so weird?

338
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,139
Why do you say that?

339
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,973
Well, I feel that Buster's just like me

340
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,476
Ask him to go east, he goes west

341
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,285
Ask him to eat, he sleeps

342
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,256
Ask him to sleep, he pees

343
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,786
Rebellious and obstinate

344
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,892
Come to think of it,
he's a bit like me too

345
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,928
Cool, tough

346
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,538
Zero EQ, but full marks in IQ

347
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,940
And always challenging
the existing system

348
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,910
Enough, enough.
Don't you know you're exaggerating?

349
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,745
Is he heavy?
Let me carry him for a while

350
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,585
Careful with his leg. It hurts

351
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,089
No, I don't want to rush it

352
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,429
I'll marry you

353
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,154
He didn't enter, so it should be okay

354
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,187
But lingering about is risky enough

355
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,521
When was your last period?

356
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,364
Mine's very irregular

357
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,661
Sometimes in 2 months, sometimes 3

358
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,531
Sometimes even only once in 6 months

359
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,798
That's bad. Why did you give way?

360
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,204
No market value now

361
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,703
I didn't want to...

362
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,775
but hated to push him away

363
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,247
I only gave half way

364
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,446
Give him an inch and he takes a yard,
the rogue!

365
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,045
He's got a whole yard?

366
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,811
It's a saying!
What d'you mean a whole yard?

367
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,559
Did you or didn't you do it with him?
Was it nice?

368
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,129
Get lost, you nympho!

369
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,829
Nosy Parker! See how nosy you look

370
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,399
Nosy? I'm not nosy!

371
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,729
You are, Fatso!

372
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,065
Wake up, time to work!

373
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,733
It's so damn noisy here all day long!

374
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,305
I'm starving

375
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,143
Beautiful, really beautiful.
Let's have a snack

376
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,612
Let's go to Water Street for sweet soup

377
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:33,989
I'm starving

378
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,890
Sweet soup, OK? Herb and egg tea?

379
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:48,563
Ah! 7001, you're gorgeous!

380
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,897
Here it comes again

381
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,299
Everybody says
his girl friend is 01 of her class

382
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,559
What're you looking at? Come here

383
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,767
This place is pretty cool.
So this is a Mini Hall?

384
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,471
Yeah, it meets the Hong Kong
Housing Department specifications

385
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,802
35 square feet per head

386
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,668
That's different.
That's for resettlement areas

387
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,172
This is a resettlement hostel

388
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,747
Be satisfied

389
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,781
Chow time!

390
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,146
Let's play "Spin The Bottle"!

391
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,117
What's that?

392
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,285
"When, Where and With Whom",
your first time

393
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,852
The one pointed at
by the bottle must confess!

394
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,026
When: 18, where: 7-11,
with whom: sister 13

395
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,426
Wow, 3 seconds! Fastest gun in the west

396
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,070
"When, Where, With Whom", shoot

397
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,174
And it has to be me?

398
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,281
Just your luck.
Stop whining, talk. When?

399
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,816
OK, sweet eighteen

400
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,149
Where?

401
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,723
At my place

402
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,219
With whom?

403
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,515
Actually
it's outside the door of my place

404
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,655
It's so damn noisy! I give up!

405
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,562
With whom?

406
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,632
Michael

407
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,395
Michael who? Michael Chang?
Michael Jackson? Michael Douglas?

408
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:28,634
Go to hell!

409
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,937
Nuts, forget it! Next

410
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,040
Spin again...

411
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,014
Me? Speak, "When"!

412
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,546
I was 20, she was 18

413
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,715
Who? Where?

414
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,119
The place was her house...
outside her door

415
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,283
Outside the door again?

416
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,958
Well it was outside the door

417
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,797
With whom?

418
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,495
I'm Michael

419
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,843
Your turn at last Yes, big shot?

420
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,709
OK. Ready?

421
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,819
"When"? On my 21st birthday

422
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,351
"Where"?
A bedroom en suite facing the sea

423
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,824
How romantic! How classy!

424
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,163
"With whom"?
Even if I tell you, you don't know her

425
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,435
Wait, I heard you're only 20

426
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,276
Can't I plan

427
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,141
my next birthday gift for myself?

428
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,344
You're a virgin!
Woolly Susie, he's yours

429
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,510
You're so foxy, fox him!

430
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:56,416
Fox him! Fox him! Fox him!

431
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,854
Cut the crap!

432
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:04,228
Box him! Box him! Box him!

433
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,231
I quit, next one

434
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,535
Down with Japanese militarism!

435
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,674
Defend the Diaoyutai Isles!

436
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,084
In today's Diaoyutai Movement

437
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,589
everybody may have a halo overhead

438
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,793
But the same movement in those days

439
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,858
was not widely acceptable...

440
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,159
because it's impossible then

441
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,295
Demonstration? 10, 5 or 3 people

442
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,864
that's unlawful assembly already

443
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,735
Arrests were made every time

444
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,306
So when you went on one

445
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,466
you felt like a martyr

446
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,970
This sort of thing is unimaginable
for people nowadays

447
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,647
Don't forget the 8 years war!

448
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,183
Beware another Japanese invasion!

449
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,753
Defend the Diaoyutai Isles
with our lives!

450
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,618
Don't forget the 8 years war!

451
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,352
Beware another Japanese invasion!

452
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,463
Defend the Diaoyutai Isles
with our lives!

453
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,729
Let's go. Arrest for unlawful
assembly leads to a criminal record

454
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,731
No fear! If I join the Police Force

455
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,630
I become their superior!

456
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,760
Defend the diaoyutai Isles
with our lives!

457
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,805
Down with Japanese militarism!

458
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,906
Protest against Japanese invasion!

459
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,237
Listen, you mob

460
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,844
Your assembly is unlawful

461
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,970
You have one minute to disperse

462
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,706
Or else the Police will make arrests!

463
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:52,099
Diaoyutai, ours...

464
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,676
Ready! Charge!

465
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,511
Yes, Sir!

466
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,478
Charge!

467
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,215
Push! Push! Push!

468
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,418
Raphael, let's go. Will you listen to me

469
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,186
No!

470
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,618
God damn it!

471
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,772
Raphael!

472
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,375
Go, Vivien, never mind them.
Hurry and go!

473
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,842
Raphael! Let go of me!

474
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,174
Raphael!

475
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:32,713
Hurry and go! Never mind them!

476
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,266
- Tiger, have you seen Vivien?
- No, I haven't

477
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,066
Shut up! Let's go!

478
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,526
The demonstrating crowd
has not yet dispersed after dark

479
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,000
The Police will bring unlawful assembly

480
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,706
charges against these 21 demonstrators

481
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,041
This concludes our report
at Victoria Park

482
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,337
There was great confusion at the scene

483
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,642
The demonstrators retreated
from the Park

484
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,841
into the heart of Causeway Bay

485
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:19,118
Baby, don't mix up with
such impetuous people

486
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,416
The Cantonese in Hong Kong
are trouble makers

487
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,050
The Police arrested

488
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,663
21 demonstrators altogether

489
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,933
They are Gus Mok,
Ng Chung Yin, Wong Hing Wah

490
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:36,005
Raphael Hui, John Sham,
Chung Ling Ling...

491
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,768
Baby, where are you going?
Your hair's still wet

492
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:39,603
Leave me alone!

493
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,775
Bookie-learner,
your wife's here to see you

494
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,799
We are the best!

495
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,366
We are the best!

496
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,045
I was so worried you'd be arrested too

497
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:51,980
How's your head?

498
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,982
Still hurts a little, no sweat

499
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,586
I brought aspirins for you

500
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,224
An aspirin a day, while she is away

501
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,333
Wash it down with a glass of water

502
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,000
No need. I'm good in swallowing medicine

503
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,806
They've confiscated the"Yukio Mishima"

504
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,347
Says it's Japanese and gives wrong ideas

505
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,275
Leaving just this "Gorky's Collection"

506
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,950
They think he's a Chinese named Gor

507
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,658
Go now. Girls shouldn't stay here long

508
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,098
No sweat.
There're so many cops here, it's safe

509
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,133
Are you really OK here?

510
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,768
I'm OK

511
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,840
You heard them calling me bookie-learner

512
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,480
All those "ring leaders",
"big bosses" take good care of me

513
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,950
There are many drug addicts here

514
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,455
When it's urine test time,
I substitute my urine for them

515
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,421
I "pass water" for them,
they "carry water" for me

516
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,666
I provide the urine
for the whole detention center

517
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,363
They take good care of me. I'm fine

518
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,170
Ping Ching and Derek couldn't
get permission to visit you

519
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,378
Maybe they've taken their pictures
during the demo

520
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,145
Ping Ching asked you to keep cool

521
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,358
They also asked me
to bring you this sweet soup

522
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,084
I got it from Water Street

523
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,322
And this tape

524
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,364
I've applied for ages to bring it in

525
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,530
Listen

526
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,122
I'm going

527
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:22,818
Pissing for others?
I'll beat the piss out of you!

528
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,786
U boy! U boy!
Hands off, you've got nerve!

529
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:54,717
I sentence you, Raphael Hui,
to three months' imprisonment...

530
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,558
but you will be put on probation
for two years

531
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,224
Dad, let me carry it for you

532
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,369
Have you signed in this month?

533
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:08,199
Yes, I have

534
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,264
You're graduating in 2 years and
you had to get into such trouble

535
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,541
How can you find a job in future?

536
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:15,542
I've talked to my Warden

537
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,010
He'll help me lift the probation order

538
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,210
He knows people inside

539
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,512
In Hong Kong,
gweilos talk better with gweilos

540
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:22,781
So you understand that

541
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,453
This is only Hong Kong, why make trouble

542
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:30,525
Registered mail, please

543
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,023
Shut up in your hostel all day,
you don't know it's tough outside

544
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,694
One stamp short and the letter can't
get out of the Fragrant Harbor

545
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,630
Dad, I'll go first

546
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,238
You're mistaken

547
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,964
First floor, not ground floor

548
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,574
- What a lousy postman!
- Sorry, sorry

549
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,910
Dad, I'll continue my study in France

550
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,045
France? What are you doing in France?

551
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,884
Hong Kong is hopeless

552
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,855
Go to France? You think
it's as simple as sending a letter?

553
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:05,723
You have money?

554
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,857
I'll figure it out myself

555
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,161
Don't worry

556
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,381
(1971-The Fiery Age
for University Students)

557
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,885
I never thought
my Mum's been a revolutionary

558
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,588
And I never thought
my Dad's been in prison

559
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,724
And just for a far away and remote isle

560
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,358
My grandpa had fought against
the Japanese

561
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,333
So he'd had a part in World War II,
right?

562
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:24,339
My great grandpa was sort of a
revolutionary too, fighting the Manchus

563
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:30,002
Great grandma said
his name's on the 72 Martyrs' Tomb

564
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,776
So what have our generation ever done?

565
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,303
9701, you're gorgeous!

566
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,334
Here it comes again!

567
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,051
I meant to build a bridge here
in Hong Kong

568
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,864
Every big city should have
a beautiful bridge

569
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:25,931
In the U.S.A.
you've got the Golden Gate Bridge

570
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,428
In Italy, the Bridge of Sighs

571
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,169
In England, there's Cam Bow

572
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:33,739
Cam Bow, what a nice name for Cambridge.
I like it

573
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,610
Where are you going to build this bridge

574
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,775
Don't know yet.
Got to look down from a plane...

575
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,008
to see which is the best location

576
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,478
Why don't we go and
learn to fly a plane together?

577
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,453
Good. And I promise you

578
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,355
the first day I've learnt how to fly...

579
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,457
we'll fly together that very first day

580
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,618
So let's go and have lessons tomorrow

581
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,862
I'm leaving next term

582
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,830
You really have to go?

583
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,968
I've made something for you
when I was inside

584
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:06,838
Your hand?

585
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,267
See, identical

586
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,707
The lines of your palm
are so complicated

587
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,546
It's my name!

588
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,418
My lines of life, Career and Romance...

589
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,815
are all composed of your name

590
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,493
Come

591
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:35,830
Where to?

592
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,699
Don't you want it very much?

593
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,044
Don't be silly

594
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,409
Maybe next time

595
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,144
Raphael, it's me

596
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,983
What time is it at your end?

597
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,050
Can't hear? Can you hear now?

598
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,823
How are you?

599
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,791
I'm very well over here, you hear?

600
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,361
Is your job over there tough?

601
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,430
The job's fine, fine

602
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,100
Anybody making soup for you?

603
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,565
Sure, smoked oysters with octopus
and pork bones

604
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:41,898
What bones?

605
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,665
Pork bones

606
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,520
Did I wake you up?

607
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,858
I told you not to move out of Ho Tung

608
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,117
Couldn't find me?

609
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,894
Yeah, my boss is a jerk

610
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:11,793
Every time there's a call for me
he says I'm not in

611
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,463
How are you? When are you coming over?

612
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,669
Soon, I've got many jobs in hand

613
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,242
Two private tutoring,
two evening schools. Please wait for me

614
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,418
Stand in for me tonight, please

615
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,880
Thanks, I'm counting on you

616
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,696
Please

617
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,227
Paris, 3 minutes, Raphael Hui

618
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,095
Raphael, it's me

619
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,308
You haven't called for so long

620
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,705
I'm very busy these days,
no time even to eat

621
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,607
Really?
I thought you've had another girl

622
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,417
No, you hear?

623
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,917
The French girls here are ugly

624
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,953
They don't shower, just spray perfume

625
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,688
Don't be silly, OK?

626
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,701
But when are you coming back?
You've taken so long

627
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,941
Well it takes that long
to read Architecture

628
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:30,678
Why don't you come over first?

629
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,315
I can't. The way my Dad is

630
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,478
how can I go away?

631
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,646
Why don't you try to understand
my situation?

632
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,448
You keep saying I don't understand you,
d'you understand me?

633
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,719
I've told you
I won't come back without a degree

634
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,594
This I'm determined

635
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,538
I say so and it'll be so

636
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,272
Hello?... What?

637
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:07,382
Hello?... Say something, there's no time

638
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,179
You don't make a sound,
it's wasting money

639
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,049
Next time... I'll...

640
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,188
I'll call you again
when I've saved enough money

641
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:53,992
Substitute

642
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,632
Tutor them for me.
I'm going to evening school

643
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,335
Hello

644
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:40,741
When your grandpa passed away,
your Mum didn't say anything

645
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,778
She just went on studying

646
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:47,038
and took up 7 part-time jobs...

647
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,116
making $700 a month

648
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,587
$700 was quite something in those days

649
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,757
I know, she very much wanted
to go to France at that time

650
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,594
But she never mentioned it, not a word

651
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,643
Pity my Mum didn't go to Paris

652
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,809
Or else
she'd have reunited with your Dad

653
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,012
Wouldn't that be nice?

654
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:27,282
But you can also say
it's a pity my Day went to Paris

655
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,855
If they hadn't parted,
wouldn't it be even better?

656
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,194
If that's the case,
then wouldn't you become my brother?

657
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,732
I guess so

658
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,530
- Who wants to be your sister?
- Who wants to be your brother?

659
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,803
If that's the case, that's tragic

660
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,369
If, if, how can there be so many if's?

661
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:55,948
Baby, that young man's not bad

662
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,086
Good guys are hard to come by

663
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,753
Granny, it won't work

664
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,456
Why not?

665
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,219
Cause he's Raphael's son

666
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,824
So? What's wrong with that?

667
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:15,131
Granny, he says
he won't have girlfriends until 30

668
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:22,173
Thats sensible
A man won't mature until 30

669
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,807
Take your Mum's case

670
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,978
If she'd met Raphael later...

671
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,946
wouldn't it be nice?

672
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,155
But these things are hard to say

673
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,053
Sometimes it's too early,
sometimes too late

674
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,820
Who knows?

675
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,499
Just like the English word
you just mentioned. What was it...

676
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:46,966
You mean, 'Timing'?

677
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,465
What 'ming'?

678
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,171
It's T-I-M-ing, Granny

679
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,272
Ah, Too-lncomprehensible-Mystify-ing

680
01:01:56,012 --> 01:02:00,176
Today we practice
pronouncing plosive sounds

681
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,648
Paste the strip on your nose and
repeat after me

682
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,347
Ping as in pingguo (apple)

683
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,681
Ping

684
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,415
Pin as in pinbo (strive)

685
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,616
Pin

686
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,457
Pin as in pinqiong (poor)

687
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:12,928
Pin

688
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:14,722
Pan as in panwan (yearn)

689
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,195
Pan

690
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:21,234
In 5 years Hong Kong will return
to China's sovereignty

691
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,203
If you don't grasp the time

692
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,306
to learn Putonghua...

693
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,601
by 1997 you'll lose out in all aspects

694
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,238
You are all top executives
of large organizations

695
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,244
I'm sure you understand this

696
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,313
and I need not say more

697
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,114
OK. Next, who'd like to try?

698
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:37,549
OK. You then

699
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,956
"The 7th month of 1997"

700
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,249
"The silly month
of nineteen ninety silly"

701
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,051
"Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region"

702
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,693
"Hong Kong Special Apprehensive Region"

703
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,456
Not"Apprehensive Region",
"Administrative Region"!

704
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:52,395
"Apprehensive Region"

705
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:55,971
Try again Yes

706
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,663
"Si Shi seized the sail and
sailed the seven seas"

707
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,139
See See See See See See See

708
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:53,654
We are the best

709
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,301
Have you been seeing the old classmates?

710
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,571
I heard that
Ho Tung Hall will soon be torn down

711
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,980
Yeah,

712
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,212
but Tiger and her gang had all emigrated

713
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,984
Two-thirds of my classmates are gone

714
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,616
Even Mum has gone to Vancouver...

715
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,388
and taken an English name called Nancy

716
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,425
Sounds like a dance hostess

717
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,196
She flies between here and there,
free as the wind

718
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,234
Well, all the emigrated Riccians
have come back

719
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,339
There's no place like Hong Kong

720
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:45,939
There are so many opportunities here

721
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,513
Is Ping Ching in Vancouver?

722
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,391
No, he's in Toronto

723
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,287
He says there's more business over there

724
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:07,164
He works as an immigration lawyer there.
He's doing fine

725
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,764
How about your wife?

726
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:17,002
She's in New York with our son

727
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,406
Both of them don't like Hong Kong

728
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,684
Having got the passport,
they didn't want to come back

729
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,385
And you? How about you?

730
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:33,828
I live at my Mum's place

731
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,155
My daughter's keeping me company
in Hong Kong

732
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,498
I want her to have
a good grounding in Chinese

733
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,770
But I've also got
an advertising company in Shanghai

734
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:47,642
So I'm always travelling between Canada,
Hong Kong and China

735
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,546
And you? Have you seen any old friends?

736
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:57,712
Sometimes

737
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,187
I see the university guys more often

738
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,423
And the revolutionary ones... less

739
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,019
Why?

740
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,922
Mao Zedong said, "Revolution is not
giving dinner parties"

741
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,830
Now I'm often giving dinner parties
for my clients

742
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:17,168
Revolution...
I guess I'm a revolutionary renegade

743
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:24,605
After all, revolution comrades
are mostly momentary hotheads

744
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,840
Friends at university, however,
are slow water that runs deep

745
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,285
Ladies and Gentlemen

746
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:39,184
Let's welcome my old friend Raphael Hui
to sing for us

747
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,162
No, Paul, you sing

748
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:42,920
No way,

749
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,157
didn't you sing this song every time
you're here?

750
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,426
Let's give a big hand
for a lovely beautiful song...

751
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,899
"Try to Remember"!

752
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,552
This is Mrs Hung. Is Ping Ching there?

753
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,120
Mrs Hung,
Mr Hung's gone to a meeting in Kingston

754
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,161
Thanks

755
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,703
Vivien, it's me

756
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,578
Are you interested in learning
to fly with me?

757
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,810
OK, Raphael. We'll just check the oil

758
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:01,883
Undo that,

759
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,886
just bring it out far enough
How much is it?

760
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,221
Five quarts? Yes, that's correct

761
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,727
So just pop it back in again

762
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,197
Take out some gas

763
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,356
watch its color, then smell it

764
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,997
If no water's got in then it's OK

765
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,942
Be especially careful with the propeller

766
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,876
It might have been hit by rocks
and has cracks

767
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,609
That will affect the safety of flying

768
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,086
OK, I get it

769
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:34,813
Clear prop!

770
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,733
Hong Kong Tower, Cessna India Golf,
with information Charlie...

771
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,392
request taxi
to light aircraft holding point

772
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,833
India Golf, you are cleared

773
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,097
to light aircraft holding point

774
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,264
QNH is 1007

775
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:54,909
Hong Kong Tower

776
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,811
Hotel November,
taxiing to the holding point

777
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,716
Raphael,
we need to stop just behind India Golf

778
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,883
Tower: Cessna India Golf
ready for departure

779
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,714
runway 13

780
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,017
India Golf, runway 13

781
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:09,920
Your are cleared for take off

782
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:54,887
What?

783
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,557
It's impossible

784
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:05,734
No drain pipes at all,
and you call it a skyscraper?

785
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,609
Raphael, what is it?

786
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:16,414
It's outrageous!

787
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,353
Every time I go up to see it,
it's not ready

788
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,220
Well,
now the whole building's erected...

789
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,322
there's no sewer pipes

790
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:25,984
toilet pipes or water pipes...

791
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,493
whole building no pipes!

792
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,696
- Ah, no-pipe building!
- Shit!

793
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,388
No wonder you're mad

794
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,825
You can't win.
They've got the upper hand

795
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,431
I'll draft a new contract for you

796
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,435
and call the municipal council

797
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:37,561
We'll sort it out, OK?

798
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:38,664
Thanks

799
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,070
Happy hour?

800
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,872
No "happy hour" for me, I'm dining in

801
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,511
- Going home?
- Yes

802
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:47,777
Going home?

803
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,781
Yes, going home

804
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,249
When did you become so well-behaved?

805
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,952
I'm going home, you have a happy time

806
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:57,289
Foget it, Mr Hui,
experience the vicissitudes of life

807
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,617
You mean"viscosity"of life?

808
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,559
I'll pack up and leave.
Really, not tonight

809
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,135
Hello?

810
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:31,307
Hello? Hello... Hello?

811
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,529
I just can't get these few notes right

812
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,401
Never mind, take your time

813
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,104
There's no time. I've promised Mum that
I'll return to the U.S...

814
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,004
after selling the house and
watching the hand-over ceremonies

815
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,645
Is there anything
you want to do before you go?

816
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:39,881
I'll keep you company

817
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:41,746
I...

818
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,351
I don't want to wait until I'm 30

819
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,058
Come over here

820
01:18:57,666 --> 01:19:00,328
Look at this one. she suits you,
the Prom Queen

821
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,863
What Queen? Queen of puddings?

822
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,238
No way, too far

823
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,068
Don't be too choosy

824
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,040
There are 8 universities
in Hong Kong now

825
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:10,974
Quality's average

826
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,140
How about this one?
She's the model wife type

827
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,211
That one's gorgeous

828
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,486
Which one?

829
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,452
That one, beside the Lily Pond

830
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,390
She's gorgeous?

831
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:25,523
Yeah

832
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:27,158
Really gorgeous?

833
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,685
Very gorgeous

834
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,924
OK, I'll go get her for you

835
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,208
The one standing by the pond!

836
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,463
Yeah, the one by the pond

837
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:23,740
A bit more, more to that side, right

838
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:25,379
Good, that's it

839
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:29,786
OK

840
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,393
You really got the pillar box at auction

841
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,067
Yeah, the goddamn Cultural Center

842
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,332
Even stolen goods are priced so high

843
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:46,868
How much?

844
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,006
$25,000

845
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,141
That's expensive!

846
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,105
Only nostalgic dinosaurs like us

847
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,511
will buy such things

848
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,408
When my Dad was a postman

849
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,612
$25,000 was 5 years' wages for him

850
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:06,055
I think this looks
like the one outside Ho Tung Hall

851
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,924
It really looks like it...

852
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,363
the pillar box
where I sent you letters everyday

853
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,935
Vivien, look

854
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,808
All the letters I sent you!

855
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,348
20 years, all here

856
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:35,215
They'd gone round the world,
finally returning to Hong Kong

857
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:44,264
Let's put them all back in

858
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,397
1973, go back in

859
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,334
This one...

860
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:53,930
It's your birthday, remember?

861
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:54,900
Is that so?

862
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:55,835
And that one

863
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,675
This one?

864
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,945
Yeah, Valentine's Day Right

865
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:08,653
And this one,
another birthday card I sent you

866
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,624
Yes, I still remember
that winter I received this...

867
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,253
Rephael!

868
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,396
Raphael!

869
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,602
Surprise! Surprise!

870
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:19,642
It's a pity Ho Tung Hall
will soon be torn down

871
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,054
We've grown up together with her

872
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:26,189
Together we lost, together we won

873
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,420
Now, let's relive the joys and
sorrows of those days

874
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,819
Recognize yourself? So young and strong

875
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:25,812
We'd better break up

876
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,946
You've said it many times

877
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,425
This time I mean it

878
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:36,595
As you please

879
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:44,766
All the classmates are back

880
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:47,800
When I see them...

881
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,208
I feel so guilty

882
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,620
Then go home and be a good wife

883
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,794
From the very beginning
I wasn't a good wife

884
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,656
Nor a good lover

885
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:22,734
I'm going

886
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,648
From now on, you needn't call him

887
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,044
furtively behind my back

888
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,048
And you needn't find excuses yearly

889
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,189
not to spend your birthday with me

890
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:38,993
And Valentine's Day...

891
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:42,086
- Moon Festival...
- Christmas...

892
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:43,994
New Year...

893
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:52,733
I hope you won't forget...

894
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,540
each day that we were together...

895
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:03,642
was so happy,
and I loved you so very much

896
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:11,991
Then I hope you'll remember the days
when we're apart

897
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:17,424
I love you most
when you're not by my side

898
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,428
Looks awful!

899
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,939
Raphael, have you seen Vivien?

900
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:01,973
No, I haven't

901
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,411
Where have you been?

902
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,119
Just looking around

903
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,621
Why are you here?

904
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:25,289
What are you doing here?

905
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:31,003
I remember that year...
greenhorns raiding the gong

906
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,607
You Riccians grabbed our gong right here

907
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,169
Who's the one who grabbed it that year?

908
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:37,910
It's so long ago, I don't remember

909
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,109
D' you remember?

910
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:43,645
No, was it Derek?

911
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,852
Of course not!

912
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,080
It's Raphael who grabbed it from Vivien

913
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:49,553
Don't think I've forgotten

914
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:12,613
Let's go

915
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,061
What's to become of us?

916
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:31,623
Don't worry too much. It's no use anyway

917
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:37,068
When we were students,
we thought we could control everything

918
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,070
Now we know nothing's up to us

919
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:44,442
That's true

920
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,538
- But one thing I can be sure about
- What?

921
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:51,516
I'm sure we'll both get
our pilot's license next week

922
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:52,981
Let's fly together then

923
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:56,482
Next Sunday's your birthday
Let's fix on that day

924
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:59,518
Good. We'll train up

925
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,557
and fly out of Hong Kong together

926
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:04,724
Yeah, where do you want to go?

927
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:07,459
I want to fly to England

928
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:10,596
To look at the Thames from up above

929
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,902
Flying from bridge to bridge

930
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,443
all the way to Cam Bow...

931
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,248
Ladies and Gentlmen

932
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:25,784
another private pilot!

933
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,791
Drinks are on me today! Cheers!

934
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:57,709
Vivien

935
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,777
Happy birthday!
Raphael's present for you

936
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:06,445
Where is he?

937
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:09,381
He can't make it.
He's got business in Mainland

938
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,982
I know. His wife's suddenly come back

939
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,592
But today's my birthday

940
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:19,127
And the first time
I've learnt how to fly

941
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,499
And our first time to fly together

942
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:25,730
He promised me

943
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:29,972
Let's go!

944
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,813
Derek, does Raphael really love me?

945
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:38,111
Yes, of course

946
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:41,153
So does he love his wife too?

947
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:45,656
Well, it's like this... he...

948
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,121
You mean he does

949
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,464
Can't say he doesn't

950
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:54,432
Put it another way, you can't say
you don't love Ping Ching

951
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,998
How come a person can love 2 people
at the same time?

952
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,306
Even a clever one like
you can't answer that

953
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:09,207
Sis, if I can answer...

954
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,977
how come a person can love 2 people
at the same time...

955
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:12,278
I'd have got the Nobel Peace Prize

956
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,478
before Nelson Mandela

957
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,552
Good answer!

958
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,625
I've got my license today and
can take passengers

959
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:21,657
Hop in

960
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,832
Come on

961
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:40,243
Are you scared?

962
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:44,811
You're such a nice guy,
too bad I don't love you

963
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:47,349
Please stop talking...

964
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:50,313
and concentrate on flying.
I'm really very scared

965
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,621
Take care of Buster for me

966
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,288
I'm going to a meeting in England

967
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,757
After that I'll stay there and
have a break into the New Year

968
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,093
- You'll be over there into 1997?
- Yeah

969
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:01,860
You're leaving Raphael behind?

970
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,062
Tell him I'm through with him

971
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,937
Tell him not to look for me

972
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:09,809
If we go on like this I'll go crazy

973
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:18,483
I think my Mum wants to be buried
with your Dad too

974
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:20,147
This should be the best way

975
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:21,887
Yeah, I think you're right

976
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:25,855
Let's get Uncle Derek to help.
He knows many people

977
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,591
I checked already
The biggest one is sixteen inches...

978
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:32,230
and shoots up two thousand feet...

979
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:35,902
and stays there 20 seconds.
Pretty cool, huh?

980
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,070
- 20 seconds?
- Yeah, that's long, right?

981
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,973
Well, my Mum's loved your Dad
for over 20 years

982
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:46,409
I miss Dad again

983
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,749
It's just daybreak, who are you calling?

984
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:55,651
I'm calling Dad

985
01:34:58,426 --> 01:34:59,358
David...

986
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,053
Listen

987
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:07,534
Hello, this is Raphael

988
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:08,930
I can't answer your call right now

989
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,339
Please leave your number and
I'll call you back when I return

990
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,207
We've made it look so nice,
and we have to leave

991
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:26,084
It's really beautiful

992
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,953
Give me the books and records

993
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:40,257
You can take the plants and goldfish
to your hall

994
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:44,096
What a pity

995
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,332
Soon as we make them lively

996
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,305
they have to leave this home

997
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:52,141
Never mind

998
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:09,329
Buster, you'll live with granny
from now on, you know

999
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,692
You've finished composing this song?

1000
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:16,664
Yes

1001
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:21,972
This number is in memory of my days
in Hong Kong

1002
01:41:23,777 --> 01:41:24,869
I dedicate it to you

1003
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:28,208
Thank you

1004
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,074
What's the title?

1005
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:35,751
I haven't named it yet.
Let's use your name

1006
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:38,452
OK

1007
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,755
Actually, what's your Chinese name?

1008
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:43,388
Cam Bow

1009
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:45,393
Cam Bow?

1010
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,900
Why? It sounds awful?

1011
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:50,330
My Mum gave me this name

1012
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:53,364
If it sounds awful, let's use your name

1013
01:41:53,907 --> 01:41:56,034
No, I'm also called Cam Bow

1014
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:58,405
My Dad chose it for me

1015
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:10,179
When... when's your birthday?

1016
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,255
I won't tell you

1017
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:50,219
In an hour's time, Hong Kong will return
to Chinese sovereignty

1018
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:52,726
There'll be a fireworks display,

1019
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,527
the largest ever, in Victoria Harbor

1020
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:56,464
Many citizens have come
to the waterfront

1021
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:58,093
to take up vantage points since noon...

1022
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:00,432
making both sides of the harbor

1023
01:43:00,574 --> 01:43:01,506
overorowded with spectators

1024
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:23,628
Hurry, there's a crowd.
We'll be late, quick

1025
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,025
- Have you brought everything?
- Yes

1026
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:05,864
Sorry we're late, Derek

1027
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:07,906
You almost didn't make it.
This is Samcon

1028
01:44:09,109 --> 01:44:11,304
Here's your pass. Come with me, quick

1029
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:15,766
Hong Kong should have its own separate
trading and financial system...

1030
01:45:17,744 --> 01:45:20,474
The establishment of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region...

1031
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:23,778
is a celebrated event
for the Chinese Nation...
