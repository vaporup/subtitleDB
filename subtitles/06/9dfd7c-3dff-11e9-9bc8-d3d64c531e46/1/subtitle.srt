And be noticed as what?

I don't know.

Just to be noticed?

63
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,260
You'd have to be blind
not to notice you.

Peyote.

This, plus weapons, is a guaranteed

he sawed his own leg off
without feeling a damn thing.

It'll take him all morning.

Oh.

91
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:16,637
And Dimitri
is nursing a hangover.

92
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,810
Which will also take all morning.
[awkward laugh]

So.

94

I didn't mean to scare you.

100
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,144
Oh, no, it's OK, you
just surprised me, that's all.

101
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:08,652
Hey, this is a nice bedroom.

102
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,023
Yes, it is.

You know, it really is a shame

105
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:24,067
we didn't have more time to get
to know each other better.

106
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,674
Call me when you can.

107
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,809
We could do...

108
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:36,913
a thing or two...

109
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,982
together.

110
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,522
I don't know
if I'll have time with work.

111
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:49,593
Oh, work.

What is it
you don't like about me?

115
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:11,711
No, nothing.

116
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,849
I just want to know, so...

117
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,520
tell me.

118
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,088
What is it
you don't like about me?

119
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:30,567
You're... You're not
my type, that's all.

120
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,202
Oh.

121
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,972
Why am I not your type?

122
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:45,248
You're...

123
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:52,222
you're too small.

124
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:54,925
Oh.

125
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:57,758
I like taller guys,
that's all.

126
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,729
There we go! [laughter]

[sighs]

128
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,810
And I haven't changed height
since yesterday, have I?

129
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:26,987
I asked you a simple question.

130
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:30,124
Even for your tiny
little oyster brain,

131
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,095
it shouldn't be
too difficult to understand.

132
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:34,330
So, I'll ask you again.

133
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,201
Did my height

134
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:40,837
change

135
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,706
since yesterday?

136
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,345
No.

137
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:52,048
And yet,
you seemed to like me yesterday.

138
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,182
No, but I...

139
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:58,117
Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we were
dancing together last night,

140
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,788
everything was very clear.

141
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,090
You came onto me
like a pussy in heat,

142
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,960
rubbing yourself against me,

143
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,632
turning me on.

144
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,464
And now, suddenly,

145
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,369
I'm not your type?

146
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,903
Like that, boom.

147
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:20,173
During the night,
I've become too small for you.

148
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,243
[slam]

149
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,248
Yesterday,
you were dying for it.

150
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,220
And now you're apparently...

151
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:33,053
Stop.

152
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:34,821
Richard will
be back anytime soon.

153
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:37,793
[mocking] Oh, Richard.

Call the helicopter.

Call the helicopter.
I want to go home.

Hey, calm down,
