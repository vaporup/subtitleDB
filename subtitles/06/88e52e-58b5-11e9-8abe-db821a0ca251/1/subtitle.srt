00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,472
BRYCE: All I ever wanted
was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.

2
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:56,442
It all began in the summer of 1957,
before the start of second grade.

3
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,310
STEVEN: Here we are.
PATSY: Ha, ha.

00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,575
- What do you guys think?
LYNETTA: I like this place.

5
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:03,084
BRYCE: It's cool.
LYNETTA: Uh, what color is my room?

6
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,916
Just you wait.

7
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,650
BRYCE: Let's see what's inside.
STEVEN: Hey, come on, buddy Bryce.

8
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,454
Why don't, uh, you and I
go help unload the van...

9
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,224
...and the womenfolk here
can get in the kitchen and start setting up.

10
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,866
Okay, Dad.

11
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,264
BRYCE: For me, it was the beginning
of what would be...

12
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:22,806
...more than half a decade of
strategic avoidance and social discomfort.

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,772
- Hi, I'm Juli Baker.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

14
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:28,139
Don't you want some help?

15
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,440
No. There's some
valuable things in there.

16
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:33,414
- How about this one?
- No, no, no.

17
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,382
Run home. Your mother's
probably wondering where you are.

18
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,251
Oh, no, my mom knows where I am.
She said it's fine.

19
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,154
BRYCE: It didn't take long to realize
this girl could not take a hint.

20
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,818
- It's crowded in here with three people.
- I don't mind.

21
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,795
BRYCE: Of any kind.
- You wanna push this one together?

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,131
Bryce, isn't it time for you
to go help your mother?

23
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,136
Huh?

24
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,572
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,975
BRYCE:
I mean, nothing would stop her.

26
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,979
I was about to tell her to get lost
when the weirdest thing happened.

27
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,121
I couldn't believe it.

28
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,190
There I was holding hands
with this strange girl.

29
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,793
- How did I get into this mess?
PATSY: Well, hello.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,530
- I see you've met my son.
- Uh-huh.

31
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,069
BRYCE: Finally, I did the only manly
thing available when you're 7 years old.

[BELL RINGING]

33
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,342
However, my troubles were far from over.

34
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:38,148
The minute I walked
into Miss Yelson's classroom...

35
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,807
Bryce? You're here.

36
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,681
BRYCE:
...it was clear:

37
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,947
School would not be a sanctuary.

00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:49,291
Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?

00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,452
BRYCE:
I was branded for life.

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,894
Hey, Bryce,
why don't you ask her to marry you?

My first year in town was a disaster.

Look at them.

00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,402
BRYCE:
And the next three weren't much better.

47
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,674
But finally, in the sixth grade,
I took action.

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,818
I hatched the plan.

49
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,519
Sherry.

50
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,852
Sherry, wait up.

51
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,848
Hi, Bryce. Heh.

52
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,623
BRYCE:
I asked out Sherry Stalls.

53
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,658
I was wondering if you wanted to go...

54
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,263
BRYCE: To full appreciate
the brilliance of this plan...

55
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:29,366
...you have to understand
that Juli hated Sherry Stalls...

56
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,392
...though I never understood why.

57
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,835
Sherry was nice, friendly
and she had a lot of hair.

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,407
At first, my mother wouldn't let me
get my ears pierced, but I begged...

59
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,704
BRYCE: The idea was that Sherry
would eat with me...

60
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,838
...maybe we'd walk around together,
and hopefully Juli would lose interest.

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,075
But I still can't get the hoops till I'm 16.

62
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,412
Oh, that's a shame.

63
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:52,717
So Melanie wanted to get her ears pierced,
but of course her mother said no.

64
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:57,021
So she threw a fit and smashed
her Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits album...

[LAUGHS]

66
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,559
...and she got grounded, so now she can't
come to my pajama sleepover party.

BRYCE:
Things were unfolding quite nicely.

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,661
What are you doing
for your science project?

69
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,639
BRYCE: That is, until my supposed
best friend, Garrett Einbinder...

70
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,675
...took an interest in Sherry himself.

71
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:17,679
I was thinking of showing how split ends
react with different hair conditioners.

72
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,009
That's fascinating.

73
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,017
BRYCE: Loyalty gave way to desire
and Garrett, the turncoat...

74
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:23,711
...told Sherry what I was up to.

75
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,249
SHERRY:
Jerk.

76
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,220
BRYCE:
She didn't take it well.

77
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:32,188
Word got back to Juli, and pretty soon
she started up with the goo-goo eyes again.

78
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,161
Only this time it was worse.

79
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,960
She started sniffing me.

80
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,501
That's right, sniffing me.

81
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,229
What was that all about?

82
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,136
My only consolation
was that next year would be different.

83
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,402
Junior high, bigger school.

84
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:51,015
Maybe we'd be in different classes
and it would finally, finally be over.

JULl:
The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped.

86
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,487
It was those eyes,
something in those dazzling eyes.

00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,422
You wanna push this one together?

88
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,459
JULl: His family had just moved
into the neighborhood...

89
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,257
...and I'd gone over to help them.

90
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,630
I'd been in the van all of two minutes
when his dad sent him off to help his mom.

91
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:13,737
I could see he didn't wanna go.

92
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,467
So I chased after him to see if we could
play a little before he got trapped inside.

93
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:22,440
The next thing I know,
he's holding my hand...

94
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,946
...and looking right into my eyes.

95
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,982
My heart stopped.

96
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,642
Was this it?

97
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,380
Would this be my first kiss?

98
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,389
- But then his mother came out.
- Well, hello.

99
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,086
JULl: And he was so embarrassed,
his cheeks turned completely red.

100
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,731
I went to bed that night thinking
of the kiss that might have been.

101
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:47,736
I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me,
but he was just too shy to show them.

102
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:50,170
My mother said boys were like that.

103
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,108

of opportunity to get over his shyness.

00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,716
By the sixth grade,
I'd learned to control myself.

107
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,118
Then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.

108
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:09,991
Sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny,
gossipy, backstabbing flirt.

109
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,092
All hair and no substance.

110
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:13,356
And there she was...

111
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,523
...holding hands with Bryce. My Bryce.

112
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,226
The one who was walking around
with my first kiss.

113
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:22,532
My solution was to ignore her.
I knew a boy of Bryce's caliber...

114
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:26,199
...would eventually see through
a shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.

115
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:29,472
It took all of a week.
They broke up at recess.

00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,009
She didn't take it well.

00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,682
Now that Bryce was out of Sherry's
evil clutches, he started being nicer to me.

- Hi, Bryce.

JULl:
He was so shy and so cute...

120
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,053
...and his hair,
it smelled like watermelon.

121
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,028
I couldn't get enough of it.

122
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,895
I spent the whole year
secretly sniffing watermelon...

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,843
It happened at home.

My grandfather came to live with us.

because he missed Grandma.

That was not something Grandpa
would ever talk about with me.

As a matter of fact, he never talked
about much of anything with me.

in the local newspaper.

wind up in The Mayfield Times...

she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.

Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.

She always thought it was God's gift
to our little corner of the universe.

I like to think there's at least a chance
the bus won't show.

159
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:01,130
I think the tree looks particularly beautiful
in this light. Don't you?

160
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,735
If by "beautiful" you mean "unbelievably
ugly," then, yes, I would agree.

00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,486
Oh, there he is.

168
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:33,992
The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
That truck's not ugly enough in real life?

169
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,689
He's gotta make a painting of it?

170
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,927
No, he does landscapes.
Sells them at the county fair.

171
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,696
People say they're beautiful.

172
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,602
Landscapes? Let me tell you something.

173
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,709
The world would have
more beauty in it...

174
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,779
...if he'd do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard.

175
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,940
PATSY: I feel bad for his wife.
She married a dreamer.

176
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:56,485
Because of that, one of the two of them
will always be unhappy.

177
00:09:56,654 --> 00:10:00,021
Yeah, fine.
But why do we have to be unhappy?

178
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,592
BRYCE: As annoying as the yard was
to my dad...

179
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,252
...it was nothing compared to how annoying
Juli Baker was in that tree.

180
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,160
JULl:
Three blocks away.

181
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,494
BRYCE: Every morning
we had to listen to the sound...

182
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,727
...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.

183
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,201
JULl:
Two blocks.

184
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,634
WOMAN:
There you go.

185
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,603
Why do they call it The Three Stooges?

186
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,834
- I mean, there's five of them.
- What?

187
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:23,447
Well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly,
Shemp and Curly Joe.

188
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,516
- Yeah, but they only have three at a time.
- Yeah.

189
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,847
You know, I hate Curly Joe.
I mean, he shouldn't even be a Stooge.

190
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,013
MAN: Listen, girl,
I'm this close to calling the police.

191
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,989
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

192
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,391
GARRETT: What's going on?
MAN: Either you come down...

193
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,726
...or we're gonna cut you down.
JULl: You guys, come up here with me.

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,091
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

195
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,294
- Bus, bus, bus.
BRYCE: Juli was frantic.

196
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,098
They wanted to cut down her tree.

197
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,333
I couldn't understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches...

198
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,103
...meant so much to her.
JULl: Bryce, please.

199
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,409
BRYCE: I felt bad for her.
GARRETT: Leave her.

200
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,446
BRYCE:
But I wasn't about to cut school over it.

201
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,640
GARRETT:
Come on, bro.

202
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,944
CHET:
Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?

203
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:05,921
You'd have to know Juli.

204
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,455
Well, I'd like to.

205
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:08,950
Why?

206
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,822
That girl has an iron backbone.

207
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:13,827
Why don't you invite her over sometime?

208
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,627
An iron backbone?

209
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,825
She's just stubborn...

210
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,629
...and she's pushy beyond belief.

211
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,633
Is that so?

212
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,070
And she's been stalking me
since the second grade.

213
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,707
Well, a girl like that
doesn't live next door to everyone.

214
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,510
Lucky them.

215
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,606
Read this.

216
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,942
Without prejudice.

217
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,982
BRYCE: Like I needed to know
anything more about Juli Baker.

218
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,389
Juli wasn't at the bus stop
the next morning.

219
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,198
Or the morning after that.

220
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,770
She was at school,
but you'd never know it.

221
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,735
- Little Joe? He's got so much makeup on...
- He doesn't age.

222
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,068
BRYCE:
I told myself I should be glad about it.

223
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,404
I mean, isn't that what
I'd always wanted?

224
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:04,014
But still, I felt bad for her.

225
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,809
I was gonna tell her I was sorry,
but then I thought, hey, no...

226
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,878
...that's the last thing I needed:

227
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,545
Juli Baker thinking I missed her.

228
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,654
I see why you like to come out here.

229
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,561
Would you mind explaining it
to your mother?

230
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,934
JULl:
I loved to watch my father paint.

231
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:27,003
Or really, I loved to hear him talk
while he painted.

232
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,503
I learned a lot about my dad that way.

233
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,266
He told me all sorts of things...

234
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:35,640
...like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how he'd wished he'd finished college.

235
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,781
Then one day he surprised me.

236
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,283
What's going on with you
and, uh, Bryce Loski?

237
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,378
What do you mean? Nothing.

238
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,352
Oh, okay.

239
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,251
My mistake.

240
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,490
Why would you even think that?

241
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:52,721
No reason.

242
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,123
Just that you...

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,592
...talk about him all the time.

244
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,101
I do?

245
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,603
Mm-hm.

246
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,533
I don't know.

247
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,606
I guess it's something about his eyes.

248
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,082
Or maybe his smile.

249
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,585
But what about him?

250
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,581
- What?
- You have to look at the whole landscape.

251
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,785
What does that mean?

252
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,858
A painting is more
than the sum of its parts.

253
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:30,262
A cow by itself is just a cow.

254
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:35,730
A meadow by itself is just grass,
flowers.

255
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:41,005
And the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light.

256
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,012
But you put them all together...

257
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:46,579
...and it can be magic.

258
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,180
JULl: I didn't really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon...

259
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,551
...when I was up in the sycamore tree.

260
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,192
I was rescuing a kite.

261
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,262
It was a long way up,
higher than I'd ever been.

262
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,997
And the higher I got,
the more amazed I was by the view.

263
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,099
I began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled.

264
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,501
Like sunshine and wild grass.

265
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,007
I couldn't stop breathing it in...

266
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:16,112
...filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.

267
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:18,614
Hey, you found my kite.

268
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,445
Bryce, you should come up here.

269
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:23,653
It's so beautiful.

270
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,480
I can't. I sprained my, um...

271
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,122
I have a rash.

272
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,253
JULl: From that moment on,
that became my spot.

273
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,562
I could sit there for hours,
just looking out at the world.

274
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,034
Some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink.

275
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:45,005
And some days
they were a blazing orange...

276
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,974
...setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon.

277
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,842
It was during one of those sunsets
that my father's idea...

278
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,745
...of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts...

279
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:56,478
...moved from my head to my heart.

280
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,154
Some days I would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise.

281
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,190
One morning
I was making mental notes...

282
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,387
...of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds...

283
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,122
...so I could tell my dad...

284
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,699
...when I heard a noise below.

285
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,093
Excuse me.

286
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,364
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't
park there. That's a bus stop.

287
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,064
Hey, what are you doing up there?

288
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,176
You can't be up there,
we're gonna take this thing down.

289
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:23,245
- The tree?
- Yeah. Now come on down.

290
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,943
- But who told you, you could cut it down?
- The owner.

291
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,851
Why?

292
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,454
He's gonna build a house,
and this tree's in the way.

293
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:36,457
- So come on, girl, we got work to do.
- You can't cut it down. You just can't.

294
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,494
Listen, girl.
I'm this close to calling the police.

295
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,895
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

296
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,127
Now either you come down,
or we're gonna cut you down.

297
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:48,465
Go ahead. Cut me down.

298
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,301
I'm not coming down.
I'm never coming down.

299
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,075
Bryce. You guys, come up here with me.

300
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,543
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

301
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,315
Bryce, please don't let them do this.

302
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,817
Come on, you guys.

303
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,481
Bryce, please. You don't have to
come up this high. Just a little ways.

304
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,451
Bryce, please. Please.

305
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:13,862
JULl:
What happened after that was a blur.

306
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,333
It seemed like the whole town was there.

307
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:21,631
But still I wouldn't move.

308
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,740
Then my father showed up.

309
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:27,071
He talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where I was.

310
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,347
Sweetie, it's time to come down.

311
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,346
Daddy, please don't let them do this.

312
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,750
- Sweetie...
- Daddy, look.

313
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,322
You can see everything.
You can see the whole world from here.

314
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,591
No view is worth my daughter's safety.
Now, come on.

315
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,995
I can't.

316
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,190
Julianna, it's time to come down now.

317
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,693
Please, Daddy.

318
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,401
It's time.

319
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,280
JULl:
And that was it.

320
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,612
I must've cried for two weeks straight.

321
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:13,018
Oh, sure, I went to school
and did the best I could...

322
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,817
...but nothing seemed to matter.

323
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,119
TEACHER: Juli?
- Huh?

324
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,390
Do you know the answer?

325
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,858
Uh, the Peloponnesian War?

326
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,636
I'm sure that's the answer
to something...

327
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,998
...but I was looking for the area
of a rhomboid.

328
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,531
[CHILDREN LAUGH]

329
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,477
JULl: Somehow, rhomboids
and isosceles right triangles...

330
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,909
...didn't seem so important.

331
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,177
I rode my bike so I wouldn't have to pass
by the stump...

332
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,878
...that used to be the earth's
most magnificent sycamore tree.

333
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,055
But no matter what I did,

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,264
Thanks.

501
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:47,430
BRYCE: Then I'd dump the eggs
before anyone noticed.

502
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:50,732
And why? Why couldn't I just face her?

503
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,301
Why couldn't I just say:

504
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:56,037
"No, thanks. Don't want them.
Don't need them. Give them to the snake"?

505
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:59,582
Was I really afraid
of hurting her feelings...

506
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,243
...or was I just afraid of her?

507
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:07,754
Now, you wanna make sure you get it...

508
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:11,361
JULl: When Mrs. Brubeck first suggested
hatching eggs as my science project...

509
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,655
...I was less than excited.

510
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,861
That is, until I saw my first sign of life.

511
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,426
Is that it?

512
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,504
- That's the embryo. Heh.
TRINA: Wow.

513
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:26,174
- It looks like a bean.
- It does.

514
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,776
Let's try the other ones.

515
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,537
JULl:
Suddenly it felt real.

516
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,305
All the eggs were alive.

517
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:34,417
There were, like, little bean babies
inside every one.

518
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,879
On the day of the fair,
all six chicks hatched.

519
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,920
What are the odds?

520
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,786
This year's top prize goes to Juli Baker...

521
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,928
...for her wonderful project:

522
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,620
"A Chicken is Born."

523
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,164
JULl:
I won first place.

524
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:55,101
And that was cool,
but all I really cared about were my chicks.

525
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:57,769
There you go. There you go, guys.

526
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,409
JULl: My mom wasn't crazy
about us raising chickens.

527
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,044
But I begged and pleaded.

528
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,340
I told her I would take care of everything.
And I did.

529
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,276
Where's Clyde?

530
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,977
Clyde?

531
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:14,714
Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?

532
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,085
Are you okay? Aren't you hungry?

533
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,162
Come on. Come here.
What's wrong, baby?

534
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,490
Come here.

535
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:27,059
Hey, you're not Clyde. You're Clydette.

536
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,097
Mom!

537
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:34,136
JULl: As it turned out, my hens
laid more eggs than we could eat.

538
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,512
At first we tried to keep up...

539
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,874
...but after a month of boiling,
frying and deviling...

540
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,009
...like that movie The Blob,
we were being overtaken by eggs.

541
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:47,817
Then opportunity in the form
of our neighbor, Mrs. Steuby, knocked.

542
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,891
STEUBY:
Hello, dear.

543
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:55,529
If you ever have any extra,
I'd be happy to buy them from you.

544
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,027
- Really?
- Certainly.

545
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:02,138
And I happen to know that Mrs. Helms
would be interested as well.

546
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,132
- Great.
- Nothing like fresh eggs.

547
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,711
- Thanks, Mrs. Steuby.
- You bet, dear. Bye.

548
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:14,575
JULl: Between Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms,
my egg overflow problem was solved.

549
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:17,481
Then I realized that Mrs. Loski
deserved eggs too.

550
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,986
But I didn't think it would be right
to charge her.

551
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,524
She had been such a good neighbor,
lending us supplies when we ran out...

552
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:26,322
...giving my mother a ride
when our car wouldn't start...

553
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,963
...it was the least I could do.

554
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:32,733
Besides, if I happened to run into Bryce,
that wouldn't be the end of the world.

555
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,161
Hi, Bryce.

556
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,829
JULl: By the third time I brought eggs over
to the Loskis...

557
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,565
...I realized Bryce was waiting for me.

558
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:42,678
Waiting to pull open the door and say,
"Thanks, Juli. See you at school."

559
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,143
And in return,
I got a few moments alone...

560
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,146
...with the world's most dazzling eyes.

561

It was a bargain.

Until the day it wasn't.

564
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,253
It was two weeks after the sycamore tree
was cut down...

565
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,952
...and I was just starting
to feel normal again.

Oh. Right.

00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:20,374
So, um, will you start
riding the bus again?

571
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:24,280
I don't know.
I haven't been up there since...

572

It doesn't look so bad anymore.
It's all cleared away.

JULl:
Maybe Bryce was right.

577
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,735
Maybe it was time
I started riding the bus again.

578
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,275
After all, didn't he just tell me
he wanted me to?

579
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:52,108

actually misses me?

Don't you want them?

It wasn't me.
My dad didn't think it was worth the risk.

...for a whole set of new ones.

609

It was actually worse having her mad at me
than having her annoy me.

The way she ignored me
was a constant reminder...

All week I tried to approach her

stuff and they're gonna make a demo.

to make a demo.

- I don't have to. I know the type.

Is that girl working you too hard?

That girl's name is Juli.
And, no, she isn't working me too hard.

quite a soft spot for her, huh?

No, Patsy. Just wanna find out
why your father has the energy...

681
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,359
...to befriend a complete stranger...

682
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:23,506
...when he won't throw a baseball around
with his own grandson.

683
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:26,665
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.

684
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,701
Juli reminds him of Grandma.

Of Renee? Heh.

686
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:32,476
That's ridiculous.

687
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,315
You know why the Bakers
haven't fixed their yard?

688
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,479
Yeah, because he's too busy
with his paint-by-numbers kit.

689
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,225
If you had a brother with a severe handicap,
what would you do?

690
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:47,328
What the hell
does that have to do with anything?

691
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,897
Juli's father has a retarded brother.

692
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,962
So what? He's not the gardener,
is he? Heh.

- Steven.
STEVEN: Ha-ha-ha.

694
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,029
It was a joke.

695
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:00,171
You know,
other people have family troubles...

696
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,574
...and they manage
to mow their own lawns.

697
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,074
I don't know where their pride
in ownership is.

698
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:07,546
They don't own that house.

699
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,679
The landlord's supposed to maintain it.

700
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:15,018
Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he has
into caring for his brother.

701
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,888
Don't they have government facilities
for that sort of thing?

702
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,758
Maybe they thought that a private facility
would be better for him.

703
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:26,197
Either way, it's not our fault that their
family has some chromosomal abnormality.

704
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,837
It has nothing to do with chromosomes.

705
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,067
When Juli's uncle was born, he had
the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.

706
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:38,078
If he'd had enough oxygen, he would've
been a perfect little baby, just like your son.

...your mother could be standing
in Mr. Baker's shoes.

715
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,442
Did her brother have the cord
wrapped around his neck too?

716
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,770
You did.

was on the ball and got it untangled...

the other way.

he would've thrown me in a nuthouse.

No, no. Now, that's not fair.

Until now.

what it felt like to be up in that tree...

00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:09,823
...to be held above the earth,
brushed by the wind.

Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking,
but I don't know.

837
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,051
Do you think it would look better
to take them out?

838
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,723
Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs.
These will prune up nicely.

839
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,298
Listen, Mr. Duncan.

840
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,166
Call me Chet.

841
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:18,870
Chet.

842
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:21,742
If you're here
because of what Bryce said...

843
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,475
...I don't need your help.

844
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,709
Read about you in the paper.

845
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:31,150
Renee would've sat up in that tree
with you.

846
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,789
She would've sat up there all night.

847
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:36,683
Renee?

848
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:38,884
My wife.

849
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:41,253
You remind me a lot of her.

850
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,363
JULl:
We worked on the yard for weeks.

851
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,335
And the whole time we worked,
we talked.

852
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,573
- Right there?
- Perfect, yeah.

853
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:56,576
JULl: He wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree.

854
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,313
He knew exactly what it meant...

855
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,177
...about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts.

856
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,349
He said it was the same with people...

857
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,386
...but sometimes with people,
the whole could be less.

858
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,914
I thought that was pretty interesting.

859
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:12,026
I started looking at people
I'd known since elementary school...

860
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:15,721
...trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts.

861
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:21,933
Chet was right. A lot of them were less.

862
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,576
Of all my classmates, the one person
I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.

863
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:36,144
Until recently, I would've said
with absolute certainty...

864
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,119
...that he was greater, far greater,
than the sum of his parts.

865
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,813
But now I wasn't so sure.

866
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:44,824
It's looking good, Juli. Nice job.

867
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,620
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

868
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,662
I'm sorry for what I did.

869
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,939
I just don't get it, Bryce.

870
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,042
Why didn't you just tell me?

871
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,734
JULl:
Was he really sorry?

872
00:47:02,912 --> 00:47:05,881
Or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better?

873
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:09,674
Then I thought maybe I just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts.

874
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,749
But as I looked into his eyes...

875
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,049
...those dazzling eyes...

876
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:17,485
...for the first time...

877
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,629
...I was pretty sure
that Bryce Loski was less.

878
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,333
We're going to invite the Bakers
over for dinner.

879
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:35,670
- What?
- I don't know, Mom.

880
00:47:35,845 --> 00:47:37,574
I think that's a marvelous idea.

881
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:39,874
Patsy, what purpose does this serve?

882
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:42,415
Trina Baker is a very nice person.

883
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:45,918
- And Matt and Mark are really cool.
- I hate cool.

884
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:48,147
Something we should've done years ago.

885
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,815
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.

886
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,291
The statute of limitations has run out.

887
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:56,224
We're having the Bakers over for dinner.

888
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:03,264
If this is about what I said last night,
I'm sorry, okay?

889
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:06,840
But, you know, having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother.

890
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,073
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

891
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:11,941
And I expect everyone
to dress accordingly.

892
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,206
Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?

893
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:17,409
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

894
00:48:19,054 --> 00:48:20,749
Just shoot me now.

895
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,990
Careful what you wish for.

896
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:24,919
BRYCE:
So that was it.

897
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:29,724
A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker
was in my immediate future.

898
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,397
And that made seeing Juli at school
more uncomfortable.

899
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:37,031
I found myself staring at her in class.

900
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,674
And the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders...

901
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:42,276
...she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper.

902
00:48:43,979 --> 00:48:45,970
Dana Tressler caught me watching.

903
00:48:46,148 --> 00:48:49,083
If I didn't do something fast,
this could spread like wildfire.

904
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:50,946
There was a bee in her hair.

905
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:53,113
See, there it goes.

906
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,891
There's no bee.

907
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,891
It flew out the window.

908
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:03,460
BRYCE:
I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.

909
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:06,630
I had to put Juli out of my mind.

910
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:10,238
Keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork.

911
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,073
My weakness was unnerving.

912
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,603
I need your sharpener.

913
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,715
- You ever heard of knocking?
- Hey, what you got there? Dad's Playboy?

914
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:22,245
None of your business.

915
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,181
- Give my best to Miss October.
- Get out.

916
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,886
- Or should I say your best? Ha, ha.
- You're disgusting.

917
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,787
BRYCE:
Another disaster avoided.

918
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:34,293
My life had become a minefield.

919
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:34,930
GARRETT: Hey, man.
- Hey.

920
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,955
GARRETT: Hey, man.
- Hey.

921
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,458
What's this?

922
00:49:40,636 --> 00:49:41,898
Whoa.

923
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:44,438
It's not what you think.

924
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,336
Okay, it is what you think,
but I can explain.

925
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:52,143
Okay, I can't explain.
Can we just talk about it later?

926
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:53,941
Whatever you say.

927
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,743
BRYCE:
I had to talk to someone.

928
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:58,954
Why not Garrett?
Maybe he could help me get back on track.

929
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,817
Garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart.

930
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,255
Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker.
You hate her.

931
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:07,589
That's what's weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.

932
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:10,459
- You got it bad, man.
- Well, what do I do?

933
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,659
Well, you gotta nip this in the bud.
These aren't real emotions.

934
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:16,464
- They're not?
- You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

935
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,106
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

936
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:20,504
Exactly. Of course,
the place is a dump anyways.

937
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:24,203
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

938
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,042
A retard? Well, shoot,
that ought to tell you something.

939
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,817
- About what?
- About Juli.

940
00:50:30,686 --> 00:50:31,778
What are you saying?

941
00:50:32,354 --> 00:50:34,288
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

942
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:37,152
BRYCE: I couldn't believe it.
I wanted to yell at him.

943
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,124
Tell him that he didn't know Juli
like I did.

944
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,259
But all that came out was:

945
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:44,759
Heh, oh.

946
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:47,402
- Right.
- Yeah.

947
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,835
Right. Um, I'll talk to you later.

948
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,876
BRYCE: I was supposed to go
to Garrett's after school...

949
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:57,637
...but I couldn't be around him.

950
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,508
He'd crossed the line.

951
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,311
And standing right next to him
across that line was my father.

952
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:05,720
I didn't care what they thought.

953
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:08,219
I liked Juli Baker.

954
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:13,554
JULl: Sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house.

955
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:15,560
My dad lets himself sleep in.

956
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:17,858
My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.

957
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,797
If my brothers have been out late
playing with their band...

958
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,302
...you won't even know they're around
till noon.

959
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:26,407
But this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird.

960
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:29,874
I had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about Bryce...

961
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,070
...that were starting to creep back in.

962
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:43,280
You really did it, didn't you? Heh.

963
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:47,352
- Proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.

964
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:51,530
- Where you going?
- To see Daniel. It's his birthday.

965
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:54,461
I wanna come with you.

966
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:58,437
Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning,
stay with your mom.

967
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:02,466
No, Dad. I wanna come.

968
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:05,343
Sweetheart, listen.

969
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,539
Sometimes, with Daniel...

970
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,411
I'm coming, Dad.

971
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:13,787
Okay.

972
00:52:14,857 --> 00:52:17,018
We'd better leave a note for your mother.

973
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:22,529
JULl: In all the years,
I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel.

974
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:25,997
I don't know why.
It was always something my dad did alone.

975
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:30,969
We didn't say much to each other on
the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care.

976
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,867
I just liked being with my dad.

977
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:38,244
Somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could.

978
00:52:56,832 --> 00:53:00,700
The residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy.

979
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:07,708
It takes some getting used to.
They're good people, though.

980
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:10,635
Daniel?

981
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:12,471
Daniel.

982
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:16,646
Richard! You're here!

983
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,946
Richard for my birthday.

984
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:21,146
Who? Richard, who? Who?

985
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,984
Who? Who? Richard, who? Who?

986
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,888
Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna.
It's my daughter.

987
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:28,120
Your niece.

988
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:31,627
Julianna.

989
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,394
- Ha, Julianna.
- Happy birthday, Uncle Daniel.

990
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,539
Ha-ha-ha. Richard. It's my birthday.

991
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:41,067
I have your pictures, Julianna.
I have your pictures.

992
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:44,041
We have a present for you.

993
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:45,646
A puzzle? A puzzle, Richard?

994
00:53:45,814 --> 00:53:47,406
Not just a puzzle.

995
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,177
A puzzle and a...

996
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:51,810
...pinwheel.

997
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:55,252
A pinwheel! Thank you, Richard.

998
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:56,914
Yes.

999
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,424
Orange. Outside? Outside, Richard?

1000
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:04,989
You wanna go outside?
All right, we'll go to, uh, McEIliot's.

1001
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,567
- We'll walk out there for an ice cream.
- Ice cream!

1002
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:10,364
Oh, no. No, no, we can't.

1003
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,507
Daniel doesn't like ice cream.

1004
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,533
Aw.

01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:27,261
Which one?

1171
01:02:27,636 --> 01:02:30,264
You know, the one where they cut down
that big ugly tree.

1172
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:35,936
BRYCE: I wanted to say that a lot of people
liked that tree, but I didn't.

1173
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,705
I didn't want to go against my dad.

1174
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,675
Some people thought that tree
was the jewel of the neighborhood.

1175
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:45,684
Yeah, well,
there's no accounting for taste.

1176
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:51,453
So, Matt, Mark, Mark, Matt...

1177
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,160
You guys are, uh, gonna be
graduating soon, huh?

1178
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:56,229
Yeah, thank God.

1179
01:02:57,198 --> 01:02:58,460
You don't like high school?

1180
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,629
- You kidding?
STEVEN: No.

1181
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:04,437
High school was the best time of my life.

1182
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,805
- Not for us, no.
- Yeah, we've had enough of that scene.

1183
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:10,205
Ah.

1184
01:03:10,378 --> 01:03:13,211
So college is probably
out of the question, huh?

1185
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,707
No, it's a possibility.

1186
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:16,441
They've actually been accepted...

1187
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:18,916
...at several places already.
- Yes, they have.

1188
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,520
Really?

1189
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,787
Well, that's good.

1190
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,986
But, um,
we're gonna give music a shot first.

1191
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:30,796
- Really?
- Oh, they are very talented.

1192
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,990
Oh, their band is really boss.

1193
01:03:33,168 --> 01:03:35,728
They did a bunch of demos
and they're really cool.

1194
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:37,396
Thanks, Lyn.

1195
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:40,735
When Steven and I first met,
he was playing in a band.

1196
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:43,002
You played in a band?

1197
01:03:43,178 --> 01:03:46,773
He was a wonderful saxophone player.

1198
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:49,876
- Cool. You still play?
- Well, l...

1199
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:52,815
Well, if you want,
you can come jam out with us sometime.

1200
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:55,720
Uh, you...

1201
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,448
No, I mean... Heh.

1202
01:03:57,926 --> 01:03:59,416
That's not me anymore.

1203
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:02,154
PATSY: Have you boys ever performed
in front of an audience?

1204
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,354
MATT:
A lot of times.

1205
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:06,193
BRYCE: The more Matt and Mark
talked about their musical exploits...

1206
01:04:06,368 --> 01:04:07,767
...the quieter my dad got.

1207
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,431
He tried to plaster on a smile
now and then...

1208
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:14,234
...but underneath he seemed really sad.

1209
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,476
But my parents didn't like him at first.

1210
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,240
Republicans fought like crazy
against the New Deal.

1211
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:24,044
BRYCE: The rest of the evening
was painless enough.

1212
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:28,516
But through it all,
Juli didn't say a word to me.

1213
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:31,357
Never even looked at me.

1214
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:34,789
Until she was about to leave.

1215
01:04:35,764 --> 01:04:38,255
I'm sorry I was so angry
when we first came in.

1216
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,230
I think everyone had a good time.

1217
01:04:41,202 --> 01:04:43,670
Your mom was really nice to invite us.

1218
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,969
See you.

1219
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:48,803
BRYCE:
Her apology made things worse.

1220
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:52,342
- Hey, wait for me.
BRYCE: I knew I wasn't forgiven.

1221
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:56,478
It was like I wasn't even important enough
to hold a grudge against.

1222
01:04:56,651 --> 01:04:58,949
Well, I think they're a delightful family.

1223
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,588
Those boys were nothing like I expected.

1224
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:03,849
I thought they were very nice young men.

1225
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,788
- Hoodlums.
- What?

1226
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,428
How you think they can afford
all that recording gear?

1227
01:05:08,596 --> 01:05:12,498
Steven, please.
You can't just make an accusation like that.

1228
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:14,828
Don't be so naive, Patsy.

1229
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:17,938
Do you know how expensive it is
to record a demo?

1230
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:20,506
They're probably stealing hubcaps,
for chrissake.

1231
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:23,235
You are such an asshole.

1232
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:25,441
What is the matter with you?

1233
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,440
Go to hell.

1234
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,277
Don't you talk to me like that.

1235
01:05:31,453 --> 01:05:32,613
Steven, stop!

1236
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:34,550
STEVEN:
Nobody talks to me like that...

1237
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,587
...in my own house!
PATSY: Stop!

1238
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:40,919
BRYCE: I'd seen my father angry before,
but this was different.

1239
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:42,727
As I lay in bed that night...

1240
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,264
...I thought about how my dad
always looked down on the Bakers.

1241
01:05:46,434 --> 01:05:50,427
And how he'd called them trash
and made fun of Mr. Baker's paintings.

1242
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:53,165
And now I realized
he was just mad at himself.

1243
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,036
But why?

1244
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,371
Juli called me a coward.

1245
01:05:57,545 --> 01:06:00,241
Was it possible my dad
was a coward too?

1246
01:06:00,682 --> 01:06:02,240
I didn't know.

1247
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:04,275
What difference did it make?

1248
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:06,477
Juli Baker was out of my life.

1249
01:06:06,654 --> 01:06:08,485
Or, more accurately...

1250
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:10,180
...I was out of hers.

1251
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:14,019
JULl: As I was getting dressed
for the Loskis' dinner party...

1252
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:17,255
...I found myself staring at the painting
my father had given me...

1253
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,593
...and became furious all over again.

1254
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,531
Bryce had never been
a friend to me, ever.

1255
01:06:22,704 --> 01:06:24,695
He hadn't taken my side about the tree...

1256
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,397
...he'd thrown away my eggs...

1257
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:29,441
...and he made fun of me
at my uncle's expense.

1258
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,642
When my mother called
that it was time to go...

1259
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,508
TRINA:
Juli, let's go, we're late!

1260
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:37,742
JULl: I went out with every intention of
telling her that I wasn't going to the Loskis.

1261
01:06:37,919 --> 01:06:41,355
Please hold these. I need to check my hair
really quickly one more time.

1262
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:43,115
- Your hair is perfect.
- Really?

1263
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,690
JULl:
But she looked so happy...

1264
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:49,023
...and she'd gone to so much trouble
over the pies that I couldn't.

1265
01:06:49,197 --> 01:06:51,927
Ooh! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God, what a disaster.

1266
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,897
Okay. Here, hold one, and you hold this.

1267
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:56,628
- I don't wanna hold it.
- I won't have you hold it.

1268
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,862
Let's go, boys.

1269
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:00,166
JULl: But that didn't mean
I had to be nice to Bryce.

1270
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,332
And I don't wanna speak to you.

1271
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,478
Not now, not ever.

1272
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:06,737
JULl:
It felt good to take charge.

1273
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:10,373
I felt strong, in control.
I told Bryce what I thought...

1274
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:13,817
...and I was determined not to talk to him
for the rest of the evening.

1275
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,658
At dinner it struck me that we were sharing
a meal with a group of strangers.

1276
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,858
We'd lived across the street
from the Loskis for years...

1277
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,160
...but except for Chet,
I didn't know these people at all.

1278
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:29,630
Mr. Loski was clean and smooth
on the outside...

1279
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:33,706
...but it seemed like there was something
rotten buried just beneath the surface.

1280
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:40,871
By the end of the evening,
all I felt was detached, neutral.

1281
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:43,483
No fireworks, no leftover anger...

1282
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:45,949
...no flutters, nothing.

1283
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,246
See you.

1284
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,649
JULl:
I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.

1285
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:51,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1286
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,494
I was grateful that I had the family I had.

1287
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,856
And it felt good to no longer care
about Bryce Loski.

1288
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:08,705
BRYCE: The dinner with the Bakers
had taken its toll on me.

1289
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:11,737
Then the annual
school fundraiser arrived...

1290
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:15,246
...and I found myself
with a whole new set of problems.

1291
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:18,979
I was a Basketboy.

1292
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,116
To fully appreciate the humiliation
of being a Basketboy...

1293
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:26,420
...you need to know that the chosen few are
auctioned off in front of the student body...

1294
01:08:26,594 --> 01:08:28,186
...to the highest-bidding females.

1295
01:08:28,363 --> 01:08:31,264
Yes, technically, each of us
comes with a lunch in a basket...

1296
01:08:31,432 --> 01:08:34,697
...but let's not kid ourselves.
This was a beefcake parade.

1297
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:36,496
There he is, my idol.

1298
01:08:36,671 --> 01:08:38,138
One word, you're a dead man.

1299
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:40,536
No, man, I'm serious.
Listen, you won't believe this.

1300
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:41,936
What?

1301
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,305
Two of the hottest chicks
are fighting over you.

1302
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,380
- What are you talking about?
- Sherry is breaking up with Mitch.

1303
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:49,812
She and Melanie
are having a bidding war over you.

1304
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:51,315
I don't care.

1305
01:08:51,486 --> 01:08:54,649
Are you nuts?
Sherry dumped Mitch because of you.

1306
01:08:54,822 --> 01:08:56,312
You're my idol.

1307
01:08:56,491 --> 01:08:58,618
BRYCE: As comforting as it was
to be Garrett's idol...

1308
01:08:58,793 --> 01:09:02,285
...it didn't diminish the horror
of being Basketboy number nine.

1309
01:09:02,463 --> 01:09:06,763
And my only hope was that a giant tornado
would destroy the school before the event.

1310
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,796
It was a long shot.

1311
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:11,903
Welcome, everyone...

1312
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:15,975
...to this year's
Mayfield Boosters Club Auction.

1313
01:09:16,878 --> 01:09:19,574
Once again we are pleased to present...

1314
01:09:19,747 --> 01:09:23,183
...20 of Mayfield's finest young men...
- Bryce, Bryce, Bryce.

1315
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:25,581
- What are you doing here?
- Juli's in the third row.

1316
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:28,017
- So?
- So she's got a wad of cash.

1317
01:09:28,723 --> 01:09:29,747
- Bullshit.
- Bull-true.

1318
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:31,653
I saw her counting it by her locker.

1319
01:09:31,826 --> 01:09:32,850
McCLURE:
And now...

1320
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:36,360
...please give a big Mayfield School
welcome...

1321
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:40,831
...to your 1963 Basketboys.

1322
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:48,298
BRYCE:
Juli with cash? What did this mean?

1323
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,706
Was it possible
she was gonna bid on me?

1324
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:53,039
First up, we have...

1325
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:55,478
...Raymond Hughes.

1326
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,277
Raymond's on the chess team...

1327
01:09:57,452 --> 01:10:01,718
...and his hobbies include stamp collecting
and the yo-yo.

1328
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:03,379
Remember, when you bid...

1329
01:10:03,558 --> 01:10:06,618
...you'll not only be getting
the handsome Mr. Hughes...

1330
01:10:07,195 --> 01:10:09,720
...you'll also be enjoying...

1331
01:10:10,098 --> 01:10:12,692
...a lovely chicken-salad sandwich...

1332
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:17,161
...and what looks to be
a tasty bean dip, and...

1333
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:20,404

1663
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:40,594
- No, I'm kidding.
MAN: He's kidding.

1664
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:41,753
- Ha, ha!
MAN: What?

1665
01:32:41,932 --> 01:32:43,923
CARROLL:
My face drained. I'm just like:

1666
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:47,133
And I looked at Callan. I'm like, "What?"

1667
01:32:47,304 --> 01:32:49,238
It was so funny.
They got me really good.

1668
01:32:49,406 --> 01:32:52,569
- Oh, my gosh. That was scary.
- Ha, ha.

1669
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:55,006
- Good one, Rob.
CARROLL: Who put you up to that?

1670
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:57,612
But the sad thing was,
my mom and dad put him up to it.

1671
01:32:58,048 --> 01:33:00,573
Oh, gosh. That was so embarrassing.
