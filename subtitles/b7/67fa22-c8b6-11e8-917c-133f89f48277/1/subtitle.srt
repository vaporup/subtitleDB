1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,480
Don't look back.
Look... over there.

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,440
The world prays before
the rising Sun, ...

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
...for it's the source of light
for the whole world.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,040
But dad, the Sun gives us light
only during the day.

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,480
But the nights are lit up in
the city, isn't that so, Daddy?

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,880
Do people in the city pray to
the lights ofthe night?

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,080
People in the city pray for wealth;
not for the light ofthe day.

8
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,880
And those who are enamored of
wealth live a life of lies...

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,480
... and they oRen stray
towards the wrong path.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
Why so, Daddy?

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,480
Because the path oftruth
is difficult to tread upon.

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
lt is a fiey path.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
The fiey path...?
- Don't you remember the poem?

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,280
Oh yes... l remember.

15
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,320
''O' traveller on the
path through fire''

16
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,160
''Should you ever find
a tree on your way''

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:45,280
''Seek not even the shade of a leaf
For the path leads through fire''

18
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,600
''Tread tirelessly and without rest
upon the path of fire''

19
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,280
''Make unto yourselfthat promise''
- Oh no!

20
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,360
Promise that!
- All right... l promise.

21
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,000
''For traveller, you tread upon
the path through fire''

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,720
l forgot the next lines, Daddy.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,160
''Thus he wades ...

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:11,160
... through a sea of
tears, sweat and blood''

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,400
''For the traveller, treads upon
the path through fire''

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
What does that stanza mean,
Daddy?

27
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,920
Man must pass the test of fire...

28
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,280
... by blood, toil, sweat and
tears.

29
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,680
And then, no obstacle can stand
in the way ofwhat he seeks.

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,280
l won't forget this poem ever.
l promise.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,600
That's good, Son.
- Hello there, schoolmaster!

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Electricity is coming to our village.
The engineer is here already.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,520
Shiksha! Hey Shiksha!

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,000
How many times have l told you, Vijay,
not to run about! Watch your step!

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Hey Shiksha!
- What's up, Brother?

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Why! You're still sitting
beside the lamp! Just forget it!

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,040
Vey soon, we'll have the sun
brought right into our house.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
What do you mean?- Electricity
is coming to our village!

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,880
This is Mr. Mathur,
the chief engineer.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Greetings, Sir.- He's here for
the electricity project.

41
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,760
Till the project is completed,
he'll stay as a guest in our house.

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,760
Please come inside, Mr.Mathur.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,000
Electricity will bring about...

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,280
... a renaissance of a new
India in our village.

45
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh yes.
- Please come along.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
This is the school
for the children.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
lt's necessay to have
electricity in here.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,880
Hey lady! What are you doing?!
Is that a garbage dump?

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,080
That must be a hat you're wearing!
- Yes.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,160
You're well-regarded here,
school master.

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
The people not only respect me
but also love me.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
Bloody swine!

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Have you gotten drunk again?
- Yes, l am drunk!

54
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,960
Bloody swine!

55
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,080
You told my wife
not to give me money...

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,160
...Not to give me money, for a
drink!

57
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,240
ls it your money?!

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
Don't.- Aren't you ashamed, you
Iout?!

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,280
lfyou are so enraged,...

60
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,280
... you may strike me
on the other cheek too.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Will you have your wife do
menial jobs for a living?

62
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,520
Must your children berate their fate
for having been born to you?

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,280
ls that the way you discharge
your duty as a father?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,240
lnstead of caring for her,...

65
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,280
... must you snatch money
from her and beat her up?

66
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,080
l can't live without the booze.

67
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,280
You have been born of
this earth, as we all are.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,280
Can't you shoulder the
responsibility ofyour family...

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,880
...when the earth bears the
burden of all life?

70
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,280
ls the soil so weak? Will you let
yourself be drowned in liquor?

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,880
You must do something, Boss.
These developments aren't good for us.

72
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,600
We'll lose control over the
village.

73
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,480
l know! The winds of progress
are picking up force.

74
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,880
l must get a hold on my fiefs.
Else, l'll be blown away.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,080
The money l've given you,
Dinkar Rao...

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,080
... was issued by the
government of India.

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,160
lt's worth far more...

78
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,640
... than the scrap of paper
you're given me in exchange.

79
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
You've tried to sell me the lands
which belong to the villagers.

80
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,440
You see, Sir...- Enough of it.
You may keep the money.

81
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,920
l don't take back what l have
given.

82
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,840
My principle is profit.
For the sake of profit, l will...

83
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,400
... even accept a lie as the truth.
And l'll make friends of my enemies.

84
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,440
Get that?- Forgive me for
having told lies.

85
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,920
But you didn't tell
me the truth, either.

86
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,320
You didn't tell me that you
want to use this place for...

87
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,840
...smuggling and dealing in
stuff like opium and hashish.

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
You're right.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,760
This village ofyours, Mandwa,
is nowhere on the map of India.

90
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,320
This place is close to Bombay; and yet
it is beyond the reach of Indian laws.

91
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,400
This place is ideally suited
for my shady business.

92
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,440
l hear that a schoolmaster
in this village...

93
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,440
... is tying to get
electricity in here.

94
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,440
lf anything like that happens
l'll be sorely disappointed.

95
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,920
And, it'll cost you your life.
Get that?

96
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,440
The schoolmaster!

97
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,440
ls that the result of my untiring
efforts in tying to educate you?

98
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,440
l had told you about
the mother in evey woman.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
And here you are... with a
prostitute! In this hell!

100
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Get out of here before ...

101
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,440
... your character is
destroyed. Get out!

102
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,080
You've destroyed many homes.

103
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
You've destroyed many young
lives.

104
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,000
And now, you're dragging
the children into sin.

105
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,160
You should be ashamed ofyourself.
- Why must l be ashamed?

106
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Brothels are the creation of men.

107
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,760
They push helpless women
into prostitution.

108
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,160
Stop talking nonsense!
Only a fool...

109
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,160
... would step into
this world of sin.

110
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,440
lt's easy for you to preach,
because you aren't involved.

111
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,440
lfyou're man enough, ...

112
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,440
... you will help me out
ofthis world of sin.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,800
lfyou really are man enough, you'll
bring in these books ofyours...

114
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,840
... and tell me of
the good and the evil.

115
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,200
''lfyou're man enough...

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,000
... you will help me out
ofthis world of sin.''

117
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Haven't you been able
to memorise the alphabet yet!

118
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
Please don't hurt her, Daddy. It's my
fault. l didn't teach her properly.

119
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
l've been irresponsible.
Beat me ifyou will.

120
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Do you want to take a punishment
for your sister's fault?

121
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,200
You have told me that l must
stand the test of fire.

122
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,240
And that l must pick up
someone else's burden too.

123
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
Well said, Son.

124
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
You have taught me ...

125
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,160
... the vey lesson l taught you.

126
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,600
You want to take your
Iessons over here, don't you?

127
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,840
l accept the responsibilities of
teaching you, from now onwards.

128
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,080
Drop your airs! Your father spent
the last night at the brothel.

129
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
Eveyone in the village has
seen him there. Understand?

130
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,600
Did you hit him?
- Yes.

131
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,320
Why?
Apologise to him. Go on!

132
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
l won't apologise.
- Won't you?!

133
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,400
The schoolmaster must...

134
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,320
... Iose his esteem
and social standing tonight.

135
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,760
And, tomorrow morning,
he must walk in disgrace.

136
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,160
He must be a broken man by tomorrow.
And he may never raise his head again.

137
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
lt will be done.

138
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Please don't visit
the brothel anymore.

139
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,240
Those who tread upon the path of
truth do not care for wagging tongues.

140
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,320
The lamp must be lit...

141
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,280
... by fire to dispel the darkness.

142
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,600
There goes the schoolmaster.-
He isn't as innocent as he seems.

143
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,000
The villagers are casting
aspersions upon the schoolmaster.

144
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,840
They say that the schoolmaster
is up to some bad deeds.

145
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,400
l told them that the schoolmaster
would rather die than commit a sin.

146
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,680
The schoolmaster is
at home right now, isn't he?

147
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,560
He must have gone to
Chandabai's brothel.

148
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,400
Where's the schoolmaster?!
- Come on... Iet's take a look.

149
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,560
Where's the bloody preacher?
- But l'm telling you... he won't...!

150
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Look at him, now.
- What a shameless fellow!

151
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
Sleeping with a prostitute!
- What a shame!

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,680
We respected him. And this is what
he turns out to be!

153
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:13,600
Get up, you hypocrite!
- Drag that shameless fellow out!

154
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,520
Burn the master's house.

155
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,600
Father...
- Vijay...

156
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
Father...

157
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,600
This is the path through fire.

158
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,840
No...

159
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,160
Killed him!

160
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,640
You have killed him.

161
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
You have killed the
school master.

162
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,160
He cared for you as long as he
lived. And now you've killed him!

163
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,600
No one even cares for his
corpse.

164
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Swine! Cowards! Fools! Animals!

165
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There goes schoolmaster
Dinanath.

166
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:16,640
What are you staring at Vijay?
Don't even look at that village.

167
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,480
Forget that you were born over
there.

168
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,640
No! l will never forget that
village.

169
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,600
Some day, l'll give that village
to my mother.

170
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
So you've received your pay.
- Yes, Sir.

171
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,360
Now get lost. We're going to
ambush Kancha Cheena.

172
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,600
Return to your beat aRer 1 hour.
- All right

173
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,240
Then you can investigate his death.
Now get out of here.

174
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,080
Greetings, Sir.
- We'll take care ofyour family.

175
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,600
Nowjust get on with your work.
- Take that..... and that.

176
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,920
And make sure you don't foul up.
Now get going.

177
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,600
The dog! He escaped.
- The swine escaped us!

178
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,800
How did he find out?

179
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,200
From now on, this is our
home, Mummy.

180
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,800
This is where we are going to
live.

181
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,800
Get out!
Greetings, Sir.

182
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
The merchandise arrives tonight.
Take care of it.

183
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,400
Let's move.

184
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
(He was) Kancha Cheena.

185
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,960
Come...

186
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,560
Come...

187
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Come inside..

188
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,440
What happened?...Mother...

189
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't beat him.
- Move away..

190
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,360
l have taken down your complaint,
haven't l?

191
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,960
When are you going to arrest the
manager ofthe petrol pump?

192
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,680
l know vey well what
l'm supposed to do!

193
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,960
l've been in this job for 10 years.
And now, you're tying to teach me!

194
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,960
Get out of here!- Bloody cop!
And you do take bribes.

195
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,920
Did you hear that?!
That boy talks too much!

196
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,840
Wonder what he'll make
when he grows up.

197
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,400
We've found out about
the fellow who burnt...

198
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,120
... Kancha Cheena's petrol pump.
- Who is he?

199
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,440
A melve-year old boy.

200
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,120
A 12-year old!!
- A vey smart kid.

201
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,200
He set the petrol pump afire to
avenge his insult to his mother.

202
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,280
What a kid!
- Say what Usman...

203
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,200
Let's bail the kid out and
put him to work for us.

204
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,400
You'd rather think it over.
The boy is much too spirited.

205
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,960
He could wipe us out once he
grows up.

206
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,560
Wrong, Shem.

207
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,360
Help him out now and he'll
remain a faithful dog forever.

208
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,280
Go on, Terence..... take a
decision.

209
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,800
Bail the boy out and we're one up on
our opponent. Do you get that Shem?

210
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,400
Get him offthe hook.- And
he'll remain faithful forever.

211
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,400
Fathead Shem won't understand!
- All right... do what you please.

212
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,280
Do you know that it's a crime to
set petrol pumps on fire?

213
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,880
And what was it that had
been done to my mother?

214
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,640
Wasn't that a crime?

215
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,400
You could've lodged a complaint
at the police station.

216
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,720
ls that so?
Well, l did that.

217
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,440
l did report it.
But what did you do about it?

218
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,120
Nothing. You did nothing at all.
And that's why l did it.

219
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,120
l burnt it... l burnt the petrol
pump.

220
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,280
What's your name?
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

221
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,800
That's my full name.

222
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Dinanath Chavan was my father.
My mother is Suhasini Chauhan.

223
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,040
l'm from the village of Mandwa.

224
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,800
l'm 36 years, 9 months
and 2 days old...

225
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,800
... and 16 hours as of now.

226
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,400
Won't you mend you ways?
- And why should l?

227
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,280
The world is a bad
place, Mr Gaitonde.

228
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:07,800
One must be crooked to
survive in this world.

229
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Anyone who mends his ways, is
bound to die. Did you know that?

230
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,960
Keep the advice for your
underlings in your hutments.

231
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,640
Your underlings worship you.
You are the Godfather.

232
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,880
And you're the Boss.

233
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,080
But you're racing
towards your death.

234
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,400
That's because your bosses
don't like being refused.

235
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,280
You've started refusing them too.
- To come up in life, it is...

236
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,880
... necessay to refuse some things.
- This measure of self promotion...

237
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,400
... could be quite dangerous, Vijay.
You are involved in all their rackets.

238
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,560
But you've refused to get
involved with narcotics.

239
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,400
That's because you hate
narcotics just as l do.

240
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,400
And l want to help you.
- No, thank you.

241
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,560
l don't need your help.
Understand!

242
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,400
And what exactly are you
tying to tell me?

243
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,800
Are you telling me that they are
planning to kill me today?

244
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,400
But, l know the exact time when
they want to kill me.

245
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,960
Let me show you...
Take a look at this.

246
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,120
Do you see what's written in there?
''6 o'clock- an appointment with Death''

247
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,040
This evening at six, l have an
appointment with death.

248
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,720
An appointment... hear that? l
can also speak English, you know.

249
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,400
And now, l must take your leave.

250
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,560
3 more hours to go, Usman.
Think it over again, ifyou may.

251
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,400
All Vijay Chauhan wants, is the top
chair. Let's just give it to him.

252
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,040
Don't bring trouble in here.
- Bloody coward!

253
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,040
lfyou are so scared, why did you
get into this business?

254
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,200
With Vijay at the helm, we'll have
to wash our hands off narcotics.

255
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,400
And, that'd put paid our ambitions
to overtake Kancha Cheena.

256
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,960
Why cy over spilt milk?
l'd warned you.

257
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,800
And you had insisted saying that
he'd be a faithful dog forever.

258
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Now your bloody dog refuses!

259
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,200
We're going to
kill him at 6 O'clock today.

260
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,120
Hi there, Vijay...come in...
Welcome.

261
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,440
Come inside, dear.
Why are you standing outside?

262
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,400
Now you want a chair, don't you?
Here... have this chair.

263
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh yes... the chair is for you.
We're old men now.

264
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,720
We're simply waiting to die.
Come on.... take over.

265
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,400
The phones keep ringing...

266
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,400
...over here... Don't they?

267
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,600
The telephone is quite
a misleading instrument.

268
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,200
People like you use the telephone
to say things you don't intend to.

269
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,120
And you end up doing things quite
different from what you say.

270
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,800
You're misinformed.
- No.

271
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,400
Come over here.
- Who ...l?!

272
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,800
lt's you who is tying to
mislead me.

273
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,880
You're plotting to kill me. And when
confronted, you offer me the chair.

274
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,120
Kill me ifyou want to. l'll
willingly face your bullets.

275
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,000
lfyou kill me, the business is
yours and the chair is yours too.

276
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
And what if l survive?

277
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:38,280
The guns won't decide who wins
the war bemeen us... fate will.

278
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,600
Why are you shooting at the
car?

279
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,800
Shoot at me. Go on, shoot!

280
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,480
Go on... Iet's see some more
shooting.

281
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:15,880
Swine! You've stabbed me in the back.
Shoot me when l'm facing you. Go on!

282
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,400
Swine! Cur! Dog! Look at what
they've done to my stuff!

283
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,400
Smashed my coconuts! Curse you!

284
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
Don't breathe your last yet!
l'll save you! l will!

285
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,120
Now give me your hand... your
hand!

286
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,400
Wory not. l'll save you!

287
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,960
l'll take you to a doctor.
Now keep breathing...

288
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,880
Just keep on breathing.

289
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,840
Down the shutters!

290
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,960
They dare to shoot at the Don!

291
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,760
The Don needs blood!
Come along, folks.

292
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:52,680
There was a bandit. Eveyone
in the city was fed up of him.

293
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:57,360
He used to plunder for the sake of
money. Sometimes, he killed people.

294
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,280
Your son has been shot by his
rivals.

295
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,840
He's in a hospital right now.

296
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,640
We've imposed a curFew
to stop the riots in the city.

297
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,280
You can come to hospital in my
jeep.

298
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,280
Thank you for giving me
the news, Mr.Gaitonde.

299
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,280
As all evil things meet an evil
end,...

300
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,800
...so was it with the evil bandit.

301
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,920
One day, he was shot dead.

302
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,240
We have enough stock of blood in
the hospital. And you may leave now.

303
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,840
What are you raving at? Do you
take me for a blood donor?

304
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,440
What else is it?- l took the
trouble to bring him here.

305
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,760
Do you know how many coconuts
l have lost in the bargain?

306
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,200
l've lost 325 rupees in all.
Are you going to compensate me?

307
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,960
Come in, quickly.

308
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,000
These fellows are savages!
They're screaming and throwing stones.

309
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,520
l've taken a few stones too.
Bloody savages!

310
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
l'm Krishnan lyer MA (postgraduate
in arts). And now, l sell coconuts.

311
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,920
They nearly upturned my cart!
That's when l saw the Don.

312
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,800
There was lots of blood.
Blood was pouring out of his body.

313
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,200
l brought him to the hospital. l did!
And now, they throw stones at me!

314
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,040
l lost a lot of money in the bargain.
l had to throw a lot of coconuts away.

315
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,560
The total loss is
something like 325 Rupees.

316
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,720
These fellows are savages...
but... what brings you here?

317
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,280
Well,... why have you come here?
- l'm his mother.

318
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,560
His mother?!

319
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,720
What up? No night cricket nowadays...
has a politician won an election?

320
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,720
And where are our guards?

321
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:57,280
None ofthem seem to be around.
- Could it be that Vijay has survived?

322
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,840
l'd warned you not to touch him.

323
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,120
lf he survives,
all four of us are dead.

324
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,520
No! That can't be!

325
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,000
Let's kill him before he can kill
US.

326
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,440
A thousand men are keeping vigil on
the hospital. How will you kill him?

327
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,080
lnspector Pathan
will make it possible.

328
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
For my sake, he will.

329
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,960
The Don is out of danger!
Hurrah! Let us celebrate...

330
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,840
Excuse me... l'm Inspector Pathan.

331
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,880
l am assigned to protectyour
SOn.

332
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,720
Will you please ask the people
outside to disperse?

333
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,000
Vijay is safe now.

334
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,600
So the savages have now been
sent away! They even made me dance!

335
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,120
They gave me this. l don't know
whether it's real gold or artificial!

336
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,440
l'll be on my way now.
- Son...

337
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
l haven't enough
words to thank you...

338
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:53,120
... for whatever you've
done for Vijay.

339
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,720
You'll come back... won't you,
Son?

340
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,840
l'd stayed back for my 325
rupees.

341
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,440
l thought l'd leave aRer
l receive 325 rupees.

342
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,840
And you've given me so much
more.- What do you mean?

343
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,920
l've been living for
many years on the sidewalk.

344
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,120
l haven't ever been
addressed respectably.

345
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,000
l'm used to hearing abusive
Ianguage.

346
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,840
But you've addressed me as a son.
l will come. l surely will.

347
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,680
l'll come, even if it is the
Iast thing l do before l die.

348
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,440
l will come. l surely will.

349
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,920
A black cat across my path!

350
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,120
Now l have to take 10 steps
backwards (to ward offthe evil).

351
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,720
Get out of here, you fool!
Else l'll cut your head for you.

352
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,160
What did you say?
Will you cut my head off?

353
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,680
Oh yes.- D'you know what l
could do to you?

354
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,840
Just get out of here.-l'll thrash
the daylights out ofyou!

355
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,840
Hey...!
- Bloody fellows...!

356
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,600
Will you cut my head off?!

357
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,120
Now, wait and see what
l am going to do to you.

358
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,120
Hury! The patient could be dying!

359
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,120
He wants my head!

360
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,800
Hury!

361
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,840
They made fun of me out there.

362
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,120
And, l told them, l'd show them
up.

363
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,960
The Don isn't here at all.
He's inside the bathroom.

364
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,120
Vijay Chavan survived the second
attempt. And l'm in a fix right now.

365
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,120
Tell him, my life is in danger.

366
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
Vijay Chauhan is leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

367
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,120
l'm taking the first flight to
Mauritius tomorrow. Tell him that.

368
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,480
Vijay Chavan has survived
the second attempt.

369
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,120
ARer a long while, an Indian fish
has appeared in my waters.

370
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,800
lnvite him to dinner.
- But, Vijay Chavan...

371
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,920
l'd like to befriend an enemy...

372
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,120
... who gains a fresh lease of
life.

373
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,320
l could gain a fresh lease of life.
Have flowers sent to Vijay Chavan.

374
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:54,720
Don! Please forgive me!
l've committed a grave error!

375
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,320
Kancha Cheena has
sent me these flowers.

376
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,320
Nice flowers.

377
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,320
Forgive me, Don! Please forgive
Me.

378
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,320
Why is he weeping?

379
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,800
His uniform is a symbol of his
power.

380
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,320
He can stop anyone he wants to.
He can let anyone in.

381
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,920
He can allow anyone to shoot.
- l won't make such a mistake again!

382
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Tell him not to do
such a thing again.

383
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,520
Does he want to die?
He doesn't want to, does he?

384
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,800
Ask him to see reason. And he
must do my bidding from now on.

385
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,320
Now get going... take him away.

386
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,040
All right... go on now.
- Thank you, Don.

387
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,920
Congratulations on
the fresh lease of your life.

388
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,120
Now, you're the uncrowned king
ofthis city.

389
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,040
Eveyone in the city is celebrating
your recovey... except your 4 bosses.

390
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,480
l think you'd like to make your moves
aRer the enemy has exhausted theirs.

391
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,920
But l won't let you succeed in
any move.

392
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,360
l'll stop you in evey path you
go like a wall.

393
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,360
Because, l'm an honest police
officer who can't be bought &...

394
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,360
... who still lives off a meagre
salay of Rs.1500.

395
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,320
Demand for a hike!

396
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,200
You should really hike
the salaries ofyour policemen.

397
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,040
The salay isn't enough for a living.
Can it pay for the conscience?

398
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,320
What's happening here? Now, go
on eveybody... please leave.

399
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,840
Mummy...

400
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,360
Your mother still ekes a livelihood
out of 500 Rupees a month.

401
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,160
You've been lying unconscious
for the last 3 days.

402
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,520
And your mother didn't move
for a moment all this while.

403
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,280
She sat all the while,
and kept staring at you.

404
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,200
And you...
- What's your name?

405
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,200
Why do you want to know
that?

406
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,800
You're the first woman aRer my
mother who has seen me naked.

407
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,120
l was a child when l played on
her lap. And here l have been lying...

408
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,840
...unconscious for 3 days. And you've
taken care of me. That's why l ask.

409
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,000
What's your name?
- May Matthews.

410
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,840
And l am Krishnan lyer, M.A.
Nowadays, l sell coconuts.

411
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,560
l've been coming here for the last 3
days. Your men asked me not to leave.

412
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,080
Oh, l know that they call you
a ''Don''. They told me that...

413
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,840
...the Don would give me a reward.
l told them l don't want a reward.

414
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,800
And l'll leave as soon as you
reimburse my loss of 325 Rupees.

415
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,720
And will you keep
on standing over here?

416
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,960
What if l don't give you the
325?

417
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,840
No! You can't do something like that.
l picked you up and brought you here.

418
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,240
Had l been 5 minutes late,
you could've died?

419
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,520
Then l would've had to
take you to the crematorium.

420
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,440
All right.
l'll let you have your 325.

421
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,000
Now, Krishanan...
Oh yes, the MA.

422
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,720
But you must promise me something.
- What?

423
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,160
That you'll be there beside me should
anything like this happen again.

424
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,320
Nothing's going to happen by God's.
grace. If something does,...

425
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,240
...go wrong, l'll be
there a full five minutes earlier.

426
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,160
And when l get angered,
l might do just about anything!

427
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,160
Those are the bullets which were
taken out ofyou. They're useless now.

428
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,800
Wait! Give me those leads.

429
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:36,400
He'll be discharged from the hospital
tomorrow. And then, he'll kill us.

430
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,440
Nothing ofthe sort will happen.
- Get out of my way!

431
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,320
Hey! Shem ran out on us!

432
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,440
Oh, hello! Where are you going?
- To hell!

433
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,840
Get out of here.
Or will you save us still?

434
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,440
Hello, Mr. Teylene!
How do you do?

435
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,160
Greetings.
- Greetings.

436
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,440
How are you, Don Usman?
Evemhing all right?

437
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:13,800
Considering the present
circumstances, l conclude that...

438
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,640
... there's one safe place...

439
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,160
...where you will be in no danger.

440
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,040
Where is it, Mr.Pathan?
- Where?!

441
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,560
The lock up in my police station.

442
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
Hello, Don Hasmukh.

443
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,320
How are you, Don Usman?

444
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,440
l have been faithful
to my masters for long.

445
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,640
l always return whatever l take
from my masters with interest.

446
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,320
No! Don't! Please, Don! Please
don't kill me!

447
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,840
Please forgive me! l'll go back
to my village! l swear!

448
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,920
Please don't kill me!

449
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,320
Take your hand away.
Please take your hand away.

450
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,440
Step aside.

451
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Why? What's up?

452
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,040
Both ofyou seem troubled.

453
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,320
The nurse was worried that
you...

454
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,840
That l have run away!
No, doctor, l don't run away.

455
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,520
Do l look like l'm about to
run away? l don't, do l?

456
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,080
But ifyou don't discharge me
tomorrow,...

457
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,720
...l'll surely kill a few people.

458
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,240
Your bodyguards
weren't letting me in.

459
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,840
Just as you don't
Iet me go out of here.

460
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,840
Long live, Don Vijay.

461
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,240
Why are you weeping?

462
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,840
Don't weep. l took 4 bullets.
But l didn't drop a tear.

463
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,400
Do you know why? Do you
know?

464
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:19,720
Because l had all ofyou with me.
You are my power.

465
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,640
Nothing has happened to me.
Look at me.

466
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,440
l'm all right.
Nothing is wrong with me.

467
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,560
What's the matter?- My
husband's body is lying here.

468
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,640
But l can't find anyone
to take him to the cemetey.

469
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:16,320
Don't say that, Mother. l'm here.

470
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,840
We'll take him to the cemetey.

471
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,400
Make all the money you can.

472
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,240
But, don't let these
children beg on the streets.

473
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,240
We mustn't let anyone sleep
hungy.

474
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,320
Go on... make palatial houses
for yourselves. But do also give...

475
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,840
...the poor a place of shelter.
Else, l'll kill you. Understand?

476
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,840
l could've given you a lot of
money.

477
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,560
But l know, that people like you
will take only what is due to you.

478
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,480
Keep that my friend... It's your
325 rupees.

479
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,800
You've taken me for a friend... and
your mother has taken me for a son.

480
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,200
l'm grateful. Just tell me whatever
you want. l'll do whatever you want.

481
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,040
l have only one sister... Shiksha.

482
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,640
Hey southerner... why are
you going inside the college?

483
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,840
There's a dance going on inside.
Now get out of here.

484
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,920
Did l hearyou call me a
southerner?

485
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,840
Now take a good look at me.

486
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,240
And give me a salute...
and do it again.

487
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:48,840
Who are you?
- l am Krishnan lyer. M.A.

488
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,240
The Don has sent me here
to guard your body.

489
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,680
Looks like a soR one.

490
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,480
Get lost... and come back aRer
you've learnt how to dance at a disco.

491
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,240
Dancing in a disco could
give you a sprained leg.

492
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,320
Shut up!

493
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,640
Are you kids tying...

494
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,040
...to make fun of me?

495
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,440
Let me show you!

496
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,880
l'll show you the coconut disco
dance. Come on!

497
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,760
l will show you a southern
disco today.

498
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,240
l will show you a southern
disco today.

499
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,040
lf l am agitated, l will
make you all dance...

500
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,040
...to my tunes
in turns.

501
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,920
Krishnan, MA, who is a tender
coconut vendor has come.

502
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,640
l am a tender coconut vendor

503
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,400
l will show you a southern
disco today.

504
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:22,560
lf l am agitated, l will
make you all dance...

505
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,360
...to my tunes
in turns.

506
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:35,680
Krishnan, MA, who is a tender
coconut vendor has come.

507
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:16,920
Wash your hands first.
- Hands... oh yes. l'll wash.

508
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:20,520
What's wrong with washing my hands?
l'll wash my hands immediately.

509
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,320
Washing is over...
here take a look...

510
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:32,920
...my hands are clean. Spotless.

511
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,000
Washed spotlessly clean.

512
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,240
Your hands won't come
clean so easily, Vijay.

513
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:45,120
Your father's name was tarnished. It
was a lie. Will you prove it true now?

514
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,520
Look at yourself, Vijay.
Your hands are dim...

515
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:57,760
...and your soul is dim.

516
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,360
Are those the principles,
your father taught you?

517
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:07,520
ls this the reward for the principles
he stood by even in his death?

518
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:16,320
ls that what he taught you?
- Mummy... oh Mummy.

519
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:23,560
The truthful schoolmaster ...

520
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,640
...was beaten to death. What
dirt was there in his hands?

521
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,520
They tried to rape a poor
helpless mother.

522
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,720
How was she dim?

523
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,320
You don't know, do you?
... Let me tell you.

524
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:47,000
What tainted us was weakness!

525
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,840
And truth can't change that.

526
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,320
Principles can't cure
the ills ofweakness.

527
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,240
Neither can God
do anything about it.

528
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,240
The only cure for weakness is
power.

529
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:11,480
Can anyone speak ill
of my father now?

530
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:20,000
Can any scoundrel dare to ogle
at my sister or my mother?

531
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:25,000
No one will dare to; for fear of
getting hacked to pieces.

532
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:31,400
Well said...
Your father had told me...

533
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,160
...that man used to be an animal.

534
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,520
lt took the animal
centuries to become a man.

535
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,560
But you took no time at all
to turn into an animal.

536
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,520
Enough!
- Mummy!

537
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,320
Enough! Enough!

538
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,880
Dinner is over.

539
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:12,840
l've had so much to eat
in my mother's house today.

540
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:15,920
l won't even feel hungy
in another 4 or 5 months.

541
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,080
Let's move.- No! Don't! Please
don't go away!

542
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,840
Mother didn't mean what she said.
- No! She said it purposely.

543
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:40,120
She says all that purposely.
And tell her that her words...

544
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,760
... hurt me more
than the bullets.

545
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,520
But, Brother...
- Move it!

546
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,840
Congratulations, Mummy. You've
been successful once again...

547
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,880
... in throwing your son out of
the house. Congratulations.

548
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,320
You?!

549
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,720
What brings you here?

550
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,680
l was passing by.

551
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:18,880
May l have something to eat?

552
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,040
Yes. Be seated. l'll fetch
something.

553
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,800
''Wash your hands, first.''

554
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,840
''Your hands can't be
cleaned easily, Vijay!''

555
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,880
l can't eat that food.
l can't!

556
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:58,760
You could buy, beg,
rob or steal food.

557
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,680
But that alone can't sate hunger.

558
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,000
lt's love that one needs.

559
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,400
Not food alone.

560
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,000
lt was aRer months that
l went to my mother's place.

561
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,720
And l love to eat what she
cooks.

562
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:27,120
But l couldn't eat.
Do you know why l walked out?

563
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:33,800
She says what l do is wrong.
Why mustn't l do what l do? Tell me!

564
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:38,240
Why must l not retaliate to a
wrong?

565
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,120
l was a child when l saw
it happen before my eyes.

566
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:54,520
l saw my father...

567
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,800
...being killed. And he hadn't
done anything wrong.

568
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:05,240
l dragged his body all
by myselfto the crematorium.

569
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,560
l cremated mo corpses that day.

570
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:14,240
That of an innocent father
and his innocent son.

571
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:25,400
My mother's innocent son is dead
& gone. Search as she might...

572
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,920
... but she won't get
her innocent son back.

573
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:36,200
Never mind. She might not
give me what l seek from her.

574
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,120
And she might force me offthe
table. But l won't ever become...

575
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,440
... schoolmaster Dinanath. l
won't!

576
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,400
Do you know why l'm telling you all
this? You don't... Iet me tell you.

577
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,560
You cared for me
while l was..

578
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,800
...in the hospital.
l guess l got used to it.

579
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,040
l lied when l told you
that l was passing by.

580
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:08,880
ARer l leR my mother's house,
l thought l'd feel comfortable here.

581
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,720
That's why l've come here.

582
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,840
l'm tired ... vey tired.

583
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,520
Go to sleep now.
Let's talk in the morning.

584
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:56,600
There lies the village. Some day, l
must give this village back to Mummy.

585
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,760
They threw her out ofthat village.
l must give the village back to her.

586
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:27,840
lt's time now, isn't it, my son?

587
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:34,120
Yes, Uncle. The time has come.

588
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,760
The time has come.

589
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:54,200
Swines!

590
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,400
You all took the life ofthe school
master by stoning him.

591
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:12,200
lt's my turn now. l'll throw
stones at you now. You brutes!

592
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:23,880
l don't let the
right hand know the crime...

593
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:27,000
...done by the leR hand.
That's my policy.

594
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,280
A powerFul man loses his strength
in an alliance with the weak.

595
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:39,080
That's why l always seek
the friendship ofthe powerFul.

596
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:45,080
Vijay Chavan is coming here
on a mission of friendship.

597
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:47,680
Are you going to get into
an alliance with Vijay Chavan?

598
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:49,400
Not ifyou can cut him off.

599
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:54,240
Else, he'll cut your throat.
Get that?

600
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:57,000
Yes. l understand.

601
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:42,480
What calls for the celebration?

602
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,280
A mighty sword has fallen
before a mere thorn.

603
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,280
Teylene has done
what 4 people...

604
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,680
...and a hundred bullets couldn't
do.

605
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:01,160
Has Teylene killed Vijay
Chauhan?

606
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
l've always been punctual.

607
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,760
But, l'm late today.
l apologise for the delay.

608
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,600
Someone dumped filth on me.

609
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,760
l thought l'd take a wash in
the water to get rid ofthe filth.

610
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:50,760
l'm Vijay Dinanath Chavan.

611
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:52,240
And l'm...

612
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,280
Kancha Cheena,
who lives in a glass house.

613
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:03,080
l've met you. l used to
clean your car...

614
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,080
...with a piece of cloth
when l was a kid.

615
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,000
And now, you want to wear my
clothes.

616
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,600
No... not all.
l don't want to wear clothes.

617
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,280
lnstead, l want to help
someone wear clothes...

618
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,680
...that is this lady.

619
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,680
Go on inside.
Else you'll catch a cold.

620
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,480
Shall we talk business?
- Come... Iet's sit down.

621
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,440
Vey ambitious, are you?

622
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:49,080
l'm way of people...

623
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,320
...who are over-ambitious.

624
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,280
Even the most insignificant
of men have their ambitions.

625
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:08,880
And sometimes, we must slaughter
even innocents to achieve our goals.

626
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,280
Have you not trampled upon
the weak and innocent?

627
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:18,480
You have, haven't you? Yes!
- What do you want from me?

628
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,280
Mandwa.

629
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,480
What's in Mandwa for you?

630
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,080
That which l can
find in any place...

631
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,000
Any place where the laws are
Iax.

632
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:46,760
You run a business out of Mandwa.
l want to set up base there.

633
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,680
We can work together. You could
make your buck, and l could make mine.

634
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,480
Else, ...

635
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:00,760
... innocents will die as we compete
with each other. Isn't that so?

636
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,600
All right. But, be warned.

637
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,280
Don't ty to cross my path. Get
that?

638
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,280
There's only one punishment for
evey error... death.

639
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,280
Only death!
Take a look... over there.

640
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:28,760
lt's a small giR for you...

641
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,080
... to mark the beginning
of our friendship.

642
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:42,680
He was your enemy... Teylene.

643
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:07,280
What's that mark on your hand?

644
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:15,280
l had burnt a petrol pump when
l was a kid. l had also burnt my hand.

645
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:23,320
The petrol pump was mine.
l'll send you the bill.

646
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:26,000
Do send your tailor's
address along too.

647
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,440
l like the way you dress.

648
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:28,480
Swing, dance and sing...

649
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,600
Swing, dance and sing, friends

650
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:44,600
Alibaba has met
all the 40 thieves.

651
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:08,800
Let the world listen to something
said by a poet.

652
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:16,960
Eveybody who shakes hands
with you is not a friend.

653
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:30,480
Who is there in your heart and
whom are you looking at?

654
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,200
You know it and
l am also aware of it.

655
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,320
l don't want to tell anyone else.

656
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,800
Alibaba has met all the
40 thieves.

657
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:55,680
These secrets are not meant to
be shared with eveyone.

658
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,760
Eveybody who shakes hands is
not a friend.

659
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:39,120
Someone has drunk such a
thing that...

660
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,760
...the thirst is not quenched but
there is fire.

661
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:48,560
This is the effect of love.

662
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:56,800
Alibaba has met all the
40 thieves.

663
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:05,440
All the drinks are not meant for
drinking.

664
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:13,240
Eveybody who shakes hands
with you is not a friend.

665
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,960
l won't allow you to
go far away.

666
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:44,120
l won't allow you to
go far away.

667
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:49,640
l will keep you bound
with me...

668
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,320
...just with the help
ofthe strength of my hair.

669
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,520
Alibaba has met all
the 40 thieves.

670
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:10,200
All the friends do not
show love & loyalty.

671
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,400
Eveybody who shakes hands
with you is not a friend.

672
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:25,520
Swing, dance and sing...

673
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:32,680
Swing, dance and sing
with mery, friends.

674
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,600
Alibaba has met all the
40 thieves.

675
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:49,360
Out!... Get out of my way...
Step aside.

676
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,680
Anna! Vijay Chavan has gone abroad.
And his sister is here all alone.

677
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:01,560
l'll be back in sometime, Mummy.
Don't wory.

678
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,920
She needn't wory. Krishnan lyer MA
is going to accompany you.

679
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:10,160
What?! Are you coming with me?
- Yes. The guard follows your body.

680
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,560
l don't need a bodyguard.
And, you needn't come with me.

681
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,040
Sory, lady. Don has ordered
this. l can't let you go out alone.

682
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:29,160
Did you call me a ''backward fool''!
You called me a fool!

683
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,160
Do l look like a fool!
And you'rejust out ofschool!

684
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,200
And you compare yourself
with Krishnan lyer, an M.A.!

685
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:44,160
l'm an MA! A Master ofArts
degree-holder from Kerala University.

686
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:46,360
Are you tying to
ridicule the way l dress?

687
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,960
The first President of India
used to wear this dress.

688
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,120
Nobel Prize winner Dr.C.V.Raman used
to anoint his forehead traditionally.

689
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,560
And President Venkataraman
was also from the South.

690
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,640
Wearing a pant-suit doesn't make
anyone a forward-minded individual.

691
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:05,800
And l'm not ashamed to wear
a traditional dress.

692
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:08,160
Do you take me for a fool...

693
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:12,960
... because l sell
coconuts for a living?

694
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:16,800
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think l'm lying?

695
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,480
Wait! l'll show you my degree.

696
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:22,200
You wait! She calls me a fool!

697
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:38,360
Get away! Eveyone!
Else we'll shoot you down.

698
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:07,560
You're the goose...
and that's your sauce.

699
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,200
l'd gotten your brother
out ofjail. That swine!

700
01:29:13,159 --> 01:29:15,040
l'd given him food to eat.
The dog!

701
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:20,040
A dog would've been faithful.
But, he tried to bite me. The cur!

702
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:24,160
My brother isn't a dog.
He's a lion!

703
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,160
And you've made a big mistake
by tying to bait the lion.

704
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:33,360
l didn't. It was he who
has tried to challenge me.

705
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:40,760
Your brother loves you
vey much, doesn't he?

706
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:45,120
He'll surely come here to save
you.

707
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,880
But, you won't survive.
Do you know why?

708
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,760
Because l'll cut your
fair skin into little pieces.

709
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:00,680
Listen to me. l haven't come
here to enjoy myself.

710
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,120
Nor have l come here to
give you lectures on justice.

711
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:07,640
l have come to this city
in search of a livelihood.

712
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,760
l come from a village
known well for ruthlessness.

713
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,160
lf anyone comes near me,
l'll tear him apart.

714
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:23,760
This fellow is teasing a girl &
all you can do is watch and laugh!

715
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:29,560
You're an insult to us...
our culture and our tradition.

716
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,720
l've used my hands to cut coconuts.
Today, l'll cut up an eunuch! You!

717
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:36,160
Hold it!

718
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,160
You have called me an eunuch!
You dare insult me!

719
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,800
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

720
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,560
Let's see who your bodyguard is.

721
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,160
You're one of Shem's men! Tell
us... where has he taken our sister?

722
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,760
Which roads lead us to them?
Which roads?

723
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:54,760
l've administered an injection. Your
mother will regain consciousness soon.

724
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:01,880
Shem is holding her...

725
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:04,760
... somewhere within a full
square mile of slums.

726
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,200
We must fight our way through
a crowd of a 1000 or 2000 people.

727
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:12,160
That's what these
fellows have told us.

728
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,880
Police Commissioner Gaitonde
has gone over to get her out.

729
01:32:16,279 --> 01:32:18,040
But, Shem's men
aren't letting them in.

730
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:22,200
Go outside.
Get out of here!

731
01:32:57,279 --> 01:32:59,400
He has kidnapped
Vijay Chavan's sister.

732
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:05,560
Kidnapped my sister.

733
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,480
Brother...

734
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,680
Krishnan, take Shiksha away
from here.- No.

735
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,760
l won't leave you here.
- Get out of here, l said!

736
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:42,480
Look at me now and think back.

737
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:47,760
This boy is much too spirited.

738
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:57,720
lf he wipes us out once he
grows up, what'll we do then.

739
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,040
Stop... stop it now, Don.

740
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,600
The police are coming in.

741
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,160
Will anyone dare to
touch my sister again?!

742
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:12,800
Will anyone dare!
l'll hack him to pieces!

743
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,840
Pathan... What are you doing in
here?

744
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,360
l got news that the slums are on
fire. That's why l'm here.

745
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,480
The slums didn't catch fire. They
were torched. And you did it.

746
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:05,360
You did it to destroy the
evidence.

747
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:20,640
Don't you recognise me?
- Krishnan?!

748
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,160
This is the reward for a bodyguard.
Evemhing else is all right.

749
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,280
Not to wory. It's done my body
and her mind a lot of good.

750
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,160
Whose mind?
- The disco-freak's.

751
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:48,760
Do you see that? l've turned the
forward backwards.

752
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:51,160
And l've made an Indian out of
a foreigner. How does she look?

753
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,640
My hero!-What do you blabber?
My love! - l am scared.

754
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,280
My beloved- Your brother will
beat me. - l salute to you...

755
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,120
My hero, my love and my
beloved, l salute to you..

756
01:38:08,199 --> 01:38:11,400
So many names for Krishnan
Iyer MA.

757
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:14,800
Why did you save me?
- l just did my duty.

758
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,000
You would've done anything for it
- Yes.

759
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,040
Say, you will do it.
- Ok

760
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,760
You would have also died
- Yes - Oh my God!

761
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:07,520
Who knew that we are made
for each other?

762
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:15,880
Who knew and was aware that
we are made for each other?

763
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,120
l knew it-Not feminine gender
but say in masculine gender.

764
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:30,640
l knew and was aware that we
are made for each other.

765
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:27,320
My heart was like a
closed envelope.

766
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:36,240
And there was a love letter
in this envelope.

767
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:47,320
Today l opened it and read that
''We are made for each other''

768
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:10,520
But what should l do?
l am a vey poor man.

769
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:19,040
But what should l do?
l am a vey poor man.

770
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:26,920
That is the reason why
l am so close to you.

771
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:35,920
That is the reason why
l am so close to you.

772
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,920
Don't fear anyone!

773
01:42:42,119 --> 01:42:46,560
Don't fear anyone and
Iove openly.

774
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:49,840
We are made for each other.

775
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:58,000
Who knew and was aware that
''We are made for each other''

776
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:09,240
l knew and was aware that we
are made for each other.

777
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:17,880
Who knew and was aware that
''We are made for each other''

778
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:27,000
Who knew and was aware that
we are made for each other.

779
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,400
What are you up to?

780
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:58,280
What have you been doing?

781
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,160
What's going on?

782
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:10,000
Have l done anything wrong?
Have l not brought you up decently?

783
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:16,800
Have l leR anything undone
to educate you? Go on tell me.

784
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,600
Have you lacked anything as
far as education is concerned?

785
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,960
And l see you walking
shamelessly holding his hands.

786
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:25,560
No.. please tell me whatever
you want.

787
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,240
No!
- She's not at fault.

788
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,880
You are not to interFere in this.

789
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,400
This is a family matter.
And you are not to interFere!

790
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:39,600
Why?! Did you know why l sent
you to a good school?

791
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:42,720
So you could learn the difference
bemeen what's good and what's bad.

792
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:46,320
And what's right and what's wrong!
- Do you know the difference, Vijay?

793
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,800
You don't know what Shiksha
is doing!

794
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:52,040
l fully concede to Shiksha's
wishes.

795
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:56,600
What are you saying?! He goes
around with her holding hands!

796
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:03,800
Thank God that there is at least
one like Krishnan in this world...

797
01:45:04,119 --> 01:45:06,000
...who is willing to mary
Shiksha despite evemhing.

798
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:12,000
Else, she would
have remained tainted...

799
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,320
...all her life for your misdeeds.

800
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:19,880
What are you saying?! No...
you mustn't say such a thing.

801
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:21,480
And why mustn't l?

802
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:28,800
Krishna is the good son
l had always dreamt of.

803
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:32,960
What is she saying?
What are you saying!

804
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:37,320
l can never be a son to you
as he is. He's your own son.

805
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,560
Please don't mind her.
She's just a bit angy.

806
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,720
You're her son... l'm the problem
in this family & l'm leaving.

807
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:53,320
No. You won't go an_here.

808
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,880
You can't go,
because you're the good son.

809
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:07,560
lt's l, who is the rotten
apple. l'd rather leave.

810
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:12,200
Stop him! Please stop him!

811
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,000
From now on, l have
no one in this world.

812
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,800
l have severed all relations
with my family.

813
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:43,400
You are the only one leR.
Will you mary me?

814
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,600
Right now!... Will you mary me?

815
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,320
The girl who screamed at me in
the hospital. Don't you remember?

816
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:24,600
She's the girl who used to change
his clothes in the hospital.

817
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:27,560
She isn't from your community.
But you mustn't be angy for that.

818
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,280
What is there is religion?

819
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,360
l swear upon you...

820
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:36,560
Someday, l'll bring him and his wife
to this house.

821
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,960
You must welcome them
and give them your blessings.

822
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:43,440
Now, please don't cy.

823
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:49,200
l'm no less than a son to you
and will never take false oaths.

824
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:55,800
And l promise to bring them here.
Now, please don't cy.

825
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,080
l've treated you to a sweet.
Now it's your turn to treat me.

826
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:19,000
A drop of honey attracts a fly.

827
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:24,600
lf one fly isn't killed, more
flies are attracted to the honey.

828
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,400
And the atmosphere gets spoiled.

829
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:33,960
Understand?

830
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,800
l want to hear a cy of pain
from Commissioner Gaitonde.

831
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:47,480
Go over to India. Take help
from Vijay Chavan if need be.

832
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:57,480
May l ask you why you have
come here?

833
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:04,600
Please be seated with us.

834
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,600
This husband ofyours...

835
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,320
... is a man of principles.
He worships the law.

836
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,240
What has he received in his
life?

837
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:30,960
He has confiscated contraband
worth millions.

838
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:32,440
And what has he received
from the government?

839
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,400
Nothing. Has the government given
him anything?

840
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,040
And do you have as little as mo
hundred quid for painting the house?

841
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,400
Bring him around.
He's too optimistic...

842
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,080
... about his principles and the
Iaw.

843
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:01,200
This is a city only in name.

844
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:06,920
But the laws ofthe
jungle prevails here.

845
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,520
The housefly eats microbes.

846
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,160
The frog eats the housefly.

847
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:20,560
The snake eats the frog.

848
01:50:22,279 --> 01:50:23,960
The mongoose kills the snake.

849
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,760
The fox is aRer the
blood ofthe mongoose.

850
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,760
And, the lion eats the fox.
While here...

851
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:38,920
The powerFul kills the weak.

852
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,280
Have you had your say?- No. l
have lots more to tell you.

853
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:52,200
But l don't have time.

854
01:50:54,279 --> 01:50:55,640
And neither do you. Get that?

855
01:50:56,199 --> 01:50:58,320
You don't have the time! But
you don't seem to understand!

856
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:02,440
Understood... l understand

857
01:51:05,079 --> 01:51:06,960
...that you have come
here to repay a favour.

858
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:14,520
l remember having informed you that
your people were plotting to kill you.

859
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:16,880
And now you've come to tell me
that someone is going to kill me.

860
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,680
Yes... now he understands.

861
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:27,960
Do you know what this
contains?

862
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:33,840
A bit of vermilion. My wife uses it
to mark her marital status.

863
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,360
And she prays that l live long. And,
it is she who has given this to me.

864
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:44,160
l cary it eveyday,
when l leave for work.

865
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:50,120
lf l die, she will never
need to use it anymore.

866
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:55,760
Take a good look at their faces.

867
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,080
They are not afraid of
happenstance.

868
01:52:00,359 --> 01:52:01,160
They will be proud should it
happen.

869
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:08,760
Go and tell them ...

870
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,760
... that Commissioner Gaitonde
is ready to face death.

871
01:52:21,079 --> 01:52:22,760
The schoolmaster.

872
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,960
Just like the schoolmaster.

873
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:36,120
You talkjust like Dinanath...

874
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,200
The schoolmaster Dinanath.

875
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:45,360
Who is he, Daddy?

876
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,840
Vijay Chavan?
- Isn't he a hoodlum?

877
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,760
We can't sit down to eat
with such a person.

878
01:53:33,399 --> 01:53:35,680
Hey! Where do you think you're
going? Sit down. Sit!

879
01:53:37,399 --> 01:53:38,720
Where do you
think you're going?

880
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,000
Do you find it bloody
uncomfortable,...

881
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:44,480
...just because l am sitting next
to you?

882
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,160
Have l lighted a fire under your
arse?

883
01:53:49,479 --> 01:53:52,400
Don't l look human?
Am l not human?

884
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,320
Am l a bloody animal?

885
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,400
Or, am l not dressed properly?
Did you buy me these clothes?

886
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,760
l bought these with
my hard-earned money.

887
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,360
What are the rest ofyou
staring at?

888
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:10,360
Well, what are you watching?
And why are you so bloody silent?

889
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,640
Has my presence silenced you?

890
01:54:14,439 --> 01:54:16,000
l've come here to spend
my hard-earned money.

891
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,480
l've even polished shoes. Have
you polished shoes for a living?

892
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:22,440
No, you haven't. And, have you
washed cars for a living?

893
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,320
And you ty to show me up!

894
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:26,600
Where do they think they're
going?

895
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,720
No! What are they tying to tell
me?!

896
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:30,960
That they're right and l'm wrong!

897
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:33,480
These people from high society
are gentlemen!

898
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,440
And l am the hoodlum!

899
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,840
Excuse me, Sir.
- Am l the hood?!

900
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:42,560
What was that piece you told
me in English?

901
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,040
What's this English about?

902
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,360
You want money for those glasses,
isn't that so? Well, here you are.

903
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:50,760
Here take money...take that and that,
How much more do you want?

904
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,120
Don, even a mosque has been
built in our hutments now.

905
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:28,320
A hoodlum... am l a hoodlum?

906
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:34,480
l had gone to tell him
that his life is in danger.

907
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:40,280
And he tells his son that
l am a hoodlum. A hood!

908
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:42,360
May the Allah grant
you a long life, Don.

909
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:46,440
l'll show him what
a hoodlum is.

910
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:01,320
Remain here. The informer
wants to meet me alone.

911
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,600
No! Please don't hurt him.

912
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,200
So... you've been raiding
Kancha Cheena's hideouts!

913
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,240
Blood looks nice on your uniform.

914
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:54,000
Kancha Cheena wants to hear you
scream in pain over the phone.

915
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:09,320
Eh! Commissioner!
You've already passed out!

916
01:57:28,039 --> 01:57:31,840
You whites will always
resort to trickey.

917
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:37,800
And you will always attack the
weak.

918
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:48,400
You've resorted to deceit to
get the police officer here.

919
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:54,320
Years ago, you had lured an
innocent widow into your petrol pump.

920
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:58,360
You had deceived her.
You tried to rape her.

921
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:02,440
And why are you silent... speak up!
Go on. Speak up, swine!

922
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:14,840
A 12-year old changed
your face forever.

923
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,960
But, you're incorrigible.

924
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:26,600
The 3-feet tall Vijay has grown
six-and-a-half feet tall.

925
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:27,520
But you have not yet
changed your ways.

926
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,840
Are you the same kid?

927
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,960
This contains vermilion. But you
aren't aware of it's power.

928
01:58:41,319 --> 01:58:44,920
lt's what is beholden
to women from India.

929
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,160
Let me show you how powerFul
this is.

930
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,120
Kancha Cheena on the
line for you, Don.

931
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:09,160
You want to hear the Commissioner
scream out in pain, don't you?

932
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:10,920
Listen to this...

933
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,640
Did you hear that?

934
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,280
That was a lot of noise.
Now, wait for the big bangs.

935
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,280
Those were big bangs
indeed, Vijay Chavan.

936
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:51,560
He hurt kids... the bloody hood.

937
02:00:19,319 --> 02:00:21,000
l've taken you for a brother.

938
02:00:23,079 --> 02:00:24,240
And l respect you as an elder.

939
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:28,800
You had once taken me for a
friend. Is the friendship over?

940
02:00:30,199 --> 02:00:33,960
l'm not related to you. But, aren't
your mother and your sister your own?

941
02:00:35,079 --> 02:00:38,640
lt has been 3 months since
you have spoken to them.

942
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:43,360
Your mother is sad, and your sister
is sad. And, l have been sad too.

943
02:00:43,479 --> 02:00:46,120
l can take care ofyour
mother and your sister.

944
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,800
But, l won't spare you if
anything happens to your wife.

945
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:52,640
She had come over.

946
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,360
Tell me... did you meet them?
- Yes.

947
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,360
The world knows what you're about
to do. But l don't know a thing!

948
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,680
What have you told Krishnan?
What have you told him?

949
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:51,520
You want to abort the child...
you want to kill the child.

950
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,480
lf anything happens
to my child, l'll ...

951
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,680
You'll kill me, won't you?
Go on... kill me...

952
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:00,280
Go on...
You'll be doing me a favour.

953
02:02:02,119 --> 02:02:07,880
At least, l'll be spared the trauma
of having killed my own child.

954
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,880
l don't want our child to
grow up and call you a hoodlum.

955
02:02:23,479 --> 02:02:24,880
What are you going to do then?

956
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,600
Will you strangle the child?
Or, will you kill yourself?

957
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,480
Take a look at yourself...
how you have changed!

958
02:02:35,399 --> 02:02:37,600
ARer the Commissioner's son
had called you a goon,...

959
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:39,920
... you took me to the slums.

960
02:02:40,359 --> 02:02:43,680
You wanted to show me that
you are a God, not a goon.

961
02:02:45,159 --> 02:02:46,880
But, you are no God, Vijay.
God was that child...

962
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:52,880
...who promised that he'd give a
village back to his mother.

963
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:56,840
Where is the village?
Where is it?

964
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:01,880
l want the village, Vijay.

965
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:09,680
But, ifyou do anything to my
child...

966
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,880
... l'll kill you.

967
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:23,560
l'll kill you.

968
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,760
And you've had eveyone addicted
n the village - Get out of here.

969
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:00,880
Are you going to hit me? Swine!

970
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,280
My house... it's a poor man's
house.- Liar! Dog!

971
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,200
Never was born a man poorer
than you!

972
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:13,880
l'll give you a penny.
Curse your mother!

973
02:05:00,279 --> 02:05:03,200
There used to be a school over here.
Children used to study in the school.

974
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:07,440
Education is really
of no use... say what?

975
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,600
Nowadays, l put them to work
as soon as they are born.

976
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:14,440
And that's what the cur
makes the children to do.

977
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:18,760
That's why no child was born
to you.- Get lost.

978
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,440
You'll remain a eunuch forever!

979
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:26,840
This is the pleasure spot in the
village... the red light area.

980
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:28,840
We used to have only one whore
in the village.

981
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,360
Now, all women are whores.

982
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:36,440
His mother is one ofthem too.
- lt's a matter ofwarming the beds.

983
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,440
And some day, your wife
will be warming beds too.

984
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:44,840
Shut up, you miserable thing!
- Swine!

985
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:59,920
Why have you stopped here,
Don? You're seeing this house.

986
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:03,760
Had l not burnt the
house you are seeing,...

987
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,040
...l would've been burnt. A
schoolmaster used to live here.

988
02:06:10,279 --> 02:06:15,640
Dinanath... He used to dream of
making a heaven out ofthis village.

989
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:36,760
The fools must be begging for
a living somewhere, l guess.

990
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:46,240
A strong wind is rising. You
might get blown away. Take care.

991
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,360
You should start praying,
Dinkar Rao.

992
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:00,640
Else you should arrange for 5
million.

993
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,360
Five million?!

994
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,040
My Son!

995
02:07:09,359 --> 02:07:13,040
Why are you looking at me?
Come, let me show you the world.

996
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,480
Gora hasn't returned from India.
Dinkar Rao isn't calling up.

997
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,760
And, God knows where Laila is
gone.

998
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:43,920
Kancha Cheena is coming to
India.

999
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:50,320
You have saved my life, Don! l
shall never forget this in my life.

1000
02:07:52,199 --> 02:07:59,040
Are you licking the dust?
Stop groveling and get up.

1001
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:01,120
Here's the money. You may take
it.

1002
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,680
l could give my life for you,
Don.

1003
02:08:08,039 --> 02:08:10,840
You beg for your life, and then
you offer to give it up for me!

1004
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:17,320
You can't give me anything. You
have nothing! What do you have?

1005
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:22,560
Oh yes, l have. l have these title
deeds of all the land in the village.

1006
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:34,440
Are those lands yours?
Does the land belong to you?

1007
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:36,600
Those lands belong to
the people in the village.

1008
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:40,440
But l hold these lands in lien of
mortgages. You may keep the papers.

1009
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:46,160
They wouldn't know that l've pledged
their lands with you. They trust me.

1010
02:08:46,439 --> 02:08:50,400
And l trust you. In a short
while, l'll return your monies.

1011
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:56,200
lfyou want me to, l'm willing
to sign on a blank paper.

1012
02:08:57,319 --> 02:09:06,440
Go on.
- l've signed the paper now.

1013
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:12,840
l'll give the money to Inspector
Pathan. It'll save my life.

1014
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,240
Thank you vey much, Don.

1015
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:22,920
Gone! There goes the bloody
swine.

1016
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:26,480
He bought his coffin for 5
million!

1017
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:30,160
The blank paper is now a deed
of sale.

1018
02:09:30,279 --> 02:09:34,160
He has sold the village lands.

1019
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:40,160
l'll kick the villagers
out oftheir homes.

1020
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:45,680
And, the villagers, in turn,
will kick the hell out ofyou.

1021
02:09:46,119 --> 02:09:47,320
lsn't that what's
going to happen, Vijay?

1022
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:55,320
Here, uncle....
take the stone and throw it...

1023
02:09:57,159 --> 02:10:01,400
Kancha's glass house. It'll
shatter.

1024
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:14,440
Pimp! You've sold the villagers'
Iands.

1025
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:17,080
Did you own the lands?

1026
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,920
Beat him! Beat him!

1027
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:40,480
You won't even find shelter
in the brothels.

1028
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:51,320
They'll help you get warmer,
swine!

1029
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:55,240
Run, you dog!

1030
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:08,440
So you did get blown away by
the wind.

1031
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:16,440
l had warned you
about the strong breeze.

1032
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:19,320
Now, you have been blown away.

1033
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,240
Why did you deceive me?

1034
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:25,920
ln your drunken fantasies,...

1035
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:30,840
... you have seen the
schoolmaster's family begging.

1036
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,240
You were wrong.

1037
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:45,440
Who are you? -Vijay Dinanath
Chavan. That is my full name.

1038
02:11:50,199 --> 02:11:52,960
The bloody dog is dead! The
swine!

1039
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:22,840
What have you done?!

1040
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,840
ln a fight bemeen the snake and
the mongoose, the snake dies.

1041
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:33,440
The snake is dead.
It's the mongoose's turn now.

1042
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,240
The mongoose tried to betray
the snake-charmer.

1043
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:44,440
Didn't you say that
you'd even befriend an enemy,...

1044
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:48,600
... for the sake of business?
Isn't that your policy?

1045
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:52,920
You've learnt my policies in
business well.

1046
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,840
But, you have no
inkling ofthe outcome.

1047
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:00,480
The outcome is what you must
face.

1048
02:14:46,439 --> 02:14:49,320
But, you are a poor listener.

1049
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:52,240
You don't understand;
and you don't remember.

1050
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,320
l told you my name on
the first day we met.

1051
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:02,680
That's my full name...
understand?

1052
02:15:05,039 --> 02:15:06,880
Now you have understood.

1053
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:12,440
A case ofthe right hand not
knowing what the leR does.

1054
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,160
What you don't know...

1055
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:23,240
... is that you are about
to join the schoolmaster.

1056
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:28,240
Why step back while
you hold a gun on me?

1057
02:15:31,159 --> 02:15:35,720
Stepping back cannot take
you backwards into time.

1058
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:37,720
Will it return?
No!

1059
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,720
And, l have you trapped
like lesser game.

1060
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:47,040
l've checkmated you. Look
behind you.

1061
02:15:53,159 --> 02:15:55,680
Had l wanted to, l would've
killed you right away.

1062
02:15:57,079 --> 02:15:59,920
But, my enemies aren't
given an easy death.

1063
02:16:01,319 --> 02:16:04,680
l have waited 25 years to reach
you.

1064
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:09,720
Take him away. Let him rot in
prison.

1065
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:13,960
The courts need evidence.

1066
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:16,560
l have all the evidence, Kancha

1067
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:24,200
l have evey shred of evidence
for evey crime ofyours.

1068
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,600
You too, Laila!

1069
02:16:27,159 --> 02:16:31,640
l am no Laila... l am Shanti.

1070
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:36,120
You took help from Chandabai's
mother to kill the schoolmaster.

1071
02:16:37,239 --> 02:16:40,600
Vijay used Chandabai's daughter
to checkmate you.

1072
02:16:41,799 --> 02:16:47,520
Chandabai's daughter?!
- Yes. That's who Shanti is...

1073
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:50,720
... Chandabai's daughter.

1074
02:16:54,840 --> 02:17:00,720
A question must be answered
in the same way it is asked.

1075
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,000
lt's a matter of my business
policy.

1076
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:12,720
l had told you when we
met for the first time...

1077
02:17:13,159 --> 02:17:18,320
... that the punishment for
treachey is death. Remember?

1078
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:35,120
Swines! Now that he holds the
cards, you beg him for pardon.

1079
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,120
You should rather beg her
pardon.

1080
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:43,600
You had widowed his mother.
Beg her pardon.

1081
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:47,040
Fools! Go and beg of her.
Go...

1082
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:58,720
You must promise to do as l
say.

1083
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:00,720
What?- You must promise me
you will!

1084
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:02,920
No! you must promise to do as
l say.

1085
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:07,200
All right. l promise to do as
you bid.

1086
02:18:07,319 --> 02:18:10,520
Now tell what it is.
- May you live for 2000 years!

1087
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:13,520
Do you remember l promised you to
bring Vijay and his wife over here?

1088
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:16,240
Vijay is here.

1089
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:22,040
He has brought
his wife and his son along.

1090
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:28,680
Today is a day of festival.
Please don't rebuke Vijay today.

1091
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:35,320
He has nothing more to do with crime.
l swear it. He has leR it all.

1092
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:24,920
This is notjust the
soil from my village.

1093
02:19:29,079 --> 02:19:30,960
On this soil had fallen
my father's blood.

1094
02:19:34,079 --> 02:19:39,680
l have got the village back.
l have cleared my father's name.

1095
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,160
My work is done.

1096
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,360
Let the blood of innocents...

1097
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:55,000
...not fall on this soil again
and spoil it.

1098
02:20:00,079 --> 02:20:05,600
Look... all the villagers
have come here.

1099
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:15,960
Beg to her for pardon.
Fall at her feet, you fools.

1100
02:20:17,559 --> 02:20:22,160
Look at that, Vijay.
They're falling at her feet.

1101
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:30,360
This kid belongs to our family.

1102
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,920
You mustn't make your
mother cy for you.

1103
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:37,000
You mustn't make
your aunt sad. Nor me.

1104
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:42,200
lfyou make me sad, l'll... no, l
won't beat you. l'll bash your father.

1105
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:45,440
He's the kid in our family.

1106
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,840
You may forgive them now -Who
threw them out ofthe village?

1107
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:09,960
Vijay did. He kicked them out.

1108
02:21:11,879 --> 02:21:13,160
And now they are grovelling.

1109
02:21:13,799 --> 02:21:16,920
He said he'd give the village back
to you.

1110
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,920
He bought the village for you.
Son Vijay bought it.

1111
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,440
Let's go back to the village,
Mummy.

1112
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:40,760
Yes... Iet's all go back.

1113
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:55,960
Shanti, alias Laila to
appear before this court.

1114
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:09,160
Lord Ganpati is coming back to
the village to give us peace.

1115
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,120
Each one got what they prayed
for and eveyone is standing...

1116
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:24,040
...in the streets now.

1117
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:31,280
Lord Ganpati is coming back to
the village to give us peace.

1118
02:23:33,479 --> 02:23:36,680
Each one got what they prayed
for and eveyone is standing...

1119
02:23:36,799 --> 02:23:38,680
...in the streets now.

1120
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:45,680
Lord Ganpati is coming back to
the village to give us peace.

1121
02:24:15,559 --> 02:24:16,840
Due to lack of
evidence and witnesses,

1122
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:22,160
... the accused Kancha Cheena is
hereby released.

1123
02:26:22,479 --> 02:26:28,600
This lovely season & winds have
brought happiness here.

1124
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:31,240
Lord Ganpati is going to the
other side...

1125
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:35,240
He is taking eveybody's
prayers with Him.

1126
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:38,320
Eveybody's prayers have
succeeded.

1127
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:42,200
There is no other day
like this.

1128
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:45,600
The clouds are
hanging in the skies.

1129
02:26:45,719 --> 02:26:48,760
The time to immerse God's idol
has come.

1130
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:58,440
Please forgive all our mistakes,
as we are all innocent.

1131
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:05,920
Lord Ganpati has returned to
the village to give us peace.

1132
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,360
Each one got what they prayed
for and eveyone is standing...

1133
02:27:09,479 --> 02:27:12,960
...in the streets now.

1134
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:26,120
Lord Ganpati has returned to
the village to give us peace.

1135
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:59,080
Hold on. You'll be all right.
Nothing's going to happen to you.

1136
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,400
Where's the doctor?

1137
02:29:02,719 --> 02:29:04,760
He's badly wounded, Doctor.
Please attend him immediately.

1138
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:10,480
Nothing's going to happen to you.
l'm here with you.

1139
02:29:11,399 --> 02:29:15,280
Come on...
- This is a police case, mister

1140
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:18,280
We can take up the case aRer you
have lodged a report with the police.

1141
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:23,480
He doesn't have time, doctor. If he
isn't taken up immediately, he'll die.

1142
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:25,280
What can l do?

1143
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,360
What did you say?!

1144
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,160
What did you say?! Do you know
who you're talking to?

1145
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:41,480
You're talking to Vijay Chavan. l'll
kill you if anything happens to him.

1146
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:48,800
He's more than a friend...
he's more than a brother to me.

1147
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:53,080
He's my sister's fiance.

1148
02:29:57,799 --> 02:30:03,360
Do something, Doctor.
Please do something.

1149
02:30:05,079 --> 02:30:07,360
What do you want?

Want my blood? Want money?

1151
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,360
l'll give you whatever you want.

1152
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:16,880
But, if he dies, l'm dead too.

1153
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:24,200
He isn't a goon. He is my
mother's favourite son.

1154
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:28,480
And he's an innocent person.
Please do something, Doctor.

02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,360
Flowers for you, Sir.

1159
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:38,480
l promise to use all
the power at my disposal.

1160
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,480

to get them released.

1161
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,880
He's holding your mother,...

02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,320
... sister, wife and son
as captives.

1163
02:32:20,399 --> 02:32:26,440
''The path through fire.''

1164
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,880
You had helped me when l
needed it.

1165
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:36,440
l shall not hesitate to help you.
- No, Commissioner.

1166
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:39,480
You mustn't interFere.

1167
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:43,480
You must not come in my way.

1168
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:00,720
So, he's the one who takes care
ofthe village, does he?

Yes, l do take care ofthis village.
And, are you going to kill me?

1170

Don't touch me, swine!
l'm speaking.

1171
02:33:11,639 --> 02:33:15,920
Are you going to wipe out
the schoolmaster's family?

1172
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:18,200
Want to shoot me?

1173
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:26,520
That's the dust l shall
become someday. So will you.

1174
02:33:27,239 --> 02:33:29,200
That's what the
schoolmaster told me.

1175
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:35,720
His son will settle
the scores with you.

1176
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:06,600
Here comes Vijay.
See my son Vijay has come

1177

policies of my business.

But, you haven't seen the outcome.

1179
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:31,520
Now, take a look at the
outcome.

1180
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:35,920
Members ofyour family will
have to pay for your mistakes.

1181
02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:39,600
Step forward, ifyou have guts.

1182
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:59,120
l had promised him that l'd be
there with 5 minutes to spare!

1183
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,440
Why have you stopped,
Vijay Chavan?

1184
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:46,240
You love to carve a path
through fires, don't you?

1185
02:35:46,879 --> 02:35:51,640
What's stopping you now?
Come over & save your family.

Let's go home, Mummy.

1196
02:40:38,559 --> 02:40:41,360
l towed my dead father's
corpse on the hand cart.

1197
02:40:41,879 --> 02:40:43,680
lt was heavy.

1198
02:40:48,799 --> 02:40:55,720
Mother l was so young. But, l
took the cart till burial ground.

1199
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:02,400
lt was heavy,
but l did it.

1200
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,640
The path has passed
through a sea oftears,

1201
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:12,440
... sweat and toil.

1202
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:19,160
The path has passed through
fire.

1203
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:26,240
l did not understand then,
now l have understood.

1204
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:36,080
We have reached home, Mummy.

1205
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:40,560

... May, Krishnan,...

1209
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:08,440
... Shiksha and my son.

1210
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:11,440
We must get electricity
to the village.

1211
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:20,240
Mother...

1212
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:33,000
l like the food you cook.

1213
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:36,560
You'll cook for me,
won't you, Mummy?

1214
02:42:39,239 --> 02:42:42,240
Look at my hands, Mummy.

1215
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:47,840
My hands are clean now.

1216
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:52,440

1217
02:42:54,479 --> 02:42:55,640

What have You done!
Oh what have You done!

1222
02:44:04,360 --> 02:44:07,920
You haven't given me anything.
All l found was a brother.

1223
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:10,120
And now, You've snatched him
away too. What have You done!

1224
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:16,840
Five minutes! l'd promised him that
l'd come 5 minutes earlier.

1225
02:44:16,959 --> 02:44:22,800
Couldn't You wait for five minutes?
Only 5 minutes!

1226
02:44:40,719 --> 02:44:44,280
My son isn't a hoodlum.

1227
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:52,640
He isn't a hoodlum.

1228
02:45:03,799 --> 02:45:09,280
You aren't a hoodlum, my son.
