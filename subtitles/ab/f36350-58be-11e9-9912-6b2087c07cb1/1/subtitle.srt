your mother went to.

599
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:20,757
Fifty years ago, she put this
in a time capsule. It's a list of dates,

600
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:25,927
events that I think
she believed would happen.

601
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,299
Look, I don't know
what any of this is about...

602
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,668
And I thought if I could talk to you
or your father...

603
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,434
My father's dead.

604
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:38,112

like your mother, Lucinda,

605

00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,217
I followed one of your mother's predictions

609
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,453
and I watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday,

610
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,360
when she said it would happen,
where she said it would happen,

611
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,295
and there was nothing I could do about it.

612
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,266

in New York City,

It's okay, Dad. I'm okay. This is my friend.

They could've taken you away from me,
but they didn't,

1061

because you have to make
this decision yourself.
