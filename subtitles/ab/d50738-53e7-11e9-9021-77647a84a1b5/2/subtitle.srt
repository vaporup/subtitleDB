1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,864
I know

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,027
Out of battery

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,134
Hello

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,206
Great, I'm about to get to see my dad

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,940
Cut the crap it, let's go, come

6
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,449
They're bringing Tony back

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,210
The phone got cut off half way

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,380
I'm afraid that Chiu will try something
stupid

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,123
I think he will play tricks

10
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,541
What are you doing? Let go of me

11
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,681
Uncle Cheuk

12
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,092
Go to hell

13
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,088
Uncle Cheuk, help me

14
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:32,489
Tony

15
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,197
Wait for me

16
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,192
I'm in a hurry

17
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,161
Stupid

18
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,257
Help

19
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:11,793
Catch it

20
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,827
Tony, are you Okay?

21
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,833
I'm fine Come

22
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,572
We have received news from
the airport

23
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,000
The escaped criminals have taken
the kid away

24
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,512
Stop them, I want them here

25
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,769
Tell the snipers to get ready

26
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,547
Yes, sir

27
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:09,652
What?

28
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,587
What?

29
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,563
They turned me on light and alarm

30
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,226
what for?

31
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,802
He wants to get my attention

32
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,539
Kun, watch the back door

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,177
Headquarters, the suspects are on the
move

34
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,145
What should we do?

35
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,117
Stop them

36
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,451
Alpha, take action

37
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,355
Copy

38
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,092
Don't come here

39
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,710
Why don't you believe me?

40
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,940
I didn't want to hurt anyone

41
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,612
I only want to have my son back

42
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,308
Why?

43
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,621
Uncle Cheuk, take the boat

44
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,453
It'll be faster this away

45
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,081
Uncle Cheuk, are you hungry?

46
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,990
Yes, a little

47
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,693
I have some peanuts in my pocket

48
00:04:55,728 --> 00:05:00,097
I wanted to eat it until we get on
the airplane, eat it

49
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:00,965

Be careful

52
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:23,646
Are you okay?

53
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:24,380
No problem

54
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,856
Sit down Thanks

00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,067
Go

56
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,619
Be careful

57
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,679
Sorry

58
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,485

00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,128
Help me

60
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,528
Who is fighting?

61
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,802
No, no one is fighting

62
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,768
Uncle, over here

63
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,244
Are you okay?

64
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,173
Damn you

65
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,306
Welcome

66
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,362
Mr. Brian Cheuk, I'm from Organized
Crime Bureau

67
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,531
What?

68
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,498
Something happened at school

69
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,741
We need you to come with us to give
us a report

70
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,679
School? What happened?

71
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,706
I don't know the details

72
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,380
I only know that there was an explosion

73
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,018
Where is my dad? How is my dad?

74
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,119
Little friend, don't worry, your dad is
fine

75
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,652
Mr. Cheuk, we are just doing our job

76
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,087
I came here to take you back to the
headquarters

77
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,998
I can tell you the details later

78
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:55,960
Let's go

79
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,933
Wait, it's better for Tony to stay with
me

80
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,630
Feel free, this is way please

81
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,731
Mr. Cheuk, over here

82
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,443
Here

83
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,318
Help me check on these files, it's urgent

84
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:50,989
Got it

85
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,018
Come in

86
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:58,621
Officer Leung

87
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,127
Mr. Cheuk, please sit down

88
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,963
Officer Leung, that lady just said

89
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,139
There was an explosion at the school

90
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,239
How many people are hurt?

91
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,141
The place is in a mess

92
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,012
Our colleagues have brought your

93
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:15,741
friend back to help us

94
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,313
He is in the next door giving us a report

95
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,844
I heard that your Chief Hui Chi-on is
at the scene too

96
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,981
Yes, he is a good boss

97
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,224
Tony, didn't you say that you want to go
to the bathroom

98
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,422
Yes, I want to go to the bathroom

99
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,601
Uncle, take me with you

100
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,632
Officer Leung, where is the bathroom?

101
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,068
Outside

102
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,063
Thanks

103
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,579
Uncle, be careful

104
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,313
Now you know how to sing "Pain"
don't you?

105
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,920
Is the chief of Hong Kong police force
Hui Chi-on? Stupid

106
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,337
You are not as foolish as

107
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:48,831
I thought

108
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,400
the reunification of HK with China has
been over

109
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,873
And you still have the Queen's picture
on the wall?

110
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,643
Isn't this the office of the Organized
Crime Bureau

111
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,449
How come all the documents are blank?

112
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,784
Also, people should be busy here

113
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,415
But the phone didn't even ring once

114
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:03,853
This is ridiculous

115
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,824
You really think that we didn't notice it?

116
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,757
We have so many men here

117
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,956
You think that you can beat us?

118
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,329
Don't worry, let me help you

119
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,964
How many can you fix?

120
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,132
How about you?

121
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,498
7, the rest of them will go to you

122
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:20,904
That's not fair

123
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,902
This world is not fair

124
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,173
Kid, shut up

125
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,206
Shut up and fight

126
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,391
I have seen it, let me see it

127
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,467
Why are you chasing after me?

128
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,496
You look ugly

129
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,038
Ghost?

130
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:50,639
Ghost?

131
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,587
Come

132
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:02,953
Go after him, Freeze

133
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,528
I know

134
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:26,944
Why are you still here?

135
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:27,876
Come back

136
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,878
What are you doing?

137
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,047
You guys get on the boat first, I'll go
start this boat

138
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,018
Hurry

139
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,731
Any trouble?

140
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,460
None of my business

141
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,699
Wait

142
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,534
Hurry, come over here

143
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,973
What are you scare of?

144
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,043
Come down

145
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,891
Please, you can't do this

146
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,335
I need to borrow your car

147
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,365
Okay, take it

148
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:26,695
Thanks

149
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,040
Let me drive

150
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,271
What? This is of no reporting value

151
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,608
If I rape you, will it be a great news?

152
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,400
Hurry up

153
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,159
Get in

154
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,531
Take the back seat

155
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,592
Don't move

156
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,701
Sir, I just want to take my son home

157
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,601
Let me take him home

158
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,706
he is my only son

159
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,135
Please

160
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,472
I have a son too

161
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,443
Even if you are not going to let me take
him back

162
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,278
At least le me see him

163
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,943
I only want to know if he is okay or not

164
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,748
Please, I beg you

165
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,746
Do you know that you almost lost your
life?

166
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,858
Who is your son? Which class is he in?

167
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:03,527
He... he is in second grade, room A

168
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,831
Cheung, turn off the ray of B zone

169
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,670
Crawl in slowly

170
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:15,842
Don't move

171
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,838
She only wants to see her son

172
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,782
She will leave soon

173
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:22,777
Take her there

174
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,177
Let's go Thanks

175
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,624
You are not keeping your promise

176
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:40,724
7 o'clock

177
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,727
I'll blow this place up after seven

178
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,137
The kidnap at the primary school is not
settled yet

179
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,206
5 minutes ago, an unknown person
sneaked into the school

180
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,307
and started a gun war with the criminals

181
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,249
Right now there is no injury report

182
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,151
The criminal claims that if he can't see

183
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,490
his son before 7

184
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,187
he will detonate all the bombs

185
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,660
Asshole, it must be done by Chiu

186
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,432
You'll get tired

187
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,396
I thought that you are an ironman

188
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,431
I can't take this anymore

189
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,910
If little Pun was not at the scene

190
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,910
I could never have held on this long

191
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,278
Sorry for all the troubles

192
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,811
Don't be silly, this is not your fault

193
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,954
Are you guys going to arrest my father?

194
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,758
Tony, don't worry, if no one gets hurt

195
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,893
your dad will be fine

196
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,086
Don't worry

197
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,825
Don't lie to me, I understand it

198
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:49,624
Good boy

199
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,968
Well, Tony is such a good boy

200
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,807
when you report this incident

201
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,602
I hope you'll be fair

202
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,508
Maybe the judge will go easy on his dad

203
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,879
I want to make it good too

204
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:03,910
but you must know one thing

205
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,043
My boss loves to make things up

206
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,452
Sometimes the press must be blamed

207
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,490
Just to make a little more money

208
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,791
They will make lots of shit up

209
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:17,821
What good will it do?

210
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,026
I am only a little worker, I have no say

211
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,633
You are only a little worker

212
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,160
but why do you have to work this hard?

213
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,974
Just joking, you don't have to be this
mean

214
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,471
Come on, I'll drive

215
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,643
Don't touch my steering wheel

216
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,550
I've told you, what a bad luck

217
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,522
They are here

218
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:54,759
Stop the car

219
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,789
Right...

220
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,396
Left...

221
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:00,901
Do you know how to drive?

222
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:01,831
None of your business

223
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,286
Right

224
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,491
No, left...

225
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,562
Go to the right, just listen to me

226
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,525
Left or right?

227
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,791
Left or right? Damn it

228
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,637
Your mouth stinks

229
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,336
Take care

230
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,672
Shut up, stupid

231
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:43,780
Go left, hurry

232
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,146
Tony, come

233
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,021
Come and help

234
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,759
Can't get out

235
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,797
So?

236
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:33,655
Help me

237
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,187
Are you okay?

238
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:34,833
I'm alive

239
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,032
Take it easy

240
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,067
Run, it is going to explode anytime

241
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,611
It's almost 6, can we make it?

242
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,155
Just three more blocks, we are almost
there

243
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:10,794
I want a rest

244
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,405
Uncle, you are bleeding, are you okay?

245
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:17,869
We will not make it if we don't go now

246
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,375
Take the short cut

247
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,331
We only had a little fun on the boat

248
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,096
Now we can really have a fight here

249
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,633
Martial artists use their fists and kicks to
prove themselves

250
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,432
Before you punch, you should really

251
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,441
think about it first, what is it for?

252
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,309
I want to defeat all my opponents

253
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,414
Wrong

254
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,378
You want to help those who didn't

255
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,409
receive fair treats

256
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,115
To tell you the truth, I'm doing this for
money

257
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,387
If I defeat you, I'll get $500,000

258
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,355
Can you make it?

259
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,893
Tony, go there yourself

260
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,360
I'll be there soon

261
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,108
Uncle, you are bleeding

262
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:01,639
If you don't go now

263
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,579
more people will bleed, hurry up

264
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,249
This is what you have?

265
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,741
I'm... in... a... hurry

266
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,459
Tony...

267
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,624
Are you okay?

268
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,364
Yes, but I'm tired

269
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:34,262
Come on

270
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,045
Excuse me

271
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,215
You can't go in

272
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,281
This place has been sealed off

273
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,385
This is Mr. Chiu Chung-tin

274
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,726
He is the father of the child who

275
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,692
the criminal requests for

276
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,692
I want to talk to your head

277
00:29:58,731 --> 00:29:59,492
stop washing my time

278
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,893
If anything happens
you will be responsible?

279
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,133
Wait, I'll get my superior

280
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,133
I'm in charge of here

281
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,336
A nutcase turned this place upside
down

282
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,736
My son has been captured by a fellow
of the nutcase

283
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,874
What is wrong with you police?

284
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,071
Have you reported it to the police?

285
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,575
I'm doing it now

286
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,709
Mr. Chiu, many violent incidents

287
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,842
happened on their way from the airport
to the school

288
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,348
I hope this has nothing to do with you

289
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:21,947
If you have anything to do with this

290
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,378
no matter how rich you are

291
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,115
we will carry out justice

292
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,682
Of course this has nothing to do with

293
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:27,923
Mr. Chiu, watch your mouth

294
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,221
Shut up

295
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,285
Please follow me

296
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:44,275
Charles, will that fool bribe the cops?

297
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,373
No

298
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,413
This case is widely watched, no one can

299
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,746
hide anything

300
00:30:58,757 --> 00:30:59,313
Hello

301
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,789
Charles, why are you doing this?

302
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,188
Surrender now

303
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,490
Even if you get Tony back

304
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,630
Can you get away?

305
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,300
Okay, even if you can escape,

306
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,160
you must live in fugitive

307
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,933
Can you stand having Tony going all

308
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:16,235
over the place with you, he'll never have
a chance to go to school

309
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,137
You forced me into this

310
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,003
I've discussed it with Chiu already

311
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,436
If you surrender

312
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,240
we will hire the best lawyer for you

313
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,780
After Chiu gets his dad's money

314
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,876
you can have Tony back

315
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,815
What we want is different from yours

316
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,914
I won't trust anybody

317
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,858
Tell him Tony is coming

318
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,925
Tony is here

319
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,231
Is it bomb?

320
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:46,665
Shit Yes

321
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,772
Don't move

322
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,374
Do you have a problem?

323
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,374
What are you talking about?

324
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,780
You asked his wife to make him

325
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,608
show up, so you could shoot him

326
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,583
Crazy, what does it have anything to do
with me?

327
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,344
Stop lying, look

328
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,413
Let's go

329
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,253
I don't know them

330
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,490
don't set me up

331
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,392
Who is the nephew of Brian Cheuk?

332
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:17,865
I'm exhausted

333
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,071
Come on

334
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,405
Uncle Cheuk, are you tired?

335
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:00,969
What do you think?

336
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,780
Can you take on 4 people yourself?

337
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,713
No problem

338
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,657
I wonder

339
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,135
Looks like you can't make it

340
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,331
The suspects are taking action
everybody standby

341
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,072
You guys are not sincere

342
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,710
Trying to ambush me again and again

343
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,077
From now on

344
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,446
I will kill a child every 3 minutes

345
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,084
He's going to kill, what should we do?

346
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,021
Son, leave this place to your dad

347
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,155
Don't come over here

348
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,992
I beg you, don't come any closer

349
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,397
I've been a Buddhist for many years

350
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:00,961
don't fight with me

351
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,272
Don't force me to break my oath

352
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:04,566
Break it

353
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,874
Uncle Cheuk, they're more powerful
than you

354
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,119
Of course, they are my masters

355
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,346
No time left, let's go

356
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,222
Excuse me, thanks

357
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,066
Sir, this is the injunction from court

358
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,164
I want to see Mr. Chiu

359
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,702
Excuse me

360
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,144
Sir, your boss is calling for you

361
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,146
Really? Thanks

362
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,347
You can't going...

363
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,414
Mr. Chiu, this is an injunction from
court

364
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,348
This is an injunction from court

365
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,648
please give me my son

366
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,221
Can't you see the situation right now?

367
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,956
Can we wait until he release all the
hostages, okay

368
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,495
You crazy, should we let him eat first?

369
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,499
This is an injunction from court

370
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:05,125
are you going to execute it?

371
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,896
I don't mean it

372
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,334
I don't care

373
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,141
Just give me back my son

374
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,138
What are you doing? Stop it

375
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:15,038
Stop it

376
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,241
What's wrong?

377
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:20,715
Mr. Chiu

378
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:21,642
Who hit me?

379
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,517
Sir, there is a fight going on

380
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,346
What's the matter?

381
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:26,919
Didn't you see who hit me?

382
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:28,687
I was working

383
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,258
Why aren't you two fools helping me?

384
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:33,922
We don't know how to fight

385
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,674
Super tag team

386
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,008
This is called side kick

387
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,178
Honey

388
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,142
Damn, luckily I practiced kung-fu before

389
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,450
3 minutes are over

390
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,155
No

391
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,498
Tony...

392
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,798
I am Pun, not Tony

393
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,597
Tony is almost here

394
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,039
You are lying to me

395
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,471
You all lied to me

396
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,642
He is not coming

397
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,173
Tony won't come

398
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:09,512
Dad

399
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:11,885
Tony

400
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:12,954
Dad Tony

401
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,084
Dad

402
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:19,987
Charles

403
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,495
I've brought him here

404
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:23,692
Let other people go now

405
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,663
Thanks

406
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,996
I always keep my promise

407
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:36,978
Uncle Pun

408
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:47,882
Don't move

409
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,119
You go inside and take a look

410
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,018
Yes, sir

411
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,128
Cheuk, please take good care of
my son

412
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,597
I will

413
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,232
You are a nice and tough man

414
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,538
They won't punish you severely

415
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,532
After you come out from jail, take good
care of Tony

416
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,137
Tell him that violence is not good
solution

417
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,347
Tony, listen to uncle

418
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:14,744
Relax

419
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:15,575
Take him away

420
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:16,410
Yes, sir

421
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:18,312
Let's go

422
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,117
Son

423
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:23,950
Mom

424
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:24,718
Are you okay?

425
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:25,728
I'm fine

426
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,789
That's good

427
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,998
I've fixed those bastards

428
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:30,491
You are something

429
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,795
I've to meditate for a long time for this
wrong doing

430
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,102
Cut the crap, let's go

431
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,531
Let's go

432
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,071
This quick?

433
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:49,309
What?

434
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,682
You dad died in America

435
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,713
Where is my share of heritage?

436
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,092
He donated all money to the charity
fund

437
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,257
You assholes, I'm going to kill you all

438
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,798
You asshole, how dare you hit me
when you become poor

439
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,326
Although I'm not good at fighting

440
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,159
I should get it a try

441
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:05,291
Come on

442
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,798
Brother-in-law

443
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,268
Are you okay?

444
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,637
I'm fine, after this couple of days
I realized one thing

445
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,237
that I've not potential to learn Kung-fu

446
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,144
I've decided to study kung-fu from
Cheuk

447
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,282
You have to try hard

448
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:22,211
Forget it

449
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,778
Forget it, bitch

450
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,785
Charles, are you okay? I didn't mean it

451
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,615
Sorry, Charles

452
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:28,449
Be careful, brother-in-law

453
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,461
Tony, be a good boy and come to your
mother

454
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,161
Uncle, let's go

455
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,092
Did you hear me, let's go

456
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,331
It is not my fault, I'm innocent

457
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,126
One picture please

458
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,530

00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,776
Maybe I'll tell you about my sex life

464
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,010

465
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,452
Damn, I've to teach you a lesson

466
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,626
I can't believe after I stayed with that
dummy for hours only

00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,422
but I've learned some useful skills

468
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,371
Dad, where are you going?

469
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,401
Going out to eat

Eating out

But I need some medicine

00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,347
Uncle will set up a date for you with
a beautiful girl

Right, she is really pretty

476
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,249
No way

477
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,950
Really? It is really pretty

478
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,923
