1
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,372
Do you enjoy it?

2
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes, but you have to take me to the
Ocean Park next time

3
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,080
Okay, if only you are a good boy

4
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,616
I'll bring you to go

5
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,308
Got it

6
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,546
Where is mom?
When will she come back?

7
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,288
Your mom went somewhere else

8
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,725
She thinks that I'm not good enough
for her, she left me

9
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:09,930
Next time, I will take you
to your mother, okay?

10
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:10,729
Okay

11
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:14,572
But, are you going to leave me

12
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,599
Iike mom?

13
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,781
Of course not, I love you very much

14
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,947
I will always stay with you, okay?

15
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,421
You're quite a caring step-father

16
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,622
I knew it

17
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:31,223
You guys have no other better place
to go

18
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,058
Tony, come here
Mom

19
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,085
Tony

20
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,361
Are they all your boyfriends?

21
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:41,836
She is not that good

22
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,933
Oh, they are your boyfriends

23
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,764
Bullshit

24
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,775
I came to take back my son

25
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,138
You dumped him before he was born

26
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,670
and now you want to take him back?

27
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,280
You didn't eat breakfast?

28
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,012
How come out have such good appetite?

29
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,419
Charles, the world is changing everyday

30
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,758
In the past, a kid means nothing to him

31
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,859
But today, he means the world to him

32
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,965
I changed my mind

33
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,132
I want to be a good father

34
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,493
You have been a step-father for years

35
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:16,336
It is my turn now

36
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,468
Tell his lawyer to come talk to me

37
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,098
The court will decided
who can keep him

38
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,110
Laws stand on the rich side

39
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:28,375
If we check the DNA, you'll definitely
lose

40
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:33,382
You ex-marine from the British force
try to mess with me?

41
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,120
Go back to England for begging

42
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,826
What does it have to do with England?

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,898
You are nonsense

44
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,293
I am a Chinese, I live in the SAR
of China

45
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:49,896
I am happy

46
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,706
I didn't marry you

47
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:55,911
The son belongs to me and Mr. Chiu

48
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,136
He has nothing to do with you

49
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,545
If you go to court, you will lose for sure

50
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:04,050
Besides, we just got married

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,588
We will take Tony to see his grandfather
in America soon

52
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,990
Don't be stiff-necked all the time, okay?

53
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,250
Stop, I don't want to be involved in
your family business

54
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,262
I think you have come to the wrong
place

55
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,528
You should go to the Social Welfare
Department right now

56
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,033
Tony, let's go

57
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,127
Dad

58
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,196
Get lost

59
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,288
Why making so many troubles?

60
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,156
I just want to take my son back

61
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:43,848
Go

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,083
Move

63
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:49,891
Damn you

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,089
Give me back my son, now...

65
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:52,896
Don't be this, come on

66
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:56,800
It's okay, hurry up

67
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,005
Damn you British dog

68
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,637
Don't blame me of bullying you

69
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,185
This sum of money is more than your
pension

70
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:12,851
Go get yourself some medicine

71
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,213
Go

72
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,648
Dad...

73
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,841
Attention, that guy has arrived

74
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:33,256
Everybody standby

75
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,990
You see? It is nothing special

76
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,203
Who are you looking for?

77
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,501
I am looking for your boss, Mr. Dick

78
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,206
Mr. Dick is not here
you better leave now

79
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:13,926
Stop...

80
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,172
Don't under-estimate him

81
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,073
Everybody, go get him

82
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:25,645
Stop...

83
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:29,546
Stop. You'll have no way out

84
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:43,453
Game over

85
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,537
We will do whatever it takes to get him

86
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:36,635
Don't let him go up to the roof

87
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,539
It's the 69th floor, he's almost reached
the roof

88
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:41,634
Go get him

89
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,976
Stop! Stop!

90
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,245
Mr. Charles Cheuk

91
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:58,581
Mr. Dick

92
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,380
you said this building is best guarded
in Shenzhen

93
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,215
But all your security guards are thieves

94
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,750
They aren't even qualified to be a
security guard

95
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,823
When I came here earlier
they paid no notice

96
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,698
But started to chase after me like
I am a murderer

97
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,469
They use useless weapons

98
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,863
If I was just a rude visitor

99
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,138
I think I would have been dead

100
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:22,844
I am very sorry

101
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:26,475
I think you need to rehire some useful
guards

102
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,407
A good guard is to solve problems

103
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,073
Not some fools who only know abusing
violence

104
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,344
If not, they will only cause more troubles

105
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,720
Mr. Charles, I need your help

106
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,089
to train and reorder them

107
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,222
Go back

108
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,830
Okay, bye

109
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,804
Today Mr.Cheuk gave us a valuable
lesson

110
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,772
Mr. Cheuk is our country's security
specialist

111
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,101
He is a martial art coach, too

112
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,149
He is very good at martial art
and self-defense techniques

113
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,753
You guys should learn from Mr.Cheuk

114
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:05,543
Yes

115
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:08,682
Everyone

116
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,458
violence is not a solution

117
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,553
Chinese people are not barbarians

118
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,328
If you want to do a good job

119
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,331
you have to control everyone's temper

120
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,398
Remember to control your temper too
okay?

121
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:22,500
Got it

122
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,004
Happy birthday

123
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,481
What are you doing? Are you okay?

124
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,946
We wish you happy birthday

125
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:14,482
Today is your birthday, congratulations

126
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,250
But,

127
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:17,756
I am showering

128
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,889
I showered you when you were little

129
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:20,618
Right

130
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:21,760
I am a grown up now

131
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:22,621
Are you shy?

132
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,061
We did this because you are an adult
now

133
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,162
Get out...

134
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,063
You guys should have waited until
finish showering

135
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,638
Uncle, happy birthday

136
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,966
Good Come on

137
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:35,169
Make a wish

138
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,169
I picked this cake

139
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,013
You've already applied to stay in HK

140
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,174
What other wishes do you have?

141
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:45,847
You guys can spend a lot of time
with me in Hong Kong

142
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,649
But I've got lots of chances here

143
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,355
You see, lots of HK people always

144
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:51,950
come here to eat and shop

145
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,024
They come everyday

146
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:54,022
That is not the same

147
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:57,225
Make a wish for a girlfriend, hurry up

148
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,764
Right, find a girlfriend

149
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:00,592
Come on

150
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,726
You are not young anymore

151
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:04,669
The girls in Hong Kong look modern
and smart

152
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,839
You will sure find someone you like

153
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,605
I will introduce girls to you, okay?

154
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,278
The daughter of Aunt Yee is very pretty

155
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,576
Right, she's got a great body too

156
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:13,472
No, please

157
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,550
When you get your travel document
to Hong Kong next week

158
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,517
you can stay in HK for 2 months

159
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,685
Uncle will help you get the citizenship
in Hong Kong

160
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:20,821
It will be easier to travel back and forth

161
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,787
I will think about it

162
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,587
Why?

163
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:25,823
You don't have to think anymore

164
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:28,125
Listen to me, come next week

165
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,358
Enough

166
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,730
Dad, can you still punch like before?

167
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,633
Of course, look

168
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:37,663
Really? That's great

169
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:40,338
Why don't we go up to the roof
to practice, okay?

170
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,337
Don't you regret?

171
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:42,373
Why would l?

172
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,338
I will beat you down

173
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:45,376
We will see

174
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:46,380
Okay

175
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,021
Dad, you've got some skills

176
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,455
You thought that I didn't practice
anymore

177
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,391
I practice everyday when I wake up
in the morning

178
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,320
Really? Come again
Okay

179
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:07,326
Watch me

180
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,628
Son, do you want a good lesson?

181
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:17,810
You want me to hold your leg?

182
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:18,569
Sorry...

183
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,798
Dad, I will go get you some tea

184
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,470
Damn, you improved a lot

185
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:08,156
Our car broke down

186
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,462
What happened?

187
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,203
How is it? Can't you fix it?

188
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,132
No, I can't

189
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,742
I thought you can help me save some
money

190
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:25,740
Now I need to find some way to get
to the train station

191
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:30,141
Don't talk like that

192
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,250
Forget it, we better think of something

193
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,959
Is your car broken down?
Do you need some help?

194
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,220
Hey man, are you going to Hong Kong?

195
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:44,857
Yes

196
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,499
Can you give me a ride?

197
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,096
Sir, you are so strong

198
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:51,329
If you are a thief, won't I be in a lot of
troubles?

199
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,839
No way, I look so nice
I don't look like a thief

200
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:56,810
I will pay you

201
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,938
Forget it, get in the car

202
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,709
Thanks

203
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:02,141
What?

204
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,511
It's okay, I've found a ride

205
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,375
Bye Bye

206
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,967
My name is Cheuk, Brian Cheuk

207
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:23,366
I am a security officer

208
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,632
Hello, just call me Charles

209
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,375
Mr. Charles, what kind of business
are you in?

210
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,278
I am not a business man
I am a driver

211
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:34,444
I was a soldier before

212
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,307
Soldier? ln China?

213
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:37,980
No, in Hong Kong

214
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:39,945
I was a Chinese soldier under the
British Army before 1997

215
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,878
a freak left by the reunification

216
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,324
Don't say that, you are smart

217
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:47,952
the best candidate to become a security
officer

218
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,498
The HK economy is so poor now

219
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:51,692
thieves are everywhere

220
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,094
What good laws and rights in HK

221
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,268
There are laws and right in HK

222
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,695
Laws? Laws are written to protect
the rich people

223
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,270
Fair justice never exists

224
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,105
Looks like you are unhappy with
the society now

225
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:08,673
Yes, I've decided to bomb those
people I hate to death

226
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,844
Good! Blow them away with what?

227
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:13,182
Plastic bomb

228
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:17,191
Do you know how to make a bomb?

229
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,325
Of course not, how would I know
how to make a bomb?

230
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:41,382
End of your ride

231
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:44,047
You can find a taxi over there

232
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,051
Thank you

233
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,846
Brother in law, sister said
that she is taking Tony to America

234
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:52,684
I won't bother you anymore, see you

235
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:53,957
Okay

236
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,061
Bye

237
00:21:56,932 --> 00:22:00,230
My name is Horn, other than working
in a garage

238
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,829
I am also an insurance agent
health food salesman

239
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,431
If you want to be a film extra

240
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:05,605
I can help you

241
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,000
No need, I come from China

242
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,769
Do you want money exchange?
My exchange rate is 2 to 1

243
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:12,442
Don't bother him

244
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,306
What did your sister say?

245
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,215
She told me not to be so nosy

246
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,416
Because if Chiu takes Tony to America
to see Chiu's father

247
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:21,648
he will get 2/3 of his inheritance

248
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,315
It is worth about US 1 billion

249
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:26,961
That's great, your sister is going to be
rich

250
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:31,461
But the three sons in Chiu's family

251
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:32,430
don't have any children

252
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:35,327
I don't know how that asshole
could give birth to Tony

253
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,131
I was beaten up by them couple
days ago

254
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,531
It hurts really bad

255
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,167
But, I am a nice person

256
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:44,042
I kept it to myself and didn't tell anyone

257
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:44,804
Also...

258
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,137
They took my money too

259
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:54,882
Brother in law, you are very handsome

260
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,356
Did he mention where to put the ransom

261
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,861
It's not like this...

262
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:06,792
I raised him up, but he is Tony's dad

263
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,526
I only hope to get his custody

264
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,430
It's that simple

265
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,137
What the hell? This is family problems

266
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:14,465
You should go to the Social Welfare
Department

267
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,034
Here is the Organized Crime Bureau

268
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,142
I can charge you with wasting
an officer's effort

269
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,713
Officer...

270
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:23,781
Honey

271
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:25,279
Officer, listen to me

272
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:27,744
Take your son home, I am very bush
right now

273
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:31,890
Okay...

274
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,624
This is it

275
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:37,325
Leave?

276
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,522
Do I have to get you the number of the
Social Welfare Dept?

277
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,332
Crazy

278
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,574
Don't make me mad, otherwise
I will bomb you guys to death

279
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:51,809
This is not a bad idea

280
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,146
Don't joke around, think carefully?

281
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,079
Are you trying to fool me?

282
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:55,979
Brother Charles, you can do it

283
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,150
We can ask Fatty to come back from
China

284
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,316
Are you crazy? We will never get away
with it

285
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:04,891
Don't worry. I will call Fatty to prepare
the tools

286
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:06,020
I will go make a phone call

287
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:06,559
Okay...

288
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,292
Brother Charles, it will be fine

289
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,690
But... it'll be shit

290
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,326
Should we make such big trouble?

291
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:29,777
Guess who this is?

292
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:31,113
Uncle

293
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,378
Why is it taking you so long to change?

294
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,153
No too long, where are they?

295
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,320
They are in the VIP room
let me tell you a bad news

296
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,088
They want to make a match for you

297
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:46,126
Are you kidding me?

298
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,726
They're going to introduce Aunt Yee's
daughter to you

299
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:50,070
I'll show you

300
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:56,465
Uncle

301
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:03,651
Tea Thanks

302
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:04,479
Tea...

303
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,383
Where are you going?

304
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,022
I want to go get some ice-cream

305
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,585
will you go with me?

306
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:13,486
Okay

307
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,160
Hung, why are you so late?

308
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,759
They are waiting for you

309
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,663
Waiting for me? For what?

310
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:22,424
Go in there first, come on

311
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,871
Mother, you called me to come here
just for a dinner?

312
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:33,171
I still have lots of things to do

313
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,480
Your aunt Cheuk's son in Shenzhen
has come

314
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:36,915
Aunt Cheuk, hello

315
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:39,675
I want to introduce her son to you

316
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:43,854
You want to do a matchmaking?

317
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,454
Where is he?

318
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:51,164
He is not here yet, sit down, cousin

319
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,222
Have some tea

320
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,770
The editor is calling me
I have to call him back

321
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:01,736
Excuse me, I have to go make a phone
call

322
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,238
Luckily I left quickly

323
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:08,880
Are you kidding?

324
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:12,551
Is this the one?

325
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,752
Aren't we going back?

326
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,987
If you want to go back, go ahead
I am not going back

327
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,226
I hate this kind of situation

328
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,661
Uncle, tomorrow you have to take me
to school and pick me up from it

329
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:31,769
What? You are so greedy

330
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:36,601
If you don't promise
I will tell them you are here

331
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,076
How dare you

332
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,479
You know? I will hang you up
and whip you

333
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:46,980
Uncle, I know you won't

334
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:47,813
What do you think?

335
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:50,717
I can't believe my mom wanted
a matchmaking for me

336
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,259
And he is dummy from China

337
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah

338
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,153
I am a famous reporter

339
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,490
If this spread out, how can I face my
friends from now on?

340
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,730
Y2K is approaching, but she is still

341
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,295
doing this corny thing

342
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:07,666
What are you looking at?

343
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:16,144
Guess is that the girl they want to
introduce to me?

344
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,080
I don't know

345
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:21,383
That's right

346
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:25,018
I will call you late, bye

347
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,060
I want to ask you what are you looking
at?

348
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,221
You don't have to be this mean, do you?

349
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,567
I don't have to be nice to a person
who isn't polite

350
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:38,061
Who doesn't have manner?

351
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:39,028
You

352
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,904
Me?

353
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:43,241
You guys are really here

354
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,436
Sister, how come you know I am here?

355
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,241
My informer told me that you brought
my son here

356
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:49,141
You are here too?

357
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,915
Okay, we're waiting for you

358
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,948
That's him?

359
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,118
Right, that's him

360
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,490
Sister, stop wasting your energy

361
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:58,953
I don't need you to introduce girl to me

362
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:02,223
Sorry, I have never thought of being
your girlfriend

363
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:03,661
Stop dreaming

364
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,364
There are lots of girls like you

365
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,125
in Shenzhen

366
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:08,596
Right

367
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,799
I think you're quite a special kind of
man in HK

368
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,596
You are corny

369
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,332
Please show a little respect

370
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:15,542
Stop arguing

371
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,402
We only want to introduce a friend
to you

372
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:18,473
So you guys know each other?

373
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,673
Hung, this is my brother Brian

374
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,711
Nice to meet you

375
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:24,509
Bye

376
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,016
I have a meeting to attend to
I'm leaving now

377
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:28,553
Bye

378
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:29,279
You don't want to go in?

379
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:33,357
What is she?

380
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,586
She is a reporter, Papa rezzi

381
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,990
To explore other people's privacy?

382
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,390
No, only to satisfy the curiosity of
readers

383
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:42,592
Sister, listen...

384
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,327
If you introduce girls to me again

385
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:45,301
I will not apple to stay in Hong Kong

386
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,538
No, please don't. No problem
anything you say

387
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:48,732
Let's go up

388
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:49,567
Come on, let's go

389
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:50,535
Come on

390
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,940
Hurry

391
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:56,179
Uncle, hold it

392
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,744
It will take a long time if we go this way

393
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,386
Let's take the short cut

394
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:01,519
Okay

395
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,701
This short cut is much more faster

396
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,806
I am late, hurry

397
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:26,769
You have to pick me up from school

398
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:27,972
I know

399
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,414
Let's shake on it

400
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,644
You have to listen to the teachers

401
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:09,020
Thanks for helping me

402
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,189
But if you go in there
you will have no way out

403
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:11,984
We're expected it already

404
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,020
Do we look like four dogs which just
got abandoned?

405
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:15,461
Thanks

406
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:53,890
Shut up

407
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:55,961
Sit properly

408
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,635
Shut up

409
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,306
In this mission, everybody has to be
very careful

410
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:05,402
Because we believe the criminals are
heavily armed

411
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,816
That is why I want to combine the force
of two districts

412
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:10,811
Boss, your call

413
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:14,943
What?

414
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,057
He said that he is holding the teachers
and students as hostage

415
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:17,680
of the Ching yee primary school
He wants a negotiation

416
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:22,661
Who are you?

417
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,022
Once I was here to report a case

418
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,736
The social Welfare Department didn't
accept my complaint

419
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:30,028
That is why I came here

420
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,464
My wife is going to take my son to
America this afternoon

421
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:34,904
You better get my son back

422
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,074
If you don't do it before the school is off

423
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:40,141
The students will have to stay after
school

424
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:41,143
including your son

425
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:43,413
This is a serious crime

426
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:44,717
you'll be put behind bars for a decade

427
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:45,846
I have no other choice

428
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:47,451
You guys don't have any choices either

429
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,357
You better take a look at the trash can
on the street

430
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,527
I have set bombs in each classrooms

431
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:05,262
If you try anything, I will press the
button

432
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:21,384
What is the situation?

433
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,719
We will report live at the scene

434
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,256
It's messy here

435
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:27,791
Don't bother us

436
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:29,288
Move, the police is working right now

437
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,561
Please co-operate

438
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,464
Go away, No pictures

439
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,297
Get lost

440
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:47,905
Alpha, ready

441
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,178
Beta, ready

442
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:53,449
Charlie, ready

443
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:01,719
This car is quite new, how many
kilometers has it gone?

444
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:02,984
About 10,000km

445
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,634
This is spacious, I don't know if the
stereo is as good as it looks?

446
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,564
You try it. Try the front and the back

447
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,405
Listen

448
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,634
4 criminals stormed into the Ching Yee
Primary School

449
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:18,803
and took the teachers and students
as hostage

450
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:20,771
They demand police to stop one of the

451
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:22,544
suspect's son from leaving HK today

452
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:24,743
Miss, please get out of the car

453
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:25,718
The police is at the scene

454
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:26,750
What? I haven't finished testing it

455
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,682
I am not going to sell it to you
please get out of the car

456
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:29,588
Get out of the car

457
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:30,756
What kind of salesman are you?

458
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:31,713
Move

459
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,770
Boss, this is a dramatic incident

460
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,612
it is full of excitement and it is touching

461
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,213
The sales of newspaper will go up
tomorrow

462
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,279
Yes

463
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,079
but if we don't have any information on
it

464
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,450
your chance of getting fired will be
higher

465
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:03,314
What should I do?

466
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,955
Go get some news, go

467
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:08,157
Find whatever you can on it, go

468
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:14,326
Stop pushing

469
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:16,097
It's you?

470
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:16,668
You?

471
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,701
Do you know what is going on in there?

472
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,934
Everybody knows it except you

473
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:26,144
Looks like it is very serious

474
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:27,773
Tell me what happened

475
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,179
A nutcase is holding a group of student
hostages

476
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:32,746
Nutcase?

477
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:35,318
Shit, my nephew is in there
I have to go inside

478
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,588
Don't go...

479
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:43,094
What are you doing?
Stop him...

480
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:43,788
No

481
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,626
The whole place has been sealed
on one is allowed to go in

482
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,092
If you do that you are going to get
those children killed

483
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,000
I know you guys have lots of snipers
hiding somewhere

484
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,469
It will be useless if you guys kill me

485
00:34:58,246 --> 00:34:58,871
If I die

486
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:00,940
my three friends here will blow
this place up

487
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:01,777
I know him

488
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:03,706
I only have one request

489
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:06,117
that is to have my son back

490
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,351
If I don't see my son before 3 o'clock

491
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:09,644
I will blow this place up

492
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:10,851
We don't have enough time

493
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,586
Please calm down. Give me more time
okay?

494
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,327
All you have to do is go pick him up
at the airport

495
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:17,096
If I see my son, I will surrender

496
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,164
Here is my son's information

497
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,960
I have faxed it to the Organized Crime
Bureau

498
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:24,427
Charles

499
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:24,936
It's you?

500
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,800
My nephew is in there
Please don't hurt him

501
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,338
I only want to see my son

502
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:29,440
No one is supposed to get hurt

503
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:30,670
Give me more time

504
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:31,539
I need some time to get to the airport

505
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:36,572
Okay, 7 o'clock

506
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:38,182
7 o'clock, if I don't see my son

507
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:38,947
I know you are not sincere

508
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:39,918
Wait for me

509
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:40,619
Go

510
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:44,081
Shit, hurry up, it's almost one p.m.

511
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,289
Charles, 100%

512
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,525
Stay calm, don't stir him up

513
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:54,231
The hostages are still in there

514
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,704
Sir, it's him

515
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:02,539
You know the suspect?

516
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,307
Yes, he drove me to Hong Kong

517
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,670
I am from Shenzhen

518
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:08,072
I came here to pick up my nephew

519
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,106
This simple?

520
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:10,974
You don't believe me?

521
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:12,686
Detain him

522
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:13,585
Sir...

523
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:15,755
What are you doing?

524
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:19,114
I am his girlfriend, no his fiancee

525
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:20,889
He is a retired British soldier

526
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:21,858
He might really have set bombs here

527
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,257
Come kidnap me

528
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:24,896
What are you doing?

529
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,724
Don't come here

530
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,259
He has a knife, you better don't come
over

531
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:31,800
He is pointing a knife at my ass
don't come

532
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:32,800
Don't come over

533
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:37,601
Stop or I will shoot

534
00:36:39,045 --> 00:36:39,478
Go after them

535
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,304
Yes, sir

536
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,778
The suspects are heading for Wanchai

537
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:51,579
They've brushed us off

538
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,420
All units, pay attention...

539
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,487
The suspect's car is heading
for Wanchai

540
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:01,384
Eu car one and two, go after them

541
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,327
Set road blocks

542
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:06,996
Looks very familiar?

543
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,028
Really? Fasten your seatbelt

544
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:15,641
I'm not ready yet

545
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,237
You don't have to be that cool

546
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:19,309
What is your name?

547
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:20,976
Call me Simna

548
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,346
Simna?

549
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,416
Isn't he dead?

550
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:42,831
Stop the car...

551
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:52,570
Stop...

552
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:05,916
Stop

553
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:06,849
Here comes Simna

554
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:25,235
The suspect is heading for Western
District

555
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:26,902
The license plate number is Hotel

556
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:27,704
All units, pay attention...

557
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:32,909
Simna, can we make it?

558
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,612
What do you think?

559
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,623
My brother in law always keeps his
promise

560
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,931
We must get Tony for him

561
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:51,070
If not he is going to blow up the school

562
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,338
The worst thing is that we can't get
hold of Tony's information

563
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:57,001
I don't know what Tony looks like?

564
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,978
Don't worry, I am Tony's uncle

565
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:01,539
Just count on me

566
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:04,242
Who is she?

567
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,478
She is...

568
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:06,141
His girlfriend

569
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,385
What are you talking about?

570
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,019
You don't have to mind what I just said

571
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:10,989
Without my help, do you think
you could get away?

572
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,025
I don't care, I want to get the exclusive
this time

573
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:16,222
If not, my boss is going to fire me

574
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:17,695
So you are a reporter?

575
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,291
Super Entertainment Weekly
I am the famous reporter Hung

576
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:24,231
Super Entertainment Weekly

577
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,003
Check the car up there is it on the
wanted list?

578
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:28,599
I will get you this time

579
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:32,574
Shit, they are here

580
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,869
What should we do?

581
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,514
Do you know what is the quickest way
to the airport?

582
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,443
The Airport express

583
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,784
Wrong, it's the car driven by me

584
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:47,083
Are you crazy?

585
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,338
What the hell? Why does it take so
long to print the ticket?

586
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,309
Sorry, Mr. Chiu. They are working on it

587
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:17,353
Radio, we've discovered the suspect's
car on Ching Ma Bridge

588
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,291
Follow him

589
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,786
When you discover the kid
inform me immediately

590
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,038
Tony, are you okay?
How come you don't look happy?

591
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,646
I miss my dad

592
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:44,543
What? Am I not your dad?

593
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,148
You are not my dad

594
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:49,385
Asshole, do you really think that

595
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:50,612
I want to be your dad?

596
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:52,324
IF it's not because of my dad

597
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:53,619
I don't want you

598
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:57,320
Mom, do we really have to go to
America?

599
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,326
Good boy, listen to me

600
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:02,465
If we go to America, we can have
everything

601
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:15,711
That is awesome

602
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,615
Stupid

603
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:22,681
I don't want to go to America
I want to go to school

604
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:23,748
Stupid

605
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,253
Don't call me that
my name is Tony Wong

606
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:30,586
Your name is Tony Chiu

607
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:32,289
Tony

608
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:33,023
Mr. Chiu, here is your ticket

609
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:33,996
Go get him

610
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:35,057
Don't scare him

611
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,103
How can you be so rude to your son?

612
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,998
If it's not for the DNA report

613
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:44,434
I won't call him my son

614
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:55,443
Uncle, how come you are here?

615
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:57,014
I will take you to your dad, okay?

616
00:42:57,423 --> 00:42:57,913
Okay

617
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,585
Let check if those bad guys have gone
yet?

618
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:05,659
They've gone

619
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:08,030
Do you think we are blind?

620
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,092
Run

621
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:29,079
I'm done

622
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:30,088
Please

623
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:37,324
Done, let's go

624
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,393
So fast

625
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:39,398
Let's go

626
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,356
Tony, uncle Charles will take you
to your dad

627
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,597
Tony...

628
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:49,239
Sister, do you know that your husband
is in trouble?

629
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,269
He is keeping the school teachers
and students as hostage

630
00:43:51,644 --> 00:43:52,976
He is surrounded by police

631
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:54,172
What the hell?

632
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,009
Damn

633
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:57,440
Brother-in-law

634
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,175
What are you doing here?

635
00:43:58,751 --> 00:43:59,775
Let me help you

636
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:01,175
Do you think we are idiots?

637
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:01,954
Fix him

638
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,523
Hey, someone stole my son

639
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:10,661
Yes, he is good at Kung-fu

640
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,195
Go get help then, no matter how much
it'll take

641
00:44:14,034 --> 00:44:15,001
I have to take my son to America

642
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:17,594
Take him away

643
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:18,768
Yes

644
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,076
Please, follow me

645
00:44:50,903 --> 00:44:51,666
Say "thank you"

646
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:53,737
Thanks

647
00:45:00,313 --> 00:45:01,838
You have it over there too

648
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:03,373
I know

649
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:04,601
Let's take a picture

650
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:05,440
Attention to all passengers

651
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:05,842
Come

652
00:46:05,878 --> 00:46:08,039
The New Airport Express is

653
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:09,847
experiencing technical difficulty
reparation will take 30 minutes

654
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,981
Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

655
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:13,418
Come on, let's go

656
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:20,356
I can't believe that they fled away this
easily

657
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,722
No problem, they won't get away

658
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,360
There is another flight to America
tonight

659
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:27,992
I have to take Tony away

660
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:34,429
Bobby

661
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,532
Yes, boss, we'll fix it

662
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,338
Okay, let's go to plan 1

663
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:41,737
It'll be useless for them to take the kid
away

664
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:42,840
Yes

665
00:46:47,753 --> 00:46:49,483
Uncle Cheuk, I want some water

666
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,367
Hello, let me use your phone please

667
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,570
Charles, this is Cheuk, I've found Tony

668
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:13,637
Where is he right now?

669
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:16,373
He is with me, I will bring him back
right now

670
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:19,340
Hey, I'm Hung from the Super
Entertainment Weekly

671
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,851
I've found your son

672
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:22,278
you have to let me interview you

673
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:23,552
Save your nonsense

674
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:25,048
Iet me hear my son's voice

675
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:27,384
It's your dad

676
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:27,949
Dad

677
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:29,550
Tony

678
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:32,659
I'm with uncle Cheuk right now

679
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:37,766
We'll go look for you, be careful

680
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:41,206
Okay, be good and listen to uncle
