1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,015
- It's apt. 108.
- Okay.

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:05,766
- Hey!
- Yes?

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,806
You're such a cute little thing.

4
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,281
Thank you.

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:19,980
- Thanks for everything. Bye.
- Good night.

6
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:26,295
- Bye. Take care.
- Thanks for tonight.

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,495
Where have you been?

8
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:31,734
Apartment meeting.

9
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:38,704
Look at him. He looks
like a sleazebag.

10
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:41,545
Yeah, he really does.

11
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,739
Looks mean as well.

12
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,452
What did you tell them?

13
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,359
How can you do this to me!

14
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:18,780
See you later.

15
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,956
Shit, why am I such a loser.

16
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,930
I envy you.
You've got a husband and a boyfriend.

17
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,968
Next, next.

18
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:46,766
No. 2, Hulk,
No. 3, Tiger Woods,

19
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,513
- No.4 Zidane!
- Okay, Zidane!

20
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:50,911
Zidane, Zidane!

21
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,847
What is it?

22
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,350
Aw shit. You should've knocked...

23
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:55,545
- Uh! Jisoo...
- Jisoo...

24
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:58,954
You're here. I have your assigned
internship schools.

25
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,117
- Sangmin is Dongin High.
- What?

26
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,287
- Dongin High.
- Shit!

27
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,297
What is it? What's wrong?

28
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:12,294
It's Boeun's high school.

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,068
Idiot!

30
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:53,505
Boeun...

31
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,870
Huh?

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,604
- You know...
- What!

33
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:01,280
- Speak, I'm late for school!
- Okay.

34
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,618
We'll talk at home, okay? Bye!

35
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:19,295
Excuse me, but where is
the faculty office?

36
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,769
Faculty office? I don't know.

37
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,201
I loathe that place.

38
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,300
Wait for me!

39
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,577
Hey, who told you to dye your hair?

40
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,141
What a funky hairstyle!
Come here.

41
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,991
Excuse me!
Hey!

42
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,685
Your tea...

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,454
Thank you.

44
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,330
You should have told me.

45
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,405
You seemed too attractive
to be a pervert.

46
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,505
Working out?

47
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:04,879
Sir, this is the new intern Park Sangmin.

48
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,576
Hello, sir.

49
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:09,784
Miss. Kim, you may be excused.

50
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:16,349
Yes, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

51
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,631
- How have you been, sir?
- Good.

52
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,569
- Take good care of Boeun.
- Yes.

53
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:32,871
- No one knows except for me.
- Right.

54
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,776
Last night I was at a disco club,
you know who I met there?

55
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,850
- Who?
- Our room teacher.

56
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,248
What?

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,379
She must've gone there to pick up men.

58
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,631
Old maid syndrome!

59
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,544
Quiet!

60
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:12,007
We have a new intern here.

61
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,310
- Wow, he's so cute.
- He's really cute.

62
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:15,885
Doesn't he look familiar?

63
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:19,514
Yeah, he does look familiar.
He's cute, though...

64
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,686
I am Park Sangmin who will be
teaching Art.

65
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,532
- I hope we get along.
- Yes!

66
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:33,094
Don't even think of playing tricks
on Mr. Park, okay?

67
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:34,800
Yes, ma'am...

68
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,507
You all have a bright future,
you know what I mean!

69
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,713
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

70
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,283
Quiet!

71
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,813
Now, let's make a toast!

72
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:57,083
Cheers! We'll spend
the entire night toasting.

73
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,195
Mr. Park, bottoms up!

74
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:04,901
Mr. Park!

75
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,466
Now one from your supervisor.

76
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:15,068
- Here you go~
- Just a little bit.

77
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,404
- How is it, Mr. Park?
- Excuse me?

78
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,133
- The kids are hard to deal with, huh?
- No, I can handle them.

79
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:52,478
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes, a bit...

80
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,545
Aw~ come on!

81
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,352
Aw~ come on!

82
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:03,693
What a great coincidence
we're teaching the same class.

83
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,219
This calls for a celebration together!

84
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:07,892
No thank you!

85
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:16,803
It'll make your internship much easier.
One more round, okay? Okay...

86
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,619
Mr. Park, let's go! The second round.

87
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:42,855
When I first met you in Jeju Isle,
I felt weird inside.

88
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,102
Miss Kim! Wake up. Please!

89
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:50,698
Don't take me easy cause
I'm a spinster!

90
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,470
I'll kill you if you do!

91
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,311
I don't believe this is happening!

92
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:02,745
Mr. Park. You know, I went to
a fortune teller early this year.

93
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:10,389
I'm supposed to marry a younger man.
What do you think about this?

94
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:13,764
What do you mean?
We talked about this before!

95
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:18,125
Don't take me easy!

96
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:22,070
I'll pound you with a brick
if you do!

97
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:31,404
Miss Kim... Miss Kim! Miss...
Miss Kim, Miss Kim...

98
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,752
Where're you going Mr. Park?

99
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,982
Nowhere... drive on, mister.

100
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,204
Why are you up?

101
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,782
What?

102
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:12,786
Why didn't you answer your phone?

103
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:17,525
Your teachers all drink like fishes!

104
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,790
I couldn't keep up.

105
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:23,362
- Why of all schools is it mine?
- I know.

106
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:28,500
If the school finds out,
I'm going to die! Be careful!

107
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,334
I'll be careful. Don't worry.
There won't be any rumors.

108
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:34,204
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

109
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,312
Wash up! You stink of liquor.

110
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,211
Okay. Sleep.

111
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,242
Why should I be the only one
to be careful?

112
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,547
- Hey!
- What!

113
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,651
I'll be careful.

114
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,168
What?

115
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:02,604
Sorry, but can I pee next to you?

116
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,868
- No!
- I'll turn around.

117
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,375
Boeun, I can't hold myself!

118
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:12,381
Oh my god!

119
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,520
What are you doing?

120
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,753
Hey! Park Sangmin,
what are you doing!

121
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,699
Didn't I warn you not to
drink too much!

122
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,370
I feel like shit.

123
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,910
Now, focus!

124
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,391
Mr. Park.

125
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,663
Huh?

126
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,992
Get a grip on your wife.

127
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,130
Mr. Park!

128
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,837
Ah, yes, Miss Kim!

129
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,242
Isn't this adorable?

130
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:02,950
Mr. Park, what are you doing after school?

131
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:08,154
Well, my grandfather's sick.

132
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:14,405
- You must be the first son.
- I'm the only son.

133
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,169
Your family must have a weak male line.

134
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:25,140
We're all sons except for me.
Isn't it funny?

135
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:27,147
I'm just joking.

136
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,512
Mr. Park...

137
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:32,915
- It's okay.
- A bright smile.

138
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,262
- The kids are watching.
- Let them watch.

139
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,394
What's with the old maid?
She's caught her prey.

140
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,331
The old maid's pathetic.

141
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,868
She made the phys. Ed teacher
transfer to another school.

142
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,068
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

143
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,501
Was it good?

144
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,972
Were you watching?

145
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,577
You seemed to really enjoy
the cosy lunch together.

146
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,421
It was great. Better than
the school store's stale bread.

147
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,682
Jealous?

148
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,653
You're such a loser!

149
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,990
- Hello, sir.
- Uh, yeah.

150
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,637
- Hello, Mr. Park.
- Uh, yeah, hi.

151
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:29,576
- Is there a Lee Jungwoo here?
- Yes, that will be me.

152
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:32,749
- Are you Lee Jungwoo?
- Yes.

153
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:37,482
- So you're Jungwoo...
- Yes, I am Lee Jungwoo.

154
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:42,849
- Jungwoo, was the Kimbap good?
- What?

155
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,931
You look good.
Keep it up!

156
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,604
Shit!

157
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,939
- Having fun?
- Yeah.

158
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,145
Hey, I was getting to the fun part!

159
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,309
They're all naked.
How could you say it's fun?

160
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:45,889
- Don't say that about my hobby!
- You call that a hobby?

161
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:47,715
- Give it to me!
- Forget it!

162
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,486
It's educational. Give it back!

163
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,355
You should be ashamed of yourself!
I'm studying!

164
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,555
Then close the door!

165
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,221
- Stop watching!
- Shut up!

166
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:06,973
- Alright, so give it back.
- No.

167
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,009
- I'm sorry, so give it back.
- You're sorry?

168
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,240
It won't stop you from
watching it again!

169
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,206
Gimme. Okay.

170
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:16,276
Hey! Do as you wish!

171
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,769
Hey! Someone's at the door!

172
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,540
Jeez.

173
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,617
Boeun. Boeun
Miss Kim's at the door!

174
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,160
Miss Kim?

175
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,663
What did you do to make her
come all this way!

176
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,530
I don't know. Hurry and
clean this up. Hurry!

177
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:18,037
Underwear, underwear!

178
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,345
Mr. Park~

179
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,917
- Mr. Park!
- Oh god!

180
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:32,653
- Oh, the door's open~
- Yes...

181
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:36,626
Oh, your place looks cozy.

182
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:42,628
- A woman could just fit in.
- Miss Kim, what brings you here?

183
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,873
Mr. Park, I came to do
your dirty laundry.

184
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:52,245
- Is that your bedroom?
- Miss Kim!

185
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:11,028
- What's that?
- An automatic vacuum cleaner.

186
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:16,504
Auto, it does everything by itself...

187
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:22,172
- Someone's here, Mr. Park.
- No!

188
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,059
It's a ghost, a ghost!

189
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,097
Who was that? Who was it?

190
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:49,671
- It's my sister, she's a bit crazy...
- Crazy? It does seem like it...

191
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,505
Munch is a Norwegian painter.

192
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:58,105
A pioneer of expressionism, whose
paintings were of angst and grief.

193
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,109
- Then there was...
- Mr. Park.

194
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,513
- Huh, what?
- Forget Munch...

195
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,056
Tell us about your first artwork
in the dept. Of romance.

196
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,993
- First artwork...
- Yes!

197
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,594
Let's continue the class!

198
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:17,961
- Your first love!
- Mr... tell us about your first love

199
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:23,369
Okay.
My first love was

200
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:29,469
the only visitor during my
two years of military service.

201
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:37,786
But that person doesn't
know how much I like her.

202
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,354
She still do?

203
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:42,149
It must be Jisoo.

204
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,494
She may or may not know.
Now back to class.

205
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:56,804
How's the internship?

206
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:01,174
I'm so unlucky being stuck
with a boys' high school!

207
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,575
How could you be lucky when
you're not with the girls?

208
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,511
How about you, Sangmin?

209
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:10,382
Everything's great, thanks to you.

210
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:14,849
I felt that you two needed
some time together.

211
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,056
The dude's having ball.

212
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:19,457
He goes to school where
he can meet his pretty wife,

213
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:22,163
and be surrounded by
young high school girls.

214
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,266
How could he get bored there?

215
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,126
I'm bored out of my brains.

216
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,964
Seeing my bossy wife at school
and at home...

217
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:35,769
Dude, you've got nothing but luck.
Take this.

218
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:41,508
What is it?
Military service...

219
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:46,515
It's tomorrow, so don't be late.
And bring coins to play coin games.

220
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:54,027
Your husband's off
to serve his country!

221
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,256
Allegiance!

222
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,993
- No, it's "Victory!"
- Victory!

223
00:19:58,402 --> 00:19:59,869
See you later.

224
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,661
Oh, and don't forget
what I asked you to do.

225
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,070
Have fun.

226
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,906
Thank you.
Morning training's over!

227
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:15,916
Time has passed, but I still
got the form, don't I?

228
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,418
Your beer belly is destroying
the form.

229
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:23,389
- They're lining up.
- It's the lunch ration line!

230
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,453
Morons...

231
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:27,657
Thank you.

232
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,765
Hey, Sangmin, it's noodles...

233
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,095
- Fried tofu noodles?
- Yeah.

234
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,636
Can I have another bowl?

235
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,998
No, it's okay.

236
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,005
You're not eating, right?

237
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,705
Is that Kimbap?

238
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:48,882
- Victory!
- Victory!

239
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,381
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

240
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:08,031
- I'm sorry. I just brought only one.
- Don't worry.

241
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:11,539
It's okay. Is it good, dude?

242
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,300
Don't talk to me. It's delicious.

243
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:16,378
At least you could offer some.

244
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,646
- Want a piece of kimchi?
- Kimchi, kimchi...

245
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,284
Another piece would be nice.

246
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,683
A big piece! Let go!

247
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,152
Aren't you marine Park?

248
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:33,929
Victory...

249
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:36,398
Victory!

250
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,567
Victory!

251
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:42,900
- Invincible!
- Invincible!

252
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,471
- Marines!
- Marines!

253
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:47,009
Once a marine, always a marine.

254
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,941
What do they want?

255
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:51,108
Marines are all like that.

256
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:53,849
- Do something!
- Ah, delicious.

257
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,752
Stop! Don't touch anything!

258
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,350
Invincible... Marines...

259
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,883
Mister, what do you think
you're doing!

260
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:06,587
- Get up!
- This won't take long.

261
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,600
A feisty one, aren't you?
Are you his wife or what?

262
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:15,964
- Yeah, I am his wife!
- Sorry, she's my little sister.

263
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,571
What's there to hide!

264
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:20,801
How dare you push my hubby
around? Apologize!

265
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:24,107
- I'm a marine.
- Now!

266
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,478
- I'm a marine.
- My grandpa's a marine, too!

267
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:29,914
What's your year rank!
What year!

268
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,744
Hey, Boeun...

269
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:36,356
Now, I'm leaving for the sea.

270
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:42,561
Casting a net to catch fish~

271
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:46,635
I am the romantic cat~

272
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,930
Meow~

273
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:58,208
My hot lips wish to touch your soft lips.

274
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:07,789
So my feelings can reach your heart~

275
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:19,092
If you still don't know.

276
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:26,708
More than anyone, I will love you ~

277
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:34,610
- I will love you~
- Forever~

278
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:40,447
- I will love you~
- Like this moment,

279
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:49,862
More than anyone, I will love you ~

280
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:55,268
We can't meet~
The feeling's important~

281
00:23:55,372 --> 00:24:00,901
That's what I think~
I don't want things to be too simple~

282
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:07,077
Even if it may be just this once~
The feeling's important~

283
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,052
That's what I think~
I don't want things to be too fast~

284
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:18,920
I still don't know what love is~
Wait a little longer~

285
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:25,362
If you really love me~
You can wait a little longer~

286
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:31,130
I still don't know what love is~
Wait a little longer~

287
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:37,213
If you really love me~
You can wait a little longer,

288
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:43,314
even if it may be just once~
The feeling's important ~

289
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:49,648
I can't meet you, I can't~

290
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:56,463
Stop it.

291
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,600
Stop.

292
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:05,531
- Tickle, tickle~
- Stop~

293
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,500
- Nice picture.
- Hullo, hullo!

294
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,940
- Who are you people?
- We're hoodlums.

295
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,316
You're her sugar daddy, aren't you?

296
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,246
- Cute.
- Really cute.

297
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,979
You want to die by my hands!

298
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,088
Hey, I'd love to be her sugardaddy.

299
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:23,182
Sangmin, Sangmin, shit!

300
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,759
You're all dead meat.

301
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:30,399
Let go!

302
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,195
Can't you file a paper, right?

303
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,261
How can this high schooler
be your wife?

304
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,468
They all say they'll marry the girl
when they're caught.

305
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,641
It's true.

306
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:45,006
I'm no sugardaddy.
You can check my record then.

307
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:49,582
Mister, it's true. We're married.

308
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,819
You're both fucking with me,
aren't you?

309
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:55,251
What is the world coming to?

310
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:17,907
I'm so pissed. How could you
get beat up like that?

311
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:20,379
How will you live in the real world!

312
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:24,175
How come everyone you meet is a bully?

313
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,818
I really worry about you.

314
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:29,921
- Stop...
- Keep rolling...

315
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,855
How will you go to school
with a face like that?

316
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:36,323
I'm worried about school...

317
00:26:38,134 --> 00:26:42,195
Everything will be okay.
Yeah...

318
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:49,968
Hello.

319
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:01,819
Attention!

320
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:05,860
For this year's school festival,
our class is assigned to decorations.

321
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:07,623
No!

322
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,230
Quiet!

323
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:12,259
Stage decorations will be done by
No. 1 to 15.

324
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:15,960
The stands and stairways,
No. 16 to 21.

325
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,174
The Entrance, No. 23 to 32.

326
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,610
- And No. 22!
- Yes?

327
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:27,916
No. 22 will do the hall wall. Alone!
That's all!

328
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,316
But, Miss Kim!

329
00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:40,429
That's unfair. How will Boeun paint
that huge wall by herself?

330
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:44,893
Right! I told her to do it herself!
So what!

331
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:49,530
With my luck with men,
what was I thinking?

332
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:04,444
You are huge.

333
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:22,168
Have you thought about
what you'll paint?

334
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:24,603
No.

335
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:29,069
What do you mean?
Even if I wanted to help you,

336
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:33,807
I can't, for fear of starting rumors
at school. I'm really worried.

337
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:37,281
I really worry about you, Boeun.

338
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,848
Do you know what I'm thinking?
Do you?

339
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:42,389
- Cut it out.
- Boeun!

340
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:05,242
Shhh!

341
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:08,678
Follow me.

342
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:21,226
Oh my...

343
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:35,475
I must be a lesbian.
I like my friend better than a boy.

344
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,977
If you're a lesbian,
I'm a cheating wife.

345
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:01,731
Hey~
Your husband is so cute.

346
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:04,298
Stop talking about that loser.

347
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:08,070
He keeps staring at you during class.

348
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:11,507
He has a cool side to him.

349
00:30:11,748 --> 00:30:14,842
Cool my ass!

350
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:18,720
Suh Boeun!

351
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,819
I know you're seeing Jungwoo
with romantic feelings,

352
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:29,622
but have you ever thought about
Sangmin's feelings?

353
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:39,237
I really think you like Sangmin.
Am I right?

354
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:46,643
No. Sangmin's just like a big brother.
Since we were little.

355
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,430
- Stop fooling around.
- You're always on my back.

356
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,596
- Hey, sew her mouth, shut.
- Uh?

357
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:29,954
Wow, look at all this food.
The table's barely holding up.

358
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,355
- Eat.
- Thank you for the meal.

359
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,394
Thank you for the meal, mom.

360
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:42,866
Easy. Have you been skipping meals?

361
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:45,474
I've really been busy.

362
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:49,235
I missed your cooking,
it's delicious.

363
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:52,274
You shouldn't say that,
your wife's right here.

364
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,114
You'll hurt Boeun's feelings.

365
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:59,917
Mom, don't worry. I'm undernourished.

366
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,585
When Boeun reaches twenty,
you'll totally forget mom's cooking.

367
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:10,428
Boeun, I've put food in the fridge,
don't forget, okay?

368
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,125
There'll be more when you're
done with it.

369
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:13,392
Yes...

370
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:16,332
Okay, it's late. I'm leaving
after dinner.

371
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,496
Yes.

372
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,108
Mom, it's raining.
Sleep over at your son's place.

373
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:23,273
Yes, mom.

374
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,974
Is it okay?

375
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,416
Sleep over, sleep over.
Eat, mom.

376
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:33,483
Oh, okay.

377
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:35,420
It's your son's place.
What's the big deal!

378
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:41,655
Oh, great. So comfortable.

379
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:47,728
Turn around.
No, not this way, but the other.

380
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,434
Okay.

381
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,003
- Stay in that direction.
- Okay, pest.

382
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:08,285
- Are you asleep, Boeun?
- No...

383
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:12,185
You can't sleep?

384
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:19,430
- Sangmin, I thought about it...
- Yeah...

385
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:23,600
It's not fair to you.

386
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:28,503
Look at me, Sangmin.

387
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,247
What?

388
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:41,489
Did you know?
That you're really cute?

389
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,654
You're pretty yourself.

390
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:50,965
- Sangmin.
- Yeah, Boeun...

391
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:07,842
Boeun...

392
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:11,683
Sangmin, what are you doing?

393
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:14,584
- What do you think?
- Stop!

394
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:16,022
Wait, Boeun.

395
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,956
Uh, stop it!

396
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:40,538
Sleep.

397
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:52,190
Did we paint that much?

398
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:55,195
Let's hurry with this. There's not
much left till the festival.

399
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,021
- Hurry!
- Okay.

400
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:11,502
Hey, wait!

401
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:15,576
Gotcha, gotcha!

402
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:30,789
I see you've been working hard,
but can you finish at this pace?

403
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:32,892
The festival's coming up.

404
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:38,136
Don't worry. We'll be done by then.
Yeah, and it'll look great too.

405
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:44,341
Really? We'll see about that...

406
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:48,247
I've seen enough...

407
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:52,312
Whatever...

408
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:57,556
The hag has appeared.

409
00:35:57,794 --> 00:36:01,730
To find fault in our wall painting.

410
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,661
Miss Kim,

411
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,630
Miss Kim,

412
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,235
with her nasty tone, she will...

413
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:13,237
I hate to admit it,
but we've done a horrible job.

414
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:16,671
- It's okay.
- Really?

415
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:22,746
Let's wash our hands
and grab some snacks.

416
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:26,912
Are you taking care of Sangmin's meals?

417
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:28,884
It's really hard to be an intern you know.

418
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,422
It couldn't be that hard!

419
00:36:31,694 --> 00:36:34,060
Hey, but he's your husband.

420
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,094
Hey, I'm busy myself.
And he'll never skip a meal.

421
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,127
What kind of wife are you?

422
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:44,273
Then you be his wife.
Mrs. Park Sangmin.

423
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,374
Forget it. I don't want it.

424
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,002
- Why the sudden interest!
- Shut up.

425
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,558
Hey, Park Sangmin! Where are you?

426
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,090
Shouldn't you be helping me?

427
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:17,831
I couldn't believe it myself!

428
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,546
- Coke.
- Thanks.

429
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,188
- Good?
- Yeah.

430
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:38,727
- Eat up. We'll be painting until dawn.
- What?

431
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:46,525
Hey, isn't she a babe?

432
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,593
She's the queen of Sunil Girls' middle school.

433
00:37:48,738 --> 00:37:50,365
- Hey, let me see.
- Hey!

434
00:37:50,506 --> 00:37:53,805
I'm going to make a move on her,
so nice shots, please.

435
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,810
Okay.

436
00:37:57,713 --> 00:37:59,772
Just don't get blown off.

437
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:03,544
From this day on, she's
Suh Dongku's woman!

438
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:10,883
Excuse me, but, aren't you
going to Sunil Girls' middle school?

439
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:15,759
Hey! Over there. Isn't that
Dongku's sister?

440
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:18,493
Where? It really is his sister.

441
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:22,002
Her husband looked older than that...

442
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:23,965
Then, who's that?

443
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:26,275
She must've fallen for a younger dude.

444
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,474
Nice.

445
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:45,123
The whole family's fooling around!

446
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:48,559
I got her number.
Did you get a good shot?

447
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:49,960
Here.

448
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:11,542
COME TO THE MONTHLY FAMILY DINNER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

449
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:16,786
Jungwoo, I have to go home.

450
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,385
Already?

451
00:39:28,004 --> 00:39:29,494
Hurry in and sit.

452
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,539
Can't you be more early?

453
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,103
Leave her alone.

454
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,870
It's okay. Let's eat.

455
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,609
The chilli squid was great...

456
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:43,949
Attention, please.
I'll now show you my girlfriend!

457
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,687
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, of course.

458
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:50,087
- Now take a good look.
- That's her?

459
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:54,489
She's better than your sister.

460
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:58,625
- Hey, look... look...
- Who's that? Huh?

461
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,507
Hey, Boeun!

462
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,738
Hey!

463
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:10,402
Boeun!

464
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,241
When you were little,

465
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:50,878
I always pushed you on
this swing here. You really loved it.

466
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:58,217
But one day,

467
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:04,062
you fell off the swing
while I was pushing.

468
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,598
I actually did it on purpose.

469
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:12,302
I'm sorry, Sangmin...

470
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:26,251
Everyone will be worried.
Let's go.

471
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,780
This marriage...

472
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:56,312
it seems like your grandpa
forced you into it,

473
00:41:57,086 --> 00:42:03,082
but in fact we wanted to have
Sangmin as our son-in-law.

474
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,194
Do you remember?
How often you would cry?

475
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:15,735
But whenever Sangmin came,
a smile would spread on your face.

476
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:20,273
You would fall all the time.

477
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:30,846
Scraping and breaking yourself.
Sangmin felt worse than I did.

478
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:38,052
He carried you on his back
all the time, that Sangmin.

479
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,096
Anyway, I envy you.

480
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:50,296
The way he spends more time on your school
festival than his graduation exhibition,

481
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:56,234
I guess he's gone to paint the wall
with Yongju and Youngchul...

482
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:05,473
Sangmin! Sangmin!

483
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:41,665
Sangmin!
I came with the family to see you,

484
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,470
but an emergency at your squad
forces me to turn away.

485
00:45:45,414 --> 00:45:47,405
Are you doing well?

486
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:50,877
A few days ago,
heavy snow came down in Seoul.

487
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:53,179
The Han River is frozen as well...

488
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:57,256
It's colder here, right?
Don't catch cold.

489
00:45:59,328 --> 00:46:01,819
And this is a secret

490
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:06,095
but my mom says that
I've become a woman now.

491
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:08,535
I'm a bit behind than the other girls,

492
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:11,797
but being an idiot that you are,
you won't understand what I mean, will you?

493
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:20,038
It's strange but when you were around,
I hated your guts,

494
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:23,078
but your absence has me missing you.

495
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,552
Are you feeling the same?

496
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:29,114
Then be good to me
from now on. Stupid.

497
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:35,559
The disappointment of not being able to
meet you has your mom crying.

498
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:43,235
Anyway, this letter,
I hope it reaches you.

499
00:47:39,328 --> 00:47:41,558
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

500
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:44,227
The wall's great.

501
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,158
- I... have something to say.
- Yeah, what?

502
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:52,969
I'm sorry. I've been so selfish.

503
00:47:53,976 --> 00:47:56,467
To you and...

504
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,444
What's got into you?

505
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:04,409
I'm breaking up with you.
I'm sorry, Jungwoo.

506
00:48:11,994 --> 00:48:18,331
People laugh and dance
but I hate to laugh~

507
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:27,274
While we drink and search for love,
we forget about the truth~

508
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:31,909
Why are you late?

509
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:33,545
Did you see him?

510
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:36,309
Who? Your husband or boyfriend?

511
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:38,410
I'm not kidding!

512
00:48:38,587 --> 00:48:40,418
There he is.

513
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:44,889
I like the smiling clown~
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah~

514
00:48:45,027 --> 00:48:53,025
I like the clown who embraces sadness~

515
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,577
Aren't they great?

516
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:11,082
Now, intern, Park Sangmin will
share a few words with us.

517
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:25,496
I thank everyone,
the principal, all the teachers...

518
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:35,132
and all the students for helping me
finish this internship in one piece.

519
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:38,408
It may have been a short time,

520
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:40,708
but personally,

521
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:48,121
it has left me with precious memories
I will carry for the rest of my life.

522
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:58,492
Mr. Intern, cut the boring crap
and show us some honestly.

523
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:03,961
Mr. Park Sangmin is a married man.

524
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,032
Didn't you know?

525
00:50:09,211 --> 00:50:12,703
Of course, it's not a sin to be married.

526
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:18,410
But in fact you're married to a
15 year old high school girl, right?

527
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:23,619
To Suh Boeun who's sitting right there...

528
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:36,029
Correct. We are married.

529
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,737
But Boeun had no choice.

530
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:44,310
The only crime she's committed was
granting her sick grandfather's last wish.

531
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,975
It was against her will to marry me.

532
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:57,052
She may be married, but she's still a
15 year old high school girl.

533
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:04,888
She goes crazy over a bowl of
chilli and spaghetti.

534
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:14,740
She loves cute stars and
Kimbap-loving attractive baseball players.

535
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,849
Everyday, she's stressed over exams,
and applying to university.

536
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:34,085
I hope you won't persecute Boeun's
school life over a marriage document.

537
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,457
I beg you all.

538
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:46,797
Sangmin,
I'm not a kid anymore.

539
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,847
Since I was little,
you were always at my side.

540
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:58,880
I was never aware of the
strange feelings... inside...

541
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:04,720
but... I think I'm in love with you...

542
00:52:56,378 --> 00:53:00,178
Our poor Dongku. She's the end of
all your fun and play.

543
00:53:00,282 --> 00:53:01,374
Fun and play...

544
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,180
I knew it since he was fixed on
that school queen or whatever...

545
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,482
I can't believe grandpa fell for
her grandmother.

546
00:53:07,556 --> 00:53:10,047
- I can't believe it...
- She looks bright though.

547
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,227
Just consider it starting early! Do it!

548
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,490
Do it!

549
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:19,191
Oh, shut up and peel the garlic.

550
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:23,635
I'm in no position to say this, but

551
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:27,136
you can hide a lop-sided butt,
but not lop-sized balls.

552
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:29,471
Anyway, congrats.

553
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:31,577
It's good that she doesn't have a clue.

554
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,639
Who would marry a lop-sized ball man
if they knew, right?

555
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:38,746
Right.

556
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:40,785
Oh, you're here!

557
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,823
Oh, dad!

558
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:46,187
You're here.

559
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:50,628
I'm really getting into
peeling these things...

560
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:53,893
Did you get married to peel garlic?

561
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:57,437
Mom!

562
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:01,040
Okay!

563
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:04,804
Say cheese. One, two, three!!
