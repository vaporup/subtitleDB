MY LITTLE BRIDE

11
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,725
Honey~

12
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,533
Hey, you can't kick that...

13
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,803
Jeez.

14
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,543
You haven't changed one bit.

15
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,477
It's you, Boeun.

16
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,611
You're a big girl now. Great body!

17
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,519
Nice curves.

18
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,857
Drop it, okay?

19
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,328
Hey, you little girl!

20
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,728
Hey, give me a break!

21
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,194
They look so nice and shiny...

22
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,366
Stop staring. You'll sprain your eyes.

23
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,141
No, it's just that they look familiar.

24
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,711
Anyway, what brings you here?

25
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,987
Missed me so that
you had to skip school?

26
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,919
No, it's the school's anniversary.

27
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,457
I was forced to come here.

28
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,853
I'm wasting my time
when I really have to study.

29
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,555
Yeah, there's only 2 years left
to the national exam.

30
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,665
But people like you really make
college look undesirable.

31
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,402
What do you mean?

32
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,076
You're a pervert and a playboy.

33
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,405
I may be a playboy,
but not a pervert.

34
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,783
Here's your present.

35
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,944
Just for you, keep it
a secret to the family.

36
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,613
Okay.

37
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,788
Pretty, isn't it?
It's padded. Real thick.

38
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,623
You're a pervert!

39
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,321
Should I help you put it on?

40
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,399
- Should I?
- Want me to punch you?

41
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:27,351
- My son! My son's home!
- How have you been?

42
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,360
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

43
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,364
- How was your trip?
- Fine. How have you been?

44
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,001
- Grandfather's waiting. Hurry.
- Okay.

45
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,695
- Mom, it's heavy. I'll carry it.
- Okay.

46
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,901
You've changed.

47
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,203
What was all the rush?
And is grandpa really sick?

48
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,211
Son, brace yourself, okay?

49
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,754
Delicious, isn't it?

50
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,728
I made it myself,
just for you, grandfather.

51
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,868
Really tasty.

52
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,435
No one but you can take
such good care of me.

53
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,867
Of course, I'm your
only granddaughter.

54
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,171
You've really grown.
Now you look like a lady.

55
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,748
She may have grown,
but she's still a child.

56
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,145
I'd be married in the old days.

57
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,915
Right grandfather?

58
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,150
Absolutely. A married woman.

59
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,787
- Sangmin, come sit here.
- Yes, grandfather.

60
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,929
You two, hear me out.

61
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,436
You may have heard this story
before,

62
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:55,642
Sangmin's grandfather was an
old friend and war comrade

63
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,682
When we were young, we made a pact.

64
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,883
To marry our kids.

65
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,725
But you two had only sons.

66
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:13,292
So, our pact was passed down
to the next generation.

67
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,999
I hope you two can
keep this promise.

68
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,563
What are you saying?

69
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,909
You idiot! Grandpa wants you
to marry Sangmin!

70
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,372
Marriage?

71
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,843
You must be joking grandpa!

72
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,283
Marry Sangmin?

73
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,514
Hey! Your grandpa's not kidding!

74
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,289
I can die peacefully after
you two get married!

75
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,163
This way I can face Sangmin's grandpa.

76
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,597
How can a high schooler get married!

77
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:59,808
Anyone over 15 can marry
with their parent's consent.

78
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,742
I haven't much time left, you know?

79
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,947
No, I won't.

80
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,085
Never!

81
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:18,362
Sorry grandpa but I'll forget
what you just said.

82
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,128
He hasn't finished speaking!

83
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,679
I'm speechless myself.

84
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,321
It's me. I'm back.

85
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:52,325
I'm back in Korea, standing
in front of the dept. Office.

86
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,697
Hey, there's new blood in the dept.

87
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,101
- How are you?
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,803
The chicks are great!
Let's get together after class.

89
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,804
Hey, Sangmin!

90
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,240
What a surprise!

91
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,348
Has it been a year already?

92
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,783
No, family business.

93
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,545
How about you?

94
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,954
Great. My looks...

95
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,596
- keep me too busy...
- Come on...

96
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,064
Come back when I'm the TA.
It'll help when you skip classes.

97
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,599
Would I, a model student, do that?

98
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,101
Besides, it's my last year...

99
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,006
Friend, my good friend!

100
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,910
- How have you been!
- Great dude!

101
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,542
Look at him! Life in the West
has done you well!

102
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,212
What brought you back?
Problems at home?

103
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,792
- Yeah something's up at home...
- Huh? What?

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,785
- I'm getting married... damn.
- Huh? Bastard!

105
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,329
Hey, is it a black or white girl?

106
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,260
Pounding!

107
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,428
Only you should know about it~

108
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,570
I'm just 17~

109
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,607
Come, come silently ~

110
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,146
Here and there~

111
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,183
Hey!

112
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,657
They're making such a fuss.
Losers...

113
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,821
- Shh! They'll hear you.
- Why? You think you're different?

114
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,509
My doctor said I have
20 more years to go!

115
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,947
Really?

116
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,246
Change of plans. I'll make my move.
Just back me up.

117
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,880
I understand.

118
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,322
Good!

119
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,290
They switched it.

120
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,258
Isn't he the guy?

121
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,227
They switched it. Remember?

122
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,895
Yeah...

123
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,208
I really wish they wouldn't play
those things on TV.

124
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,872
I guess the wedding's really on.

125
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,347
What am I going to do, mom?

126
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,028
Be strong, son.

127
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:39,819
Grant your grandpa this one wish.

128
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,912
Let's call it a day!

129
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,748
You're Suh Boeun, 1st grade,
right?

130
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,069
You were so funny, don't you agree?

131
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,232
Hey, what?

132
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,342
Come on!

133
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,080
Who's he?

134
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,080
He's just a guy I know.

135
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,710
That's what they all say.

136
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,114
I'm telling the truth!

137
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,994
I really thought about it,

138
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,832
and I'll speak first.

139
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,805
- Let's just do it.
- Are you crazy?

140
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,569
I'm kidding.

141
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,243
You think I'd want to?

142
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,373
I don't want to do it with you!

143
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,984
Even if I did,

144
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,986
it's insane. I'm just 15!

145
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,717
Okay, I got it.

146
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,887
Anyway, I'll buy you dinner.

147
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,292
Or anything else you need.

148
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,389
Mister, you're a sugardaddy,
aren't you?

149
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,264
- Boeun.
- Huh?

150
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,599
How can you do this to me?

151
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,601
I may be pretty, but

152
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,607
into something like this.

153
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,308
Hey...

154
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,246
Hyewon, stop it!

155
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,998
- I'll leave you two to talk.
- Huh?

156
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,267
See you later, Boeun.

157
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,338
- Remember, it's a secret.
- I know.

158
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,838
- Bye.
- Good bye.

159
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,443
- What's her problem?
- It's understandable.

160
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,043
Hello? Yes...

161
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,048
What!

162
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,796
Good, good.

163
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,733
Grandpa!

164
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,700
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

165
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,866
Grandpa, we're here!

166
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,871
Grandpa, Grandpa!

167
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,843
Grandpa, Grandpa!
Wake up, Grandpa!

168
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,475
- Uncle, something's wrong!
- What?

169
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,643
Grandpa!

170
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,718
It's doing it again.

171
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,015
We should've gone
to another hospital!

172
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,960
It almost gave me a heart attack!

173
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,828
I was out of myself again.

174
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,765
Are you okay, grandpa?

175
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,302
- Let's have a word outside.
- Okay.

176
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,802
Be by your grandpa's side, okay?

177
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah.

178
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,943
I'm really worried.

179
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,855
I know. With the kids like that,
he's getting worse.

180
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,324
Come on... marriage is
out of the question!

181
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:15,357
They... you have to think about
Boeun's future.

182
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:22,303
Come on, let's just marry the kids.

183
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,909
Let go.

184
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,910
Come on...

185
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:34,349
This is Sangmin's grandparents.

186
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:40,823
Soon after this picture was taken,
war broke.

187
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,927
Want me to tell you a secret?

188
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,754
Secretly,

189
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:53,596
your grandpa had feelings
for Sangmin's grandma.

190
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,539
She was quite a beauty.

191
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,242
However, after Sangmin's
grandpa's death,

192
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,206
I tucked those feelings away.

193
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:09,384
That's why I took care of Sangmin's
father like my own son.

194
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,290
Your father may not have been
so happy about this.

195
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,159
- Boeun!
- Yes?

196
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:22,493
Keeping this promise is the most
important thing for me.

197
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,436
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

198
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,442
Grandpa, wake up. Grandpa!

199
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,146
You can't die!

200
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,646
Open your eyes, grandpa!

201
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:43,911
Grandpa, I'll get married
so open your eyes, grandpa!

202
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,492
I'll keep your promise, grandpa!

203
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,026
I'll get married...

204
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,334
Are you crying?

205
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,472
Stop crying.

206
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,073
You may be behind in your grades,

207
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,233
but you're the nation's first
to get married.

208
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,102
Congrats, missus.

209
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,074
Right.

210
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,581
Scared that Sangmin will
discover your lop-sided butt?

211
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,445
A butt that needs cushioning
to keep it on balance?

212
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,750
- Hey, get out!
- Ouch, it hurts!

213
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:29,127
I'm sorry Boeun,
for not being much help.

214
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,127
Mom, am I really getting married?

215
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,034
What about school?

216
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,609
I have to go to college...

217
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,647
Marriage won't change anything.

218
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,045
Marriage, accept it with grace.
It's nothing.

219
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,423
Just consider you're getting
a new brother.

220
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,950
I'm scared that they'll
find out at school.

221
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,858
How will I face everyone?

222
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,990
Don't worry.
Grandpa will take care of it.

223
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,904
Your grandpa was your principal's
military senior.

224
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,769
Really?

225
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:15,006
Behold the face of a wolf who'll
eat up a 15 year old virgin.

226
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:20,411
- Is it satisfaction or disbelief?
- Satisfaction, of course.

227
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,750
Shit, are you really my friends?

228
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,217
I can't be married at this age.

229
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,487
- To Sangmin!
- Cheers~

230
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,820
The chicks here are hot!

231
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,123
Let's go out on the floor!

232
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,240
Hello.

233
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,543
You're here. Thanks.

234
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,151
You're here.

235
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,211
- Sir!!
- Yes, come in. Over here.

236
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,688
I won't forget this.

237
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,293
How could our field trip
be at the same time?

238
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,086
I know.

239
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,687
You shouldn't keep it from
your other friends.

240
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,491
If they found out,
the whole school will know.

241
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,434
Then I'd have to quit school.

242
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,367
Anyway, you're so pretty today.
I wish I could get married too.

243
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,910
Look here!

244
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,478
Hey, smile!

245
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,639
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

246
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,182
- Don't take my picture.
- Okay, okay.

247
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,218
Good luck!

248
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,119
I'm convinced that
grandpa scammed me.

249
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:13,327
- Boeun, it's just a wedding, okay?
- I can't do it, mom!

250
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,625
Now, don't be a baby.

251
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,061
I'm nervous myself.

252
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,997
I'm telling grandpa.
"I can't do it!"

253
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,336
Do you want your wedding
turned into a funeral?

254
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,703
I don't know.

255
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,841
I'm scared, mom.

256
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:37,454
What am I going to do
with such a baby?

257
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,991
Now the groom will enter.
Welcome him with a big applause.

258
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:44,351
The groom, please enter!

259
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,596
She's so beautiful!

260
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,224
Respectable guests,

261
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,027
family and relatives.

262
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,894
We are all gathered here to
congratulate the new beginning of

263
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,194
groom, Park Sangmin

264
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,738
and bride, Suh Boeun...

265
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,636
- Dad, we'll be okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

266
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,346
Remember, she's only 15.

267
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,980
- What's your point?
- I know I can trust you.

268
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,789
You forced me into this marriage,
so I'll do as I wish!

269
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,452
Boeun is still in high school!

270
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,821
I don't care! I'll do as I wish
with my wife.

271
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:33,193
Boeun, don't worry. Your father-in-law
has had a word with Sangmin.

272
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,134
About what?

273
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:40,501
- That you... shouldn't do it...
- What?

274
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,139
I can't say...

275
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,945
- Call us when you get there.
- Yes, auntie.

276
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,784
Stop calling her that.
It's mom from now on.

277
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,049
Yes, mom.

278
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,727
Hey, mom! Can I keep the bouquet?

279
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,454
It was so pretty...

280
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,122
Forget the bouquet...

281
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,361
She's such a child.

282
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,303
What am I going to do with you?

283
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,873
Stop, you promised to be cool.

284
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,977
- Bon voyage~
- Yes, yes...

285
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,073
- Bye~
- Follow right behind, okay?

286
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,216
It's time to board, where is she?

287
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,483
Boeun.

288
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,455
- Boeun? Where is it?
- Over there...

289
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,756
- Okay, we'll go inside, thanks.
- Okay, go.

290
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,563
- Thanks for everything.
- Don't overdo yourself.

291
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,264
- Have a safe trip.
- Yeah, give me the suitcase.

292
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,164
Have fun, Boeun.

293
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,033
Don't worry, dude.
Be good, okay?

294
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,439
- See you later!
- Bye. Bon voyage.

295
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,705
- I've never boarded on time...
- Wait.

296
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,974
- What?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

297
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,412
Again? It's your first time on
a plane, isn't it?

298
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,777
Don't worry. It's only an hour
to Jeju Island.

299
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,320
It won't take long.

300
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,425
You're making such a fuss.
Hurry back.

301
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,223
- I'll be at our seats. Hurry.
- Okay...

302
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,926
Shit. Where is she?

303
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:25,782
- Sir, you must be seated.
- The plane's leaving. Open the...

304
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,283
Sir, please seat yourself!

305
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,184
Mobiles are prohibited in the cabin.
Thank you for your cooperation.

306
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,490
He must think he owns the plane.

307
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,530
It must be his first flight.

308
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,737
I don't believe this.

309
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,047
Wait sir.

310
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,486
- We're in a hurry.
- Sorry.

311
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,596
Hey!

312
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,330
Did they arrive safely?

313
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,599
Yeah... they did.

314
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,245
I need to be clear about one thing.
Listen.

315
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:36,277
Until Boeun graduates from
college, no grandchildren!

316
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,546
Make this clear to your father as well.

317
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,085
Yes, of course.

318
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:53,332
When she was little, she would fall
and break things,

319
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,673
but she seemed to hold herself
well at the wedding.

320
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,068
It's a relief.

321
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,678
Why? Are you disappointed
that she didn't fall?

322
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,073
Yes, a little.

323
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,548
Come on...

324
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,751
Not those idiots again!

325
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,505
Having fun?

326
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,906
Hey!

327
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,492
Hey, do you have a place to stay?

328
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,633
Just this once.

329
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,465
Press anything. Wind it and press.

330
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,534
Say cheese.

331
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,699
Take your best shot.

332
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,938
Uh, Sangmin?

333
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,004
I can't believe this!

334
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,119
What brings you here?

335
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,592
Boeun's on her honeymoon
and we're on our fieldtrip.

336
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,787
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I do.

337
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,496
- Where's Boeun?
- Well...

338
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,996
- Hey! Who's the mister?
- He's just a friend.

339
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,761
- He's cute.
- See you later!

340
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,429
- Hey, stop it. Wait, come here.
- Oh god...

341
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,664
Hey!

342
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,010
What are you doing on top of her!

343
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,911
You pervert! You chase after young
girls, don't you!

344
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,549
It's not like that.

345
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,344
- I'm not...
- Really.

346
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,419
- Really?
- Really.

347
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,551
Then what are you doing?

348
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,884
- Uh?
- Huh?

349
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,118
Look at him running off!

350
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,404
Aren't you supposed to be
on your field trip?

351
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,279
Yes...

352
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,523
Then why are you here?

353
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,968
What are you doing today?

354
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,138
Nothing.

355
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,339
Do you have a boyfriend?

356
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,371
No... I don't.

357
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:15,899
The mobile you have reached is off.
You will be transferred to a voice mail...

358
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,800
Pest, how can you do this to me...

359
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:26,173
Our parents shouldn't find out.
We'll talk later. Bye.

360
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,925
Then, from now on we're dating.

361
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,258
Okay!

362
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,763
Hey you! Come here!

363
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,780
Wow! Looks so fun! Isn't it?

364
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,324
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Canada.

365
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,459
Canada? I know Canada!

366
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,889
Who am I kidding?
I've never set foot on Canada.

367
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,924
Teacher!

368
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,464
Teacher!

369
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,302
Hi, how are you?

370
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,734
Uh, Hyewon?

371
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,975
What brings you here at this hour?

372
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,476
It's individual time.

373
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,745
Haven't you ever been on a field trip?

374
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,378
Of course I have.

375
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,157
Anyway, where's Boeun?
Why're you alone?

376
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,030
I don't even know where to begin?
It's like this...

377
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,393
Yes.

378
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,292
Boeun...

379
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,296
You're a serial pervert, aren't you!

380
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,344
Hey! Come back!

381
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,139
Feels good, doesn't it?

382
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,481
It's been a while... together.
Sit here.

383
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,882
Stop.

384
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,890
Rest your back on this.

385
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,917
I feel great.

386
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,996
It's too late for this

387
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,931
but I'm sure that we did
a horrible thing to Boeun.

388
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,941
She's only 15, and going through
her 1st year of high school.

389
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,903
Come on! Be more positive.

390
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:46,613
You were considering him as
your son-in-law anyway.

391
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,415
She's not going far away.
Let's have some faith, okay?

392
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:55,185
Besides, our in-laws love Boeun
like their own daughter.

393
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,188
But, she's not their own daughter.

394
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,424
I can understand dad and you,

395
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,623
but I still can't forgive you for it.

396
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,429
Okay, okay, that's enough... enough...

397
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:11,001
Without Boeun, it seems like
there's a big hole in my heart.

398
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,556
Everyone looks like Boeun,
that one too...

399
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,762
Candy, sir? Thank you.

400
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,132
Candy, sir?

401
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,359
Boeun, help him.

402
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:46,228
Honey, honey, here.

403
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,804
Thank you very much.

404
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,304
- Grandpa!
- Dad, come on out.

405
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,648
- Sit, sit and eat.
- Okay.

406
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,314
So, how was your trip?

407
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,748
Good grandpa. We had a good time.

408
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:13,020
Yes, Sangmin was kind to me.
I really had fun.

409
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,232
Stop, I didn't do anything.

410
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,560
I'm glad you had fun.

411
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,371
Since you're officially married,

412
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,099
love one another
so we can see the fruit of your love.

413
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,780
But you don't look so happy, Sangmin.

414
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,877
Are you sick?

415
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,046
Of course I'm not sick.

416
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,879
They're definitely a great couple,
aren't they?

417
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,052
Your room's been cleaned,
go get some rest.

418
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,184
Yes sir.

419
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,661
Stop, we should have a drink
with the new groom.

420
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:48,890
How about it dad?

421
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,194
Right. My grandson-in-law
should pour me a drink.

422
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,933
As you wish.

423
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,649
Grandpa, I'll go to bed now.

424
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,652
Yeah, yeah.
Go to your room...

425
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,051
Careful!

426
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,260
Honey!

427
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,456
Let's go!

428
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,558
- Hey! Boeun's not a thing.
- Good night!

429
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,702
Hey! Be careful.

430
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:30,306
Hey! Hey!

431
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,236
- Have a good night.
- Good night!

432
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,037
Honey!

433
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,251
Ah, you're heavy!

434
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,351
You stink of liquor!

435
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,964
Hey! Hey!

436
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:06,975
- You're tearing my dress. Stop it!
- Keep still!

437
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,076
He's coming on real strong.

438
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,713
This is the right place.
Come in. Look at this tree.

439
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,284
Come in dad.
Close the door behind you.

440
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,358
What do you think? Huh? Okay?

441
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,989
Look at this, great huh?

442
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,392
It's a great place.

443
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,825
Great place Boeun.

444
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,960
- You put up that picture.
- Nice, isn't it? Great huh?

445
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,040
Look at the balcony. I chose this.

446
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,302
Boeun.

447
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,541
It's so clean.

448
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,440
Hey, look at this picture.
This picture.

449
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,281
Where should I put this picture?

450
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,142
You're having the time of your life,
aren't you?

451
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,551
- What's this, Arabian Nights?
- Goodness!

452
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,290
- What's with the pillows...
- Goodness...

453
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,887
Separate rooms until you graduate,
okay?

454
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,954
I am so pissed!

455
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,233
I like it...

456
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,370
What's this, a flower garden?

457
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,676
What am I going to do?

458
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,254
Stop it!

459
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,450
Language is part of culture...

460
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,660
Language is... a part of... culture...

461
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:40,662
When we learn of foreign language
We should also learn about

462
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,633
that country's culture...

463
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,881
Ah, great!

464
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,146
Hey, stop! Put something on!

465
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,580
I always take everything off.
Even my underwear.

466
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,456
Get out!

467
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,830
Out where?

468
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,227
This is my room.

469
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,395
What do you mean?

470
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,608
This is my room.
Yours is over there.

471
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,902
Get out!

472
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,881
I don't feel like it.

473
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,142
Let's sleep together.

474
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:33,346
What, you're crazy!

475
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,495
You sleep together
when you get married.

476
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,130
Boeun...

477
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,893
What?

478
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,303
- I think tonight is the night.
- What?

479
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,664
Listen to me.

480
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,172
Stay away from me.

481
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:55,041
Come on. We're married. Boeun,
do as I say!

482
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,871
Hey, stop it!

483
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,914
We're married! Do as I say
and stay still.

484
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,829
Shit... I was just playing with you!

485
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,167
Oh my god!

486
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,877
Good morning, Boeun.

487
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,177
Your eyes are quite a sight!

488
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,649
Morning exercise?

489
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,837
What? You disappeared from the airport?

490
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,871
Then what did you do
during your honeymoon?

491
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,844
Who, me?

492
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,944
Can you keep a secret?

493
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,781
You have too many secrets.

494
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,882
I'm dating Jungwoo.

495
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,988
Jungwoo? What about your husband?

496
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,822
Husband... are you kidding?
I was forced into it.

497
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,661
Then does Jungwoo know
you're married?

498
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:27,303
No. But I'm sure he'll understand.

499
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,103
Let's go.

500
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,549
If I call her, she'll
be here in an instant.

501
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,047
She'll come if you call her now?

502
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:52,894
Of course. "Yes master"
and she'll come.

503
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:57,329
You're such a liar.

504
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,100
Stop, she'll be studying anyway.

505
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,604
- Wait. I'll show you.
- Dude, that's impolite.

506
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,935
- Tell her to come.
- Wait.

507
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,512
Wife! It's me!

508
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,675
Your husband commands you to come!

509
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,115
Wow.

510
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,278
- Hurry!
- Wow.

511
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,014
- Hurry!!
- Wow.

512
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,317
Bye!

513
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,754
Now she'll fly here like a bullet.

514
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,887
Guys... let's drink!

515
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,061
I'm Sangmin. I'm a man, ain't I?

516
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,565
Of course you're a man.

517
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:39,574
I'm just teaching my wife a lesson.
Like a real man.

518
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,102
A man of all men.
A real man. Have a drink, men!

519
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,306
Men!!
Men, drink up!

520
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,747
Drink till we drop!

521
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,819
There'll be an inspection today.
Go home and study.

522
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,354
Wife!

523
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,283
She's my wife. Come here wife!

524
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,924
- We're married!
- Not today.

525
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,656
He's really her husband.

526
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:04,223
Welcome, Boeun.

527
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,100
You saw her at the wedding.
My wife, Boeun.

528
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,268
How could you call me over
to a place...

529
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,508
like this.

530
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,402
Your husband says okay.

531
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,612
Another beer please!

532
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,618
Don't. Would you like a soda?

533
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,145
Yes...

534
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,877
A soda over here.

535
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,519
You're so adorable.

536
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,325
Thank you.

537
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,894
Of course! My wife's adorable.

538
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,891
She's a horrible cook,
with a bad temper.

539
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,059
And a bad student.

540
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,228
- She also snores.
- Sangmin! You're drunk.

541
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,932
- Stop drinking, okay?
- No.

542
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,134
I am jealous. I have no one
to worry about me.

543
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,474
- Wow, I feel great. Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up, bottoms up!

544
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:54,540
I never introduced myself.
I'm Sangmin's senior, Han Jisoo.

545
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,377
I'm Suh Boeun.

546
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,819
Boing, boing, Boeun.

547
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,084
She goes boing boing
every morning!

548
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,788
Jisoo, know what she did to me
on our honeymoon?

549
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,195
Hey, Park Sangmin!
Get off your butt!

550
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,668
Pretty please...

551
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,475
I'll see you again, Jisoo.

552
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,876
Yes. I'm sure we'll be good friends.

553
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,540
Treat me like a little sister.

554
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,412
But you're my senior in life
since you're married.

555
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,553
Stop joking.

556
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,557
Stop joking, stop joking.

557
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:39,587
You know, you two are
made for each other.

558
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,291
We were always at each other's
throats when we were little.

559
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,058
Hitting and teasing each other.

560
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,338
He's the first boy to flip my skirt.

561
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,836
Funny. Boys are mean to
girls they really like.

562
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,543
Jisoo, Jisoo, kiss me.

563
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:19,695
At least you could've fixed me
something for my hangover.

564
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,567
You deserve it.

565
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,700
Besides, I'm still in high school.

566
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,133
You always use that line
when you're cornered.

567
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,710
High school is not a crown, you know.

568
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,007
It is too, so there!

569
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:38,352
Okay, then I'll show you
my cooking talents tonight!

570
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,602
- Hey, Suh Boeun!
- What?

571
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,897
- Let's go.
- Come.

572
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,566
You wanna get smacked? Come!

573
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,777
What do you want?

574
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,578
I heard you were telling everyone
you were Jungwoo's girl?

575
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,619
Fucking unbelievable!

576
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,785
She's boasting that
she's slept with Jungwoo.

577
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:22,231
The bitch thinks we're shit.
How dare you, bitch.

578
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,798
Listen up. Watch your mouth.

579
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,301
If I hear about this again,
you're dead meat!

580
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,041
Jungwoo and I are in love!

581
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,772
Have you lost your senses!

582
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,341
Hey! Didn't you get the message?

583
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,678
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm leaving!

584
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,492
Hey! How dare you...
Lose your attitude!

585
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,726
What are you doing!

586
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,875
Fuck off.

587
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,672
What?

588
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,005
Hey, Lee Jungwoo,
you can't treat me like that!

589
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,050
You're in no position to say
that to me.

590
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,519
Listen up. It's true that Boeun
and I are dating.

591
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,800
Don't mind them.
They think they're princesses.

592
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,335
But you're the real princess.

593
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,452
Sesame oil, sugar!

594
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,689
- A small bottle of oil?
- Yeah!

595
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,265
- This sugar?
- Hurry, hurry.

596
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,625
Okay!

597
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,234
Vinegar, spaghetti, ketchup!

598
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,330
There's the vinegar...

599
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,605
And there's the spaghetti!

600
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,638
Here?

601
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,179
Here, the ketchup's here. Okay...

602
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,977
Hurry, hurry!

603
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,447
- Olive oil, pickles!
- Olive oil, pickles!

604
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,851
Boeun!

605
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,488
Are you okay, Boeun?

606
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,464
Boeun, Boeun, Are you okay?

607
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,969
Are you okay?

608
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,234
Ow, my leg!

609
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:45,569
It hurts?

610
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:56,418
- Does it hurt bad?
- No. Why? Get off?

611
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,321
Stay put before I change my mind.

612
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,326
Don't touch me there!

613
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,400
I'm not doing it on purpose.
Why should I?

614
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,826
My hand just went there naturally.

615
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,571
What a great excuse!
Now walk straight.

616
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,502
You slant to the right cause
your butt is lop-sided.

617
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,470
Don't start with me.

618
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,142
I'm not kidding.

619
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,076
Your right butt has grown bigger.

620
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,516
Hey, stop it!

621
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,951
Stop it! Hey, stop it!

622
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,988
Lop-sided butt~
lop-sided butt~

623
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,717
- Stop it, stop it!
- Okay, okay!

624
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,586
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Shut up...

625
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,597
Boeun has a lop-sided butt!

626
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,757
Lop-sided butt~

627
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,266
Look at how you're cutting.

628
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,169
You should put your heart into
what you're cooking.

629
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,135
Just be quiet!

630
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,333
- Be quiet? I'm older than you...
- Stop it!

631
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,809
Stop what? I'm older...
Hey... You little...

632
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,408
- What?
- Take my sword.

633
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,211
- Pest... aim at what you can take.
- Hey, come here.

634
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,478
What are you going to do with that?

635
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:10,753
- Hey, stop it... it's hot. Hot! Hey...
- Hey...

636
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,885
Hey... that's not fair!

637
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,826
Ouch!

638
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,499
- It's delicious.
- Yeah.

639
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,808
You got something on your mouth.

640
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,012
The same with you.

641
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,712
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

642
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,550
Yes!

643
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,143
Make sure everything's spotless.
It's more important than cooking.

644
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,120
Give me a break!

645
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,152
Hey, is it this side?

646
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:49,298
Hey! You pervert!
If I were you, I would help!

647
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,974
This picture's great.
I look so handsome.

648
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,618
Gotcha!

649
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:26,430
Sangmin... Don't come near!

650
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,606
Stop it!

651
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,803
Don't come near!
Stop it, stop...

652
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:38,280
- Now, I'm taking everything off!
- Stop!

653
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,187
- Thanks, the Kimbap's delicious.
- Really?

654
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:52,461
The baseball field's empty.
Aren't people coming to watch the game?

655
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,760
No one comes to watch
high school baseball anymore.

656
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,829
It's pro-baseball or the major league
they go to.

657
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,167
I hope you'll play in the major league
some day.

658
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,901
Hey, Lee Jungwoo!

659
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,306
Good luck!

660
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,881
I'm starved.

661
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:32,968
Double crust seafood...

662
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,673
This is pretty good.

663
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,516
Lee Jungwoo, hurrah~

664
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:54,283
Give us a break.
Great pitching and now good batting?

665
00:54:55,792 --> 00:55:00,388
She's quite a chick.
Why don't you share? Shit.

666
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,064
Yes, that player's Lee Jungwoo.
An upcoming star in high school baseball!

667
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,532
Huh? It's Boeun's high school.

668
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,899
Was I too generous?
That's doesn't look good...

669
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,103
Youngsters with raging hormones.
Something to do without.

670
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,807
But, I guess they'll
grow out of it.

671
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:27,117
One cute student is quite
passionate about a player.

672
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,216
- Ah, it's the Kimbap girl.
- Excuse me?

673
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,524
They were sharing a Kimbap lunch
before the game. Nice picture.

674
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,098
I see.

675
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,818
Can't you be more early?

676
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,520
- Were you still up?
- I've been waiting for you.

677
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,916
It gets dangerous at night. Go to bed.

678
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,253
Okay.

679
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,349
- Sleep.
- Go to sleep.

680
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,985
- Yeah.
- Night.

681
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,986
- What's wrong?
- Don't you know?

682
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,725
What?

683
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:46,098
The whole school knows about
you and Jungwoo.

684
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,175
- What's wrong with that?
- Do you think it's right?

685
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,839
You're married.

686
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,776
Just by law!
You know how things are!

687
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:07,486
What if Sangmin's and your parents
found out? How can you be so selfish?

688
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,736
Why are you crying?

689
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,134
I like Jungwoo too!

690
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,824
There you are. We're having a
meeting at our place tonight.

691
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,054
I know.

692
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:52,031
You look great. Your hubby
must be treating you well.

693
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,167
- Hey!
- Yes?

694
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,238
- You live in apt. 106, right?
- Yes

695
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,768
There's an important meeting tonight,
so tell your mom to come, okay?
