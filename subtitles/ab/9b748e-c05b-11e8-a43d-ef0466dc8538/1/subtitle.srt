1
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:39,017
Let me introduce you.
My assistant, Lakeisha.

2
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:41,581
How are you?

3
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,045
You speak Mandarin? Great!

4
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,082
She only speaks a little.

5
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:50,002
Let's go.

6
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,009
I am so happy!

7
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,587
Let's get out of here!

8
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:46,011
Miki, get up here!

9
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They're coming after us!

10
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:03,518
Hurry!

11
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:13,505
They're directly behind us!

12
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:22,005
Hold it!

13
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,591
Jackie, help me!

14
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:52,017
Forget the luggage.
At least we're safe.

15
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,068
You are shaking.

16
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,595
I thought we were going to die.

17
00:38:58,062 --> 00:39:01,011
What have you done to them?

18
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:04,076
I didn't do anything!
Really nothing!

19
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:06,045
She didn't mean it.

20
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:34,054
Does this happen often here?

21
00:40:34,088 --> 00:40:36,032
Only today!

22
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:38,055
Now wait a minute!

23
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:41,068
I promise we won't see her again!

24
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:27,000
That's the way out?

25
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,033
Yes!

26
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:31,054
Don't be scared!

27
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:29,028
Are you alright?

28
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:16,520
Miki, are you ok?

29
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:52,055
What have I done to deserve this?

30
00:46:58,077 --> 00:47:01,000
I should cheer up for Jackie.

31
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,069
What are you doing?

32
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:26,025
Washing dishes.

33
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:28,079
I need to buy something.

34
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,019
Now?

35
00:47:32,097 --> 00:47:36,060
It's been all crazy since I arrived.

36
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:39,087
I need at least some underwear.

37
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:44,000
Sorry, but all shops are closed now.

38
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:02,000
She said...

39
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,033
I know!
That mine are small!

40
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,031
No, she said she has clothes that fit your size.

41
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:14,040
I heard the word "small"!

42
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:18,098
My English is poor but I understand the word "small".

43
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:20,074
Hers are not very big either.

44
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:26,085
She did use the word small,
but not referring to yours!

45
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:06,022
It's allright now.
Sorry for all the trouble.

46
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,003
Forgive me.

47
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:14,016
It was really an unforgettable day.

48
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:17,036
Let's have some fun tomorrow.

49
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,023
Thanks,
but I've had enough "fun" today.

50
00:49:25,038 --> 00:49:29,001
I came here for one thing.

51
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:30,591
I know.

52
00:49:31,062 --> 00:49:32,025
Really?

53
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:34,066
Yes.
The clothes here are beautiful.

54
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,065
What?

55
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:37,032
Aren't you here to buy clothes?

56
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,042
Shut up!

57
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:26,599
Jackie, help me!

58
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:29,585
Jackie, help me!

59
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,533
Jackie, get out!
