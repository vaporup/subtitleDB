1
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:07,649
( clock ticking )

2
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:31,138
Male TV announcer:
lt was a very short putt.

3
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:34,636
lt would seem routine had he not
just come off a bogey the hole before.

4
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,082
Mm-hmm, obviously
smarting from that.

5
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:41,212
- But let's see what he does here.
- ( ball rattles into hole )

6
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:44,280
Oh perfect.
Textbook, textbook.

7
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:47,487
We move ahead now to Lee Trevino
on the fairway at the seventh.

8
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:51,054
His lie looks as though
he may be in a little divot.

9
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,693
Absolutely. Tournament officials
have been cracking down

10
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,703
on caddies filling in the divots.

11
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:59,900
At this level of the game, some of us
gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,000
( insect buzzing )

13
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:17,152
Just go to sleep.

14
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,461
( insect buzzing )

15
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,079
TV announcer:
A lovely approach.

16
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,383
He's considering it now.
l presume that a player like...

17
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:50,549
( buzzing continues )

18
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,864
( buzz echoing )

19
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,674
TV announcer: Sand wedge
or intermediate pitching wedge.

20
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,276
Oh, very exciting.
He's lining up the shot.

21
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,455
Look at me.

22
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,726
Hmm?

23
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:33,426
l'm not standing for this.

24
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,435
Sorry?

25
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,565
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

26
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,033
l'm leaving.

27
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,190
Jack?

28
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,622
- Jack.
- lf you leave me, l'll throw her.

29
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,759
( bee buzzing )

30
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,134
You think that l won't, hmm?

31
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:14,502
- Please.
- Do you think l won't?!

32
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,968
l won't leave.
l won't leave you.

33
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,725
( buzzing stops )

34
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:37,095
l'm sorry.
Don't ever do that again.

35
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,724
Don't ever leave me.
Don't ever do that again.

36
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:58,314
¶ All things bright and beautiful ¶

37
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:02,685
¶ All creatures great and small ¶

38
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,715
¶ All things wise and wonderful ¶

39
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,663
¶ The Lord God made them all. ¶

40
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,723
l invite you to be seated at this time.

41
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:21,164
( applause on TV )

42
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,505
TV announcer #1 :
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

43
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,977
So maybe he can make a par.
And at worse from there

44
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,775
you'd think he could stay
his point total.

45
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:30,544
Now here we find him
with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

46
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,453
Announcer #2:
l don't know if there was a problem

47
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,550
with him slippin' with his right foot
there, but definitely a pull.

48
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,425
Announcer #1 :
He obviously had the thought in his head

49
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,293
that he needed
to give it a little bit extra,

50
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,731
and he's found himself
in a difficult spot.

51
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,997
Announcer #2: All the expectations
he had coming into this...

52
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:52,129
( ringing )

53
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,106
- Hello?
- Woman: Jack.

54
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,111
Betsy.

55
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,912
Your brother slipped away.

56
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,011
Oh oh,

57
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,646
finally out of his misery.

58
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,021
- Betsy: Yes, he is.
- Oh, l know, l know.

59
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,323
And how many times did l hear, ''Why
can't you be like your brother Bobby''?

60
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:18,729
lf l had a nickel for every time
that was said to me...

61
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,930
l'd be a rich man today.

62
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:26,461
That scar on his forehead that he had,

63
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,532
he always had a story for it,

64
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,012
but it was me. l threw a hammer
at Mr. Perfect when l was eight.

65
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:34,946
( crowd murmuring )

66
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,381
He never told though.
He covered for the people he loved.

67
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,853
That's how he was
and l loved him for that.

68
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,447
And l wanted to be like him.

69
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,253
Everything--

70
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,564
l just want to say that...

71
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:05,339
if it wasn't for Bobby, l'd...

72
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:10,310
l-l don't know...

73
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,682
where l would've wound up.

74
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,381
He taught me how to live,
what was right.

75
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,487
l'm gonna miss him.

76
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,930
He lived right. He lived right.
He was...

77
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:30,732
what more could you s--
want people to say about you?

78
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,567
( bird squawking )

79
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,974
Woman on radio: All throughout Scripture
it talks about God being a just God.

80
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,970
l mean, l just read the parable
about the unjust judge,

81
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:46,042
where the woman kept coming
and coming and saying...

82
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,418
Man #1 on radio:
Caring, loving, forgiving...

83
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:51,219
Man #2: l'm wondering if you concur
with what you've heard so far?

84
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,283
Man #3: l think that the choices,
the idea of free will,

85
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,352
and the fact that
we have freedom of choice...

86
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,762
( overlapping dialogue on radio )

87
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,438
Male radio host #1 :
The reality of the times we live in,

88
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:16,040
this notion that-- this angst that a lot
of people are feeling in this country,

89
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:19,483
that we've gone through some sort
of fundamental transformation...

90
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,113
Male radio host #2:
...Barack Obama earlier today, crediting

91
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:26,922
his so-called stimulus package
that he signed four or five months ago,

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,123
as ''putting cash
into the pockets of taxpayers.''

93
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:33,291
lf you're a taxpayer
in the Detroit area

94
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,858
who got cash in your pocket
from the stimulus plan,

95
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,268
l'd love to hear from ya, and you
can also check in via the internet,

96
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,295
but we would love
to hear from you personally.

97
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,900
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

98
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,239
Welcome.

99
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,246
Hi, Paul.

100
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,223
Thanks.

101
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,568
( people chattering )

102
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:36,462
No, it's true.

103
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,397
With God is my witness, l've changed.

104
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,662
With Jesus and my family...
( voice echoing )

105
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:48,307
( voices overlapping, echoing )

106
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,149
Oh my God,
l'm sorry for what l've done.

107
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:10,219
l mean, l robbed a goddamn
liquor store with a toy gun.

108
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:13,391
What kinda--
what kinda idiot does that?

109
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,560
( voices echoing )

110
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,058
Warden wants to see you.

111
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:45,724
Hi, Allie.

112
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:50,163
- Hi, Mitch. Janice.
- Jack.

113
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,467
- What's up?
- Shut the door, Jack.

114
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,407
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

115
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,446
- This is yours? Your report, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Why?

116
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,151
lt's an incompetent mess, Jack.

117
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,092
l mean, look, l know your head's
already out on the golf course,

118
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:18,359
but this is a travesty
of proper casework here.

119
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:26,895
( snickers )

120
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,568
- l got ya.
- You got me.

121
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:33,636
Here. Learn from the master
of understatement.

122
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
- Absolutely.
- Keep 'em brief.

123
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:40,150
Now l need to get Janice up to speed
before you're out the back door,

124
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,678
so let's pass all your
indeterminates eligible off to her.

125
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,056
Yeah yeah, of course,
but l'd like to stay on my currents,

126
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:50,187
if l can see them through
to review-- is that okay?

127
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,065
Yeah, if you're willing.

128
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,692
- l would like to. Thank you.
- Yeah.

129
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,135
- We're good.
- Janice: Okay.

130
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,533
Oh, hey, l'm sorry.

131
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,269
Excuse me?

132
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,709
Your brother--
l just recently heard, l'm sorry.

133
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,474
Thank you.

134
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,450
- Okay.
- Yeah.

135
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,649
( blower whirring )

136
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:27,656
( phone ringing )

137
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,386
S-- Stone.

138
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,445
Hmm?

139
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,389
No, l-l'm Stone.

140
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:54,552
l mean, l know it say
''Gerald'' in the file,

141
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:58,621
but l'm just saying l prefer Stone.

142
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,690
Gerald Creeson.
So what's Stone, like a nickname?

143
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,565
That's something from here?

144
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,434
No. Oh no, man.
Fuck all these assholes.

145
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,770
Yo, that's what my people call me.
You know, people who know me.

146
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,409
Look, are we just gonna, like-- are you
just gonna tick the boxes and shit?

147
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,973
l mean, can we-- can we talk straight?

148
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:21,248
l mean, you gonna help me out or what?
'Cause l, you know, l don't think

149
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,585
- l deserve to be up in here no more.
- Let's just slow down. Slow slow down.

150
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,023
l've done a long bid, man.
Three more years ain't gonna--

151
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,085
Slow down. Let's-let's talk
about what got you here.

152
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,062
- You want to tell me about that?
- lt's right there in front of you.

153
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,657
- Why you want to talk about that again?
- 'Cause now you're mine.

154
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,599
You moved up.

155
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,762
And just 'cause l like to chat.

156
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,830
All these scrubs in here, you know,
these short-timers and meatballs,

157
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,205
they're like,
they're all innocent, right?

158
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:46,006
Yeah. But at least l admit it.

159
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,013
You know, l copped
to what l did right away,

160
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,481
and-and now
l'm lookin' forward, man.

161
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,609
l got a job lined up
and l'm sayin',

162
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,849
why l got to talk about that shit
every fuckin' time?

163
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,753
'Cause l want to hear
your side of it, that's why.

164
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,781
You know what? Just fuck this shit.
Fuck you too.

165
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,192
- l ain't got time for this bullshit.
- Hey, son--

166
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,719
No, you're just settin' them up
so they can flop me, man.

167
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:06,994
So you write what you're gonna write
and let's just get on with it, man.

168
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,058
- 'Cause l'll take the flop.
- Hey, son. Stone.

169
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,592
- Go ahead, max me, max me.
- Son, calm down.

170
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:12,695
You don't think l'll do it,
l'll see that max standing

171
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,000
- on my fucking head, man.
- Stone!

172
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,769
l'll see you outside
before you see me, bitch.

173
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:18,402
Stone! ln about
two fucking seconds you're gonna

174
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:21,880
go in the hole, and your file is
gonna go to the bottom of my pile.

175
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,815
You understand?
You see that door in front of you?

176
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,251
You know where it goes-- back.

177
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,345
You want to go back?
Be my guest.

178
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,982
You want to go forward,
you want to walk out of here,

179
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,515
you want to find that door?
Me, l'm that door.

180
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,654
And you will go through me. lf l ask
you a question about the weather,

181
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,757
you better fucking answer it or go back
and l'll see you in three years.

182
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,324
- You got it?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,928
- Then sit the fuck down.
- All right.

184
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,608
Well, we just shootin' the shit.

185
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,374
( Stone chuckles )

186
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,678
l like her, man. She's hard.

187
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,623
Okay. All right, look,

188
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,024
look, this is a process.

189
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,187
We talk.

190
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,891
We're not friends,
but just pretend we're friends, okay?

191
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,162
Relax, just-just talk, that's all,

192
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,863
and then maybe we both get
what we want, okay?

193
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:21,340
- Okay, let's pretend.
- Okay.

194
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:23,171
You're married.

195
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,370
Yeah.

196
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:27,140
Okay, that's good.

197
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,704
How long are you married?

198
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:31,911
Nine years, man--
eight of it up in this shit.

199
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,681
lt's right in the file, man.
l don't want--

200
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,647
Let's talk about your wife.

201
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,091
- Lucetta?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

202
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,118
- Has she come up here? You seen her?
- No.

203
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,960
- She's a dime, dawg.
- What's a dime?

204
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,125
Perfect 10, man. She's fine.

205
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,694
l'll tell you, between you and me,

206
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,705
she's-she's a alien.

207
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,570
Alien? What do you mean,
like an illegal?

208
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,406
No, she ain't illegal, man.
She's whiter than you.

209
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,639
No, she's like-- she's like a--

210
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,080
she's an alien
from another world, man.

211
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:10,177
She visit you much?
Picnics most Saturdays?

212
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,454
l don't want no picnic, man.
l miss my dick in her fuckin' ass.

213
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:15,892
You know, l miss her suckin' me
till l can't take no more.

214
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:18,829
l mean, she's crazy.
She'll do anything.

215
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,061
Fuck her tits, come in her face, she'll
just blink and keep on laughing, man.

216
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,659
lt's-- she--

217
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:26,069
look, if we gonna talk about Lucetta,
you better watch out,

218
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,936
'cause l'm gonna give you
some pictures in your head

219
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,908
gonna keep you up nights, man.

220
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,471
Oh man.

221
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:39,746
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l-l got a mouth, l know.

222
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:42,913
l apologize, man.
You're givin' me that look,

223
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:46,823
and l feel like you go down here
and that's the end of this shit.

224
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,918
Look, l don't want no beef with you.

225
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:50,986
l just want to be vegetarian.

226
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,123
( chair creaks )

227
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,637
ls that your wife?
You're married?

228
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:02,673
Yeah.

229
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,676
- A long time?
- 43 years.

230
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,008
Get the fuck out.

231
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,640
Man, that's true love, huh?

232
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,617
That's great, and after 43 years
and you still get it on and everything?

233
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:16,144
- Excuse me?
- No, l'm really curious about this.

234
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,156
lt's like, say, l love my lady, right,

235
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,715
but, you know, l wonder sometimes,

236
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,389
like how you gonna do
when the skin starts to go to the crepe,

237
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,922
you know what l'm sayin'? l mean,
what do-- how does that work for you?

238
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,733
Like you get hip to Viagra,
so you can like hammer nails with it?

239
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:36,003
Listen listen, look, l don't talk
with anybody about my wife like that.

240
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,011
l ain't talkin' about your wife.
l'm sayin', for me,

241
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,979
you know,
l've been locked up a long time.

242
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,880
You don't need much more than two
pumps and a swirl to get it done.

243
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,440
l don't consider this polite conversation.

244
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:49,420
l ain't tryin' to be rude, okay?
l really want to know

245
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,582
where does that go?

246
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:54,218
Or where do you put it, if you--

247
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,057
you get what l'm sayin'?

248
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,620
l want to know
how it works for you,

249
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:00,393
how you keep a lid on that.

250
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,732
We're not--
we're not talking about me.

251
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,567
We're not talking about me, okay?

252
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:08,007
Radio host:
Man looks on the outward appearance.

253
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,634
Radio host:
Man looks on the outward appearance.

254
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:12,075
God looks on the heart.

255
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,579
And certainly the heart
of a man does matter,

256
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,047
because out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaks...

257
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,483
( speaking Spanish )

258
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:40,003
Male radio caller: Only in the choices
that God decides to present to us.

259
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,529
Host:
Well, no, l'm not saying that.

260
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:45,908
l'm saying that l just believe
that we're automatons...

261
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:16,837
Radio:
...and here's the deal:

262
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,674
- l did not choose to be born...
- Madylyn: This is very very serious.

263
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,011
...and l cannot choose to be born again.

264
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,448
She's four-- can you believe it?

265
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,146
Radio: l had no choice
in that matter whatsoever, and yet

266
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,587
- there are so many people that...
- Where have you gone?

267
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:32,614
...think they have a choice
in the matter

268
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:36,253
of their spiritual rebirth
and their spiritual formation.

269
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:40,698
The fact of the matter is, a seed
is planted and conception takes place,

270
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,065
- which you had nothing to do with.
- Male caller: Amen.

271
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,434
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

272
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:49,032
will continue here right after
these very important messages.

273
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,970
Stone: Look, we was high as shit
and we were lookin' for money.

274
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,004
You know?
My poppy hears us.

275
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,606
Him and Teach have words.

276
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,311
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

277
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,512
And l was like, ''Fuck this.
l don't want no part of this,''

278
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,317
and l went outside.

279
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:07,223
So then, Teach done what he done
and then the house got burnt.

280
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:11,187
lt was--
you know, it was terrible.

281
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,198
l was like a terrible mistake
that l made.

282
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,792
l was tragic and it was
a long time ago

283
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,429
and l've paid-- l've paid...

284
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,939
with a lot of hard time.

285
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:24,101
And l just think, you know,
l'm so ready to be out

286
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,338
and start my life again,

287
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,744
and well, so what--

288
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,215
you know, what-what-what
can we do to make that happen?

289
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,774
How can you help me
make that happen?

290
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:35,286
Well, we'll see.

291
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,789
We were just getting started, so--

292
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:41,122
A lot of good things have
happened for me in here, you know.

293
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,025
l did my GED like that, man.

294
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,223
l held down this job--
Textiles Unit,

295
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,129
number one position
the last two years.

296
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,896
l'm goin' home to my wife.
She's got a spot for me, you know,

297
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:52,233
Mount Elliot Chrysler,
job lined up.

298
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,138
- l'm-l'm going, you know.
- Yeah, whose idea was it?

299
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,438
Lucetta-- she knows
the branch manager at Mount Elliot.

300
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:58,966
No no, not your job.

301
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,502
Whose idea was it
to go to your grandparent's?

302
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,105
- What?
- Whose idea was it?

303
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,382
l told you--
l told you it was Teach.

304
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,083
Teach, you know.

305
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,684
Like l said, l wasn't even--

306
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:17,093
l was-- l went outside the house.

307
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,359
Yeah, but you
didn't stop them, did you?

308
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,992
- Stop 'em what?
- From killing your grandparents.

309
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:28,169
You-you-you ain't gonna do it, man.

310
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,702
You're not gonna--

311
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:36,607
You don't give a fuck, man. Shit.

312
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,443
l was outside,

313
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,786
Teach-- Teach come out,

314
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:48,315
and l didn't even know
what he'd done until he told me.

315
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,885
Teach testified to that, man.

316
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,831
He-- that's why l didn't even
catch the rap

317
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,527
for-- for manslaughter.

318
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,968
l got accessory and arson.

319
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,631
l've done eight out of 10-15.

320
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:04,769
l mean, what-- what more
do you want from me?

321
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,839
Okay, so,

322
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,975
let's make today

323
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:14,577
an extra special day.

324
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,112
Let's do one nice thing
for someone else,

325
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:22,355
but not tell
anyone else that we did it, okay?

326
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,123
( all agree )

327
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:27,326
Madylyn: Win with the seventh deuce,
it's 10 bucks for everybody.

328
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,197
- ( phone ringing )
- Win both ways with the seven deuce,

329
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,202
- 20 bucks a head.
- Jacks wild?

330
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:32,794
Jacks definitely not wild.

331
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,830
- Woman: Marsha, stay in?
- ( rings )

332
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,364
Hello?

333
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,742
- Woman: Hi, is this Jack Mabry's place?
- Excuse me?

334
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,145
Oh, my name is Lucetta Creeson.
My husband's...

335
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,116
Excuse me,
l couldn't understand what--

336
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,881
- Can l speak to Jack Mabry?
- Well, this is Mrs. Mabry.

337
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,617
Okay, can l speak to Jack?

338
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:54,125
You need my husband.
l can give him a mess--

339
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,150
( dial tone )

340
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,761
( people chattering )

341
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,538
- Stone: Hey, you get ahold of him?
- Lucetta: She was a little short.

342
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,277
You know? Like, l don't know. Like she
didn't want to talk or something.

343
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:19,682
Why-why-why you talkin' to her?

344
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,709
Hey, Tommy, Tommy, we don't bite.

345
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,621
Huh-uh, no biting, okay?

346
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:28,320
Do you understand what l'm sayin'?
l need you to do this for me right now.

347
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,487
Right now. Don't let it slide.

348
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,793
Lucetta:
Okay, l will.

349
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,800
Stone:
Okay? Call him tonight.

350
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,359
Call him tomorrow.
Call him tomorrow night.

351
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,032
Call him the day after.
Call him the day after tomorrow night.

352
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:44,236
That's what l'm getting at is do you
believe what you did was wrong?

353
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:46,972
What-what d'you think,
because l grew up westside

354
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:50,106
that like l'm one of
these socio-delinquent types,

355
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,118
don't know the difference
between right and wrong?

356
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:55,746
You want me to tell you
about my bad childhood and shit?

357
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,255
l don't know. Did you have one?

358
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,224
Well, you know, at the time,
l thought a lot of shit was normal.

359
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:03,387
lt was definitely unhealthy,

360
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,897
but on the same token,
you know, l didn't think

361
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,297
l was a bad person to begin with.

362
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,496
So, you know, l mean,
what, you want to know

363
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:13,835
if l'm gonna light
any more grandparents on fire?

364
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,669
- Are you?
- No.

365
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,836
- You got any more?
- Yeah, l got one.

366
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:22,472
Yeah well, try to make
a better effort with that one.

367
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,985
l'm not trying to be flip.

368
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,057
l think l deserve to be free, l do.

369
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:37,119
Why, because you did the time?

370
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:40,063
That's it, you're ready?
Now you're a clean slate?

371
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,432
l'm clean as anybody, man.
l'm clean as you.

372
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,199
( chuckles )
Well, maybe, maybe not.

373
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:49,105
Seriously, let me
ask you something, you know.

374
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:51,632
Why are you-- why are you--
why are you gonna sit there,

375
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,077
like, asking me these questions
like you never done nothin'?

376
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,345
l mean, you know, why do you
get to walk around free and l don't?

377
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:00,283
l wasn't convicted of a crime.

378
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,310
Oh, come--
you never did anything bad?

379
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:05,448
Never did anybody no wrong,
had to be forgiven for nothin'?

380
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:06,981
No, never broke the law.

381
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,084
What, you never got
a speeding ticket?

382
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,926
You never backed somebody up
in a bar fight or something?

383
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:15,229
Shit, Vietnam-- you never killed
some kid-- you carry that with you?

384
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,791
You step out on your wife,

385
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,962
you fuck that little 15-year-old
who looked at you sideways?

386
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,029
- Okay okay.
- No, come on, man! Come on!

387
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:25,635
How long you get to keep judgin'
a person for one bad thing they done?

388
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:28,407
No matter how much l paid,
l gotta keep eatin' shit with you?

389
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,074
For how long?

390
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,884
That ain't right. lt ain't.

391
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,252
l mean, l'm beggin' you, man.
l'm beggin' you.

392
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,123
l'm a person. l'm a person.
Look at my record, you know.

393
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,151
Look at-- look at
what l've done in here.

394
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:46,028
l mean, l'm different
than when l come in here, man.

395
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:50,933
l've grown a lot.
l'm like fuckin' reborn, man.

396
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,767
What does that mean to you,
being reborn?

397
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,432
What?

398
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,472
What does that mean to you?

399
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,219
( car horn honks )

400
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,317
- ( car horn honks )

401
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:25,736
Hi. Yeah, l'm back.

402
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,098

403
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:34,141

404
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,222
Thanks. Bye, guys.

405
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:46,781
( door buzzes )

406
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,229
Guard: Creeson!

407
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,875
Oh, the rows look so nice.

408
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,311

409
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,076
- l've been using that mousse you sent.
- Yeah?

410
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:12,413
'Cause Crystal said you put the rag on
before you go to sleep,

411
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:16,114
and when you wake up they're still all
clean and nice-- they look really good.

412
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:19,385
They look tight.
You look so fucking good.

413
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,392
l miss you so much.

414
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,021
( boots squeaking )

415
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,168
What have you got to tell me?
l mean...

416
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,871
Well, l called him

417
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,141
and he didn't call me back,
so l left another message.

418
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,172
Okay, that's good, but you know you
got to get with him person to person.

419
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:47,879
- l'm on it. Baby, l'm on it.

420
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,253
l gotta have you with me on it.
l can't do this by myself.

421
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,383
Anything.

422
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:56,792

423
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,193
Yeah.

00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:00,562
Okay okay.

425
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,830
Baby, l wore
something special for you.

426
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,564
Did you? What did you wear?

427
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:08,129
- Nothing.
- Oh God.

428
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,698
You're killin' me.

429
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,676
( moans )

430
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,442
Oh no.
Okay okay okay.

432
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:25,487
Come on. No no, l'm sorry. Just come on.
Come here, come here.

433
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,592
Honey?

435
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,422

436
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,091

437
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:37,158

438
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:40,228
Okay, l'm so close.

439
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:43,241
- What am l gonna do?
- lt's gonna happen.

440
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,470
- l can't do much more of this.
- Don't worry.

441
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,375
l can't.
l ain't gonna make it.

442
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,539
l'm serious, Lucetta.

443
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:53,210
l just think l want--
like l want to kill myself.

444
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:56,482
You don't even joke like that, okay?

445
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:58,079
Don't joke.

446
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,421
l love you.

447
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,295
You want something to eat?
l got some cream puffs

448
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,562
and some animal crackers
and some milk and stuff.

449
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:13,103
''That the Father may be glorified...''

450
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,699
( loud chattering )

451
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:56,042
( Stone reading indistinctly )

452
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,813
''...the embrace of sin, the individual

453
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:07,313
achieves perfect metaphysical pitch

454
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,156
and transforms himself

455
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:12,322
into a tuning fork of God.''

457
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,768
l'm trying improve myself here,
you motherfuckers!

( phone ringing )

459
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,176
Jack's voice:
This is Jack and Madylyn Mabry.

460
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,917
- Please leave a message.
- ( machine beeps )

461
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:42,017
Hi. Hey, this is

00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,154
Um, l called before.

464
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,529
but Mr. Mabry, this is for you.

465
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:52,196
l would like to talk to you
about my husband.

466
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:54,205
Um, it's kind of important to us.

467
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,969
And l work most mornings, but--

468
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,033
well, no, look,
l could rearrange things,

469
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,875
so whenever's good for you
is fine with me.

470
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,346
( beeps )

471
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,474
Shit.

472
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:07,781
l wasn't done.

473
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:11,319
Who goes to sleep at 9:00?

474
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,369
Hi.

475
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:53,454
Lucetta: Mr. Mabry?

476
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,998
- Officer Mabry?
- Sorry?

477
00:30:58,036 --> 00:31:01,528
Mrs. Creeson-- l'm Stoney's wife.

478
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:03,666
Oh oh, Mrs. Creeson.

479
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,505
Look, call me Lucetta though, please.

480
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:09,071
You're here to see your husband?

481
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:12,049
No, silly, l'm here to see you.

482
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:15,143
Wait, l'm sorry,
didn't you get my message?

483
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:19,180
Oh yeah, okay. Well, there's a way
to meet with family, Mrs. Creeson.

484
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,784
You have to go through the office
for me to see you.

485
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,522
- Oh right.
- The case officer too--

486
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:27,430
meet and assess the home situation.

487
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:30,059
- That's-that's how we--
- See, that's the thing though, sir,

488
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:33,434
because, l mean,
l am the home situation.

489
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,400
- Mrs. Creeson, just call the office--
- Lucetta.

490
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:40,878
Lucetta. Just call the office
and make an appointment.

491
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:43,642
- That's the way you have to do it.
- Can't l just talk to you for a while?

492
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:46,879
l mean, can't we just, sort of just you
and me make a date or something?

493
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:48,351
- No, we can't.
- Please please.

494
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:49,819
You know how much
this means to us.

495
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:53,312
lf you're coming to see your husband,
fine, but we can't do it any other way.

496
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,690
And l'm late, really.

497
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:57,922
Well, Mr. Mabry,

498
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:00,227
Mr. Mabry, l wanted
to give you a little something

499
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,426
- my kids made in class.
- Yeah, l can't accept that.

500
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:05,368
- lt's inappropriate. Thank you anyway.
- But it's for the birds, see?

501
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:08,497
And they-- it's a nest
and they come and they take their twine

502
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,737
and their twigs and stuff
and they make their little home.

503
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,334
Thank you.

504
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,676
Lucetta: Okay.

505
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,239
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

506
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,023
Okay.

507
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,694
What the hell is this?

508
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,962
- What's that?
- This-- your wife.

509
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,332
What, she sent it to you?

510
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,633
She gave it to me
in the parking lot just now.

511
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:41,832
Wait, what,
Lucetta come and find you?

512
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:45,001
She gave that to me in the parking lot.
Don't mess with me.

513
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:47,409
l ain't lookin' for any kind
of trouble with you, you know.

514
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,470
l hope you didn't put her up to it.

515
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:51,744
The parole board's
gonna send you a flop in the mail

516
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,478
and you won't even see them.

517
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:56,248
Lucetta does whatever
the fuck she wants. l told you, man.

518
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:58,882
She's just boisterous.

519
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,052
Jesus, what a week.

520
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,365
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

521
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,902
Hey hey, l want to see
what you think about something.

522
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:26,381
You ever-- you seen this?

523
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,547
l found it in the library.

524
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:33,546
''Zukangor, The Sound and Life God.''

525
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:35,081
Yeah, you know it?

526
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,694
No.

527
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:40,163
They say the sound part come first.

528
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,894
They say the-- when you experience

529
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:45,402
a spiritual truth

530
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:48,497
that it comes to you as a sound,

531
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,940
that it goes through you,

532
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:54,274
changes your vibration,
gets you back into harmony.

533
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,803
Like God's tuning fork or something.

534
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:59,442
And then if you let that happen to you,

535
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:02,146
then-- then you get the light,

536
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,621
or you get illumination
or something.

537
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,753
l wouldn't know about that.
l'm an Episcopalian.

538
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:12,820
They say it starts with small things,
like little sounds, little vibrations,

539
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,856
like a-- just like
a buzzing electric light

540
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,461
or rushing water
or the sound of a bee or...

541
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

542
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,234
And then it grows.

543
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,505
But there's no priest or nothing.
lt's not like a religion.

544
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:31,072
There's just this one dude
named Arnold who's the Zukmaster.

545
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:34,711
They say you do this practice
all by yourself.

546
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:37,153
You can-- you can hear better.

547
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,055
You can hear God
speaking to you through sounds.

548
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,718
What's the practice?

549
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,126
- They chant ''Hue.''
- Hue?

550
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:47,256
- And then they listen.
- For what, a bee?

551
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,762
Maybe, l don't know.

552
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:53,362
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

553
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:57,501
( chuckles )
But you know, the thing is

554
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:00,443
they say you got to keep coming back

555
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,345
until you pay for all your shit.

556
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,849
That you've got to fix it

557
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:09,251
over a lot of lives, you know,
until you work it all out.

558
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,983
Well, what about this life?

559
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:15,618
What about answering for the things
that you've done in this life?

560
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:21,294
Shit, l know l have.

561
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,266
Have you?

562
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,825
Yeah. Have you?

563
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:33,702
Male pastor: This is
the body of Christ, given for you.

564
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,680
The body of Christ, given for you.

565
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,984
The body of Christ, given for you.

566
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,011
- Jack: l'll be right back.
- Pastor: Sure.

567
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:51,019
Here, you drive home.

568
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,826
l'm going to talk to the pastor
a minute and then l'll walk.

569
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,526
Okay.

570
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,661
- ( men chattering )
- Man: Hey yo, foul, bitch!

571
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,434
Damn, that's a hard foul!

572
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,499
Yo, that's a foul!

573
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:13,175
( clears throat )

574
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:16,085
( chanting )
Hue...

575
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,145
( basketball game fading out )

576
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,991
( basketball game grows louder )

577
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:29,124
Man:
Man, you should've dunked it!

578
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,101
( loud chattering )

579
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:44,144
Jack: Okay, l've never
done this before, so--

580
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:46,013
well, l mean, l come to the...

581
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:50,617
church every week and l really try.

582
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:53,783
And l don't know, l mean,
l guess l had hoped with time

583
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:55,850
it would be easier and easier and...

584
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:59,122
and l'd be...

585
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:03,994
My family, people close to me,

586
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:07,334
it seems to come to them easily,
but for me it's...

587
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:10,068
l mean l've...

588
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,598
l don't know.

589
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,410
l mean l've...

590
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:21,407
sometimes
the thoughts that l have,

591
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,249
feelings...

592
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,551
but, uh, sometimes

593
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:30,652
l just think maybe
you should shoot me or something.

594
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:33,755
Well, l don't believe that
that's what God wants for you.

595
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,665
Well, what does he want?

596
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:41,138
l wish l had a simple answer for you.

597
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:43,868
l'm not sure what God wants for you.

598
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,504
ls there anything...

599
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:52,707
There's an old Biblical passage
that says...

600
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,953
''Be still and know that l am God.''

601
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,889
Which is a way of saying

602
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:02,484
sometimes God does, um,

603
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:05,724
speak to us in mysterious ways.

604
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,528
( chattering )

605
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:21,902
( meditative humming )

606
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,308
Guard: Off the rail!

607
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,147
l said off the rail!

608
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:40,595
( chanting )
Hue...

609
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,766
( phone rings )

610
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:52,866
Hello?

611
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,277
Lucetta: Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson.
We talked last week.

612
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,748
Madylyn: l'm sorry,
what is your name again?

613
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,808
Lucetta Creeson.

614
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:03,377
l was just wondering
if Jack was home.

615
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:06,083
l'm afraid he's still--
oh no, wait, hold on.

616
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:09,560
- Jack, telephone.
- Who is it? Who? Who is it?

617
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,289
A friend of yours?

618
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,598
- Hello.
- Hey.

619
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,429
lt's Lucetta Creeson.

620
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,799
Listen, l was just wondering, um,

621
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,031
when we could meet,
when we could get together.

622
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:25,236
Uh, Mrs. Creeson, l don't know
how you're calling my house,

623
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:26,937
but l told you to call the office.

624
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,707
Lucetta: Well, look, l'm just,

625
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:32,341
l'm not that great at offices
and, you know,

626
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:35,819
l just-- l just can't be real, like,
in an office, you know?

627
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,878
- Look, Mrs. Creeson--
- Lucetta.

628
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:41,380
Mrs. Creeson, l have
business with your husband.

629
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:43,690
Well, that's why l'm calling.

630
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,855
l mean, what, did you think
l had another reason?

631
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:47,626
Jack: Well, no, l didn't.

632
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,725
Maybe we could go to lunch,
you could bring Mrs. Mabry too.

633
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:53,601
You know, she's got a sweet voice.
What's her first name?

634
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:55,401
Look, l admire
that you love your husband

635
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,930
and you want to do
what's right for him,

636
00:39:56,974 --> 00:40:00,102
but you're not helping him.
l'm telling you that right now.

637
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,112
( whispering seductively )
Listen to me, Jack.

638
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,307
l do love my husband.

639
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,282
l love my husband

640
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,684
so much.

641
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:11,450
( Lucetta moans )

642
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:14,481
And all l'm asking you
is for a chance

643
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:17,323
to help you see him
in a different light.

644
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,221
l mean, how many men
at that place you work at

645
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:24,666
have somebody
loving them like that, huh?

646
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:28,502
Doesn't that mean something to you,

647
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,235
a man in a position like yours?

648
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:34,472
lt-it-- no, it-it does, it does.
Don't misunderstand me.

649
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:37,174
( seductive whispering continues )
l just want him home.

650
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:40,810
l want... l want him so bad.

651
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:43,286
l want his arms around me.

652
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,789
l want him in my bed.

653
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:48,291
l miss him.

654
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,624
Can't l persuade you?

655
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,959
Who's it gonna hurt, hmm?

656
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:56,228
Just let me come see you, please.

657
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,195
Let me come see you, Jack.

658
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,439
( breathing heavily )

659
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,208
l got him.

660
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:11,147
lt's gonna happen, baby.

661
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:18,647
Huh. Honey, you okay?

662
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,384
l'm so fuckin' tired.

663
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:24,052
Can't you sleep?

664
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:27,087
No, it's too loud all the time.

665
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,224
So noisy l can't...

666
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:33,063
l can't get out of my head.

667
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,504
l can't hear nothin'.
l can't listen.

668
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,304
This place is startin'
to mess with my head.

669
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:41,869
l'm tellin' you, l'm having
these weird-ass dreams.

670
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:43,881
Poor honey.

671
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,087
l thought l wanted
to kill myself, right?

672
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,549
Thought l wanted to hang myself
in the solitary.

673
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:56,253
l don't get it.
You dreamed that?

674
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,524
But then l got too scared to die

675
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:02,124
and l just hung there
for all of eternity.

676
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,064
l don't want to fuckin' be here.

677
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:16,041
l don't want to fuckin' be here.

678
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,105
Honey.

679
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,380
Honey, what'd you have
to eat that night?

680
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,256
lt must've been something.
Was it spicy?

681
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,019
( basketball players chattering )

682
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:46,609
- Man #1 : Shoot it!
- Man #2: All right, let's go.

683
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,512
Woman #1 : That's the grandson
l've been tellin' you about right there.

684
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,851
- Woman #2: How cute.
- Woman #1 : His eyes are so...

685
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,124
l got a grandchild.

686
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:06,925
Do you really?

687
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:09,524
Yeah. Her name's Katie,
three years old.

688
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:12,297
- Cute.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, very cute.

689
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,133
Does she look like you?

690
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,401
Hell no. No no no.

691
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,601
l bet she loves you though.

692
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:20,907
- Yeah well...
- You see her much?

693
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:26,616
They live upstate,
so we don't see her that much.

694
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,278
Aw, that's too bad.

695
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:35,052
She's getting a divorce,
my daughter.

696
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:37,856
- l'm sorry.
- What are you gonna do?

697
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:39,920
People are gonna do
what they're gonna do.

698
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,758
Are you in pain?

699
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:46,326
Yeah, it's just my back.

700
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,860
Oh. What'd you get that,

701
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,736
playing ball or like from some war?

702
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,401
No no, it's just life.

703
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:54,138
So l don't know if l can--

704
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:56,169
l don't want you to get your hopes up.

705
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:57,771
About what?

706
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:59,874
What l can do for you, for your husband.

707
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:02,579
- There's a whole system--
- Have you tried magnet therapy?

708
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,885
For your back, l mean. lt's like
these magnets that you wear and stuff.

709
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,323
- Magnets?
- Yeah, it's really good.

710
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:10,327
Actually, you should
come over sometime,

711
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:13,353
because l got these insoles
this guy sold me

712
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:15,092
and l wear 'em in my shoes

713
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,396
and l don't get tired
in school or anything.

714
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,026
And-- yeah, and sometimes

715
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,835
l even put 'em under my pillow
before l go to sleep.

716
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,397
And what does that do?

717
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,473
Well, okay,

718
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:29,979
you know how we're
all toxic and stuff, right,

719
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:33,609
with like all the microwaves
and cell phones

720
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:36,518
and all that weird stuff
flying through the air.

721
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:39,114
So it all builds up
inside of you, right,

722
00:44:39,156 --> 00:44:41,215
and it makes you
all achy and upset--

723
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:43,055
and it can give you
brain tumors, really--

724
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,721
l mean, it kills people.

725
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:47,424
So these magnets,
they detox you.

726
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:50,093
- Wow, that's...
- Yeah, it's real. l believe it.

727
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,329
You don't believe it?

728
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,396
l don't know, l guess.

729
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,339
No, it's real.

730
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,208
l mean, look,
l'm all into the body, you know,

731
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:02,769
and for me
if the body's feeling good,

732
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:05,611
the mind just follows, you know?

733
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,310
Absolutely.

734
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,285
Egg?

735
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,515
My kids made 'em.

736
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,682
Now l got 'em all and l have to eat 'em.

737
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:15,624
They're nice. They're pretty.

738
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:17,183
Eat me please.

739
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,895
Jack: Why not?

740
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:34,444
l'm just eating the healthy part.

741
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:37,970
Go on, just eat the whole thing.

742
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:40,347
- ( door closes )
- ( inmates chattering )

743
00:45:43,454 --> 00:45:46,685
Creeson, what's up?
You haven't been to chow in two days.

744
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:49,887
You got a call out to go to Medical.
Get dressed.

745
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:54,695
( lights buzzing )

746
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:56,461
Hold up there.

747
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,936
( door buzzes )

748
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:10,576
( keys jingling )

749
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:28,922
( whispering )
You feel anything?

750
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,098
No.

751
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:36,802
Like a tingling?

752
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:41,836
No, l don't.
l don't think l...

753
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:44,143
Like a pull?

754
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,842
lt's not dramatic, you know.

755
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:49,216
lt's just-- it's kind of a sense.

756
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:53,256
Yeah well, you know,
maybe a little something.

757
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,053
Yeah.

758
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:58,485
( clock ticking )

759
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:14,578
( ticking continues )

760
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:32,387
( ticking )

761
00:48:17,474 --> 00:48:19,567
( lights buzzing )

762
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,387
( grunting )

763
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:38,585
( screams )

764
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,672
( echoing scream )

765
00:49:57,908 --> 00:50:00,433
( buzzing lights fading out )

766
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:24,395
Madylyn: ''To what extent is
my commitment to obey God

767
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:26,198
based on dos and don'ts

768
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:29,364
or on a true love for Him?''

769
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:32,170
Hmm.

770
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:35,975
''ln what recent circumstance
was l aware of God's leading?''

771
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:40,446
Why don't you say the blessing?

772
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,617
Yeah.

773
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,384
Blessed O Lord...

774
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,256
( clears throat )

775
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:51,454
blessed O Lord,

776
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:56,159
this food to our use,
and us to Thy loving service,

777
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,226
and...

778
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:02,136
make us mindful
of the needs of others...

779
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:08,234
- ln Christ's name, Amen.
- Amen.

780
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:13,116
You lose your place?

781
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,209
( chuckles )

782
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:17,277
( spoon clangs )

783
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:19,482
You want an egg?

784
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:26,728
( chattering )

785
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,410
( chattering fades )

786
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,336
Male radio host: Sin comes
naturally to us from our birth.

787
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,245
We-we-- it's inbred in us.

788
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:20,444
We are not sinners
because we sin;

789
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:24,113
we sin because we are sinners.

790
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:28,488
Even if you lived a life
of perfect righteousness,

791
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:30,425
you deserve hell.
You know why?

792
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:33,919
Because ''all of our
righteousnesses,'' lsaiah says,

793
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:35,659
''are as filthy rags.''

794
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:37,633
( turns off car, radio )

795
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:25,437
( panting )

796
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:27,814
You're real sweet, Jack.

797
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,950
You're real sweet.

798
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:34,624
Fuck me harder.

799
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,926
( man laughing )

800
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:20,500
You're good, Jack.

801
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,330
You're a good man
for helping us.

802
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:28,634
l appreciate it.

803
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:36,445
You know that
nobody can know about this.

804
00:54:36,486 --> 00:54:38,249
You know that, right?

805
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:39,949
l mean nobody.

806
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,083
That's very important.

807
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:46,391
Whatever you want,
it'll all go bad if anybody knows.

808
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,627
Bad for everybody,
you understand that?

809
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,497
Of course, silly.

810
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,676
What's wrong?
You're not eating?

811
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:44,646
You ever think about things
they say go on forever?

812
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:46,485
What?

813
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,219
Things they say
go on forever-- like...

814
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:53,121
what's that mean, you know?

815
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:58,360
The sky, like, they say
the sky goes on forever.

816
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:02,136
But what is that really? That's--

817
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:05,699
l mean, you can't see
nothing you can't see, so...

818
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:09,702
it's like a big bowl
of blue above you.

819
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:11,611
You can see clouds
during the day

820
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:13,741
or you can see stars
at night maybe,

821
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,412
but even with a telescope
you can't see forever.

822
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,148
So how do they know?

823
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,652
Know what?

824
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:24,820
What it is.

825
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:27,193
Eternity-- how do they know?

826
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:38,035
So-- so, Jack,

827
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:42,011
he said the board's gonna review
the whole thing, okay?

828
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:44,570
And they're going
to take into consideration

829
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:47,947
your age and, you know,

830
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:50,976
your mom and all that,

831
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:54,752
and the fact that
you were an addict back then, um...

832
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,293
- hey, Stoney baby?
- Hmm?

833
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:01,456
Look at me.

834
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,629
Well, l was trying to tell you
about your parole.

835
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:09,696
Yeah?

836
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,731
( sighs )

837
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,606
Well, you weren't listening.

838
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:19,308
Oh yeah, l'm listening.

839
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,011
l am.

840
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:25,453
Okay, so Jack said, um--

841
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:27,389
You call him Jack?

842
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:28,948
Sure.

843
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:32,824
That's good.
What's he say?

844
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:38,301
Okay, so, um,
he's gonna talk to you

845
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:40,997
and he's going over
the whole thing

846
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:44,837
and he's gonna decide in a few days
to write up his notes in your case file

847
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,810
to submit it to the parole commission
so when they go over it next week

848
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:49,903
they're gonna see it.
lsn't that great, baby?

849
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,141
Honey, this could be it.
lsn't that great?

850
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:00,719
Yeah.

851
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:08,328
Didn't-didn't-didn't l do good?

852
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:14,099
Well, look at me.

853
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:15,798
( Stone groans )

854
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,807
What are you doing?

855
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:21,936
Sometimes l think the best thing is...

856
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:26,074
is just-just listen.

857
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:35,123
Would you stop playin'?

858
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:37,127
Radio: ls the kingdom of heav-- you think it
should be a peaceful kingdom

859
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,925
Radio: ls the kingdom of heav-- you think it
should be a peaceful kingdom

860
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:42,830
- and we should all get along?
- That's great, but is it just going

861
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:45,266
- to be a constant struggle...
- That's a tough one.

862
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,429
...to have the kingdom of heaven
here on earth?

863
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,030
( overlapping radio broadcasts )

864
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:56,043
Guard: Crack 53!

865
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:06,121
Just tell me,
is it the 30th or the 31st?

866
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:07,680
l've had about enough lip from you!

867
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:09,248
God damn it, just tell me,
which one is it?

868
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:11,726
You can button that up right now
and be nice. And l mean it.

869
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:21,795
Creeson's here.

870
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:24,398
Stone: How do ask a person to...

871
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:27,069
to explain something that--

872
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,442
that they experienced

873
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,276
to where another person's got no way

874
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:34,841
to relate to the whole
indefiniteness of it, you know?

875
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,620
You don't believe me
already, do you?

876
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:40,850
l'm not saying l don't believe you.
l just, you know, l--

877
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,722
look, l've seen the tape,
it's quite a thing.

878
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:46,593
But nothing happened to you.
l mean, you weren't involved in any way.

879
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,259
Yeah, look, l don't know how to even--

880
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,532
- ( phones ringing in distance )
- l'm not--

881
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:56,732
l don't know. l--

882
00:59:56,773 --> 00:59:58,968
You had, what, a profound

883
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:02,308
spiritual epiphany.

884
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:05,007
Shit, man, l ain't never even
heard that word before.

885
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:07,676
Look, we don't have to talk about it.

886
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,981
You know, it really don't matter.

887
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,113
Well...

888
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:15,420
l mean, don't get me wrong, l'd
like to believe in such things, but--

889
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,358
Like what? Like me?
You believe in me?

890
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:20,693
Sure, l'd like to believe in you too.
l mean that's why we're all here, right?

891
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:28,499
Wow.

892
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:32,503
Okay, you know, wait, look,

893
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,442
there were something like...

894
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,373
it was just a moment.

895
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:40,542
The static,

896
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,108
it just all went away, you know?

897
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:44,643
And l could really hear,

898
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:47,282
like l could hear clear, for real.

899
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:51,351
l don't know. lt just made me
see everything different.

900
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:54,795
lt made me look
at my life in a different way.

901
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:57,493
lt was just all of a sudden
l could-- l could see that

902
01:00:57,534 --> 01:01:01,402
my life in here isn't empty and
pointless like l thought it was before.

903
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,629
Woman: Family and...

904
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:11,878
- Look, Stone, just drop it.
- Drop what?

905
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:13,610
Well, l know what
you're trying to do, but don't.

906
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,847
Just-just-just don't.
lt's not helping. Just stop.

907
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:19,150
Hey look, man,

908
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:21,851
it don't matter to me no more.

909
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,416
- What doesn't matter?
- l don't care about what--

910
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,726
what you're doin' or what anybody else
is tryin' to make you do.

911
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:31,222
Make me do? What's that?
Nobody's trying to make me do anything.

912
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:34,701
Okay.

913
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:40,402
You should do what
you think is right, okay?

914
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:43,469
l am whatever you say l am in there,
so write what you feel.

915
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:46,949
Seriously. l mean it.
l mean, judge me how you think.

916
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,144
- Well...
- l mean, don't get me wrong,

917
01:01:49,185 --> 01:01:51,176
l want to be out,

918
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:54,190
but l'm gonna wrestle
with the same shit if l'm out.

919
01:01:54,224 --> 01:01:56,886
And l'm gonna keep
this feeling if l'm in.

920
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,125
Jack:
So you're all good now?

921
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:06,261
Stone: No no no. Look, l ain't sayin'
l'm all happy all of a sudden.

922
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:08,770
You know, my middle finger's
been up a long time, man.

923
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:11,865
l'm not just gonna start wavin'
and smilin' at people.

924
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:15,036
l'm gonna pop off.
l'm gonna lose my temper, and--

925
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:18,377
and say shit and do shit
that l'm gonna regret, whatever.

926
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:21,384
l just-- l just--
l am who l am, you know?

927
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:24,717
And that's okay.
You know what l'm sayin'?

928
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:27,279
Jack:
No. No, l'm afraid l don't.

929
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,121
Stone: Well, l told you
l couldn't explain it really.

930
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,355
- Madylyn: Are you okay?
- Yeah. My back.

931
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:35,296
- l'm gonna go sleep in the other room.
- Oh.

932
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:37,891
Male radio host:
You can take great comfort in that,

933
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:39,834
but that can be a false comfort.

934
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,895
Sometimes in the twilight
of a civilization,

935
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:45,339
there can be a great
cultural flowering,

936
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:49,004
but in reality, there are cracks
in the foundation of that society

937
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:50,512
and that society is doomed.

938
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,660
lf you really want to know,

939
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:18,299
l think it's some kind of
play-acting or something.

940
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:20,070
lt's all bullshit?

941
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:24,479
No. No. Look, Stoney's just...

942
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:26,414
you know.
l mean, he's screwed up.

943
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,940
He's got weird ideas about things.

944
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,818
Sometimes really weird.

945
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,915
But, l mean,
he's always been that way.

946
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,826
Jack: Talkin' to him,

947
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,853
he almost seemed like...

948
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,990
Like what?

949
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:46,559
Something-- really,
l don't know. Different.

950
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,697
( chuckles )
No.

951
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:53,800
Look, he's just trying
to impress you, you know,

952
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:56,505
trying to do whatever
it takes to get out.

953
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:58,673
Can you blame him?

954
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,945
- No, it's okay.
- What?

955
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,042
Hey, sit down.

956
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:06,885
Come on. Come on, sit down.

957
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:08,584
Sit down.

958
01:04:12,562 --> 01:04:16,123
Look, he admires you a lot,
you know.

959
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,930
He told me
he learned a lot talking to you.

960
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:25,268
Can you be straight?

961
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,242
Straight as you.

962
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:30,206
ls this all just a-- l mean,

963
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:32,908
just-just-just
tell me what's going on.

964
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:39,046
l don't do anything
l don't want to do.

965
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,553
l like you.

966
01:04:43,593 --> 01:04:45,686
l like you, Jack.

967
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:50,630
l would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

968
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,227
Well, thanks.

969
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,838
God, you're beautiful, you know.

970
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,806
You're beautiful.

971
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:06,678
Thank you.

972
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,055
l'm not gonna
come over here anymore.

973
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,852
- You're not?
- No.

974
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:16,153
Okay.

975
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:17,784
Maybe l should just take

976
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:20,489
some antidepressants
or something, l don't know.

977
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:25,225
- Yes you will.
- What?

978
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:27,031
lt's okay though.

979
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,265
l don't mind when they say,
''Oh no, no more,''

980
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:31,933
'cause then l just sit back and wait.

981
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:35,001
( chuckles )

982
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:36,978
But you'll call,

983
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:38,708
won't you, or drop by?

984
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:41,979
Like maybe late again
some night, won't you?

985
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:44,111
Oh God.

986
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,681
Look, l don't care if you deny it.
lt's funny to me.

987
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,826
St-stop this now.

988
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,263
l think about you so much, Jack.
All day long l'm thinking about you.

989
01:05:55,298 --> 01:05:57,266
l think about you at work.

990
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,530
Don't say that.

991
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:01,901
You're sexy, Jack,

992
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:03,701
and you know if you let Stone out,

993
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,436
we can still be friends too.
He won't know.

994
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:08,341
He won't even care.

995
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:11,313
Look, l do what l do
because l'm on my own, okay?

996
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:13,941
And l got to make my own way,
so don't you want to help us?

997
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:16,781
- Don't you want to help me?
- Don't talk like that.

998
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:19,344
l can't.
lt's not that simple.

999
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:27,994
You can't leave, can you?

1000
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:33,326
lt's sweet.

1001
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:39,469
What the hell am l doing?
God damn it.

1002
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:42,535
Oh, come on, Jack.
He's a good man at heart.

1003
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:44,978
You really believe that?

1004
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:47,244
Yeah, l do.

1005
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:49,547
No different than you and me.

1006
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:52,414
Do you go to church?

1007
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:55,913
Hell no.
There's no such thing as God.

1008
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,334
( dialing )

1009
01:07:46,376 --> 01:07:48,970
They called again.
They need the Creeson report.

1010
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,501
l just sent it!

1011
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:53,276
You don't have to yell.
l'm on the intercom.

1012
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:56,945
You got your RGC recommendation.

1013
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:59,113
Vocational counseling,

1014
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:02,921
psych therapy,
GED, NA, NA program.

1015
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:05,826
So the board needs to decide

1016
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:08,524
if it's safe to let you back
into the world,

1017
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:10,794
that you're not a danger
to yourself or others.

1018
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,028
Rehabilitated, right?

1019
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:14,696
Yeah.

1020
01:08:14,737 --> 01:08:16,398
You know, in my book it says

1021
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,535
that chronic neck pain comes
from bein' hanged in another life.

1022
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:23,602
Well, it's my back.
lt's not my neck.

1023
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:25,944
Well, l'm just makin' conversation.

1024
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:29,544
Look, if you're
not interested in the details

1025
01:08:29,585 --> 01:08:31,314
of your hearing, we're done here.

1026
01:08:31,354 --> 01:08:33,151
- Done?
- We're done.

1027
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:36,386
- How do you mean we're done?
- My report's already sent. We're done.

1028
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:42,463
Basically they want to hear that you
take responsibility for your actions.

1029
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,840
See, the thing about that,
l don't know.

1030
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,448
About what?

1031
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:04,977
lt's funny, you know, 'cause you're
always askin' me about that night--

1032
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:06,886
how it made me feel.

1033
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,988
You know, when my cousin
come out of the house

1034
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,557
and got me
and we went back inside...

1035
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,469
it was trippy, man,
because like two minutes before,

1036
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:24,564
you know, my poppy,

1037
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,405
he was-- he was alive.
There was color in his face.

1038
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,434
There was light in his eyes.

1039
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,971
And then l go inside there and...

1040
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:40,915
and then l see them

1041
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:44,154
lyin' there all over everywhere.

1042
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:51,867
There was this buzzing
in my ears, you know,

1043
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:54,392
and l thought it was
just the shit that we was on,

1044
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,997
but it kept growin'

1045
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,769
and it started scarin'
the shit out of me.

1046
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,868
Teach was bouncin' off the walls,

1047
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:04,402
yellin' at me,
''We got to do something,

1048
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:06,642
You gotta help me.
We gotta handle this.''

1049
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:09,776
But all l could hear
in my head was this sound.

1050
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:15,923
And then,
l don't know how l knew,

1051
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:19,894
but l just knew that
there needed to be a fire.

1052
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,988
l went to the garage.

1053
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:24,226
l got the can of gasoline

1054
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,030
and l got the match

1055
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,036
and l lit it.

1056
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:34,668
You ever seen a fire
take control?

1057
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:37,838
lt's somethin', man.
lt's alive.

1058
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,144
And l watched it

1059
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:43,117
take them up

1060
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,848
and start to change them.

1061
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:50,390
And the only thought
that came in my head

1062
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:55,054
was ''This is awesome.''

1063
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,122
Awesome?

1064
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,100
Stone: Yeah.

1065
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:02,767
lt was

1066
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:04,796
truly awesome.

1067
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:11,041
Um, the thing is that

1068
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,244
l know l'm supposed to take
responsibility for my action,

1069
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:19,277
l know that l'm supposed
to feel guilty about it,

1070
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:22,849
but l never did.

1071
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:24,792
And l never knew why.

1072
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:29,995
But now l think
l can understand

1073
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:32,057
that it was just

1074
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,194
part of what was
supposed to happen

1075
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:37,569
in my life's journey,

1076
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,268
you know?

1077
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:41,640
That was your decision--
you did that.

1078
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:43,167
No, l'm not sayin' l didn't.

1079
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:46,238
l'm saying that we're all
God's co-workers,

1080
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,250
and we don't even know it.

1081
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:50,252
Your crime
has nothin' to do with God.

1082
01:11:50,286 --> 01:11:52,516
Why not?
God is everything.

1083
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:55,285
You know,
look at earthquakes and floods,

1084
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:58,555
and-and tornadoes,
and all the bad shit that happens--

1085
01:11:58,594 --> 01:12:01,461
why don't you think that
we're a part of all of that too?

1086
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:04,432
What we do, you know,
the shit that we carry with us

1087
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:06,492
from one life to the next,

1088
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:09,732
maybe there's a plan
that includes all of us--

1089
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:11,967
you and me and my grandparents,

1090
01:12:12,008 --> 01:12:14,602
and we just don't know it.
How can we know?

1091
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,908
Enough of this shit.
You know-- you know--

1092
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:18,914
you and Lucetta,

1093
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:21,041
- she said that you were--
- Lucetta?

1094
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,846
- Your wife--
- What, you call her Lucetta?

1095
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,853
- She said--
- Don't.

1096
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:27,048
- What?
- Don't listen to her.

1097
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,420
What do you mean?

1098
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:31,585
Don't listen to what
she's tellin' you, man.

1099
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,229
Well, she believes in you.

1100
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:37,596
Look, it's a game to her, man.

1101
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:39,123
lt's a game. She--

1102
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:41,159
l told you in the beginning,
she's an alien.

1103
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:42,932
She's a-- she's like a freak.

1104
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,530
That's not a nice thing to say.

1105
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:46,973
No, listen, l'm tellin' it
to you straight, okay,

1106
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,704
she's just workin' on you.

1107
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:51,338
She's workin' on you.
She's fuckin' you over, man.

1108
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,870
She's an animal.

1109
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:56,112
You know, you're fuckin' nuts,
you know that?

1110
01:12:56,152 --> 01:12:57,642
You're fuckin' nuts.

1111
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,621
You got a beautiful wife
who cares about you, and--

1112
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:02,749
Beautiful?
You think she's beautiful?

1113
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:09,590
Okay, you're a con.
l've known that from the fuckin' start.

1114
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:12,829
l don't believe you for one
fuckin' second. Never did, never did.

1115
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:15,393
So you've both been
conning me? Okay, l know.

1116
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:18,896
l've been around the block a few times.
l ought to know better.

1117
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:22,703
- l'm sick and fuckin' tired of it.
- What'd l say, man?

1118
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:24,235
( Jack stammers )

1119
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,305
You expect me to eat this new shit
you've been handing out?

1120
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,578
Write a nice little note about
your goddamn fucking epiphany?

1121
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,107
You're the same bastard
you've always been.

1122
01:13:30,152 --> 01:13:31,744
- ( muttering )
- l know l am.

1123
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:34,950
That's what l've been sayin', man.

1124
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,424
- You don't get it.
- Get it? Oh no no, l got it.

1125
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,587
l got it and l'm goddamn
fuckin' fed up with you.

1126
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:41,562
The both of you
can go to hell for all l care.

1127
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:45,260
l can't f-- what have l done?
Jesus Christ, l've been--

1128
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:48,737
l mean, just goddamn
year in and year out

1129
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:51,740
sitting across the desk from this
and we pretend we're doing something,

1130
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:53,605
you pretend you've heard us
and then we fall for it.

1131
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,303
And then you come back in one year

1132
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:58,643
and you're sitting right back here
across the same desk from us again

1133
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:01,775
and somebody out there is hurt or dead.
Well, l'm not buyin' it anymore.

1134
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,615
Nothin' changed for the better. lt's all
bullshit. No one changes for the better.

1135
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:06,951
l've spent my whole fuckin' adult life
doin' this goddamn bullshit.

1136
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:09,287
l'm sick to death
of this whole fuckin' waste.

1137
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:11,156
You get no more of my time, pal.

1138
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:13,491
Get the hell out of here. Come on.

1139
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:15,793
Let's go. Come on, get out.

1140
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:18,129
Okay.

1141
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:20,567
( Stone mutters )
Oh God. Oh God.

1142
01:14:20,603 --> 01:14:22,662
Hey, man, you have anyone?

1143
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:25,538
- What?
- Anybody to stand behind you.

1144
01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:27,041
- Are you all alone?
- l'm not--

1145
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:30,170
Blow your motherfuckin' life up, man.
Blow it up all the way. Do it.

1146
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:32,043
Really, take it all the way.
lt helps.

1147
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:33,946
Hey, Peterson, we're done.

1148
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,974
Just go ahead and burn
your motherfuckin' life.

1149
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:38,748
- Now, God damn it!
- Blow it up. Let it go, all of it.

1150
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:40,278
Did anybody not fucking hear me?

1151
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:41,812
- Let's go, please!
- Go all the way.

1152
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,121
- Secretary: He's coming!
- Just embrace it, man. Burn it up.

1153
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,594
- Get him the hell out of here.
- lt's awesome. l'm pullin' for you.

1154
01:14:46,629 --> 01:14:49,792
- No, really, l'm pullin' for you.
- Fuck you, you sick son of a bitch.

1155
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,027
( insects buzzing )

1156
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:02,440
( insects buzzing, crickets chirping )

1157
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:08,048
( phone ringing )

1158
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,712
( beeps )

1159
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:15,053
Jack's voice: This is Jack and Madylyn
Mabry. Please leave a message.

1160
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,421
( beeps )

1161
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,688
Lucetta:
Hey, Jack-- Mr. Mabry,

1162
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,890
l left messages at work,
but you didn't call me back.

1163
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:25,157
l'm kind of in the dark here.

1164
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:29,430
Don't leave me dangling.
l hate that.

1165
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:31,769
( phone line clicks )

1166
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:36,938
( rings )

1167
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:38,970
Madylyn:
Let the machine get it.

1168
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,582
( rings )

1169
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,522
( rings )

1170
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,295
- ( rings )
- Hello?

1171
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,094
Woman:
ls Mom there?

1172
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,464
lt's Candace.

1173
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:08,441
Hey, it's Mom. Mm-hmm.

1174
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:11,943
Yeah, l understand.

1175
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:14,142
What's up?

1176
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:16,014
Well, how's Katie?

1177
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:32,396
Madylyn: Did you know
you started out as a stone?

1178
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:34,425
Jack: Hmm?

1179
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,267
Madylyn:
Your soul-- it started out

1180
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,773
as a mineral or a pebble,

1181
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,833
and then it was reincarnated
as a plant,

1182
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:45,745
then as a fish, birds,
animals and so on.

1183
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:47,976
You had to work
your way up to being a human.

1184
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:50,918
- ( flies buzzing )
- Know what it's been doing, your soul?

1185
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:53,888
- Jack: Hmm, what?
- lt's been paying off debts--

1186
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:56,585
past sins from past lives,

1187
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:59,958
reducing its burden
from one life to the next.

1188
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:09,128
Where'd you get that?

1189
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:11,469
Junk mail.

1190
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:20,873
You know what l think?

1191
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:23,714
l think we get this one life,
l do, and...

1192
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:27,712
you account
for what you've done in it.

1193
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:30,884
And if you don't,
you pay for it when you die.

1194
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:33,985
You don't think?

1195
01:17:35,597 --> 01:17:37,758
( exhales )

1196
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,132
Shit.

1197
01:17:40,169 --> 01:17:43,332
Shit shit, son of a bitch.

1198
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:46,500
Fuck fuck.

1199
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,203
- Okay, l get it.
- Motherfucker.

1200
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:51,406
Why don't you make me another
fucking drink, you cocksucker?

1201
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:53,312
( Jack chuckles )

1202
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:01,256
Who is that?

1203
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,024
Hello.

1204
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:07,926
l'll take care of this.

1205
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,099
Will you just pick up
the phone sometimes?

1206
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:13,693
- Oh, Mrs. Creeson, please, really.
- Pick up the phone when you're here?

1207
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:15,499
- This is inappropriate.
- Hi, Mrs. Mabry.

1208
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,505
- Did you get my messages, Mrs. Mabry?
- Look, l'm sorry, please.

1209
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:19,666
Young lady, l'm going
to take you to your car. Let's go.

1210
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,040
- Look, l'm a little bit worried.
- l don't care if you've been worried.

1211
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,511
You've been worried? l understand
if you're worried, Mrs. Creeson,

1212
01:18:24,546 --> 01:18:27,572
but try and have a little patience. Get
in the fucking car and get out of here.

1213
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:29,379
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being like this?

1214
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:31,215
And what's wrong
with my husband, huh?

1215
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:32,311
Please--

1216
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:34,914
- You're not supposed to be here.
- What did you tell him about us?

1217
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:36,822
There is no us.
Get the fuck out of here.

1218
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:39,384
- l just needed a friend to talk to.
- Thank you, Mrs. Creeson.

1219
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,555
You've got no fucking idea, man.

1220
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,622
We'll talk at the prison.

1221
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:55,874
Fucking idiot.

1222
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:02,847
lnexcusable,
coming to our home like that.

1223
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:13,254
You know, we can't alter reports
once they've been submitted for review.

1224
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:15,729
l know, l know,
but l made a mistake.

1225
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,322
Ehh, you're only human.

1226
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:21,359
Mitch, l-l-l'm asking, please.
Please.

1227
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:26,063
The hearing's in an hour.
You're kidding, right?

1228
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:27,598
l know.

1229
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,407
l need a little something
more to go on here.

1230
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:31,936
l can't go into it.

1231
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:36,849
l just missed something.
l made a-- l made a mistake.

1232
01:19:36,885 --> 01:19:40,218
lf you want to plead
your concerns, it's fine,

1233
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:43,156
or if you want to submit
additional evidence, that's okay too.

1234
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:45,956
But you know as well as l do
his fate's already been determined.

1235
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,621
lt's luck and quotas.

1236
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:51,497
Nothing l say
will make a difference?

1237
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:58,364
Well, don't sweat it, Jack.

1238
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,637
l mean, you're less than a month to go.
Sleep easy.

1239
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,644
- Hmm?
- All right.

1240
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,477
- l'm going out.
- What about the Creeson hearing?

1241
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:17,224
Thanks, Paul.

1242
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:19,557
( radio talk show playing )

1243
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:32,640
Radio host #1 :
Revelation 3:20.

1244
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:36,337
''Behold l stand at the door and knock.
lf any man open the door,

1245
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:39,279
l will come into him
and sup with him and he with me.''

1246
01:20:39,314 --> 01:20:41,214
Revelation 3:20.

1247
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,241
Radio host #2:
All right, the next one is...

1248
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:47,346
( host stammering )

1249
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:49,254
lt says Christ died for the ungodly.

1250
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:51,782
Radio host #1 :
Yeah, that's in Romans, chapter 5.

1251
01:20:51,827 --> 01:20:54,591
Romans 5:8...

1252
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,225
( sighs )

1253
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:03,397
So we're getting
to the commandments next,

1254
01:21:03,438 --> 01:21:05,702
l guess, huh?

1255
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,917
Do you believe in all this?

1256
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:20,922
What?

1257
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,554
Do you?

1258
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,463
You read the meditation.

1259
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:48,211
''What request is on the top
of my prayer list for today?

1260
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:52,346
ls it a selfish request
or one that will bring God glory?''

1261
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:55,356
l know what l want.
How about you?

1262
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,454
You lost your place again.

1263
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:09,095
You have something
you want to say to me?

1264
01:22:11,006 --> 01:22:13,440
You don't?

1265
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:16,911
l can't even think
of what you'd want me to say.

1266
01:23:06,228 --> 01:23:08,321
You want to talk about it, man?

1267
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:10,058
What's that?

1268
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:11,998
- Her comin'...
- Hmm?

1269
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,696
...or me going or anything you want.

1270
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:18,031
Look, l'm a little concerned
about you, man.

1271
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:19,870
You're seeming
a little ragged to me.

1272
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:23,844
Yeah well, put your mind at ease.

1273
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:26,109
So that's it for us, huh?

1274
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:29,174
You want to ask me any more questions
or go over some shit?

1275
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:31,685
l'll sit in the chair,
we can do that thing, you know.

1276
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,383
You'd better be smart or you're
gonna be right back in here again.

1277
01:23:35,424 --> 01:23:37,722
Hey, l got my release, Jack.

1278
01:23:37,759 --> 01:23:41,058
You ain't got to concern yourself
about me no more, man.

1279
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:42,688
You got it, all right,
but make no mistake:

1280
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,291
l can have 'em watch
your goddamn ass 24 hours a day.

1281
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:46,801
You got me?

1282
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:48,325
l got you.

1283
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,707
Shit, man, you don't believe
in nothing, do you?

1284
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:57,075
l believe you're
one fucked up son of a bitch.

1285
01:23:57,112 --> 01:24:00,570
l know you don't believe in me,
but you don't believe in yourself.

1286
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:02,845
You don't believe in God.

1287
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:05,910
l don't think you feel that anything
is true inside of you.

1288
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:07,444
l'll give you true--

1289
01:24:07,489 --> 01:24:10,083
l'm glad you're out of my hair,
Gerald Creeson.

1290
01:24:11,393 --> 01:24:13,384
Now you can be
somebody else's headache.

1291
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:16,261
Oh...

1292
01:24:16,298 --> 01:24:18,630
man, life is just
taking you by the neck,

1293
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:21,363
and rattling your whole frame

1294
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:23,701
and you don't know
which way is up.

1295
01:24:23,739 --> 01:24:26,606
lt's scary as shit when the wheels
come off like that, man.

1296
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:28,336
l feel you. l've been there.

1297
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:32,575
l mean it. But that's when
you got to start listening, man.

1298
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:34,582
Where the fuck is she?

1299
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:36,447
You don't want to shoot the shit
with me anymore, man?

1300
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:37,952
l'm gonna miss shootin'
the shit with you.

1301
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:39,544
Not me, boy, not me.
Time for you to go.

1302
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:41,351
l've enjoyed choppin' it up
with you, man.

1303
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:45,458
Anybody here yet?

1304
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:47,462
Hey, just keep listenin', Jack.

1305
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:50,158
That's all l'm saying, 'cause l think
something's coming for you,

1306
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:53,690
but when it comes, man,
just stay open to it, you know.

1307
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:56,329
- Don't close it off.
- Here we go.

1308
01:24:56,371 --> 01:24:57,497
ln there.

1309
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:17,286
Well, happy day.

1310
01:25:23,865 --> 01:25:25,526
So, well, can l kiss her?

1311
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:03,527
Ready?

1312
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,435
Yeah.

1313
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,845
Well, good luck to you, Stone.

1314
01:26:15,684 --> 01:26:18,175
Hey, l want to thank you.

1315
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,212
Seriously, l appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

1316
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:22,723
Yep.

1317
01:26:26,795 --> 01:26:28,695
Good luck to you too, Mrs. Creeson.

1318
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:31,995
Lucetta, Jack.
l mean, we're all friends here, right?

1319
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,729
Lucetta.
Take good care of him.

1320
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:38,796
( whispers ) l will.
And you take good care too, old man.

1321
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:42,643
- See you later, Jack.
- Mmm.

1322
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:50,345
Oh, hey, you know, l meant to say,

1323
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:53,752
Lucetta, she did tell me
that you fucked her.

1324
01:26:55,056 --> 01:26:58,150
l know that must be against
some kind of rules around here, right?

1325
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:00,559
l knew what you two were doing.

1326
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:03,894
Oh, did you know what you were doing
when you let my wife suck your cock?

1327
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,300
- Good luck to you.
- l'll see you out on the bricks.

1328
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:09,037
Good luck to you.

1329
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,969
Radio host #1 : Right now we enjoy
the Constitutional freedom

1330
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:17,001
to keep and bear arms.
lf that were ever infringed,

1331
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:21,607
if that were ever repealed
or just flat out violated and...

1332
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:25,211
Madylyn?

1333
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:28,552
Radio host #1 : As a Christian,
would we be within our rights,

1334
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,922
because Thomas Jefferson says

1335
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:34,622
these rights are inalienable
because they come from our creator...

1336
01:27:34,663 --> 01:27:36,290
Madylyn?

1337
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:38,595
...within our rights as Christians

1338
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:41,124
to revolt against the government

1339
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:45,936
and its denial of those fundamental
Constitutional rights,

1340
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:50,172
or would a Christian
have to respond differently?

1341
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:53,673
- Some mail.
- Host #2: We would have to respond.

1342
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:56,616
And we as Christians
would have to rise up

1343
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:59,313
against any government that said

1344
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:02,482
we didn't have a right
to protect ourselves, because--

1345
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:04,014
l guess l would ask the question,

1346
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:06,755
why do they want
to take our guns away from us?

1347
01:28:35,557 --> 01:28:37,548
( locks clicking )

1348
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:18,055
Lucetta's voice:
l like you.

1349
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:22,627
l like you, Jack.

1350
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:25,970
l would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

1351
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:29,771
( Lucetta laughs )

1352
01:29:47,796 --> 01:29:50,196
( urinating )

1353
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:58,736
( thumping in distance )

1354
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:41,980
Madylyn!

1355
01:30:42,016 --> 01:30:43,916
Wake up! Wake up! Madylyn!

1356
01:30:43,952 --> 01:30:45,783
Madylyn, wake up! Wake up!

1357
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:54,661
Come on!

1358
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,162
- l got to get to a phone.
- Where are you gonna go?

1359
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:06,673
- What about Steve and Helen?
- No, they're away.

1360
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:08,767
- Well, what about David?
- lt's too far. lt's too late.

1361
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,835
Ah!

1362
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:13,507
( Jack sobbing )
Look at this! Oh my G--

1363
01:31:14,682 --> 01:31:17,742
Jack: Oh God.

1364
01:31:17,786 --> 01:31:21,654
You motherfucker!

1365
01:31:21,689 --> 01:31:24,214
God damn it. God damn it!

1366
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:25,692
- Don't say that.
- What?

1367
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:27,854
Taking the Lord's name--
stop that.

1368
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:31,024
- Jesus, Madylyn, please.
- Stop it! l won't stand for it!

1369
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:32,896
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

1370
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:35,494
This means something to me.
lt may not mean anything to you anymore,

1371
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:37,300
- but it means something to me!
- Jesus, Madylyn,

1372
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:39,499
we just almost
got incinerated in our sleep

1373
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,771
by some fucking nutjob
who l let out,

1374
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:44,301
and you're fucking bothering me
about my fucking language?

1375
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:46,609
- Nobody did this to us!
- Give me a fucking break!

1376
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:48,707
- Nobody did this to us.
- What?!

1377
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,513
lt wasn't anybody.
lt was an act of God.

1378
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:52,952
l've got a pretty good
fucking idea who did this to us.

1379
01:31:52,987 --> 01:31:55,717
This was an act of God.
l'm going to tell the firemen that.

1380
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:59,089
What are you talking about, Madylyn?

1381
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:02,585
About the frayed wiring
in the kitchen wall.

1382
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,598
What are you talking about?
What wire?

1383
01:32:04,632 --> 01:32:06,623
ln the kitchen wall.

1384
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:09,569
And the-- the basement.

1385
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:11,697
- What?
- There are all those rag--

1386
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:14,537
rags down there,
all those old rags.

1387
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:17,374
l'm gonna tell them to go down there.

1388
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:22,777
Why would you say that?

1389
01:32:24,118 --> 01:32:26,916
Because it's as good
a story as any.

1390
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:31,686
( sirens blaring )

1391
01:33:08,062 --> 01:33:10,656
Madylyn:
lt's not that sunny out.

1392
01:33:10,698 --> 01:33:12,632
Candace:
Everybody knows

1393
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:15,636
you can still get sunburned
on a cloudy day.

1394
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:25,179
Madylyn:
Ah, look at the barns.

1395
01:33:25,213 --> 01:33:26,976
Remember that?

1396
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:29,946
Not really.

1397
01:33:33,187 --> 01:33:36,088
l don't know how you
stuck it out as long as you did.

1398
01:33:38,192 --> 01:33:40,285
l think you'd have done this sooner.

1399
01:33:43,231 --> 01:33:45,722
l almost did once.

1400
01:33:48,036 --> 01:33:49,936
So what happened?

1401
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:02,682
What happened?

1402
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,582
Man:
He's free! Yeah! He's free!

1403
01:34:11,793 --> 01:34:14,626
( laughs )
That's a free man there, huh?

1404
01:34:29,844 --> 01:34:32,278
( soft conversation )

1405
01:34:34,282 --> 01:34:38,275
( slurring ) You do not want to make it
a two-way conversation with them,

1406
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,483
because they have
nothing on their minds but--

1407
01:34:42,523 --> 01:34:44,514
well, they may have
nothin' but time

1408
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:47,084
to just think about ways
to work on you

1409
01:34:47,128 --> 01:34:49,096
and to get under your skin.

1410
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:51,360
You cannot make yourself
a person to them.

1411
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,560
Oh, believe me,
l've learned that lesson.

1412
01:34:57,038 --> 01:34:59,370
Well, l mean,
they'll test you for sure.

1413
01:35:01,209 --> 01:35:04,144
A good lookin' woman like you...

1414
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:06,203
Oh, Jack.

1415
01:35:06,247 --> 01:35:08,374
Well, l'm--

1416
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:11,408
l'm retired,
l'm not dead, you know.

1417
01:35:11,452 --> 01:35:14,421
Come on, Jack, we're friends, okay?
You're the best.

1418
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:16,548
l wanna have a little fun.

1419
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:19,321
Send me off into the sunset.

1420
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:24,261
Huh-uh.

1421
01:35:24,298 --> 01:35:26,528
Let's just keep it pro, okay?

1422
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,334
You want to be a pro?

1423
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:33,829
Fuck pro. They're gonna fucking
chew your ass up in there.

1424
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:36,002
- Okay, Jack, that's enough.
- No no, it's bullshit.

1425
01:35:36,044 --> 01:35:38,410
Jerking my chain like that,
you fucking cunt.

1426
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:41,643
- Gimme some respect.
- Hey, buddy, let's throw some darts.

1427
01:35:41,682 --> 01:35:43,479
Yeah yeah, l'm in.

1428
01:35:43,518 --> 01:35:46,453
- Up yours.
- Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, hey.

1429
01:35:46,487 --> 01:35:49,854
Jack:
l'm just fucked up. l should go.

1430
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:53,088
- No, ride with me.
- No, l'm-l'm gonna get a cab.

1431
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:54,992
l'm good, l'm good.
l'm gonna get a cab.

1432
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:58,965
l'm good, word of honor.
l'm good. lt's a cab.

1433
01:36:00,968 --> 01:36:03,493
Radio: ...get us to the reality
that God has already deemed

1434
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:06,735
is going to happen,
and nothing is going to change that.

1435
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:09,800
And so it's not like
there is this cosmic battle

1436
01:36:09,844 --> 01:36:12,074
between good and evil,

1437
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:14,581
and good might not triumph.

1438
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:17,277
The reality is that
there is a battle going on

1439
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:20,981
where you would see
a huge boxer

1440
01:36:21,022 --> 01:36:22,819
holding a guy's head back,

1441
01:36:22,857 --> 01:36:26,122
and the little scrawny guy
is flailing his arms,

1442
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,685
waving at the guy,
trying to beat him.

1443
01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:32,187
That's exactly what God--
God has Satan subdued,

1444
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,258
but in the flailing of his arms--

1445
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:37,533
and this is particularly brought out
in Revelation, chapter 1 2--

1446
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:42,202
Satan flailing his arms
is able to do an awful lot of chaos

1447
01:36:42,243 --> 01:36:44,939
and damage and bad things happen.

1448
01:36:44,979 --> 01:36:47,345
And it's because he is enraged

1449
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:49,372
because he knows his time is short.

1450
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:50,941
Revelation 1 2 said that.

1451
01:36:50,985 --> 01:36:52,919
Jack: Hey!

1452
01:37:05,466 --> 01:37:07,491
Stone:
This is some shit, man.

1453
01:37:07,535 --> 01:37:08,866
Wait whoa!

1454
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:12,396
You ruined my whole life. Why?

1455
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,568
Fucking why? Why?

1456
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:17,544
Why what?

1457
01:37:17,578 --> 01:37:19,375
Why did you do it?

1458
01:37:20,848 --> 01:37:22,713
Why did you...

1459
01:37:28,756 --> 01:37:31,247
Okay okay okay okay.

1460
01:37:32,627 --> 01:37:34,720
Hey, man,

1461
01:37:34,762 --> 01:37:36,354
you ain't gonna do this.

1462
01:37:41,035 --> 01:37:42,764
You think l won't?

1463
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,501
You think l won't?
( chuckles )

1464
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:50,841
You think l won't?

1465
01:37:50,878 --> 01:37:52,937
You think l won't?!

1466
01:38:05,993 --> 01:38:08,052
No.

1467
01:38:10,064 --> 01:38:11,929
No, l don't.

1468
01:38:39,227 --> 01:38:41,752
Woman on radio:
Yeah, at first, l thought l was crazy.

1469
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:43,957
Was this really happening to me?

1470
01:38:43,998 --> 01:38:46,933
Was it all in my head,
or is there really a God

1471
01:38:46,968 --> 01:38:49,402
who can breathe life into me

1472
01:38:49,437 --> 01:38:51,837
and make me feel his presence?

1473
01:38:51,872 --> 01:38:55,603
So this is actually what
encouraged me to write the book.

1474
01:38:55,643 --> 01:38:59,340
And honestly it completely changed
the way that l look at life...

1475
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:02,110
Man on radio:
Assume that there was a Higher Power,

1476
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:03,878
that lt created the universe,

1477
01:39:03,918 --> 01:39:07,149
until God set a bush on fire...

1478
01:39:07,188 --> 01:39:08,985
Man in room:
And maybe l did.

1479
01:39:09,023 --> 01:39:11,253
Man on radio: ...and said,
''Oh, by the way, you were right.''

1480
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:14,728
( overlapping radio and dialogue )

1481
01:39:15,997 --> 01:39:18,329
( laughs )

1482
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:26,299
You know, and...

1483
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,331
l think-- l think l'm ready to get out.

1484
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:31,072
Male radio host: Next up here is
Gerald from southwest Detroit.

1485
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:33,512
- Welcome, Gerald.
- Stone: l just want to say,

1486
01:39:33,547 --> 01:39:36,175
l got this book and they say that

1487
01:39:36,217 --> 01:39:39,084
when you experience a spiritual truth,

1488
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,213
that it comes to you through sound.

1489
01:39:41,255 --> 01:39:44,554
lf you let this sound go through you,

1490
01:39:44,592 --> 01:39:47,823
it changes you, you know?

1491
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:50,660
lt puts you back into harmony,

1492
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:54,600
you know, makes you
like a tuning fork of God.

1493
01:39:54,635 --> 01:39:56,159
Host: Okay.

1494
01:39:56,203 --> 01:39:59,263
Stone: Yeah, they say--
they say it can start with small things

1495
01:39:59,307 --> 01:40:02,765
like little vibrations--
you know, the sound of a bee,

1496
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:05,506
the sound of a buzzing light--
and then it grows.

1497
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:07,912
Host:
All right, that's interesting.

1498
01:40:07,948 --> 01:40:10,178
Stone: Well, they say

1499
01:40:10,217 --> 01:40:12,742
that everything that happens to you

1500
01:40:12,787 --> 01:40:16,518
is what was supposed
to happen to you for you to advance,

1501
01:40:16,557 --> 01:40:19,219
that you've got to
come back lots of times,

1502
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:22,423
you know, cycle through many lives
until you learn, until you...

1503
01:40:23,798 --> 01:40:25,925
Male radio host:
Well, thanks for your input.

1504
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:29,367
Next up here
on the WDDL listener line is

1505
01:40:29,403 --> 01:40:32,861
Kathy in Farmington Hills.
You're on All Voices Under God.

1506
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:35,637
( radio broadcast fades out )

1507
01:40:48,656 --> 01:40:51,489
( bee buzzing )

1508
01:41:03,437 --> 01:41:05,837
( bee buzzing )

1509
01:41:08,976 --> 01:41:10,807
( buzzing fades )

1510
01:41:10,845 --> 01:41:13,109
( silence )

1511
01:41:18,085 --> 01:41:21,543
( instrumental music playing )
