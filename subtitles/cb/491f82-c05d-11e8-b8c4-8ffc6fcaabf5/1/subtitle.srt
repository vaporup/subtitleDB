1
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:29,777
Bravo!

2
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,573
Bravo!

3
00:00:56,646 --> 00:01:02,414
Children are born good-natured
and innocent.

4
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:07,754
lf teachings are neglected,
then their nature changes.

5
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,788
Sung, what do you think you're doing?

6
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:17,923
This is called ""hanging by the braid
and jabbing on the butt"".

7
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,231
A royal jabber bestowed by Uncle Yang.

8
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,037
lf you don't concentrate on
your studies, your butt will be jabbed.

9
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,432
l'll tell my father
if you jab me again.

10
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,409
l'll tell him that you sneaked out
to steal bird eggs and

11
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:29,935
almost fell into a shit hole.

12
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,306
Then you'll really get it!

13
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:35,083
Cousin, please don't tell Uncle Yang!

14
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:37,515
All right,
l'll let you jab me one back!

15
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,884
All right, tell me
what's happening out there?

16
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:44,416
There is a lion dance
in the sitting room.

17
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,552
There are also many guests.

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,422
Who are the guests?

19
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,563
They are masters
from Shaolin, Wu Tang,

20
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,900
White Crane, Wing Chun
and other schools of martial arts.

21
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,570
What a party!

22
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,808
Those people must have come
to challenge my father.

23
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,477
l don't think so.

24
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:04,877
l heard Uncle Yang invited them here
to watch him wash his hands.

25
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:07,909
He needs an audience
to wash his hands?

26
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:10,216
What happens when he eats and pisses?

27
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:11,515
Let's go and check it out!

28
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:12,577
Good idea!

29
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:35,643
Mother, you're blocking my view.

30
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,304
You're pretty daring, aren't you?

31
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,076
You should be inside studying
instead of out here.

32
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,550
You'll be in big trouble
if your father finds out.

33
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:46,015
Mother, l've been cooped up
studying night and day.

34
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:48,080
Even my braid is bored stiff!

35
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:52,194
Everything your father does,
he does it for you!

36
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,730
Even this?
He's washing his hands for me?

37
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,155
Of course.

38
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,932
Be careful and don't let
your father see you.

39
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,160
You got that?

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,304
Bravo!

41
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:18,984
My dear friends.

42
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:24,555
Today, l have invited you all here
to announce my retirement.

43
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:27,596
After washing my hands
in this golden basin,

44
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,655
l will retire
from the world of martial arts.

45
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,358
Brother Yang, you're famous
for your Tai Chi lnvincible Fists.

46
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:35,662
We all know you
as honorable and righteous.

47
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,004
Why are you retiring from the world
of martial arts so suddenly?

48
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,938
Since the allied troops from
eight foreign countries invaded China,

49
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,510
we have suffered from civil conflicts
and foreign threats.

50
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:48,540
Now my only wish is to live
in seclusion and bring up my son.

51
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:54,016
So Dad wants to teach me
his Tai Chi lnvincible Fists!

52
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,318
You wish!

53
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,587
l have known you all for decades.

54
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,052
While some of you
may regard me as your friend,

55
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,356
others may feel vengeful against me.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,135
After l wash my hands
in this golden basin,

57
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:11,367
l hope to turn over a new leaf
and put everything behind us.

58
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,774
Who are you?

59
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,014
Mister, please pardon my ignorance.

60
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,553
May l ask your name?

61
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:28,980
Last name is Wong.

62
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,049
But all you need to know
are these two legs.

63
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,357
l have been undefeated
all through the North.

64
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,523
Today l've come to challenge
your Tai Chi Fists!

65
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,032
l have already decided to retire
from the world of martial arts.

66
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,262
lf you insist on a challenge,

67
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:42,530
then l will concede to a loss.

68
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,768
Father! Don't be a coward!
Fight him!

69
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,606
l have long heard that Yang's
Tai Chi Fist is smooth to the bone.

70
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:50,942
From the looks of it now,
not only are your fists boneless,

71
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:52,003
but you're gutless!

72
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:03,355
So you don't want to fight me?

73
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,451
l'll kick you until you do!

74
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,421
From the kung fu novels l've read,

75
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:12,525
kung fu masters often fight with
their words and not their fists.

76
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,569
That is the highest level
of martial arts.

77
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:19,100
Why don't we give it a try.
What do you say?

78
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:20,966
Fighting with words? How?

79
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:24,242
lt's simple.
You just tell us your stance,

80
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:27,247
describe your attack and how you
will counter your enemy's moves.

81
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,111
This will determine the winner.

82
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:32,144
Fighting by speech.
Are you up to it?

83
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:35,190
You are my guest.
You go first.

84
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:36,748
Fine. Black Tiger Steals The Heart.

85
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:42,128
l'll counter with Stomping Fists.

86
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,400
l'll rotate my right fist
and go for your wrist!

87
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,767
l'll then draw my right fist
and attack with Shaolin Palm.

88
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,632
l'll counter with Stomping Fist.

89
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,769
l retrieve my palms and counter
with continuous punches!

90
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,201
l'm still using Stomping Fists.

91
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:57,438
Stomping Fists again?
Do you have anything else?

92
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:01,577
Uncle Yang is only using
Stomping Fists. Can he win?

93
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,715
What do you know?
Just watch and you'll learn something.

94
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,946
All right. l'll give you
a chance to see my leg work.

95
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,422
Sun and Moon Roundabout Sweep.

96
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:09,982
Front sweep, back sweep,
right sweep, left sweep.

97
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,423
Father, use King Kong Backward Punch.

98
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,890
Backward throw!
Counter attack!

99
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:22,996
Fine. l'll keep kicking...
kick... kick...

100
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:26,397
Stop!

101
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:27,935
Why?

102
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,979
- You have already lost.
- What are you talking about?

103
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,071
What does a woman know?

104
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,543
l've been his wife all these years.

105
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:37,108
Of course l know which one
of his moves is a winner.

106
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,816
Madam Yang is an expert indeed!

107
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:49,062
Mister, it was his backward throw
kicking right and left.

108
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,731
He tripped you off your feet
before you even lifted your legs.

109
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,564
- Get lost!
- May God bless you.

110
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:54,864
l don't have time
to argue with you.

111
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:56,599
Let's fight a real fight
with our fists!

112
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,609
Wild Wind Stance.

113
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,674
White Monkey Stance.

114
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,228
Good leg work!

115
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:34,707
You are indeed
the Great Kick of the North.

116
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:36,506
l've lost.

117
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,416
Stop stalling! Today, either you
break your arms or l break my legs.

118
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,542
We must decide on a winner!

119
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:45,645
We are both masters of martial arts.
Why do you insist so?

120
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:49,419
Not only do l insist,
l'll kick you until you cry for mercy!

121
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,460
Father, be careful!

122
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:23,582
Wild Horse Stance.

123
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,090
Unrelenting lron Sweep.

124
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,235
Criss Cross Hands.

125
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,049
Good!

126
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:27,215
l am sorry.
l've overdone it.

127
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:47,969
Yang, l have lost.

128
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:51,576
But you haven't seen
the last of me yet!

129
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,140
Pre-destiny and life...

130
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:29,042
Practice of character...

131
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:34,081
Must be followed strictly
or it goes against the rule.

132
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,451
Dragon and the Hidden Tiger Fist.

133
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,116
There is a waterfall on the shore..

134
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,045
Hey, are you thinking
about girls again?

135
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:11,591
A gentleman loves a lady.

136
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:14,686
Hawk-man, what are you reciting?

137
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:16,561
Recite ""Higher Learnings"" for me.

138
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,621
Yes, Father.

139
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,363
The road to higher learnings
is practicing good deeds.

140
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:25,107
Be close to your fellow men
and treat each with kindness.

141
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,302
Know when to stop...

142
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:31,074
Why have you come here
instead of seeing your patients?

143
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,575
A father must teach his son...

144
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,578
Enough already!

145
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,412
You've retired
and moved to Hangzhou.

146
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:41,688
Now instead, you lock up your son
and nephew in the study

147
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,257
and treat them like prisoners.

148
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,385
lt hurts me to see them like this.

149
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,760
There is always a beginning
and an end to everything.

150
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,198
Hurry up and read!

151
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:53,599
Otherwise, l'll jab your butt!

152
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,830
Mother!
The road to higher learnings...

153
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:58,705
Stop that!
Your mother can't save you.

154
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:03,671
lt hurts me too!

155
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:06,506
But l still have to be tough.

156
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:10,084
Once l let loose of this monkey,
it will be hard to chase him back!

157
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,744
You worry so much.

158
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,214
You should never
have asked me for a son!

159
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:19,192
Enough now. Many patients
are waiting for you. Go see them.

160
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:22,053
Take this.

161
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,996
A kind mother spoils her son.
Do you understand?

162
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,055
Yes. l know.

163
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:35,833
lt's mother.

164
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:36,901
We're free!

165
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,216
Be careful!

166
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,276
Come down!

167
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,619
The road to higher learnings is...

168
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,095
You can stop pretending now.
Are you hungry?

169
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,152
Loosen your braid.

170
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,823
Have some dim sum.

171
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,197
- Mother, you are the greatest!
- Why?

172
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,257
You saved us.

173
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,940
Kung fu books?
Why are you reading this?

174
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:10,503
Mother, these books
are very important to me.

175
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:11,877
They're just different from Father's.

176
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,881
lf your father sees them,
he'll surely burn them! Put them away.

177
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,780
Mother, l have a question.

178
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:18,842
Yes?

179
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:20,621
Do you think

180
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:22,652
father is loosing his mind?

181
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,627
How can you say that about your father?
You disrespectful son!

182
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:26,719
You don't think so?

183
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,627
He ties my braid to the ceiling
and jabs my butt.

184
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,495
l ache from top to bottom and...

185
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,056
And, cousin Hawk-man..

186
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,396
he's been thinking about girls!

187
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,164
Thinking about girls?

188
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:52,584
You're really taking the lion out?

189
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,816
Don't you want to go see
the outside world?

190
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,222
lf Uncle Yang finds out,
we'll be in big trouble.

191
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,284
lf father finds out,
l'll take the rap.

192
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,922
Worse comes to worst, my butt
will take the beating. Then...

193
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,893
Let me tell you. ln this world,
there are three kinds of people.

194
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,060
Which three kinds?

195
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:10,333
One kind only talks but does nothing.
That's the worst kind.

196
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:13,598
The second kind talks while doing.

197
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:15,075
What's the last kind?

198
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:16,270
They're like us.

199
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,972
- How?
- The best kind.

200
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,571
We do before we talk.

201
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:20,637
Good!

202
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,307
Officer Lam, what do you think?

203
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:59,480
Not bad. Officer Tsao,
what do you think? Quite good.

204
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:01,546
lt's getting better each year.

205
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:02,613
Yes, Officer Tsao.

206
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,515
Look, that guy looks so silly!

207
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,847
Wow, it's an angel!

208
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,984
Hey, what's the matter?
Let's go!

209
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,891
l just saw a beautiful girl!

210
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:42,487
She's just perfect!

211
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,063
She's definitely one of a kind!

212
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:05,876
Yeung-wan?

213
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:11,458
Yeung-wan.

214
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,052
lt's you.
Look, isn't this lion cute?

215
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,358
When did you get back?

216
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,160
You should have asked me
to pick you up.

217
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,928
l came back with some classmates.

218
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,829
lt's so crowded here. Let's go sit on
the platform. Your father is here too.

219
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:24,895
All right.

220
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:25,998
Bye.

221
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,099
Bye.

222
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,543
What are you still looking at?
She's gone?

223
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:33,203
Daddy.

224
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:35,910
You've come! Take a seat.
This is great!

225
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:58,497
The time has come to present
our offerings to the Dragon Emperor.

226
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:04,838
What are they doing?

227
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:07,109
lt is the custom of this village
to make offerings to the Dragon Emperor

228
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,047
so he will bring us peace
and a good harvest.

229
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,586
Present the offerings now.

230
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:15,146
Lower the virgin boy and girl
into the river for the Dragon Emperor.

231
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,494
Let me go!

232
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,997
Stop right there!

233
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,863
This is murder! How can you drown
these children in the river?

234
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:29,229
Miss, you're ruining the ceremony!
That's a big sin!

235
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:30,894
Send the offerings.

236
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:31,962
Stop!

237
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,372
Yeung-wan!

238
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,740
Take your hands off!

239
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,985
They've ruined the ceremony.
Don't let them go! Get them!

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,989
Don't touch her!

241
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,535
Get the guy
who wrecked the ceremony.

242
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:02,593
Beat him up!

243
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,411
Aren't you going to help?

244
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,778
An angry crowd
is impossible to control.

245
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,818
Daddy, can't you stop them?

246
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,014
lt's the will of the heavens.
l've really spoiled you.

247
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,929
- These people are so ignorant.
- They are despicable and pitiful!

248
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:35,335
Only we who have studied abroad
can educate and save them!

249
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:36,393
Right.

250
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,032
What do we do?

251
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,102
Let's fight them with the kung fu
we learned secretly.

252
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:02,189
Stop! Stop fighting!

253
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:37,890
lt's raining!

254
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:40,361
The Dragon Emperor is pissing!

255
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,804
He's showing his powers now!

256
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,741
Heaven, if you had to piss,
why didn't you piss sooner?

257
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,282
Hey, can you walk?

258
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,644
Yes!

259
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,744
Then let's go.

260
00:19:58,821 --> 00:19:59,810
Where are we going?

261
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,879
- Don't you want to go home?
- Home! Yes, home!

262
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,185
l'll walk you home.

263
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,089
You... You'll walk me home?

264
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,149
May l?

265
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,054
Sure! Sure! Of course!

266
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,793
You were so brave.
You saved the two children.

267
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:20,365
Confucius said,
""One must save others by all means.""

268
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,431
What?

269
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,603
l meant l was just doing
what l was supposed to do.

270
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,181
Hawk-man, be careful.
Don't get the lion wet!

271
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:30,842
Your name is Hawk-man?

272
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,819
- How about you?
- Rose.

273
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,253
""Lo-she""?

274
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,756
ls this lion very important to you?

275
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:36,950
lt is a family treasure.

276
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,326
Come. Put it
under the umbrella too.

277
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,324
Son of a gun!
Meets a girl on his first time out.

278
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:49,697
This is Lung-Chan Village.
You're home.

279
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,607
lt's still a little ways ahead.

280
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:54,671
lt is? Then let's walk.

281
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:00,541
Hawk-man, we're home.

282
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:02,817
lf you go any further,
you'll be on Courtship Road!

283
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:06,914
Yeah... we're here.

284
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:12,321
The rain has stopped.
l'd better go. Thanks.

285
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,553
No. l have to thank you instead.

286
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,131
""Lo-she,"" can we
see each other again?

287
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:25,665
Sure.

288
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:26,765
Bye.

289
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:29,037
Where do you live?
How do l find you?

290
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,772
l live by West Lake.

291
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:31,870
Bye.

292
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,444
Uncle.

293
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:43,580
Bye.

294
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,223
Bye.

295
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,257
Oh no, big trouble.

296
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,425
Bye.

297
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,938
Bye.

298
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,768
So pretty!
Sung, isn't she pretty?

299
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:07,876
You'd better not tell!

300
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:19,888
Take a look at yourself!
What is wrong with you?

301
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:23,722
l've told you again and again
to study hard.

302
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,359
Don't go outside and get
into trouble! You just don't listen!

303
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:28,425
Mother!

304
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,162
Even your mother
can't save you this time!

305
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,436
Look at the lion! You have all
but completely destroyed it!

306
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,503
ls this a sea lion or a mud lion?

307
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:43,975
Oh, son. You've ruined
your father's family treasure.

308
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,014
Apologize to your father at once

309
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,352
and then go back inside to study.

310
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:50,715
l didn't do anything wrong.

311
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,316
lt's not my fault. lt's...

312
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:53,589
lt's not my fault either.

313
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,890
Not your fault?
Then whose fault is it?

314
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:56,953
My fault?

315
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:58,688
Yes, it's yours!

316
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,997
You've locked me up like a prisoner
for over 10 years.

317
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:02,559
Don't you think you've gone too far?

318
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,865
l've gone too far?
You tell me.

319
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:08,533
Why did l retire and retreat
from the world of martial arts?

320
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:11,346
Why did l leave my home
and come here to live in seclusion?

321
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,040
For whom did l do all these things?

322
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,876
Fine. l'd rather beat you
to death myself...

323
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,452
than to let you
be killed by strangers.

324
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:20,020
l'll beat you...

325
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:23,513
l haven't done anything wrong!

326
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:26,989
Have you lost your mind?

327
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,326
Did you have to hit him on the face?

328
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,661
You want him disfigured...

329
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,300
so he will never be able
to marry?

330
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,394
What are you trying to do?

331
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,803
Have you gone mad?

332
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:50,144
Your father only talks tough.
He really does love you.

333
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:55,180
l know. l just don't want
to be locked up in the study...

334
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:57,589
facing nothing but four walls
and a stack of books all the time.

335
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,787
l know nothing of the world outside.

336
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:06,625
Who was that girl
who walked you home earlier?

337
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:08,764
Her name is ""Lo-she.""

338
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:09,826
""Lo-she""?

339
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:12,767
You mean Rose?

340
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,405
Yes, it's a western name.

341
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:18,077
ln Chinese,
that is the name of a flower.

342
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,007
Rose. What a nice name.

343
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:24,081
She is Chinese. Why does she
give herself a foreign name?

344
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:27,479
Those who study abroad
usually have a foreign name.

345
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,589
Your mother used to have one too.
lt's Diana.

346
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,492
""Di-wan-na""?

347
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:36,323
No. lt's Di-an-a.

348
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:38,891
lt sounds good.
Can you give me a foreign name too?

349
00:24:40,969 --> 00:24:42,095
How about Jackie?

350
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,159
Jackie?

351
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:44,227
What does Jackie mean?

352
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:45,667
There's no special meaning to it.

353
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:50,074
When l was in the Bronx,

354
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:53,912
l used to admire a hero.

355
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:56,109
His name was Jackie.

356
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:57,845
Rose also called me a hero.

357
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,409
All right. Jackie it is.

358
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:04,489
She called you a hero?
Then you have a chance!

359
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,320
Rose is both intelligent and pretty.

360
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,262
Listen, if she is a rat,

361
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:11,031
then you must be a cat
that catches the rat!

362
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,090
- How?
- Remember.

363
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,803
To woo such westernized girls,

364
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:21,531
you must always remember
to act like a hero.

365
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:25,969
When you are with her,
say ""yes"" often.

366
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:27,843
Yes?

367
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,082
Yes!

368
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,059
Mother wants me
to be a rat-catching cat.

369
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:43,863
l'm going to catch her.

370
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:46,924
The West Lake area is so big! You
didn't even ask her where she lives?

371
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:48,196
Where do we go to catch the rat?

372
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,603
West Lake is so beautiful,
even the girls are nicer looking.

373
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,707
Look. The rat is right there!

374
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:04,275
She threw me a love letter!

375
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,244
""We demand democracy!
Let science save our country!""

376
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:08,984
What does that mean?

377
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:10,183
l don't know.

378
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,893
""Lo-she."" Wait for me.

379
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,094
Rose... l'm here.

380
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,731
Hawk-man.
l've been looking for you.

381
00:26:20,802 --> 00:26:23,327
- How did you know l was here?
- My heart told me.

382
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:25,396
Rose, l have an English name too.

383
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:27,271
You can call me Jackie from now on.

384
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:28,571
Jackie.

385
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,503
Okay, l'll call you Jackie.

386
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,569
Yes!

387
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:35,180
- We're even more in tune now.
- Yes!

388
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:37,878
Why do you always say yes?

389
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,853
You say yes, so l say yes.

390
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:42,412
Okay, then why don't you help us
pass out these flyers?

391
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,754
- Yes!
- Don't keep saying ""yes.""

392
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:46,191
We have to get home.

393
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:50,397
l still have a rat to catch. Go home
and take care of my father for me.

394
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:51,454
Jackie!

395
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:52,522
Yes!

396
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:55,330
Democracy saves our country!

397
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:58,895
Anyone wants democracy?
Anyone wants science? lt's free!

398
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:00,964
lt's all free!

399
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,475
- What is this?
- This is a flyer.

400
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:03,533
What's a flyer?

401
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:07,878
We write what we want to say
on paper for you to read.

402
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:09,807
l can't read.

403
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,375
l'll read it to you.

404
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,353
We want to save our country
with democracy..

405
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,389
Right, you want rice
to make porridge.

406
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:17,857
l want your feces
to fertilize the fields.

407
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,187
We'll give feces, but you need
scientific fertilization.

408
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,252
Right.

409
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,793
Give way.

410
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:28,461
Let's get out of here! lt's the
death penalty if we get caught!

411
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,526
Death penalty
for saving the country?

412
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,935
Get out of here!

413
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:57,922
Come on.

414
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:24,452
Rose, there are
Ching soldiers. Run.

415
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:26,150
Where is Jackie?

416
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,389
He didn't run fast enough.
He might have gotten caught.

417
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,624
How could you leave him behind?

418
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,057
Give way.

419
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:36,860
Give way!

420
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,629
Get him!

421
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:42,298
Freeze!

422
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:45,803
Be careful!
Watch out for my shit...

423
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,442
Oh... lt's all gone!

424
00:28:57,993 --> 00:28:59,927
Jackie, are you all right?

425
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:01,053
l'm okay.

426
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:02,118
Hurry and run!

427
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,331
Run. l'll deal with this.

428
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,998
Don't worry.
Let me handle this man.

429
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:14,831
Yes.

430
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:17,802
Yeung-wan.

431
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:20,406
What are you doing here?

432
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:21,471
To arrest rebels.

433
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,611
Who is this?
He looks awfully familiar.

434
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,017
He is my good friend.

435
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:28,578
Yes.

436
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:32,816
Don't speak English
in front of me.

437
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,885
- Do you know who l am?
- Who?

438
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,021
- l am her fiancé.
- Fiancé?

439
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,531
l'm warning you.

440
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,467
Don't let me see you
with my fiancé again.

441
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:44,300
Wing, l have the freedom
to make friends.

442
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:46,738
Jackie, don't mind him.
Let's go.

443
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:53,313
Officer, the girl was passing out
propaganda. She must be a rebel!

444
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,372
She's Officer Tsao's daughter!
Not a rebel!

445
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,849
We grew up together.

446
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,113
My parents arranged our marriage
even before l was born.

447
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:00,313
Arranged marriage?

448
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:03,016
l thought you were opposed
to this kind of marriage.

449
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,525
l am, but if we share
the same ideas and goals in life,

450
00:30:05,593 --> 00:30:07,652
l might still marry him.

451
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,321
What if you don't?

452
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,026
Then l will...

453
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:12,892
Say no.

454
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:14,629
Say no?

455
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:17,171
Here is the place where l teach
and meet with my classmates.

456
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,197
Good-bye.

457
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:23,301
The size of England is so small
and China is so big.

458
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:26,142
Yet as soon as the English
threatened to fight,

459
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:29,809
the Ching Government was so frightened,
they gave Hong Kong up immediately.

460
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,614
lf this continues,
then maybe Shenzhen, Guangzhou

461
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,212
or even Hangzhou will become
colonies of England!

462
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:37,750
Yes, you are exactly right.

463
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,886
What are you doing here?

464
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,117
l...

465
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,093
l brought him here.

466
00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:45,257
This is where we discuss
serious business.

467
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,164
How can you bring in an outsider?

468
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,492
l trust him.

469
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:53,303
And l want him to join us
in our efforts to save the country.

470
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,866
- l want to join very much.
- You want to join us?

471
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,037
Then you must cut off the braid
on your head first.

472
00:30:58,113 --> 00:31:00,240
Cut my braid? Why?

473
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:04,342
Every club has its rules, and that's
just one of our initiation rules.

474
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,613
You all have braids!

475
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:06,676
We...

476
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,690
This is a national shame!
We have to cut it.

477
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,417
No, l cannot cut mine.

478
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,118
Are you afraid of execution?

479
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:16,630
Of course l'm afraid of execution,
but l'm even more afraid of my father.

480
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,664
We may be beheaded;
our blood may flow,

481
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:22,999
but we're not afraid of even
the Emperor or the Empress Dowager.

482
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:24,936
And you're afraid of your father?

483
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:27,167
- Are you going to cut or not?
- No.

484
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:29,836
Actually, cutting the braid
is only symbolic.

485
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,640
A great man once said:

486
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:34,443
To save the country, we must wake up
the masses and expel the foreigners.

487
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,743
Right, right.
This theory is so right.

488
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:37,874
Brownnoser!

489
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,852
- Do you even understand?
- Yes.

490
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,844
l don't really understand.

491
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:50,694
Why isn't he back yet?

492
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,503
Have you seen
all your patients already?

493
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:01,567
Hawk-man, do you understand or not?

494
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,243
Understanding is not understanding.
Understanding is understanding.

495
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,314
Not understanding
is misunderstanding.

496
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,647
You open this door now.
Do you hear me?

497
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:12,775
He's totally confused.

498
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,755
l just checked on Hawk-man.

499
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:18,517
He... he stayed up studying all night.
Now he has the flu.

500
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,149
Flu?

501
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,259
Better not let it turn into pneumonia.

502
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:25,322
So don't go in there to bother him.

503
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,231
Go get him his medication instead.
Hurry!

504
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:28,530
l'm on my way now.

505
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:35,868
- Stop reciting. Where is he?
- l don't know.

506
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:36,933
Mother.

507
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:39,206
What took you so long?
You almost got me into trouble.

508
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,271
You've been gone for over half a day!
Now tell me.

509
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,112
Any progress on your rat-catching?

510
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:44,242
Not really.

511
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,581
Oh, Mother.

512
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,712
What does ""say no"" mean?

513
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,150
That means rejection.

514
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,782
Why? Did Rose say no to you?

515
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,223
No. Mother,
can you teach me English?

516
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:57,897
What brought this on all of a sudden?

517
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,665
Rose and her classmates
are always speaking English.

518
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,097
And l don't understand a word of it.

519
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,539
Now l realize
how big the outside world is,

520
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,867
and there is so much to learn!

521
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,876
That's right.
There is no end to learning.

522
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:14,775
You want to learn English? No problem.
You can count on your mother.

523
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,483
He is my father.

524
00:33:21,055 --> 00:33:23,319
He is my ""flour.""

525
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,187
Repeat after me.
He is my father.

526
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:30,559
He is my father.

527
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,056
Hmm... passed.

528
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:38,501
She is my mother.

529
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,973
She is my ""mudda.""

530
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,307
Mother, l'm not so bad, right?

531
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,173
No, you're not so bad.

532
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:48,408
You're REALLY bad!

533
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:50,880
Son, l didn't scare you, did l?

534
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:52,580
You're worse than Father!

535
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:56,582
l have to if you really
want to catch the rat.

536
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,057
Do you understand, son?

537
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,388
l understand, Mother.

538
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,921
But don't just teach me
""she is my mudda.""

539
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:05,395
What would you like to learn?

540
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,794
Teach me how to say ""ngo oi nay""
in English.

541
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:11,432
That's my boy.

542
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:19,304
""Ngo oi nay"" is... l love you.

543
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:24,675
l love you...

544
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:25,776
Rose.

545
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,682
Mother, was l right?

546
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:30,421
Right. Right.

547
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:35,890
l hope you don't completely forget
about your mother when you have a wife.

548
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:39,800
An empty room is lighted only
by an opium pipe.

549
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:43,126
Two shoulders hunched back
in a corner.

550
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:46,302
He does not know
when his next meal will come.

551
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:49,768
His clothes for all seasons
have long been sold.

552
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:56,106
Hurry up. Move!

553
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,448
Faster. Faster!

554
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:10,827
Little girl,
don't make so much noise here.

555
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,694
Why don't you make noise
in my bed instead!

556
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:14,962
What are you doing?

557
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:40,251
Roundabout Lotus.

558
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,619
Palm in the Face.

559
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,686
Great, Jackie!

560
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,622
Good as Sealed.

561
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:48,624
Wild Horse Stance.

562
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:52,771
Yang's Tai Chi?

563
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,152
Jackie, watch out!

564
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,790
That's amazing!

565
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,859
No wonder he didn't want
to cut off his braid!

566
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:23,926
Yes.

567
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,772
What are you afraid of?

568
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:52,688
Opium!

569
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:57,793
Get lost!

570
00:36:58,473 --> 00:36:59,462
Get lost!

571
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:05,674
What's going on?
What's all the commotion?

572
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,814
Arrest all the troublemakers!

573
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:11,451
Daddy, the tea leaf boxes
are full of opium!

574
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,009
Opium?

575
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:18,087
Move!

576
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:20,950
Move!

577
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,220
Jackie, are you all right?

578
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:26,129
l'm fine. What's going on?

579
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,031
You've just earned a medal of merit.

580
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:29,296
You have uncovered
the foreigners' conspiracy.

581
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,496
Me?

582
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:35,235
l heard there was a commotion at
the pier. l am here to secure the area.

583
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:37,039
You may leave now.

584
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,102
l am the Customs Officer.

585
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:42,012
Someone is trying
to smuggle opium here.

586
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:43,846
l cannot just walk away.

587
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,046
l am afraid this is over your head.

588
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:51,851
The Great Britain West lndian Company
is behind my boss.

589
00:37:52,693 --> 00:37:54,490
Can you afford to mess with them?

590
00:37:55,763 --> 00:37:57,287
Wise up.

591
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:01,734
Just go home
and pretend you saw nothing.

592
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,863
l will take care of everything here.

593
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:06,998
Many eyes are on us.
We have to do the right thing.

594
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,168
Move the tea leaves
into the warehouse.

595
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:12,109
What are you going to do?

596
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,613
Burn the opium!

597
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,039
Burn the opium!

598
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:18,017
Good.

599
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,548
Daddy, good job!

600
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:21,210
Let's go!

601
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:39,865
The opium was taken away by the Customs
Officer right from your hands.

602
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:42,670
You'd better get them back for me.

603
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,404
Don't say l haven't warned you.

604
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:50,210
Mr. Smith, if you must,
you should blame your two goons.

605
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:51,811
They started the trouble at the pier.

606
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:55,185
Troublemakers were those on the pier
calling for people to quit opium.

607
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,417
They were obviously against me.

608
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,719
You should have them all arrested.

609
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,932
How dare you threaten an official!
l will have you arrested!

610
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:14,934
Arrest me? Even your Empress Dowager
bows before us Englishmen!

611
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:18,941
A martial arts scholar like you
means nothing.

612
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,373
Let me tell you.
You are standing on Chinese soil.

613
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:24,383
Your arrogance and illegal dealings
will not be tolerated.

614
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:25,851
Follow me to the court!

615
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:35,251
Mr. Smith, l will take care
of the opium business. Good day.

616
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:37,259
Brother Wing, let's go.

617
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:42,936
Brother Wing, let's go!

618
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,880
What are you all doing?

619
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:59,913
Master, please allow your students
to bow before you.

620
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:01,512
l am not good enough
to be your teacher!

621
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,717
l have not studied abroad,
and l didn't cut my braid.

622
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:05,850
lt was a good thing
you didn't cut off your braid.

623
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:07,758
Please teach us your Braid Stance.

624
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:10,190
So we no longer need to worry
when we're walking in the dark.

625
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,529
And we no longer need to run for
our lives when passing out flyers.

626
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:15,733
But... all your braids are fake!

627
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,163
l'm afraid learning
the Braid Stance is impossible.

628
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:22,703
lt's all your fault.
You told us to cut our braids!

629
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:29,412
Master, our braids are real.
You can teach us.

630
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,576
All right.

631
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:34,376
But learning the Braid Stance
is not easy!

632
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:35,855
What do we have to do?

633
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:39,950
l have put in over 10 years
of hard work and serious studying.

634
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:41,789
We will too!

635
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:44,693
Master, we will work hard too!

636
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,962
Good. Then let's get started.

637
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:52,034
""The sutra of three words.

638
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:56,133
Create new ideas.

639
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,270
Learn scientific knowledge.""

640
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,144
lf you don't study hard. you won't
be able to learn the Braid Stance.

641
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:05,515
""Uncover the truth.

642
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:10,751
Not afraid of sufferings.""

643
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:14,260
l didn't know you are
so good with children.

644
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,159
Did you really learn
the Braid Stance this way?

645
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,528
Yes.

646
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:19,725
Actually. l should
really thank my father.

647
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:23,434
Stick in hand. he pushed me
to study hard since l was very young.

648
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:24,630
He's made me what l am today.

649
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:26,570
Do you have a good relationship
with your father?

650
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,575
Not at all. We rarely talk.

651
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:31,305
But he really
sacrificed a lot for me.

652
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:33,139
l am very grateful to him.

653
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:37,115
My dad is good to me too.
except we have a generation gap.

654
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:40,354
l hate it when he smokes opium.
but he can't quit.

655
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:43,682
My father was best
at helping people quit opium.

656
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:45,449
Do you know how?

657
00:41:45,593 --> 00:41:47,356
Sure. it's not that hard.

658
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:02,599
Daddy. Jackie has come
to visit you.

659
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:08,070
Uncle Tsao.

660
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,781
Rose. you're good
at choosing boyfriends.

661
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:16,112
Daddy. what are you talking about?

662
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:18,052
l brought Jackie here to treat you.

663
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:22,221
Treat me of what? l'm not sick.
See how strong l am!

664
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:24,322
This is your sickness.

665
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:25,387
Give that back to me.

666
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,865
You call this sick?

667
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:30,335
Take one puff
and you're in seventh heaven.

668
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:32,935
That kind of pleasure
you simply don't understand.

669
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:34,763
Jackie.

670
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:38,373
Let me show you what pleasure is.

671
00:42:38,412 --> 00:42:43,076
Once you give it a try. you will not
want to let go. lt's wonderful!

672
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:44,273
No. thank you.

673
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:51,057
l go here. you go here.
l go there. you go there.

674
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:05,294
Follow me.

675
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:08,733
Come on.
Over here. over there.

676
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:12,572
Jackie. be careful!
Don't hurt my father.

677
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:14,107
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

678
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:25,755
What kind of kung fu
is this. Jackie?

679
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,886
My hand is stuck to you.

680
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:30,759
This is Tai Chi's Gluey Stance.

681
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:33,664
Once l'm glued on to you.
you can't shake me off.

682
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:40,999
l can't believe
you've learned this at your age.

683
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:50,875
Please have a seat.

684
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:52,919
Uncle Tsao. please pardon me.

685
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:57,890
lf you learn this kung fu.

686
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:01,257
you will have a long and happy life.

687
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:08,164
Now. relax. Close your eyes.

688
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:11,966
Close your eyes.

689
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:15,706
Relax.

690
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:19,539
That's right. Close your eyes.

691
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:20,705
That's right.

692
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:24,807
What are you doing?

693
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,580
What kind of kung fu is this now?

694
00:44:26,654 --> 00:44:29,589
This is Jackie's family's
exclusive Quit Smoking Stance.

695
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,891
What? You're trying to make me
quit smoking opium again?

696
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:37,122
Uncle Tsao. Rose only wants
what's good for you.

697
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:39,891
Opium is harmful.
and once you're addicted to it.

698
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:42,664
you'll really go to heaven!

699
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,536
That's right. Daddy.
Opium is even prohibited in England.

700
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:49,599
They sell them in China
to poison our people.

701
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:52,202
As a prohibition officer.
you should set an example for others.

702
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:54,710
Don't you understand?

703
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,075
lt's easier said than done.

704
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:01,551
Ever since your mother passed away.

705
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:06,025
l only have you and my pipe left.

706
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:09,893
You're not always by my side.
Without my pipe.

707
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:13,497
l really don't know how to
make it through the days.

708
00:45:14,268 --> 00:45:16,236
Fine. lf you need the pipe.

709
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,567
then you don't need me.
lt's your call.

710
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:23,199
lf you choose the pipe.
then l'll go back to America.

711
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:26,236
Stay where you are!
Where are you going?

712
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:27,746
Back to America.
l'm never coming back.

713
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:28,873
You come back here!

714
00:45:29,283 --> 00:45:31,615
Of course. l'll choose you.

715
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,421
For this daughter of mine. l've
already tried to quit so many times.

716
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:39,849
Are you sure this works?

717
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:43,190
Sure. lt works every time.
Don't worry.

718
00:45:45,065 --> 00:45:47,090
Then how long
do l have to be tied up?

719
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:51,261
That depends. lt could be as little
as three to five days.

720
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:53,602
or as long as three to five years.

721
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:56,167
Three to five years? Then...

722
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,677
Daddy. are you going back
on your word?

723
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:58,769
No... no.

724
00:45:59,413 --> 00:46:01,347
l was just thinking.
if this really works.

725
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:05,449
maybe Jackie should work
on my soldiers too.

726
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,543
Good idea!

727
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:11,717
Jackie will discipline and reform
your armed forces. Okay?

728
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:12,987
Yeah.

729
00:46:13,027 --> 00:46:14,016
Jackie. let's go.

730
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:15,083
Okay.

731
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:24,034
Gather your strength like the bow.
Then release your punch like an arrow.

732
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:41,281
Look at yourselves. How can you
protect your country like this?

733
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:49,394
Miss. you're only watching.
You have no idea how difficult it is.

734
00:46:49,496 --> 00:46:51,896
l know you're
going through withdrawal.

735
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:55,764
Look at you. You can't even
hold up your opium pipe now!

736
00:46:57,004 --> 00:47:00,701
When we practiced with Officer Tsao. he
would usually take a few puffs with us.

737
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:03,843
lf you let us
take a couple of puffs.

738
00:47:03,911 --> 00:47:07,039
l guarantee you
we'll be as fierce as tigers.

739
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:09,071
Shut up!

740
00:47:10,484 --> 00:47:12,111
Jackie. take care of them.

741
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:16,547
Listen. Officer Tsao
has brought me in to treat you.

742
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:19,691
lf you're smart.
drop your opium pipes.

743
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:22,693
Otherwise. Officer Tsao
will be your good example.

744
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:26,088
Yeung-wan.

745
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,290
Why have you come here?

746
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:29,925
What is he doing here?

747
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:31,660
Daddy invited him here.

748
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:35,599
Rebel.

749
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:40,874
For Yeung-wan's sake.
l let you go last time.

750
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:43,109
Now here you are again.
trying to swindle your way through.

751
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:45,983
Mr. Lam. l have been to school too.

752
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:49,882
l don't think l could live up
to the word ""swindle"".

753
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:57,085
Pardon me.

754
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:08,941
What are you doing?

755
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:10,840
Nothing. l was just testing him.

756
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:12,173
You got some nerve.

757
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,905
Let's go over there.

758
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:16,415
Fine. Keep it up. Jackie.

759
00:48:19,553 --> 00:48:20,918
What are you looking at?

760
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,223
Why are you here?

761
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,553
Have you forgotten?

762
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,549
What is it?

763
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:30,293
lt's my birthday in two days.

764
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:31,353
Really!

765
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,926
l'm throwing a party.

766
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:36,458
l hope you can come.

767
00:48:40,307 --> 00:48:42,104
Sure. l'll be there.

768
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,977
Yeung-wan.
Let's have a seat.

769
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:56,453
You always keep company
with those poor classmates of yours.

770
00:48:56,924 --> 00:49:00,291
And carry on about saving the country
with democracy and science.

771
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:02,861
Do you know you can be
beheaded for this?

772
00:49:04,698 --> 00:49:05,687
l know.

773
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,261
We don't share the same beliefs
and goals anymore.

774
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:12,965
- lt just doesn't feel right.
- Not right?

775
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:20,340
You're saying you don't feel right
with me anymore.

776
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:22,507
but you feel it's right with him!

777
00:49:22,783 --> 00:49:23,943
What are you talking about?

778
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:25,979
You've completely changed.

779
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:28,384
You bury your conscience.

780
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:29,614
You and your brother

781
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,851
conspire with the foreigners
to smuggle opium.

782
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:34,018
Don't put my brother and l together.

783
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:36,255
l have nothing to do
with his opium smuggling.

784
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,730
l only want to get ahead
and make my ancestors proud.

785
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:42,792
l want you to be able to enjoy wealth
and comfort. lt's all for you.

786
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,927
Don't talk anymore.
lf you keep it up.

787
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:47,703
l don't think l'd even want to come
to your party anymore!

788
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:51,270
All right.
l'll let you cool off.

789
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:55,845
l hope to see your happy face
at the party.

790
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,154
Rose. what is it?

791
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:10,252
Nothing.

792
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:13,065
Did l cause a fight
between the two of you?

793
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:14,122
No.

794
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:17,066
Do you know how to dance?

795
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:19,002
Sure. l know
the Chinese tea dance.

796
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:35,451
Not tea dance. lt's tango!

797
00:50:37,157 --> 00:50:39,250
Tango? Never heard of it.

798
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:40,987
Maybe you can show me?

799
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:42,426
Okay.

800
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,120
l'm back!

801
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:46,721
You're early.

802
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:48,356
Frying fish. Mother?

803
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:51,033
Look at you.
You're all smiles.

804
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:52,435
Did you catch the rat?

805
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:54,030
Rose took me to her house.

806
00:50:54,107 --> 00:50:56,132
She even asked me
to be her partner at a party!

807
00:50:56,543 --> 00:51:01,207
That's good news.
l'll be a grandmother soon!

808
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:03,644
Mother. you're way ahead of me.

809
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:07,545
Rose wants me to ""tango.""
but l have no idea what it is!

810
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:10,654
You're in luck.

811
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:13,424
Your mother
will teach you everything.

812
00:51:15,596 --> 00:51:17,826
Slow. slow. quick. quick.

813
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:21,165
Slow. slow. quick. quick.

814
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,899
Son. did you watch closely?

815
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:31,569
Mother. please teach me.

816
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,634
Come on. l'll show you.

817
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,578
Slow. slow. quick. quick.

818
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:41,848
Slow. slow. quick. quick.

819
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:45,119
Did l step on you?

820
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:48,788
l'm fine. One more. Again.

821
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,098
Slow. slow. quick. quick.

822
00:51:57,204 --> 00:52:01,140
Turn. turn. turn.

823
00:52:04,578 --> 00:52:06,546
Mother. let's stop.

824
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:08,438
Why?

825
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:09,812
You're going to hurt yourself.

826
00:52:10,384 --> 00:52:13,751
l'm fine.
lf you step on me again.

827
00:52:13,987 --> 00:52:16,979
l won't make a sound.
Come on. Again.

828
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:19,658
Turn. Hold my hand.

829
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:22,528
Good.

830
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:24,691
Slow. Ouch.

831
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:26,291
Slow.

832
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:27,856
Slow.

833
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:35,498
l'm sorry.
Did l do it again?

834
00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:41,545
Ouch. Watch it. okay?

835
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:46,211
What are you complaining about now?
You asked for it.

836
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:48,283
You just know
how to pour salt on wounds.

837
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:51,882
Me? Do you think your son
would be as good to you?

838
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:58,592
That's true. You are good to me.
Now massage here.

839
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:01,323
That feels good!

840
00:53:01,535 --> 00:53:02,627
l know.

841
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:07,035
There's something
l don't want to keep from you.

842
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:09,875
Today. your son was in a fight
with the bodyguards of a foreigner.

843
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:13,037
Fight? Did they
break his arms and legs?

844
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:18,877
That you don't have to worry.

845
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,453
Let me tell you.

846
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:26,658
lt was one against many. and he
defeated the foreigner's bodyguards.

847
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,385
He even uncovered the foreigner's
conspiracy to smuggle opium

848
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:31,590
and became a hero in Hangzhou.

849
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:33,829
What?

850
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,301
He fought with the foreigner's
bodyguards and came back in one piece?

851
00:53:38,372 --> 00:53:39,498
How did he do it?

852
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:23,104
Who is it?

853
00:54:25,986 --> 00:54:27,146
What are you doing here?

854
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:29,151
You don't even recognize
your old man?

855
00:54:36,263 --> 00:54:39,061
Great Kick of the North?
You were defeated by my father.

856
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:40,989
Are you too embarrassed
to show your face?

857
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:43,229
You have no manners.
Let me teach you a lesson.

858
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:00,542
You come down.

859
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:03,244
You come up.

860
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:05,051
You don't want to come down?

861
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:15,130
Are you planning on spending
the rest of your life up there?

862
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:17,265
l'm coming down. l'm coming.

863
00:55:25,145 --> 00:55:26,339
l've changed my mind now.

864
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:27,971
lf you're so good.
why don't you come up?

865
00:55:32,886 --> 00:55:34,854
What are you looking at?
Make your move.

866
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:43,760
Can't hit my own son.

867
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:48,064
Why did you stop?

868
00:55:49,002 --> 00:55:51,493
You think you can get around
with your kung fu?

869
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:54,101
l didn't know
that besides your dog's kick.

870
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,368
you also have a pig's claw!

871
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,972
Little bastard.
watch your tongue!

872
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:01,237
Your parents didn't teach you
any manners!

873
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:03,738
Stomping Fists.

874
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:06,344
Grounding Punch.

875
00:56:07,187 --> 00:56:08,381
Continuous Punches.

876
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:18,389
Kid. let me teach you.

877
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:22,327
White Snake Stance.

878
00:56:23,303 --> 00:56:24,463
Rolling Stance.

How do you know Tai Chi Fists?

884
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,891
You are so ignorant.

885
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,361
Your father is not the only one
who knows Tai Chi Fists.

886
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,003
Where did you learn
your Mantis Fists?

887
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:13,145
l taught myself from books!

888
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,955
Then let me show you
the real Mantis Stance.

889

Oh. my antiques!
That's 50 taels of silver!

Let me teach you a lesson.

892
00:57:50,724 --> 00:57:52,123

So what if you are!

901
00:58:43,977 --> 00:58:47,310
What's with you today?
lt's getting late.

902
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,543
Get up for breakfast even if you
don't want to practice Tai Chi.

903
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:54,981
What happened to your face?

904
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,784
l have a toothache.

905
00:58:57,457 --> 00:58:59,049
Let me take a look.

906
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,923
That's not a toothache.
lt looks more like a chain rash.

907
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:04,156
You don't know
what you're talking about.

908
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:08,257
Chain rash grows on the waist. not on
the face. l said it's a toothache.

909
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:11,427
All right. lt's a toothache.

Let me get you some medicine then.

911
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:16,467
Wait! Who said l wanted medicine?

912
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:17,874
Don't try to be smart.

913
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:20,711
You're wasting my time.

914
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:23,609
Good morning. Mother.

915
00:59:26,886 --> 00:59:28,820
Mother. what's wrong with Father?

916
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:32,581
He said he has
a really bad toothache.

917
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:36,619
Why are you just standing there?

918
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:39,460
He's your father.
Go see how he is.

919
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:42,691
Father. l've come to see you.

920
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:43,929
A toothache is nothing to see.

921
00:59:44,003 --> 00:59:44,992
Go back to study!

922
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:48,104
What is wrong with you today?

923
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:53,512
Don't worry. Mother. l think
Father can stand a little pain.

924
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:56,777
l did it to him last night.

925
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,841
- Really?
- Yes.

926
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:02,210
What's up?

927
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:04,848
- Rose invited me to a party tonight.
- Party.

928
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:06,721
l would like Mother
to be my image consultant.

929
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:08,090
Sure. No problem.

930
01:00:10,897 --> 01:00:12,262

Little bastard.

Don't get in my way!
l have a rat to catch.

938
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,315
What is your relationship
with Yang?

939
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:07,141
Tell me!

940
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:11,648
lt's you. The Great Limp?
Not limping anymore?

941

You don't have a toothache anymore?
Now your neck?

01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,280
Great Kick of the North?

950
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:50,291

The loser will disappear from here.

1035
01:08:03,903 --> 01:08:06,201
What? You think l'm a prize?

1036
01:08:06,906 --> 01:08:08,874
That's right.
She is not a prize.

1037
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:10,135
l won't fight.

1038
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:11,699
Then stop acting like Romeo!

1039
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:14,610
Wing. please be rational.

1040
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,279
Even if you were to win.

1041
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:18,806
You're asking me?
You are my fiancé!

You must win!

Yes. lf l lose. l won't be able
to face my mother!

1044

Come on!

1045
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:56,110
Are you all right?

1046
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:57,212
You belong to me!

1047
01:09:02,995 --> 01:09:04,189
Don't fight if you can't manage.

1048
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:06,026
Don't worry.
l won't let my mother down.

1049

Let's go.

1057

You've lost the girl
to another man.

1058
01:11:52,398 --> 01:11:55,629
Let us send you to heaven
and you can wait for her there.

1059
01:13:42,107 --> 01:13:44,166
Take him to Lam Tung
in the Governor's Mansion.

1060
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:46,842
Just say Jackie killed him
because of the girl.

1061
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:50,641
Then we will be able to create a feud
between the Lam and Tsao families.

1062
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:53,344
Good idea.
l'll take care of it.

1063
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
l'll wait for your good news.

1064
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:15,869
What is it?
You're not happy?

1065
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:17,906
You have no smile
on your face either.

1066
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:20,138
Do you always have to follow me?

1067
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:24,310
l can follow you too.

1068
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,609
Really?

1069
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:30,946
Rose. l love you.

1070
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:36,788
Did l say something wrong?

1071
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:39,620
You fool.

1072
01:14:41,467 --> 01:14:42,991
Yes. l am the biggest fool!

1073
01:14:43,135 --> 01:14:45,831
l'll go home to talk to my mother.
She'll talk to my father.

1074
01:14:45,904 --> 01:14:47,633
Then my father
will talk to your father.

1075
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,571
Then ask my Dad to marry you!

1076
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:52,338
This is between the two of us.

1077
01:14:53,545 --> 01:14:55,445
This is tradition.

1078
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,016
Officer Tsao.

1079
01:15:09,094 --> 01:15:10,459
Welcome.

1080
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:12,554
- Auntie.
- Rose.

1081
01:15:12,798 --> 01:15:14,231
You look so beautiful today.

1082
01:15:14,299 --> 01:15:15,357
Thank you.

1083
01:15:15,434 --> 01:15:17,994
l haven't worn this old rag
for over 20 years!

1084
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,368
l brought it out yesterday.
Hope l didn't embarrass myself!

1085
01:15:20,873 --> 01:15:22,431
You are too humble.

1086
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:25,007
This is the latest fashion
in America.

1087
01:15:25,077 --> 01:15:27,238
You are so kind!

1088
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:31,907
Mr. Yang.

1089
01:15:31,984 --> 01:15:36,318
What do you think of this marriage
between Rose and Jackie?

1090
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:39,088
Who's Rose and Jackie?

1091
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:43,257
ls their marriage
any of my business?

1092
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,359
Father. l'm Jackie!

1093
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,357
You? You are Jackie?

1094
01:15:50,269 --> 01:15:52,328
Rose. you're going to America
for your honeymoon?

1095
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:55,636
That's great! Jackie's father
and l will go with you.

1096
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,005
A second honeymoon!

1097
01:15:57,076 --> 01:15:58,407
Oh. that would be wonderful!

1098
01:16:07,753 --> 01:16:13,714
My daughter
is idealistic and kindhearted.

1099
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,993
But just a little bit spoiled.

1100
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:21,723
Daddy!

1101
01:16:25,003 --> 01:16:25,992
See?

1102
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:30,041
Your Jackie
is completely different.

1103
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:36,105
He is well-educated and well-mannered.
He must have come from a good family.

1104
01:16:36,181 --> 01:16:37,978
You flatter me.

1105
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:41,015
Uncle Tsao. it was really
all my father's hard work.

1106
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:42,876
Yes. Yes.

1107
01:16:42,955 --> 01:16:45,788
Mr. Tsao. you're too kind.

1108
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,755
Mr. Yang. you're too modest.

1109
01:16:47,793 --> 01:16:49,988
Daddy. actually.

1110
01:16:50,129 --> 01:16:53,155
it was Auntie who did the most.

1111
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:57,635
Oh. no. it was all
my husband's doing.

1112
01:16:58,003 --> 01:16:59,231
No. no.

1113
01:16:59,605 --> 01:17:03,234
Mr. Tsao was able to quit smoking
opium. l admire your determination.

1114
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:04,297
Thank you.

1115
01:17:04,376 --> 01:17:07,004
lt looks to me that
they are a perfect match.

1116
01:17:07,613 --> 01:17:10,878
So we've agreed on Jackie
and Rose's wedding then.

1117
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:12,416
lt's a deal.

1118
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:14,679
lt's a deal!

1119
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:16,448
Right.

1120
01:17:18,157 --> 01:17:19,215
Mommy.

1121
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:20,315
Good girl.

1122
01:17:23,695 --> 01:17:25,993
Secure the whole place.
Allow no one to leave.

1123
01:17:31,403 --> 01:17:33,428
Officer Lam. why did you
bring your troops to my home?

1124
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,564
What is going on?

1125
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:38,008
What's going on?
Ask your precious daughter!

1126
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:39,933
And him too!

1127
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:41,937
The two of them
murdered my brother!

1128
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:44,078
What? They murdered someone?

1129
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:45,138
We didn't kill anyone!

1130
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:48,112
Officer Lam. how can you come up
with such a ridiculous accusation?

1131
01:17:48,353 --> 01:17:50,082
Accusation?

1132
01:17:50,155 --> 01:17:54,216
Wing was your fiancé. How could you
murder him with your lover?

1133
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:57,491
l must avenge my brother's death.

1134
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:00,289
Will you come with me voluntarily.
or will l have to arrest you?

1135
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:04,199
Father. Mother.
you don't have to worry.

1136
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:07,168
l will go with them
to clear everything up.

1137
01:18:08,173 --> 01:18:09,162
Take care of yourselves.

1138
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:10,903
Stop! Come back!

1139
01:18:13,111 --> 01:18:17,013
Officer Lam. this son of mine
may not be perfect.

1140
01:18:17,616 --> 01:18:20,517
but l don't think
he is capable of murder.

1141
01:18:20,886 --> 01:18:24,049
You... You're still trying
to protect your son?

1142
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:25,814
Arrest everyone for me.

1143
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:39,699
l retired from martial arts
for my son ten years ago.

1144
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:42,802
Now. for him.
l will come out of retirement.

1145
01:18:43,141 --> 01:18:44,233
Hawk-man. you all go!

1146
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:46,904
Father. we'll fight them together.
father and son.

1147
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:50,043
You dare resist arrest?
Kill them all!

1148
01:19:00,425 --> 01:19:02,086
What are you still doing here?

1149
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,149
Be careful.

1150
01:19:13,472 --> 01:19:14,803
Old man. are you all right?

1151
01:19:15,007 --> 01:19:16,235
Why are you still here?

1152
01:19:16,608 --> 01:19:20,305
l married you for better or for worse.
l'm now staying for worse!

1153
01:19:21,046 --> 01:19:22,035
Good wife!

1154
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:38,524
Dear. let's go.

1155
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:43,429
- What are you all doing?
- Rose. you've come at the right time.

1156
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:47,131
We saw Smith kill Lam Wing. He was
going to frame you two for murder.

1157
01:19:47,205 --> 01:19:48,194
What are you making?

1158
01:19:48,273 --> 01:19:49,501
Bombs. To take care of Smith!

1159
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:51,968
We found out he's going to steal
the smuggled opium tonight!

1160
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:53,868
Where?

1161
01:21:07,986 --> 01:21:09,248
Jackie. behind you!

1162
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:35,836
Go to the Customs Office warehouse
and get my opium back!

1163
01:22:11,016 --> 01:22:12,005
Get the opium!

1164
01:22:38,944 --> 01:22:40,775
Chan. how are you?

1165
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:44,606
l'm cold.

1166
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:48,814
Chan!

1167
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:05,429
You are lucky.
but l won't miss in my next shot.

1168
01:23:07,005 --> 01:23:09,530
You come here to rob and kill.

1169
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:12,577
- You will not get away with this!
- So what are you going to do?

1170
01:23:13,778 --> 01:23:16,246
You're the real murderer!
You disgusting scum!

1171
01:23:16,348 --> 01:23:17,542
You who killed Lam Wing!

1172
01:23:17,616 --> 01:23:19,743
Now l'm sending you to see him.

1173
01:23:41,606 --> 01:23:44,575
White devil. using foreign
secret weapons to kill is despicable!

1174
01:25:28,046 --> 01:25:29,035
l'll take your life!

1175
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,561
This stance again?
l know it too!

1176
01:27:32,737 --> 01:27:34,671
Come. let me play with you.

1177
01:27:35,073 --> 01:27:38,099
Kid. this guy has a very strong kick.
Be extra careful.

1178
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:41,607
Strong?
l'll stomp till they are weak!

1179
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,409
Good boy. l'll grant you
number one in the world!

1180
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:21,475
What kind of kung fu is that?

1181
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:24,351
lt's my Braid Stance created
especially for bad guys like you!

1182
01:28:31,062 --> 01:28:32,188
Pretty powerful. eh?

1183
01:28:38,403 --> 01:28:39,700
From under the arm.

1184
01:28:43,808 --> 01:28:44,968
From between the legs.

1185
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:54,582
l'll kick you to hell!

1186
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:03,950
The Flying Stance.

1187
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,840
Dumb ox. you'd better come with me
to turn yourself in.

1188
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,543
l'm going to kill you today!

1189
01:29:26,618 --> 01:29:27,607
Come on.

1190
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,566
Dumb ox. if you don't surrender.

1191
01:29:45,069 --> 01:29:47,902
after l'm through with you. even your
own mother won't recognize you!

1192
01:30:10,995 --> 01:30:13,156
l go for your big fat nose!

1193
01:30:20,204 --> 01:30:22,195
Play with me on the rope?
You'll be sorry!

1194
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,399
Now l go for your ugly face!

1195
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:32,872
Are you awake?

1196
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:39,445
Single lncense Stance.

1197
01:30:46,097 --> 01:30:47,291
Still hanging in there?

1198
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:58,065
Sweeping Army Stance.

1199
01:32:07,879 --> 01:32:08,937
Are you all right?

1200
01:32:09,013 --> 01:32:10,037
l am fine.

1201
01:32:10,114 --> 01:32:11,172
ls he dead?

1202
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:13,080
lf not. he's close to it.

1203
01:32:13,918 --> 01:32:14,907
Get away!

1204
01:32:24,295 --> 01:32:25,284
Are you all right?

1205
01:32:25,897 --> 01:32:26,886
l'm fine.

1206
01:32:27,765 --> 01:32:29,596
What is this?
Foreign weapon?

1207
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:30,929
Careful! The gun may misfire.

1208
01:32:31,002 --> 01:32:32,094
Stay away!

1209
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:58,217
l said l would
teach you a lesson.

1210
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,289
Everyone freeze!

1211
01:34:13,971 --> 01:34:15,563
Your brother's murderer
is over there.

1212
01:34:15,907 --> 01:34:16,896
Get him!

1213
01:34:16,974 --> 01:34:18,339
HE'S the murderer!

1214
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:21,139
You're the real one
who killed my brother!

1215
01:34:22,914 --> 01:34:26,372
Don't move!
l am a citizen of Great Britain.

1216
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:30,211
l am under the protection
of the Queen.

1217
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:31,946
Order your subordinates
to drop their weapons!

1218
01:34:32,023 --> 01:34:33,012
Drop the guns now!

1219
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:43,691
Despicable scum.
he deserved to die.

1220
01:34:43,768 --> 01:34:44,962
Take him away!

1221
01:34:45,036 --> 01:34:46,025
Yes. sir!

1222
01:34:49,607 --> 01:34:53,304
By the way. l have to thank you
for avenging my brother's death.

1223
01:34:55,947 --> 01:34:56,936
Let's go.

1224
01:34:57,014 --> 01:34:59,005
That's right.
We still have a wedding to plan.

1225
01:35:00,017 --> 01:35:01,109
Whatever you say!

1226
01:35:05,723 --> 01:35:09,159
This is the happiest day of my life!

1227
01:35:09,927 --> 01:35:11,224
Honey!
