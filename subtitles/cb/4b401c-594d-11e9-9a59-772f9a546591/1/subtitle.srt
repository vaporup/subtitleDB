1
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:22,143
The summer I was 8 years old,

2
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,991
5 hours disappeared from my life.

3
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,752
5 hours... Lost.

4
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:30,187
Gone without a trace.

5
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:41,350
I remember sitting on
the bench at my Little League game.

6
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,544
It started to rain.

7
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,068
But what happened after that
remains a pitch black void.

8
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:49,826
Brian ?

9
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,230
You dork.
What the heck are you doing in there ?

10
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,144
You're bleeding.

11
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:13,065
- lt is terrible out there.
- Mom !

12
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:15,701
Hello, sweetheart.
What happened to you ?

13
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,222
Brian got a bloody nose
hiding in the cellar.

14
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,343
What were you doing down there ?

15
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,668
Are you okay, sweetheart ?

16
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,231
Poor little baby.

17
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,306
They had me all night
in that mailroom.

18
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:30,345
l didn't even know
it was raining.

19
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,070
Hold still.

20
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:35,026
Did another mom
give you a ride home ?

21
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:38,028
- Goodnight.
- l hope you're happy.

22
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:40,826
l knew he'd get hurt
playing sports.

23
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:44,469
When l was a kid,
l wasn't a star player either.

24
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,908
But at least l wasn't a quitter.

25
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,465
Sorry, dad.

26
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,306
Goodnight.

27
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:59,181
l told your father
Little League was a stupid idea.

28
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,190
Hold your nose.

29
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,345
Mom made me
quit baseball the next day.

30
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,546
This was when the nightmares began.

31
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:30,306
And the nosebleeds.

32
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,942
I wet the bed several times.

33
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,907
And then there were the blackouts.

34
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,747
I'd feel my eyes
roll back in my head.

35
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:42,630
I'd crumple in the floor
like a dropped puppet.

36
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,826
Darned thing's
not even a year old yet.

37
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:53,462
Maybe it's screwed up
from all the lightning last week.

38
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,469
Your father will be overjoyed.

39
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,145
- What time's Dad getting home ?
- Not for another hour.

40
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,667
Mom. Deborah.

41
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,750
Come look.

42
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,188
lt's a UFO.

43
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,263
lt's just a weather balloon.

44
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,865
Look what it's doing to the TV.

45
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,148
lt's flying over the house.

46
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,263
Let's go up on the roof.

47
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:23,264
No, wait !

48
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,144
Children, be careful !

49
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,431
That summer,

50
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,987
those were
the two things I'd never forget.

51
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:35,025
The cramped,
stale darkness of the crawlspace.

52
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,031
And, equal in power and mystery...

53
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:41,508
..that UFO,
out there somewhere...

54
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:44,146
..traveling across the universe.

55
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,909
The summer I was 8 years old,
I came for the first time.

56
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,028
I was watching my Mom going at it
with her current boyfriend,

57
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,427
Alfred, in my old swing set.

58
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:03,341
Alfred was all Marlboro man,
dumb as a fucking rock,

59
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:07,070
what I would years later,
come to call my type.

60
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:13,229
Only stupid things
ever came out of his mouth.

61
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,627
But seeing him like this,
whimpering,

62
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,902
crying like a helpless animal...

63
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,584
I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

64
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,381
I'd been masturbating for years.

65
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:42,631
But it was that summer that
jizz first squirted out of my dick.

66
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,982
Couldn't wait to show Coach.

67
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,585
I should start at the beginning.

68
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,266
My Mom signed me up
for Little League.

69
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:54,267
It was Alfred's idea, so they
could fuck without paying a sitter.

70
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:55,990
Are you excited ?

71
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:58,787
Coach Heider ?

72
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:05,186
Desire sledge-hammered me.

73
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,861
He looked like the lifeguards,
cowboys and firemen

74
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:11,304
I'd seen in the ''Playgirls''
my mom kept under her bed.

75
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,033
I didn't know
what to do with my feelings.

76
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:17,629
They were like a gift
I had to open in front of a crowd.

77
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:20,023
- Hello.
- Hello, l'm Ellen McCormick.

78
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,229
And this is my son, Neil.

79
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,472
Hello, Neil.

80
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,024
Honey, won't you
say hello to your coach ?

81
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:33,345
Don't worry, it takes him a while
to warm up to strangers.

82
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,265
I quickly became team star player.

83
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:43,425
Which wasn't saying much considering
the other kids were all spazzes.

84
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,783
Our first game, I whacked
a triple with bases loaded.

85
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:49,945
The crowd went fucking nuts.

86
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:52,431
But I didn't care about that.

87
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,630
All that mattered was
it made Coach proud.

88
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,305
After that first victory,

89
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:02,386
Coach called my Mom to tell her
he was taking the team to a movie.

90
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,703
Hey, big guy. Ready to go ?

91
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,430
Where's everybody else ?

92
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,783
lt's just you and me today.

93
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:17,709
- Really ?
- Yup.

94
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:19,867
Cool.

95
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:25,742
I picked ''Blood Prom'' , an R-rated
flick with cool gore and murders.

96
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:29,832
When this annoying blonde chick
got her head chopped off, I cheered.

97
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:33,708
Then we picked up a pizza
and headed back to Coach's.

98
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,509
Coach's house was awesome.

99
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,304
He had a giant TV, an Atari with
Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Frogger.

100
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,310
All my favorite games.

101
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,584
You exploded. My turn.

102
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,905
- Sure your mom's not expecting you ?
- No, she works.

103
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:58,985
She's probably got
a date with Alfred afterwards.

104
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:03,829
- You spend a lot of time alone.
- Yes, but l kind of like it.

105
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,712
l just ride my bike and watch TV.
lt's cool.

106
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,749
Shit ! You made me mess up !

107
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,062
Sorry !

108
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,152
Hold on.

109
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:22,668
Come here for a sec.
Bring one of those bottles.

110
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,631
This might seem
a little weird at first.

111
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,142
But l need to record
my team's voices,

112
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:36,066
especially my best players.

113
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,185
Okay ? Take this.

114
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:45,467
Now just speak into it
using your normal voice.

115
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,425
What should l say ?

116
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,625
Whatever you like.
Start with your name.

117
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:57,143
Now take a big sip of pop and belch.

118
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,190
- Shit.
- Good.

119
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,947
- Say that again.
- Shit.

120
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,152
Again.

121
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,986
Shit. Hell ! Damn !

122
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,109
Now, look up into the camera.

123
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:17,866
Now stick your tongue out.

124
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,150
Make a funny face.

125
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,348
Good.

126
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:33,711
Open your mouth wide.

127
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,552
Neil, that's perfect.

128
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,787
July second.

129
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,348
We had a 7:30 game
against Taco Hut.

130
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,703
l know you'll kick
their butts tonight.

131
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:51,865
Do it for
your poor hard-working mom.

132
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:55,512
- Getting a ride home with Coach ?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,509
You're mine and l love you
and don't you ever forget it.

134
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,025
Boy, were you on fire tonight !
lt's the best you've ever played !

135
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,381
Thanks, Coach.

136
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,433
Can we play more games tonight ?

137
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,107
Sure, but let me
show you something first.

138
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,663
l look stupid in this one.

139
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,507
No. You look perfect.

140
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:50,586
Your expression.
Like you're having a wonderful dream.

141
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:57,951
Neil, l've been thinking
a lot about you this week.

142
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,871
l'm hungry.

143
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,912
Sure.

144
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,704
You want a pizza ?
l might have something you'd like.

145
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:18,107
- What'll it be, little buddy ?
- My mom never buys these things.

146
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,992
- She says they're a waste of money.
- Let's eat then.

147
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,384
Which one do you want ?

148
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,748
- What are you having ?
- Corn pops.

149
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:29,745
Then l'll have...

150
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,070
Cocoa Krispies.

151
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,546
Shit.

152
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:50,226
Sorry.

153
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,345
Here we go.

154
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,310
l like you, Neil.

155
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,990
l like you so much.

156
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,068
When l really,
really like someone...

157
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,386
..there's a way l show them
how l feel.

158
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,872
Angel.

159
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:33,062
There's nothing wrong
with kissing someone like this.

160
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,670
Don't ever let anyone
tell you that it's wrong.

161
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:49,103
It happened.
That's what I told myself.

162
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:50,911
It just happened.

163
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,584
And after it was over, I looked
down at the mess on the floor.

164
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,227
It was like a kaleidoscope
had shattered.

165
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:01,904
And when I swallowed, the taste
of Coach's tongue seared my mouth.

166
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,381
You liked it.
lt's okay that you liked it.

167
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,987
Everything's gonna be okay.

168
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,384
Do you know him or something ?

169
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:41,187
I met Wendy when I was 1 0 and
she was 1 1 and a grade ahead.

170
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,948
What are you doing ?

171
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,466
- Damn. No razor.
- You're insane.

172
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,824
If I wasn't queer,
we would have had sloppy teenage sex

173
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:54,828
and contributing more fucked-up,
unwanted kids to society.

174
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:58,862
But instead,
she became my soul mate.

175
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:01,828
One true partner in crime.

176
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,903
Let's kidnap him.

177
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,951
His mom says
we're supposed to take him home.

178
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:14,462
- Where are you taking me ?
- A house with lots of candy.

179
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,462
Goody.

180
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,663
Beware !

181
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:29,108
These are the eyes
of the Axe Murderer's victims.

182
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,227
- Come on, Satan.
- Hurry up, chicken.

183
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:41,989
Never much cared for Halloween,
but this particular year...

184
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:46,073
...I couldn't shake the feeling
something horrible was gonna happen.

185
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:48,429
And there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

186
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,943
Wait outside for me.
l'll be done in a minute.

187
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:55,825
You hold him
while l get something.

188
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:58,747
- What are we doing ?
- Having fun.

189
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:13,865
- What's the matter, ''Satan'' ?
- What did you say, punk ?

190
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,427
Loser !

191
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,707
Loser !

192
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:37,667
Brian ?

193
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:45,869
I thought that was you.

194
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:52,313
Lie down.

195
00:17:52,514 --> 00:17:54,664
Lie down, retard.

196
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,986
- What are you doing ?
- Shut up !

197
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:58,946
Shut up, or we'll kill you.

198
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,186
Point the beam over here.

199
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,828
Open your mouth.

200
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,025
l said open your mouth.

201
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:10,552
Keep these in your fucking mouth.
Do what we say or l'll kill you.

202
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,153
l swear.

203
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,029
Give me the matches.

204
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,310
Give me the damned matches.

205
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,150
Shine the flashlight on him.

206
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,625
Neil, he's going to tattle !

207
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:42,109
Don't worry. There are things
we can do to get him on our side.

208
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:46,028
That's it.
Just lay still for a minute.

209
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:47,906
You're my little green buddy

210
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:50,309
and there's this cool thing
to show you.

211
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:54,423
When l was little,
a man used to do this to me.

212
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:56,630
You're really gonna like it.

213
00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:59,183
There. That's it. That's my boy.

214
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:04,026
Wendy never looked at me
quite the same after that night.

215
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:07,584
Sharing this part of myself
I'd never shown anyone else...

216
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,431
I knew we'd be bound together.
Forever.

217
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:20,309
I woke up not knowing where I was
or what had happened to me.

218
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,953
Deborah said
I'd been missing for over an hour.

219
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:27,031
But I couldn't remember a thing.

220
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:29,947
But I knew it was
linked to the other time,

221
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,309
when I woke up in the cellar.

222
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:35,466
And I also knew
no matter how long it took...

223
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,143
..I had to find out what happened.

224
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,828
I had to find
an answer to the mystery.

225
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:47,907
When I was 1 5, I overheard kids
at school talking about a place.

226
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,307
A place you could find even in
a hicktown like Hutchinson.

227
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:09,151
Bingo...

228
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:38,942
Here we go.

229
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:51,993
How's it going ?

230
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:53,993
Okay.

231
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:56,193
l'm Charlie.

232
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,226
Wanna go for a ride ?

233
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,228
Sure.

234
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,231
You got cash ?

235
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,267
l'll pay 50, no higher.

236
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:13,342
You've got to be careful out here.

237
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,670
The cops patrol this whole area

238
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,308
and they know what's up.

239
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,664
l'm in Hutchinson on business.

240
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:24,264
l supply snack foods
to the local markets.

241
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,631
Go ahead.
Take whatever you want.

242
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:35,712
Hungry ?

243
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,904
We've only got an hour,

244
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,749
so we'd better get busy.

245
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:56,143
Wait.

246
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:58,943
Let me.

247
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,187
Beautiful.

248
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,743
So, what do you like to do ?

249
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,745
Tell me what you want me to do.

250
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,392
Whatever.

251
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,872
You like older guys ? Tell me.

252
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,667
Yeah.

253
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:42,345
That feels nice.

254
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:48,993
You are such a beautiful...

255
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,386
..beautiful boy.

256
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,346
l'm gonna come.

257
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:32,832
l'm gonna come.

258
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:22,672
l know what you're thinking.
That wasn't safe.

259
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:24,705
But we're in Kansas, thank God,

260
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,189
not some big city
full of diseases.

261
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,271
Plus, you're only a kid.

262
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,983
Maniac. You scared me !

263
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,707
Thanks for meeting me.

264
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:58,230
This better be good.
My mom'll kill me if she finds out.

265
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:00,066
l have something l wanna show you.

266
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:19,225
FRlDAYS & SATURDAYS 3 TO 4
YOUNG AND WlLLlNG

267
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,588
Yeah. So ?

268
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:23,713
That's me.

269
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,031
You're such a liar.

270
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,145
l don't believe you.

271
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:36,824
- l'll prove it.
- Okay. How ?

272
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:38,672
Oh, my God, what're you...

273
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,990
Put that back in your pants,
exhibitionist.

274
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:43,025
- Look.
- No way, pervert.

275
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:45,509
Look what the guy did to me.

276
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:54,793
Are those bruises ?

277
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:58,066
Fucker gnawed on my dick
like it was a candy cane !

278
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:00,464
Didn't know he hurt me
till l blew my load.

279
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,431
Well, you better watch out.

280
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:05,546
Next time someone
might chomp the whole thing off.

281
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:07,793
Seriously.

282
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:12,506
Even Hutchinson has freaks.
You could end up dead.

283
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:14,427
Okay, ''Mom''.

284
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,344
l wish there was
a movie showing right now.

285
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:25,307
Me too.

286
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:29,953
A film about our lives.
Everything that's happened so far.

287
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:34,664
And the last scene
would just be us standing right here.

288
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:36,587
Just you and me.

289
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:40,870
Yeah.

290
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:58,505
l hear something.

291
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,225
lt's the voice of God.

292
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:20,671
l hear him.

293
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,153
l hear him.

294
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,904
Mom !

295
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:48,754
- lt's about to begin.
- Alright, l'm coming.

296
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:53,591
- VCR on ?
- l checked it twice.

297
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,473
lt's probably going to be silly.

298
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,631
The commercial showed
an old man...

299
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:01,504
..claiming aliens beamed him up
right out of his bathtub.

300
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:07,107
lf you're going to make fun,
l'll just watch it by myself.

301
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,224
lt's starting.

302
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,824
Tonight on ''World Of Mystery'',

303
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:15,266
..we investigate
the terrifying world of UFOs.

304
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:19,508
Is it mass hysteria
or something all too real ?

305
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:22,104
They kept me prisoner for hours.

306
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:27,589
They examined me like
I was a frog in biology class.

307
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:31,391
And then they stuck a probe
in my stomach.

308
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:34,787
I still got the scar here
to prove it.

309
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:36,985
Look at that.

310
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:40,983
I always got scared anytime
I watched movies about UFOs.

311
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,947
Even ''E. T. '' scared me.

312
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:47,189
Poor thing.
She looks so homely and sad.

313
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:51,513
Avalyn Friesen lives in
the ordinary town of Inman, Kansas.

314
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:56,186
lnman ? That's only 30 miles away.

315
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:59,307
32 years old, she is unmarried.

316
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:01,983
Lives with her father
and works as a secretary.

317
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:04,834
But there is something
unusual about Avalyn.

318
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,787
For as long as she can remember,

319
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,953
things have happened to her,
things she cannot explain.

320
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,266
I'd heard about people
who've experienced missing time.

321
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:16,911
Whole chunks of their lives
they couldn't account for.

322
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:19,151
Under hypnotic regression,

323
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:22,472
I learned I'd been abducted
more than 20 times.

324
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,347
- Oh, please !
- Quiet.

325
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,352
The first time I was 6.

326
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:30,389
I was on my way home from
a picnic with my grandparents.

327
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:33,865
It was dark and we got lost,
driving down a dirt road.

328
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:36,953
Grandpa lost control
and we went into a ditch.

329
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:39,504
There was this blinding white light.

330
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,584
But the aliens weren't interested
in my grandparents.

331
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:48,351
They floated me up out of the car
using a gravitational ray.

332
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,871
That's it. l've had enough.

333
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,111
l'm gonna get some ice cream.
Want some ?

334
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,594
No, thanks.

335
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,753
I remember lying on a table.
It was cold,

336
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,314
smooth and shiny.

337
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:04,831
The aliens surrounded me.
They were bald.

338
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:08,226
With marshmallowy heads
and tiny arms.

339
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:10,995
But the worst part was their eyes.

340
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,186
The only way I can describe them

341
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,711
is big, black diamonds,
all liquidy and jelly-ish.

342
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:44,194
l'm finally getting out
of this fucking nowhere town !

343
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:47,467
You better let me know
the second you're settled.

344
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:49,633
Or else.

345
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:53,186
You better come. Or else.

346
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,784
New York City. You're so lucky !

347
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,708
Hey, assface.

348
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,945
What're you gawking at ?

349
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:16,944
Faggots !

350
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:18,104
Shit, go, go, go !

351
00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:24,108
Fuck you !

352
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:42,025
Remember the guy l told you ?
White Camaro ?

353
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,987
That's him. Parked by those trees.

354
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:48,029
l've fucked every john in this park.
Except for White Camaro.

355
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:50,705
So it's time for you two
to get lost.

356
00:31:50,955 --> 00:31:53,344
Stop scaring my business away.

357
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:55,666
You want us
to pick you up later ?

358
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,508
lf you want.
l'll be done by 7.

359
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,308
We'll meet you.

360
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:03,148
l gotta get home
and start packing.

361
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,788
Alright. Call me tonight.

362
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,667
See you later.

363
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:18,274
- You'd better be careful.
- Of what ?

364
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,548
l'm serious,
you're not in Modesto anymore.

365
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:24,470
l see the way you look at him.

366
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,871
He's so beautiful.

367
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:30,911
l can't help it.
He's like a god.

368
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:35,589
You don't have to tell me,
l was infatuated with him too once.

369
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,506
But l know all Neil's secrets and
there's shit you don't want to know.

370
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:47,032
Once l'm gone, you'll be all Neil has
and you have to understand one thing.

371
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:48,987
Where normal people have a heart,

372
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:51,948
Neil McCormick's has
a bottomless black hole.

373
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:56,393
And if you don't watch out,
you can fall in and get lost forever.

374
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,673
- Brian, you home ?
- Yeah, Mom. ln here.

375
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:42,347
No class today ?

376
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:45,275
l've got English Comp
discussion group at 7:30.

377
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:49,187
You have mail.
Looks like one from your sister.

378
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,625
And one from A. Friesen ?

379
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:56,350
l can't believe she wrote me back.

380
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:59,666
- Who ?
- Avalyn Friesen. The woman on TV.

381
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:03,312
She didn't have to dump
a whole gallon of perfume on it.

382
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:07,266
What did she say ?

383
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,263
She wants me
to visit her in lnman.

384
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:35,024
Thanks for the ride, Preston.

385
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,234
Later.

386
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:45,745
You just missed it, sweetie.

387
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:49,186
This little old lady
just won both showcases.

388
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:55,025
- What did she get ?
- She got a trip to Scotland...

389
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:58,787
A beautiful living room set.
A brand new car.

390
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,190
l can't remember the name of it
but it cost over 27 grand.

391
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:09,151
Are you wearing cologne ?

392
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,231
ls work okay ?

393
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:15,393
lt's the pits.

394
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:19,627
When is our ship
gonna come in, baby ?

395
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,666
Soon, Ma.

396
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,473
Soon.

397
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:30,946
Oh, Neil, don't forget.

398
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,187
Tomorrow's my date.
That hot ltalian.

399
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:36,863
The guy who always
comes through my checkout lane.

400
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:40,148
l'll be at work.
The last tournament of the season.

401
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,274
Vincenzo.

402
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:31,595
Patches ! Patches, down.

403
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,754
Sorry, she gets a little excited.

404
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:36,470
Hi, you must be Brian.
l'm Avalyn, obviously.

405
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,830
Dad ? lt's okay, Daddy.

406
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,630
lt's that young man
l was telling you about.

407
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:47,347
Don't mind him.
He's just a little wary of strangers.

408
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:50,509
l'm so glad you're here. Come on.

409
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:55,748
lt isn't showy, but it's home.
Here, have a seat.

410
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:59,712
l was in the middle of lunch.
l hope you don't mind.

411
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,390
No, go ahead. l ate earlier.

412
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,229
So, you saw the show ?

413
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:08,346
Several times,
l videotaped it.

414
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:12,470
They left some stuff out, but
they got the major points across.

415
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,545
l think l was taken too.

416
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,145
You mentioned that in your letter.

417
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:22,632
You're where l was a few years ago,
just starting to remember.

418
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:26,749
There are many of us and
we need to know what happened.

419
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:30,426
So you think
that's what happened to me.

420
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:33,104
Considering
about the missing time and...

421
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,068
l'm sure of it.

422
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:39,107
Feel like going on a walk ?

423
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:41,589
What's that you're carrying ?

424
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:44,185
lt's a Dream Journal.

425
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,146
l keep a log of all my dreams.

426
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,234
Whatever bits and pieces
l can recall at least.

427
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:53,474
l feel like
it's slowly helping me remember.

428
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:55,228
That's a really good idea.

429
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:58,115
Your subconscious is where
all your memories are buried.

430
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,232
For you and me
and people like us

431
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:04,224
almost every single thing we do
stems from our being abducted.

432
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:09,072
l want to show you something
they wouldn't allow on TV.

433
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:13,986
l've been tagged.
Part of their experiments.

434
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:15,145
Touch it.

435
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:20,865
When l was taken,
my leg was bleeding,

436
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:23,470
but l didn't remember being cut.

437
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,428
Under hypnosis l discovered

438
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,345
that's where
they implanted the tracking device.

439
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,433
Now everything l do, they know.

440
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:35,106
ln fact, l wouldn't be surprised
if they were spying on us right now.

441
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:39,309
When l was found that night,
my nose was bleeding.

442
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:44,315
The old up-the-nose trick,
so the scar can't be seen.

443
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:48,586
Don't forget to write.

444
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:53,594
Don't you forget what l told you.

445
00:38:58,076 --> 00:39:01,068
You better come see me soon, asshole.

446
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:03,075
l will.

447
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:07,709
l will.

448
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:38,712
Stay out of trouble, you two.

449
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:44,470
Bye.

450
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:55,475
l can't believe it's so late.
My mom's gonna worry.

451
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,268
You still live with your mom ?

452
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,071
My dad moved out 7 years ago.

453
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:04,155
- l don't see him much.
- Read me one of your dreams.

454
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:08,509
l just scribble
them out in the middle of the night.

455
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:12,470
- Sometimes l can barely read them.
- That's okay.

456
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,066
This is from 2 nights ago.

457
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:28,193
''There's a blue light.

458
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:31,388
l'm in my Little League uniform

459
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,826
and a tall alien
is hovering over me.

460
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,872
Someone else is with me.

461
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:38,555
Another boy.

462
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:40,394
Also in uniform.

463
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:42,395
A Panther ?''

464
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,709
That was the name
of my baseball team.

465
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:50,108
Let's see...

466
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,669
''The alien has big black eyes.

467
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,308
He's touching my face.

468
00:40:59,236 --> 00:41:01,545
l want to cry out for help, but...

469
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:05,714
..l can't.''

470
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,746
You're on your way
to uncovering the truth.

471
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:13,192
Think of yourself as a detective.

472
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:15,990
Concentrate on the other boy
in your dreams,

473
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:19,512
he could help you find
the answers you're looking for.

474
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:24,224
Two outs.
Third baseman Jackson up

475
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:26,028
with Hinton on deck.

476
00:41:27,436 --> 00:41:30,508
Jesus. Check out that Jackson.
Hubba hubba.

477
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,386
Are you joking ?

478
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:36,427
l'd fuck him for free.

479
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:42,071
Please return all foul balls
to press box, thank you.

480
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:44,752
You don't think Jackson's hot ?

481
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,273
Dude, he's fat and bald !

482
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:51,547
Different folks,
different strokes.

483
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:54,031
My Daddy hit this.

484
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:57,825
Well, come here. Collect your prize.

485
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,595
Thank you so much.

486
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:02,024
One second.

487
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:07,596
What will it be, big guy ?
Cash or bubbles ?

488
00:42:08,716 --> 00:42:11,788
You can't decide.
Alright, come on, hold out your hand.

489
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,745
- Thanks !
- You're welcome.

490
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,585
See you later.

491
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:26,432
What ? When kids do good,
you gotta reward them.

492
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:28,308
Christ, it's Hinton,

493
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:31,076
a.k.a. Ass of the Gods.

494
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:35,190
l am so fucking wasted !

495
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:37,875
Oh, shit !

496
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,313
Where's your mom ?

497
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,270
She's probably out with
her new boyfriend, Vincenzo.

498
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:50,425
l've got a wicked headache.

499
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:54,145
- Do you have any pot ?
- Yeah. Come on.

500
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:04,510
Here.

501
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,229
Knock yourself out.

502
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:13,191
There's a porno in the VCR
if you wanna jack off.

503
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,024
Thanks.

504
00:43:16,196 --> 00:43:17,993
You got a lighter ?

505
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,434
Yeah. Here.

506
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:12,274
- You like that ?
- It tickles a little.

507
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:14,906
That feels good, doesn't it, Neil ?

508
00:45:16,237 --> 00:45:20,389
Should we put the blanket
over our heads like last time ?

509
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:23,354
Here we go.

510
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,313
Find what you were looking for ?

511
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:35,827
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.
- Glad l could help out.

512
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:38,870
l used to write for
my school paper too.

513
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:42,349
This will really make
a big difference to my article.

514
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:45,873
- Maybe you'll win a Pulitzer Prize.
- Maybe.

515
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:48,505
Just let me know if
there's anything else you need.

516
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:50,395
Thanks so much.

517
00:46:01,477 --> 00:46:02,671
You done already ?

518
00:46:02,877 --> 00:46:04,913
l'm on kind of a tight deadline.

519
00:46:05,117 --> 00:46:06,755
Well, good luck.

520
00:46:07,477 --> 00:46:11,106
That's two outs.
Garfield the batter, Heim on deck.

521
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:18,352
Scoot your chair back
a little further.

522
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:20,675
That's better.

523
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:33,315
Wait. Hold on a sec.

524
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:37,751
The score is
Hutchinson First National Bank, 3...

525
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,385
Wichita Coleman Industries, 0.

526
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:41,996
Okay. Go on.

527
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:49,313
- Where have you been ?
- Sorry.

528
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:52,429
l should've called.
l didn't realize the time.

529
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:56,033
- Well, your dinner's cold as ice.
- That's okay.

530
00:46:57,517 --> 00:47:01,305
Brian, what's going on ?
You've been acting so strangely.

531
00:47:01,477 --> 00:47:04,435
- Disappearing for hours.
- lt's just school, Mom.

532
00:47:04,597 --> 00:47:07,987
- College is different.
- Did you ever call your father back ?

533
00:47:08,597 --> 00:47:10,713
l've been busy.

534
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,028
l'll get it.
You finish your dinner.

535
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:18,588
He's eating his supper right now.

536
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,027
- Who is it ?
- lt's that UFO woman.

537
00:47:22,157 --> 00:47:24,034
l'll get it in the hall.

538
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:27,272
Got it.

539
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,269
l was just going to call you.

540
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:34,268
l found a photo of the boy.

541
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:35,631
The one from my dreams.

542
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:38,032
That's amazing.
What are you doing right now ?

543
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:40,025
Nothing.

544
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:43,394
l need to show you something.
Can you come out here ?

545
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:44,916
Sure.

546
00:47:46,837 --> 00:47:50,147
- Hi, honey. How was work ?
- Fuck you.

547
00:47:59,957 --> 00:48:04,348
l'm so fucking sick of this stinking
little buttcrack of a town !

548
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,591
Patches, shhh, quiet !
You'll wake Daddy.

549
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:26,315
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

550
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:29,311
l stole this from
the Chamber of Commerce.

551
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:32,465
That's him.
The boy from my dreams.

552
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:36,465
Look at his face.
You can tell he knows something.

553
00:48:39,157 --> 00:48:40,829
What are you doing ?

554
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:52,473
Start looking for him tomorrow.
Maybe he still lives in Hutchinson.

555
00:48:52,637 --> 00:48:56,550
l have to show you something
only you would understand.

556
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:03,034
l've fucked every single guy and
his ugly uncle in this podunk town.

557
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,236
Twice.

558
00:49:12,797 --> 00:49:14,116
You want one ?

559
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,948
One of us has to drive.

560
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,510
l got a postcard from Wendy.

561
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:25,471
l think she's mad at me
because l owe her 3 letters.

562
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:29,391
Yeah, her last P.S. is
''Tell Fuckface to write me.''

563
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:31,548
So you wanna hear what she says ?

564
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:38,710
''Hey ass. So New York is insane
and crazy in the best possible way.''

565
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,032
Pardon me.

566
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:42,995
Can we help you ?

567
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:45,034
l was wondering if
l might buy you boys a drink.

568
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:47,629
Fuck off.

569
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,269
You heard me, fag. Fuck... off.

570
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,907
Stuck-up little pricks.

571
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:56,545
Harsh.

572
00:49:56,757 --> 00:49:58,793
Wasn't he kinda your type ?

573
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:02,353
No, l hate when they look like Tarzan
and sound like Jane.

574
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:04,867
Let's get out of this shithole.

575
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:06,993
But we just got here ?

576
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:12,514
Patches, get away from there !

577
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:18,946
Farmers have been finding mutilated
cattle around here for years.

578
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:22,792
l told ''World of Mystery'',
but they conveniently edited it out.

579
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:27,548
Dad says it's ''Satan worshipers''
going around chopping up cows.

580
00:50:28,637 --> 00:50:30,434
Come here. Let me see your hand.

581
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:33,996
Feel that ?

582
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,825
Sex organs. They're gone.

583
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:41,875
The aliens experiment on cows because
the poor things are so defenseless.

584
00:50:42,077 --> 00:50:44,033
Us, on the other hand,
they can't kill us.

585
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:46,876
They just leave behind
hidden memories.

586
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,193
Which in a way is almost worse.

587
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:52,946
Notice anything else strange ?
There's no blood.

588
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:55,148
They took that, too.

589
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:17,066
Here we go.

590
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:19,034
Oh, my God. Brian !

591
00:51:19,237 --> 00:51:21,034
Tell him you like it.

592
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,549
Are you okay ?

593
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:26,866
Oh, God.

594
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:32,187
Neil. What are you doing ?

595
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:36,506
Come on. lt's 2:30 in the morning.

596
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,191
You called me your fucking...

597
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:42,666
..angel.

598
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,793
Wendy's going to meet you
at the station ?

599
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:49,993
l don't want you getting lost
in that crazy city.

600
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,513
- You don't have to worry, okay ?
- Call me the minute you arrive.

601
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,668
Promise me, Neil.

602
00:52:00,997 --> 00:52:04,592
We should've at least gotten you
a decent hair cut.

603
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:08,309
l gotta take a piss.

604
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:12,993
We'll be right back.

605
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:17,714
- What's the matter ?
- l don't know.

606
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:21,592
My fucking dick itches
like motherfucking fuck !

607
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:23,835
What do you want me
to do about it ?

608
00:52:24,037 --> 00:52:25,834
Just look down there.

609
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:27,945
Preston, come on,
help me out here.

610
00:52:30,837 --> 00:52:31,906
What's wrong with me ?

611
00:52:33,757 --> 00:52:36,715
Dude. You've got crabs.

612
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:42,389
l mean, it's no big, man.

613
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:45,867
You just go to the drug store
and get this stuff called ''Rid''.

614
00:52:47,837 --> 00:52:49,748
You'd better be playing safe.

615
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:51,913
l stay in control.

616
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:54,748
Honey, your bus is boarding.

617
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:56,345
Alright.

618
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:05,195
My baby.

619
00:53:05,957 --> 00:53:07,390
You're all grown up.

620
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:13,548
You'll be careful ?

621
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:15,266
Yeah, l will.

622
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:24,393
You're mine and l love you.
Don't you ever forget it.

623
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:48,232
Come on. l'll buy you Dairy Queen.

624
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,507
So what now that Neil's gone ?

625
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:54,752
- l'll kill myself.
- Eric, that is not funny.

626
00:53:55,117 --> 00:53:57,312
Well, l start
Community College next week.

627
00:53:57,757 --> 00:53:59,588
Really ? That's so wonderful.

628
00:53:59,797 --> 00:54:01,708
Pathetic is more like it.

629
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:05,666
You can always come over
even without Neil around.

630
00:54:06,437 --> 00:54:09,156
Thanks, Mrs. M.
l may just take you up on that.

631
00:54:09,357 --> 00:54:10,756
You better.

632
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:16,235
Who the hell is that ?

633
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:19,505
lncognito Boy Scout ?

634
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:26,710
Can l help you ?

635
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,429
- ls this your house ?
- Yes.

636
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:34,907
Sorry to bother you, l got
your address out of the phonebook.

637
00:54:35,517 --> 00:54:40,068
l've been checking every McCormick in
Hutchinson and you're the last one.

638
00:54:40,237 --> 00:54:42,468
Anyway, l don't mean to babble...

639
00:54:42,638 --> 00:54:44,037
What do you want ?

640
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:49,193
- l'm looking for an N. McCormick.
- Are you FBl ?

641
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:52,157
Sorry honey,
you are shit outta luck.

642
00:54:53,398 --> 00:54:56,629
You mean there's
no N. McCormick living here ?

643
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:01,076
l mean we just put him on
a bus headed for New York City.

644
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:04,752
l'm Neil's friend, Eric,
and this is his Mom.

645
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:09,751
His name is Neil.

646
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:11,472
Yeah.

647
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:15,316
l'm Brian.

648
00:55:15,918 --> 00:55:17,476
Brian Lackey.

649
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:30,234
So you still haven't written.
Big surprise.

650
00:55:30,398 --> 00:55:32,707
But Wendy says you're doing okay,
which is cool.

651
00:55:32,918 --> 00:55:35,955
I've been wanting to tell you about
this strange guy I met 3 weeks ago.

652
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:39,196
No, we're not fucking.
Get your mind out of the gutter.

653
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:41,396
He's not even gay, I don't think.

654
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:45,073
In fact, his vibe
is kind of weirdly asexual.

655
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:47,433
His name is Brian Lackey.
He lives in Little River

656
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:50,869
and, like yours truly,
attends Loser Community College.

657
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:52,716
Anyway, the day you left,

658
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:56,354
your mom and I found him
on your doorstep, looking for you.

659
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:59,789
He says you played Little League
together 1 0 years ago.

660
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:02,432
He was the worst player
on the team,

661
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:06,393
He's full of questions about you.
But I haven't told him much,

662
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,391
i.e. about your ''line of work''.

663
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:12,391
I did say you were queer like me,
I figured you wouldn't care.

664
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:15,630
But now,
are you ready for the good part ?

665
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:20,792
He thinks that when you were little,
you were both abducted by aliens.

666
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:25,037
How brilliant is that ?
But he was completely serious.

667
00:56:25,238 --> 00:56:27,547
You should've seen
the look in his eyes.

668
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,836
So, what's the story, dude ?
Were you abducted by a UFO or what ?

669
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,627
P.S. Are your crabs gone yet ?''

670
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:44,627
Yeah ?

671
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,755
- You have a visitor.
- Hi Brian.

672
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,913
l was in the neighborhood
and l thought l'd stop by.

673
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:56,913
l'll be in the front room
if you need me.

674
00:56:57,118 --> 00:56:58,551
Thanks, Mom.

675
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:05,468
Didn't care for that film.
That, l didn't see.

676
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:08,509
Your Mom doesn't like me very much.

677
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:10,714
She thinks
l'm trying to steal you away.

678
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:12,869
Any luck in your search
for ''N. McCormick'' ?

679
00:57:13,518 --> 00:57:16,555
l met his mom and his best friend,

680
00:57:16,758 --> 00:57:19,067
but he's in New York right now.

681
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:20,996
New York. Really ?

682
00:57:23,758 --> 00:57:25,350
Here. Sit down.

683
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:33,828
Had any more of those dreams ?

684
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:35,553
Yeah.

685
00:57:35,758 --> 00:57:38,909
But they seem to be slowly evolving.

686
00:57:39,078 --> 00:57:42,229
And maybe it's just because
l've been spending time with Eric,

687
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:44,230
Neil's friend.

688
00:57:44,478 --> 00:57:47,356
But it's becoming
clearer and clearer that he...

689
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:51,347
..Neil that is,
is a key figure in all this.

690
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:55,354
Like he was there with me
the night it all happened.

691
00:57:58,878 --> 00:58:00,709
l can't. Don't.

692
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:03,515
No. l can't.

693
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,347
- l can't.
- lt's okay.

694
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:10,155
- No. No. Don't.
- lt'll feel good.

695
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:11,393
Don't !

696
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:16,511
- l'm sorry.
- You better go.

697
00:58:17,878 --> 00:58:20,472
- Please.
- l'm sorry, Brian.

698
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:38,277
l pay 1 20. Not a cent more.

699
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:40,996
Okay.

700
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:42,227
Shall we ?

701
00:59:27,118 --> 00:59:28,631
Fuck me !

702
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,353
Fuck me up the ass
with your hot, teenaged cock !

703
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:38,473
Wait !

704
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:40,754
What the fuck are you doing ?

705
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:49,637
Okay. Whatever.

706
00:59:52,158 --> 00:59:53,876
l'll put it on for you.

707
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:00,752
There.

708
01:00:04,678 --> 01:00:07,670
Well, come on, stud.
We're on the clock here.

709
01:00:38,878 --> 01:00:40,834
We're not in Kansas anymore, Neil.

710
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:44,432
You have got to be so careful.

711
01:00:45,278 --> 01:00:48,873
- l know.
- Don't ''l know'' me, Neil McCormick.

712
01:00:49,198 --> 01:00:50,995
This is New York City.

713
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,270
You do the wrong thing with
the wrong person and you die.

714
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:56,754
Period. End of story.

715
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:03,597
Just promise me you'll be safe.

716
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,106
Here.

717
01:01:31,558 --> 01:01:34,152
Are these the only kinds
of movies you watch ?

718
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:37,669
Why ? You don't like it ?

719
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:39,836
No, it's cool.

720
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:45,393
So, has Neil gotten back
to you yet ?

721
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:49,991
Let me explain
The Universe of Neil McCormick.

722
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:53,672
He's like a planet, Saturn, say.

723
01:01:54,198 --> 01:01:57,110
And we're all like
little moons orbiting around.

724
01:01:57,318 --> 01:01:59,832
Now, do planets write letters ?

725
01:02:01,078 --> 01:02:04,150
But l do know he'll be
in Hutchinson for Christmas.

726
01:02:05,318 --> 01:02:09,152
His mom told me
she sent him a ticket to fly home.

727
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:11,115
So l'll introduce you then.

728
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:17,868
- Yeah ?
- How about a study break ?

729
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,435
Thanks, Mrs. Lackey.

730
01:02:20,758 --> 01:02:22,157
Thanks, Mom.

731
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,676
lt's 1 1 :30.

732
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:31,471
lf it's Avalyn...
tell her l'm not here.

733
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,788
No, l'm sorry, Avalyn,
he's out with his friends.

734
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,277
No problem.

735
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:44,590
- l thought you kinda liked her.
- l just... l don't know.

736
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:49,110
l think l just need
a little space from her right now.

737
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,553
l always thought
she was a freak anyway.

738
01:02:51,718 --> 01:02:52,992
l'm off to bed.

739
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:54,836
Good night, boys.

740
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:20,634
l'm Zeke.

741
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:22,187
From L.A.

742
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:33,152
What are you doing
in New York City ?

743
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:44,270
That's a Vermeer.

744
01:03:49,238 --> 01:03:51,991
Well, it's sort of a Vermeer.

745
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:40,635
You are exquisite.

746
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,915
l guess it's my turn, huh ?

747
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,588
Hope...
these don't frighten you too much.

748
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:29,869
They have a habit of popping up
in the most inopportune places.

749
01:05:38,919 --> 01:05:41,752
l know. Don't be worried.

750
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:46,715
This is gonna be the safest encounter
you've ever had.

751
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,908
lf you could just rub my back.

752
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,948
Really, l need to be touched.

753
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:28,032
Make me happy.

754
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,877
Make me happy...

755
01:07:24,759 --> 01:07:27,114
You were 1 00 percent safe, right ?

756
01:07:28,439 --> 01:07:30,873
Yeah. l told you
l just jerked off,

757
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,428
he watched from across the room.

758
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,194
lt was the first time in my life
l'm bothered by it.

759
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:43,229
Maybe you should try and find
another safer way to make money.

760
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,077
Like everyone else.

761
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,757
Yeah, maybe.

762
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:07,228
You are the only one
l've ever told.

763
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,234
l know.

764
01:08:10,479 --> 01:08:13,437
l never told Eric, or told my Mom.

765
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,027
l know some people might think
it's fucked up, or terrible.

766
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:23,028
But what happened that summer
is a huge part of me.

767
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:28,516
No one ever made me feel that way,
before or since.

768
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:30,987
Like l...

769
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:34,717
l was special.

770
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,355
Neil, you were 8 years old.

771
01:08:39,919 --> 01:08:41,875
Yeah, but he really loved me.

772
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,239
l mean, there were
other kids sometimes, but...

773
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:51,628
l was his prize.

774
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,594
l was his one true love.

775
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:17,672
Happy birthday.

776
01:09:17,879 --> 01:09:19,870
You didn't have
to get me anything.

777
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,828
lt's just a little something
l picked out.

778
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:32,388
Cool.

779
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:34,675
l thought it'd go great
with your hair color.

780
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,871
lt's so cool. Thanks.

781
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:49,307
You alright ?

782
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,390
l'm drunk.

783
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:58,392
l've never been drunk in my life.

784
01:09:58,559 --> 01:10:00,515
l'm corrupting you.

785
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:02,271
At last !

786
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:08,317
That's pretty good.

787
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:09,958
Yeah, sure.

788
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,031
No, really.

789
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:14,793
You have definite artistic talent,
my boy.

790
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:22,155
That's an interesting touch.

791
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,987
What's the ''deep meaning''
behind the baseball cleats ?

792
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,196
l have no idea.

793
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,077
- How was work ?
- Fucking boring.

794
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,388
- You need a hand ?
- Sure.

795
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:04,553
l've got news for you.

796
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:08,552
- Well, me too.
- Okay. You first.

797
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,235
Look what my Mom sent me today.

798
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,708
She wants me
to come home for Christmas.

799
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:17,236
Your mom is the coolest.

800
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:20,872
- Mine would never do that for me.
- That's weird.

801
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:23,593
l hate Hutchinson
more than anything.

802
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:27,958
But l'm kind of looking forward
to going back, just for a short visit.

803
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,833
- Plus you get to see Eric.
- Yeah.

804
01:11:32,959 --> 01:11:34,836
So what's your news ?

805
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:38,189
l think l found you a job.

806
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:40,348
What ?

807
01:11:40,519 --> 01:11:43,397
l was talking to this friend
at work about you.

808
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,148
lt's only minimum wage
at a stupid sandwich place, but...

809
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:53,671
- But ?
- You're not into it, it's cool.

810
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:56,035
No, tell me more about it.

811
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,992
- Really ?
- l want to hear more about it.

812
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:03,550
- You do ?
- Yeah.

813
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:19,035
You sure you're gonna be okay ?

814
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,992
l'm just glad
my Mom's working late.

815
01:12:26,519 --> 01:12:28,316
Thanks for everything.

816
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:32,868
This has been
the best birthday ever.

817
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:36,718
You're welcome.

818
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:42,867
Shit.

819
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,878
Who's that ?

820
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:46,472
lt's my Dad.

821
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:55,708
Dad ?

822
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:57,908
Son.

823
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:00,112
l caught you.

824
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,634
Your Mother said she didn't know
whether you'd be home or not.

825
01:13:03,839 --> 01:13:05,397
Happy Birthday.

826
01:13:06,439 --> 01:13:07,997
What are you doing here ?

827
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,037
l'm not allowed to wish
my son a happy birthday ?

828
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:14,396
Dad, l haven't seen you for what,
2 years ?

829
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,352
Well, maybe if you called back...

830
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:20,192
Maybe l don't want to call back.

831
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:22,833
Maybe l just want you
to leave me alone.

832
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,671
Brian, don't be like this.

833
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:27,713
l drove all this way.
Just to see how you're doing.

834
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:29,756
Well, let me tell you
what l want to know.

835
01:13:29,919 --> 01:13:32,308
Something happened to me
when l was little.

836
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:34,590
Do you know what
l'm talking about ?

837
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:37,193
When l woke up bleeding
in the cellar ?

838
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:39,230
Where were you that night ?

839
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:41,914
God, l can tell
you don't even remember !

840
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,109
- You're drunk.
- Quit avoiding the subject !

841
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,750
l was bleeding,
l kept passing out.

842
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,675
l wet my fucking bed
and you never asked why !

843
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,110
And what about that Halloween ?

844
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,510
Something happened to me
both those nights !

845
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,910
What do you know about it ?
Tell me !

846
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,958
l'm sorry, Brian. l...

847
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,357
l can't help you.

848
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,757
May l help you ?

849
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,433
- Redecorating ?
- Sort of.

850
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,955
- How have you been ?
- Good.

851
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,630
- How's Berkeley ?
- Hold on, you two.

852
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,518
Let's continue this
in the front room

853
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,148
over the peanut-butter peach pie
l baked.

854
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,237
- Good to see you, little brother.
- You too.

855
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,437
Need a lift ?

856
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,554
Sure.

857
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,354
- Where we going ?
- My place.

858
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,152
Don't worry, l'll pay.

859
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,471
- lt's Christmas Eve tomorrow.
- No more talking.

860
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,469
- Where are we ?
- Brighton Beach.

861
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,071
Bedroom's this way.

862
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,999
Do it.

863
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,233
Again.

864
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,673
Strip.

865
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,957
Open wide and suck it, slut.

866
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,349
What are you waiting for, slut ?

867
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,028
Suck it !

868
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,678
You like that, don't you, slut ?

869
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,638
Take it deep.

870
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,439
Moan for me.

871
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,750
Slut knows what's coming next.

872
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,549
- l'm giving slut what he wants...
- There're some things l don't do.

873
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,593
Wait. l gotta take a piss.
l'll be right back.

874
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,312
You're getting fucked, slut,
whether you like it or not.

875
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,829
Slut !

876
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,392
Are you ready ? Here it comes.

877
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,233
Mom.

878
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,474
Today is the day.

879
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,511
- Now where are you off to ?
- l'm going out with Eric.

880
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,915
You don't want to stay
and talk with your sister a while ?

881
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,514
- l'll be back soon.
- Don't be late, young man.

882
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,790
Christmas Eve dinner's at 6 sharp.

883
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,199
Here we are.

884
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,358
- Do l look okay ?
- Okay's a relative term.

885
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,631
l'm kidding.
You look fine.

886
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,350
- Excited ?
- Yes.

887
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,998
And nervous.

888
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,232
Don't worry.
l'm sure you guys will hit it off.

889
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,237
l hope you're right.

890
01:23:22,281 --> 01:23:25,114
- Oh, hi, Eric.
- Mrs. M., Merry Christmas.

891
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:29,041
- You remember Brian.
- Of course l do.

892
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:31,197
- Hi, Brian.
- Merry Christmas.

893
01:23:31,361 --> 01:23:34,512
- So where's the Man of the Hour ?
- l was going to call you.

894
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:38,996
- What happened ?
- There's been an accident.

895
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,639
Neil got mugged

896
01:23:43,521 --> 01:23:45,113
on the way to the airport.

897
01:23:45,841 --> 01:23:47,593
ls he okay ?

898
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:51,397
He's going to be fine.
He's asleep in his room.

899
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:56,473
- Maybe we should come back tomorrow.
- Maybe.

900
01:23:57,081 --> 01:24:00,551
Or you stay if you'd like,
have some cookies and see if he's...

901
01:24:04,441 --> 01:24:06,238
Honey, you're up.

902
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:09,876
The fuck
are you staring at, Preston ?

903
01:24:11,961 --> 01:24:15,192
Brian says you both
were in Little League together.

904
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:20,473
So how long has it been
since you two last saw each other ?

905
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:23,114
1 0 years...

906
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:26,710
..5 months and 7 days.

907
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,354
You must have
a lot of catching up to do.

908
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:35,596
Turn right off Main
by the fairgrounds.

909
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:39,151
- So what the fuck happened ?
- Long story. l'll tell you later.

910
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:40,640
Just drive for now.

911
01:24:41,121 --> 01:24:44,158
lt's nice to see New York
hasn't hardened you one bit...

912
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:51,714
So you're the legendary Brian.

913
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:57,596
- We have a lot in common, don't we ?
- l think so.

914
01:25:08,961 --> 01:25:11,191
Make a left at the next stop sign.

915
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:15,631
ls this starting to look familiar ?

916
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:23,596
Pick us up in a half hour.

917
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:40,439
You ready ?

918
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:54,839
Blue.

919
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:08,277
No one's home.
Let's go round back.

920
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:13,798
We have to get in.

921
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:17,918
l know a way here.

922
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:25,316
Voilà.

923
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,841
You were the best player
on the team, weren't you ?

924
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,799
That's what he always told me.

925
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,760
Help.

926
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:57,196
This was his bedroom.

927
01:26:58,121 --> 01:27:00,510
At least
the ceiling's still the same.

928
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:04,271
l used to get lost for hours
staring at all the patterns.

929
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:07,554
Whirls, speckly sparkly things.

930
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:12,240
Come on.

931
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:24,638
What's up with these people ?

932
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:27,913
He used to keep
these things stocked.

933
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,518
This is it, right ?

934
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:52,638
Why now ?

935
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:56,555
Why did you search me out ?

936
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:00,592
l'm tired of it.

937
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:03,474
l want to dream about
something else for a change.

938
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,031
''Away in a Manger''...

939
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:26,034
lt took till l actually laid eyes
on you today to remember you.

940
01:28:27,601 --> 01:28:32,629
When Eric wrote me, l only got
the vaguest picture in my head.

941
01:28:32,801 --> 01:28:35,395
Like a staticky TV.

942
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,472
Same here.

943
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,713
But seeing you here...

944
01:28:40,321 --> 01:28:41,720
..in this room...

945
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:46,073
l feel like
he's watching us right now.

946
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:51,156
l have no idea
what happened to him.

947
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:53,591
After that summer,
he just disappeared.

948
01:28:54,241 --> 01:28:56,311
l don't know
if he's even alive or what.

949
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,595
Maybe it's his ghost watching us.

950
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:01,633
Tell me everything you can.

951
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,116
l was his favorite.

952
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:14,512
Out of everyone, he picked me.

953
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:18,591
l know it sounds
kind of weird, but...

954
01:29:18,841 --> 01:29:21,401
..when it first started happening...

955
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:24,397
l felt honored.

956
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:26,240
Go on.

957
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:32,310
This is where the big TV was,

958
01:29:32,481 --> 01:29:34,631
all the cool video games.

959
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,712
That's the kitchen.

960
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:39,950
The first time happened there...

961
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:46,237
lt lasted that whole summer.

962
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,633
Just me and him.

963
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:51,515
l saw him one other time.

964
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:54,791
On Halloween,
a couple years later.

965
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:57,398
l was lost.

966
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:00,199
He said my name.

967
01:30:00,921 --> 01:30:02,149
Brian ?

968
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:04,109
Brian ?

969
01:30:08,961 --> 01:30:10,758
I thought that was you.

970
01:30:12,881 --> 01:30:15,111
The game had just started.

971
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:17,921
l was sitting on the bench
as always.

972
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:20,358
lt started to rain...

973
01:30:20,561 --> 01:30:23,519
Sprinkles at first, then a downpour.

974
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:27,992
The ump called the game.

975
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:30,033
And no one came to pick you up.

976
01:30:30,761 --> 01:30:33,321
My Mom was working and my Dad,

977
01:30:33,521 --> 01:30:34,670
who knows.

978
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:38,039
Everyone else drove off
with their parents.

979
01:30:38,201 --> 01:30:40,431
l was left there all alone.

980
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:43,991
Then you were in the dugout
with me and you said...

981
01:30:44,561 --> 01:30:46,597
We'll take you home.

982
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:53,395
And we got in Coach's
station wagon, remember ?

983
01:30:57,761 --> 01:30:59,558
He brought us here.

984
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:04,873
It's alright, Brian.
We're going to have a little fun.

985
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:12,037
And he didn't want you in the bedroom
because that was just for us.

986
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:16,033
So it all happened here,
in this room.

987
01:31:16,961 --> 01:31:18,360
Keep going.

988
01:31:18,881 --> 01:31:20,872
Don't stop until
you've told me everything.

989
01:31:24,561 --> 01:31:27,280
When there was another boy,
it was always the same.

990
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:30,393
The Coach used me as a prop
to pull you in.

991
01:31:31,761 --> 01:31:35,470
He'd undress me and
and l had to make it seem fun.

992
01:31:35,681 --> 01:31:37,797
Like it was a really cool game.

993
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:39,480
Go ahead, show him, Neil.

994
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:43,759
Alright, here are the rules.
I kiss you, then you kiss me back.

995
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:45,440
And then it's his turn.

996
01:31:47,681 --> 01:31:49,433
Are you ready ?

997
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:53,349
Here we go.

998
01:31:55,881 --> 01:31:57,280
My God...

999
01:31:58,881 --> 01:32:00,200
You want me to stop ?

1000
01:32:07,761 --> 01:32:10,400
So l put my tongue
in your mouth,

1001
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:13,475
getting it all wet and shiny.

1002
01:32:13,881 --> 01:32:15,712
Then it was his turn.

1003
01:32:17,481 --> 01:32:20,154
Watching his big lips
sucking your face,

1004
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:23,552
l remember thinking
he's going to swallow his head whole.

1005
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:29,079
So, we took off your clothes

1006
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:34,709
and you made
this whimpering puppy sound

1007
01:32:35,281 --> 01:32:37,875
that Coach always loved.

1008
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:40,276
Coach and me had this thing

1009
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:45,271
where he would wrap
his mouth around my dick and balls.

1010
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:47,793
He did that to me

1011
01:32:48,602 --> 01:32:50,240
and l tried to do it to you
but couldn't

1012
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:53,599
because my mouth was too small.

1013
01:32:56,722 --> 01:32:59,520
Then, he went down on you

1014
01:33:02,602 --> 01:33:05,833
for what seemed like
a really long time.

1015
01:33:06,042 --> 01:33:07,953
Now your eyes
were closed mostly

1016
01:33:08,122 --> 01:33:10,192
but every now and then
they would flutter open,

1017
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:13,877
and had this glassy,
faraway look.

1018
01:33:16,042 --> 01:33:17,395
And then...

1019
01:33:17,762 --> 01:33:19,673
l leaned in and whispered...

1020
01:33:19,842 --> 01:33:23,437
It's fun right ?
Tell him you like it.

1021
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:37,757
We're almost finished.

1022
01:33:38,242 --> 01:33:39,914
Can you be able...?

1023
01:33:40,082 --> 01:33:41,276
Yeah.

1024
01:33:44,162 --> 01:33:46,676
Then we played the 5 dollar game.

1025
01:33:47,562 --> 01:33:51,794
When Coach would ask me
to do things, crazy sex things.

1026
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:54,397
And if l could do them,
he'd give me a 5 dollar bill.

1027
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,281
It's okay. Go ahead, Neil.

1028
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:09,478
He made us fist him.

1029
01:34:10,002 --> 01:34:11,594
Do you know what that is ?

1030
01:34:17,522 --> 01:34:19,831
l went first, of course.

1031
01:34:20,082 --> 01:34:23,154
And on that night,
the 5 dollars was mine

1032
01:34:24,482 --> 01:34:29,954
if l could ram my fist up his ass
all the way to the elbow.

1033
01:34:30,722 --> 01:34:32,917
And goddamn it, l did it.

1034
01:34:33,362 --> 01:34:35,273
l'll never forget how it felt.

1035
01:34:35,482 --> 01:34:38,758
lt felt like his body
was trying to suck me into it.

1036
01:34:39,442 --> 01:34:41,114
Devour me.

1037
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:45,358
And then l did it too.

1038
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:53,551
And then

1039
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:57,239
we drove you back to Little River
and left you in your driveway.

1040
01:34:57,402 --> 01:34:58,517
The End.

1041
01:35:02,642 --> 01:35:04,917
And my nose was bleeding.

1042
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:08,794
How did that happen ?

1043
01:35:19,842 --> 01:35:22,436
When it was over and
we were getting you dressed,

1044
01:35:24,922 --> 01:35:28,119
your face looked like
you'd been erased.

1045
01:35:29,042 --> 01:35:31,602
And you were just empty inside.
And you just fell.

1046
01:35:31,922 --> 01:35:35,198
Face first on the floor.

1047
01:35:35,962 --> 01:35:38,795
And when we pulled you up,
your nose was bleeding.

1048
01:35:39,642 --> 01:35:41,280
Like this ?

1049
01:35:44,282 --> 01:35:45,840
Like this ?

1050
01:35:46,722 --> 01:35:47,757
Stop.

1051
01:35:58,842 --> 01:36:02,881
- No one's even home.
- No, someone's there.

1052
01:36:03,082 --> 01:36:04,834
- l can see them.
- Where ?

1053
01:36:05,322 --> 01:36:07,836
- l don't see anything.
- Now l see them too.

1054
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:09,920
What's going on ?

1055
01:36:10,362 --> 01:36:12,398
l think someone's in there.

1056
01:36:42,642 --> 01:36:45,440
And as we sat there
listening to the carolers,

1057
01:36:45,602 --> 01:36:49,515
I wanted to tell Brian it was over
and everything would be okay.

1058
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:51,474
But that was a lie.

1059
01:36:51,642 --> 01:36:53,519
Plus I couldn't speak anyway.

1060
01:36:54,722 --> 01:36:58,556
I wished there's some way for us
to go back and undo the past.

1061
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:02,037
But there wasn't.

1062
01:37:02,522 --> 01:37:04,990
There was nothing we could do.

1063
01:37:05,442 --> 01:37:08,320
So I just stayed silent and tried

1064
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,399
to telepathically communicate

1065
01:37:10,602 --> 01:37:13,992
how sorry I was
about what had happened.

1066
01:37:15,202 --> 01:37:19,036
I thought of all the sadness
and suffering in the world.

1067
01:37:19,522 --> 01:37:21,513
And made me want to escape.

1068
01:37:22,402 --> 01:37:26,111
I wished with all my heart we
could just leave this world behind.

1069
01:37:27,202 --> 01:37:30,831
Rise like two angels
in the night and magically...

1070
01:37:31,922 --> 01:37:33,640
..disappear.
