1
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,425
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

2
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,229
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

3
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,225
Have you called the police yet?

4
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,890
It's not my fault.
Have you called the police?

5
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,489
It's not my fault...

6
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,659
Have you?

7
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,928
It's not my fault.

8
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,333
I have.

9
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,299
It's not my fault.
He rushed the traffic lights.

10
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,539
Hold on, bro.

11
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,375
The ambulance's coming.

12
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,891
Help!

13
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,764
How're you, bro?

14
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,693
Cell phone...

15
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,496
Cell phone...

16
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,938
Here you are.

17
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,450
Battery?

18
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,224
I'll fix it for you.

19
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,032
What's the number? I'll dial it for you.

20
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,853
Kirk... What's wrong?

21
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,756
The driver of 1314 has an accident!

22
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,418
What should we do?

23
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,621
Where's Elvis? I don't know.

24
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,924
Call him now!

25
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,577
Man, I was so worry about you.

26
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,044
Where're you?

27
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,581
Man...

28
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,175
Man? Hello...

29
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,984
Man...

30
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,160
Who are you looking for, ma'am?

31
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,359
Man Liang.

32
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,264
What's your relationship to him?

33
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,028
Fiancée.

34
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,570
Wait a minute.

35
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,170
Is that her?

36
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,007
He had brain bleeding.

37
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,773
We tried our best but can't make it.

38
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,483
No... no.

39
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,678
I think you've made a mistake.

40
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,483
He just gave me a call.

41
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,648
I think you really must've made a mistake.

42
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:10,922
Sorry.

43
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,520
No... This can't be... it cannot be him.

44
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,190
He just called me.

45
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,392
It must be you guys who made a mistake...

46
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,662
Please check it again, will you?

47
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,702
Ma'am, please stay calm.

48
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,136
C'mon.

49
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm calm. But you've made a mistake.

50
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,635
That guy is not him!

51
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,274
Why are you here, Hale?

52
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,906
How is it?

53
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:28,911
It's alright.

54
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,482
Let's go there.

55
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,777
Here.

56
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,748
Doctor... Who are you looking for?

57
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,919
The driver of 1314... we're friends.

58
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,455
No... impossible...

59
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,398
He's just given me a call.

60
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,003
Ma'am it's the destination.

61
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,016
Isn't the North Street your destination?

62
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,812
How do you know that?

63
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,955
I usually give you a ride.

64
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,521
You're so "ugly". Who would forget you?

65
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,460
I wanna listen to this song.
Can I get off later?

66
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,394
Sure.

67
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,034
I can give you the CD,

68
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,001
OK? Great.

69
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,466
Maybe it's not such a goof idea.

70
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,734
You can listen to the song whenever
you catch my ride anyway.

71
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,668
What's the matter?
You ran away from home?

72
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,573
It's dangerous for a girl
to wander around so late.

73
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,914
Tell me your address. I'll take you home.

74
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,156
Isn't it... more dangerous?

75
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,557
Though I look like a playboy,

76
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,923
I'm a good bloke.

77
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,621
Look at my face...

78
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,101
Wait a minute. I pick up my boss home.

79
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,464
Hello.

80
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,701
You're off? Yes.

81
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,277
Thanks.

82
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,545
What's wrong?

83
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,446
Wanna eat something?

84
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,518
Let's go.

85
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,954
Do you like kids? You may play with him.

86
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,353
Whose baby is this?

87
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,522
Stupid question.

88
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,895
This smart baby must be my son.

89
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,287
Spacious!

90
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,660
Definitely.

91
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,395
You wouldn't believe this...

92
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,866
An old lady who usually catch my ride.

93
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,301
She walks like my mum,

94
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,031
so I helped her to get on and off.

95
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,299
Later we became friends.

96
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,136
When she knew I wanna rent a flat,
she showed me this.

97
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:10,970
Guess the rent.

98
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,668
How much?

99
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,301
Just three thousand something.

100
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,644
So nice guys always get rewards.

101
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,217
It's near the stop.
It takes less time for you to travel.

102
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,343
But it costs a lot.

103
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,649
Money is not a problem,
as long as this is a nice place.

104
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,484
Where should we put our sofa?

105
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,615
This kind of difficult design work...

106
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,353
it's better to leave it for your decision.

107
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,156
Sofa in beige colour

108
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,559
and wall sky blue.

109
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,598
Colourful curtain. Like a rainbow.

110
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,927
It makes you happy when you look at it.

111
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,059
You own my minibus.
You keep my passbook.

112
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,069
After getting married,
you can't return them to me.

113
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,230
When will you tell your dad?

114
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,999
I don't want to get into a scrap with him.

115
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:42,836
What?

116
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,909
I don't want to get into a scrap with him.

117
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,411
Well... I’ll invite him to come
for a dinner later.

118
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,174
It's me who tell him
about our wedding, OK?

119
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,537
Talk about this later.

120
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,118
Or let's try... the new room.

121
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,446
There's not even a bed.

122
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,452
No problem. I've never tried new poses.

123
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,812
Laurie. Time to go to school. Get changed.

124
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,511
I'll take you to a restaurant for breakfast.

125
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,679
Get changed.

126
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,484
I'll take you to restaurant
for breakfast, okay?

127
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,488
Laurie, remember... work hard.

128
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,493
Put the books into the bag.
Listen to the teacher, OK?

129
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,186
You can't be late for school, Laurie.

130
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,559
Get changed.

131
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,021
Where's your bag?

132
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,328
I've told you... don't put the bag
in the wrong place.

133
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,599
Where're your slippers?

134
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,401
Wash up. Be quick!

135
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,250
Ma'am, your money.

136
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,029
Have hair cut or washed, ma'am?

137
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,666
It's moved?

138
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,936
It's the next shop.

139
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,073
Hello. Miss Lam.

140
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,778
Please sit.

141
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,727
I give you a bag, Miss Lam.

142
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,199
Thanks.

143
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,426
Hello?

144
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,997
It's mum.

145
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,326
I've told your dad that

146
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,491
You and Man will come back
for a dinner tonight.

147
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,000
Do come back.

148
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,298
He's only long-winded.

149
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,396
Hello... are you listening to me?

150
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,236
Man's dead.

151
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,866
What?

152
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,979
He died in a traffic accident.

153
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,789
Holly...

154
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,963
How are you? Are you OK?

155
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,273
Holly...

156
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,438
Come on.

157
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,911
Don't stay in the street. Go back.

158
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,241
Jesus...

159
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,721
I can't cry.

160
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,888
It's exgratia payment.

161
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,281
Thank you.

162
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,021
I gotta work. Take care.

163
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,768
I was just on the scene.

164
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,944
It was me who called you that night.

165
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,980
I hung up as I saw you
come to the hospital.

166
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,553
It's me.

167
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,047
What's your name?

168
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,384
Laurie.

169
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,459
Sir?

170
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,497
Just call me Hale. I go now.

171
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,298
Thanks Welcome.

172
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,786
Laurie.

173
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,098
What's that?

174
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,365
Laurie the good boy,

175
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,332
let's put it into the niche together.

176
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,471
Don't open it.

177
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,917
It's daddy.

178
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,051
Yeah, he's dead.

179
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,678
Dead?

180
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,188
What is 'dead'?

181
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,351
It's... going on a trip.

182
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,699
Are they all going on a trip?

183
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,670
Why don't they take us with them?

184
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,636
Don't ask this kind of question.

185
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,212
Holly, I don't think it's good for you

186
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,287
to take care of Laurie...

187
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,552
It's alright, dad. Please take care of mum.

188
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,226
You also take care of yourself, Holly.

189
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,694
Mum, don't worry. I'm fine.

190
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,025
Come in.

191
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,661
Come here, Laurie.

192
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,738
It's pretty good.

193
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,115
Honey, come have a look.

194
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,386
Grandma.

195
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,689
Good boy...

196
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,593
Your dad and sis come see you.

197
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,192
We've worked together
for a long time, Peter.

198
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,534
It's not about the problem of trust.

199
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,742
Ye know... there're a lot of deceivers.

200
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,203
If you aren't firm,
don't get me into the troubles.

201
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,074
Bankruptcy is possible!

202
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,756
Laurie's a good boy.

203
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,061
Congratulations.

204
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,158
When did you become a grandma?

205
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,857
OK. That's it.

206
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,059
What's up?

207
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,363
Tell Helen: Don't send him the cheque.

208
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,904
Your friend's not reliable.

209
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,373
What are you going to do now?

210
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,009
Go back to your room, Laurie.

211
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,978
I'm talking to you!

212
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,314
Fine.

213
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,149
What?

214
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,053
I mean what will you do?

215
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,955
Calm down.

216
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,385
Are you gonna raise that kid?

217
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,895
Yeah.

218
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,356
You've made up your mind.
No need to care about you, right?

219
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,490
Any problem?

220
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,626
We may go then.

221
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,363
Stay calm. Let's discuss this issue.

222
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,666
Sit down...

223
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,272
There's no need to discuss any more.

224
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,005
Let's go, dad.

225
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,910
Sharon...

226
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,314
Holly, how can you go on like this?

227
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,651
Anything to be discussed? She's great.
No need to worry.

228
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,984
Or talk about Laurie's issue with his mum.

229
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,387
Ask her to take care of him.

230
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,959
Let's go. She doesn't want us to interfere.

231
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,186
I'll wait for you downstairs.

232
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,023
Wait a minute...

233
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,991
Honey...

234
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,462
Honey...

235
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,440
Keys, mum.

236
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,836
Don't be like this.

237
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,880
I'll make some soup

238
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:43,948
or do the cleaning for you.

239
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,573
Keys.

240
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,812
NO WAY!

241
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,892
I got it repaired, Hale. Have a look.

242
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,868
The mirrors and walkie talkie
have been removed.

243
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,337
The worn tyres are also replaced.

244
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,169
You're truly a vampire.

245
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,667
This minibus's useless.

246
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,041
Excuse me. Who's Charles?

247
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,145
Yeah.

248
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,740
Miss Lam? Charles

249
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,285
I want to get this minibus repaired.
How much is it?

250
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:23,721
Get it repaired?

251
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,756
It's better to replace it.

252
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,949
Maybe the engine still works.

253
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,027
But this minibus isn't lucky.

254
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,490
Don't bullshit.

255
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,224
Go to work...

256
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,664
Charles

257
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,270
Can you make it the same as before?

258
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,840
Well... miscellaneous included...

259
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,602
a hundred and ten thousand or more.

260
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,904
So expensive?

261
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,410
No.

262
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,003
Isn't there insurance?

263
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,213
Yeah...

264
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,046
But you have to pay
thirty thousand something first.

265
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,120
And thirty thousand something
for loading next year.

266
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,916
Maybe no insurance company
will accept the application.

267
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,820
It doesn't make sense.

268
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,132
Charles, how about eighty thousand?

269
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,433
Eighty thousand? No way.

270
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,912
Eighty thousand. No more bargain.

271
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,948
No way.

272
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,045
Well I'll call a tow company to tow it away.

273
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,317
Alright...

274
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,515
This time it's me who bear the cost.

275
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,591
I'll give it a try

276
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,125
Thanks and I want it to look
just the same as before.

277
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,441
Master! Please adjust the clutch pedal
to a higher position.

278
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,206
I have to fully step on it
to shift the gear. Too slow.

279
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,804
You car-racing?
Let me have a check first.

280
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,816
Hurry up. Gotta work.

281
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,909
OK. It's alright.

282
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:10,851
What's the matter?

283
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:11,820
Forget to bring the tea leaves.

284
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,618
You go to restaurant first
and I'll take the tea leaves.

285
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,413
I got it repaired. It's like brand new.

286
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,539
Thanks, Charles.

287
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,810
Thank you.

288
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,411
Lease it out?

289
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,284
No, I'll drive it on my own.

290
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,652
Well...

291
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,996
You are in the gear...

292
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,662
And fasten the seatbelt.

293
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,346
Which horse should we bet on?

294
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,248
Have a drink.

295
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,318
Thanks.

296
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,750
Welcome.

297
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,249
Who's this?

298
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,324
A woman.

299
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,622
Stop!

300
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,065
Hale, you're in "good luck".

301
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,397
Loudmouth.

302
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,369
Sorry. I didn't hit it on purpose.

303
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,670
I know. It doesn't matter.

304
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,607
That night... thanks.

305
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,182
It was a petty matter.

306
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,443
You're looking for somebody?

307
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,382
Yeah, I want to see Elvis.

308
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,882
Elvis, can you do me a favour?

309
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,256
Sit down.

310
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,827
What's the matter?

311
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,956
I want a place for the route
from this terminus.

312
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,555
Are you kidding?

313
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,596
I have a minibus driving license.

314
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,767
But you've never driven minibus.

315
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,372
I can manage.

316
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:41,996
I know...

317
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,473
But somebody has taken Man's place.

318
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,710
Just an extra vehicle.

319
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,177
If I had say, I wouldn't be
the terminal co-ordinator.

320
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,749
Well I'll talk about this with the boss.

321
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,444
But you have to pay for the place. It's a rule.

322
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,020
Man's paid for it.

323
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,055
But the sum is by head count not vehicle.

324
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,283
It's around a hundred thousand something.

325
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,526
But I don't have so much money.

326
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,426
You can be a freelancer.

327
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,363
You can run any routes.
See it as paid training sessions.

328
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,497
Thanks.

329
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,967
Welcome.

330
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,638
You go?

331
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,039
I reverse to make way for you.

332
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,442
Go away or she might hit you.

333
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:50,769
What?

334
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,899
Two inches left...

335
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,877
Tell all the bros:
Stay away from this woman.

336
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,781
Look. What's she doing?

337
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,585
Ma'am, you stole the minibus?

338
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,018
Got a driving license?
Need some guidance?

339
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,818
Come with me and I'll teach you how?

340
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,760
Come have a chat. C'mon.

341
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,591
Wait!

342
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,095
Have a chat!

343
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,437
Laurie, c'mon.

344
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,899
Eat them all. Don't waste them.

345
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,111
Enough? I give you more.

346
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,050
You're hurt?

347
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,117
Wear daddy's gloves.

348
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,063
Good boy. Now finish it.

349
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,969
Laurie, work hard.

350
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,669
And aunt will earn more money

351
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,837
and buy you more toys, OK?

352
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,312
I'm late.

353
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,936
Bitch. How come you overtake
in this way!

354
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,414
Ma'am, the sign's wrong.

355
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,021
Thanks.

356
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,753
Christ, late again!

357
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,160
Can you hurry up a little bit? I'm in a rush.

358
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,804
Look. The tram's faster than you.

359
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,905
Yeah, Please hurry up.

360
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,339
Got it.

361
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,689
How do you drive?

362
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,354
Sorry...

363
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,959
I don't have any change.

364
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,459
It doesn't matter.

365
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,665
Clearway! What?

366
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,395
Get off!

367
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,132
What's the matter, sir?

368
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,800
No stopping.

369
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:19,934
No stopping?

370
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,978
Clearway!

371
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:22,836
Here's a clearway?

372
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,812
7 a.m. to 12 a.m.!

373
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,109
Driving license.

374
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,115
Give me a chance, sir.

375
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
Driving license!

376
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,989
Still here? Forty-five minutes passed.

377
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,198
Poor.

378
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,614
Five hundred. Fuel, miscellaneous...

379
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,518
and a ticket.

380
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,121
Three hundred and twenty... My God.

381
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,665
Bastard! That bloke in suit...

382
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,267
What's the matter?

383
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,537
What're you doing, Laurie?

384
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,474
You break the pipe.

385
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,978
Get up. Quick.

386
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,710
Laurie, go to bed on your own.
Be a good boy.

387
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,691
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

388
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,358
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

389
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,395
Daddy, I'm going to bed.

390
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,369
When'll you be back?

391
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,634
I miss you so much.

392
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,472
And aunt's driving is really poor.

393
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,636
She drives very slowly.

394
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,279
Goodnight, daddy.

395
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,356
You look familiar, ma'am.

396
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,052
You used to run taxi service?

397
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,159
I seldom see such a young girl
running minibus service.

398
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,431
You like driving?

399
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,866
I want to hire a driver.

400
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,938
Want to work with me?

401
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,596
That's enough. Sit down.

402
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,730
So annoying!

403
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,400
I really want to hire a driver.

404
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,038
Be my driver...

405
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,907
Leave me alone!

406
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,549
Get off now!

407
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,321
This is too much!
You throw up on my bus?

408
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,520
Why are you so fierce?

409
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,994
Go!

410
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,343
Cross the harbour? Get on the bus.

411
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,284
Cross the harbour? Yeah.

412
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,446
Get on.

413
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,019
Hey...

414
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,559
You can't load passengers here!

415
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,094
I'm going now...

416
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,389
Sorry.

417
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,362
Please catch the next ride back.

418
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,629
Next ride back. Sorry.

419
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,865
Are you crazy?

420
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,961
If you'd been a man, I'd have hit you.

421
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,531
Go away!

422
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,110
Go!

423
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,872
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

424
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,276
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

425
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,046
Man...

426
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,148
I miss you.

427
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,154
Can you hear me?

428
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:41,694
Laurie...

429
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,824
Good boy. Help dad clean the vehicle.

430
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,563
Look at your grubby hands.
Give me your hands.

431
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,263
You'd said it's easy to run minibus service?

432
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,038
The passengers scolded me...

433
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,242
The cops gave me a ticket...

434
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,637
those gangs kicked me out...

435
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,142
And I received a fake note.

436
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,551
Why can't I take the passengers
at the terminal?

437
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,922
Tell me... what to do.

438
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,022
Well... Goodbye.

439
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,856
It's only the first day. Not used to it yet

440
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,056
I can manage.

441
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,029
It won't be late.

442
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:16,963
Wait for me at the terminal.

443
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,868
Take a rest. Tomorrow's another day.

444
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,400
I can manage.

445
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,686
That woman is really unbearable.

446
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,851
She has no ideas
about the signs and signals.

447
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,860
The taxi driver behind
blew horn to rush her.

448
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,362
She's nearly got lost.

449
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,626
She's so skinny and
still worked for two shifts.

450
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,598
She did?

451
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,599
Sure

452
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,329
Big Fool saw her last night.

453
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,428
Even us feel exhausted
after driving twelve hours.

454
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,370
How can she stand a job like this?

455
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,442
That's the point.

456
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,305
Do me a favour. Help her.

457
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,309
Crazy.

458
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,476
His fiancée’s died just recently.

459
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,105
Women need comfort.

460
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,810
Don't say this, OK!

461
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,816
Her boyfriend's just died.

462
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,149
She needs to pay the minibus mortgage
and raise Man's son.

463
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,979
Isn't she the mother of the child?

464
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,320
No. Man was divorced.

465
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,257
This lady's pretty good.

466
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,396
Sorry. May I ask you a question?

467
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,644
You were on the scene
of Man's accident, right?

468
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,015
Did he tell you anything?

469
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,953
Not a word?

470
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,152
He seemed to tell me...

471
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,755
He said, "tell her to be stronger.

472
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,527
Don't be too sad."

473
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,598
Maybe he wanted me to tell you these.

474
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,401
Then he asked me
to pick up the cell phone.

475
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,907
He might want to call you.

476
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,179
But he didn't make it.

477
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,280
How was he at that time?

478
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,886
Was he very painful?

479
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,057
It was just a short while.
I don't think he suffered much.

480
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,766
Thanks.

481
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,800
Not at all.

482
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,082
Excuse me. Please make way for me.

483
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,313
I need to drive the vehicle away.

484
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,889
There's enough room.

485
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,516
I'll help you.

486
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:56,857
Thanks.

487
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,070
These roads are narrow. Give it back later.

488
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,334
Thanks.

489
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,911
Why do you start with second gear?

490
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,341
It's too slow to use bottom gear for start.

491
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,045
We normally use it on the slope...

492
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,418
or for our own vehicle.

493
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,921
Bottom gear start reduces
the vehicle depreciation.

494
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,219
If you're on the same row with an 'enemy',

495
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,854
waiting for the green light
to hunt for the passenger,

496
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,190
you have to use second gear.

497
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,201
Hunt for passengers...

498
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,497
No hunt, no passengers, right?

499
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,298
That's true.

500
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,532
Remember: Wait for the amber light

501
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,438
but do rush when it's alight.

502
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,970
And don't brake hard.

503
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,878
Otherwise, the passengers get hurt easily.

504
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,009
And this makes the vehicle behind
brake hard too

505
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,213
or it may crash your vehicle.

506
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,483
Running minibus service isn't as easy
as I think.

507
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,258
Have you learnt how to run the service?

508
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,901
I... caught Man's ride before.

509
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,072
Well...

510
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,836
I show you once. Be careful.

511
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,045
As a beginner, you must learn the signs,

512
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,621
recognise the routes and

513
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,981
remember the clearways and loading zones.

514
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,253
This sign, no loading during
the periods of 8 a.m. to 10 a.m...

515
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,886
So many restrictions.

516
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,994
But rules and practice

517
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,725
are different.

518
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,761
Do remember this sign.

519
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,667
No stopping at any time.

520
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,299
No loading at any time in this zone.

521
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,309
Turn to another street
for loading and unloading.

522
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,675
But those old passengers
should know this.

523
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,159
Be hawk-eyed.
Unload passengers if needed.

524
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,751
No loading, then accelerate.

525
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,261
The faster the ride, the more the rides.

526
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,264
The more the rides, the more the earnings.

527
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,105
Watch out!

528
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,108
It's always for the giant to bully the tiny.

529
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,905
No need to fear those taxi drivers.

530
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,741
Just drive close to them.

531
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,474
Scare them and they must make way
for you.

532
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,687
Just give them a scare
but don't really crash into them.

533
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,881
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

534
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,854
Look...

535
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,755
Crazy!

536
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,096
That idiot calls a minibus in the red routes.

537
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,133
If you wanna load this passenger,
look the mirrors first

538
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,361
to make sure there're no cops.

539
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,403
No cops. It's safe.

540
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,234
Then go for it.

541
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,137
Hurry up, it's red route.

542
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,177
Take a seat...

543
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,347
Look out!

544
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,711
Are you OK?

545
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,784
Get off in the next mouth.

546
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,047
Please alight beyond the clearway.

547
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,857
Loading only in the clearway.

548
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,790
It ensures an earning.

549
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,157
Unloading may bring you a ticket.

550
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,355
Too risky.

551
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,931
Who pities you?

552
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,895
A passenger.

553
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,004
Hey... you've missed that!

554
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,006
Sorry. Only a bit farther.

555
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,810
Forget about the horn and

556
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,976
complaints.

557
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,314
Why do you run your service like this?

558
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,157
Passengers will understand
your difficulties.

559
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,248
They won't make any troubles for you.

560
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,459
Anyone get off ahead? Gotta paid first.

561
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,590
Yeah.

562
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,156
Thanks.

563
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,040
Any one get off before the red route?
No stopping there

564
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,547
And if there are cops stopping you,

565
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,640
pretend you're not seeing them.

566
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,911
Gamble on fleeing the chase.

567
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,850
If not, beg for a chance.

568
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:17,886
It's easy for a woman to make it.

569
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,151
Soft tone and sweet smile.
You'll surely make it.

570
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,156
But I failed every time.

571
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,251
Weep then.

572
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,296
Weeping is the best weapon of women.

573
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,559
The cops let you go if they pity you.

574
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,603
Thanks.

575
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,642
Your profit is three times more than mine.

576
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,579
I'm lucky this time.

577
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,675
I broke the record when
I started to run minibus service.

578
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,253
No passenger for whole-day rides.

579
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,353
Hello? Yeah.

580
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,786
I'll come over now.

581
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,920
My son has a fever.
I must pick him up now.

582
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,722
Then your turn.

583
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,696
No, you're faster. It's near the terminus.

584
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,426
OK. Thanks.

585
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,094
Are you OK, Laurie?

586
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,102
Why are you so late?

587
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,399
Take him to see the doctor.

588
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,734
Sorry.

589
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,370
Aunt.

590
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,546
Come here!

591
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,612
I gotta work.

592
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,053
I got something to tell you!

593
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,716
Can you take care of him for a moment?

594
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,192
Just tell me what you want...
once and for all.

595
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,697
I don't want you drop in so suddenly.

596
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,528
Are you crazy?
You really run a minibus service?

597
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,898
Can you stop it?
How can you go on like this?

598
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,233
Man's gone and the story's over.
You still keep his son?

599
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,806
That's enough. Don't say this, OK!

600
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,307
If Man had been alive,
we would've got married

601
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,139
and Laurie would've been my son.

602
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,803
I'll do my best. I'm not that kind
of person like you.

603
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,205
You can't live off on your own.

604
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,714
How can you keep the kid?

605
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,880
So what?

606
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:54,746
Leave him or

607
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,046
send him to an orphanage?

608
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,677
How about his relatives?

609
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,412
His grandparents only live off
social security. Besides, his grandma's sick.

610
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,788
How about his mum? Where's she?

611
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,722
To be pragmatic, Holly.

612
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,295
You're an adult.
Don't play this kind of romantic game!

613
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,454
Look at you.

614
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,429
You look pallid!

615
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,967
None of your business.
I don't bring any troubles for you, right?

616
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,230
Just as I don't think in the same way
like you do.

617
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,865
I don't need any luxury cars

618
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,068
nor clothing.

619
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,109
I'm still happy.

620
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,338
Is money the only thing on your mind?

621
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,278
Don't talk about me!

622
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,475
I earn money not just for myself.

623
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,848
Who supports dad after he retired?

624
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,750
You spend on the monthly instalment,

625
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,255
rent and the kid.

626
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,258
Have you given a buck to the family?

627
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,257
You think of the kid.

628
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,626
Why don't you think of your parents?

629
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,129
You're selfish!

630
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,030
I tell you, don't ask mum for money.

631
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,228
That means she can only
give you the money?

632
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,899
I take the money for investment,
not spend it.

633
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,900
What 'spend it'?

634
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,341
What're you looking at?

635
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,810
She's so fierce.

636
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,211
You know it?

637
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,407
Yeah.

638
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,044
Then am I fierce?

639
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,577
Yes or no...

640
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,452
He really has a fever.
Need to visit the doctor now!

641
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,127
Who's he?

642
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:16,896
If you go on like this,

643
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,490
both the kid and you will die.

644
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,071
What's the matter?

645
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,615
OK. Just park it aside.

646
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,144
Alright.

647
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,547
Let me carry him.

648
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,643
It's alright. He's heavy. Let me carry him.

649
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:38,721
Thanks.

650
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,659
Good boy...

651
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,196
Good boy, take some medicine...

652
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,892
Listen to me, good boy...

653
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,763
Don't move or it spills out.

654
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,851
Meal's ready, Laurie."

655
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,516
Come.

656
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:15,782
Eat the soup. Thanks.

657
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,155
It's hot. Be careful.

658
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,202
Salty and sweet... is it OK?

659
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,394
How's the soup? Seems a bit salty.

660
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,405
No, it tastes good.

661
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,499
Your clothes got dirty.

662
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,405
Is that... I help you.

663
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,034
No, I can do it myself.

664
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,607
Eat it.

665
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,069
Go to bed yourself after dinner, okay?

666
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,569
Your sink pipe got blocked.

667
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,798
Yeah. I've cleared it many times
but still can't fix it.

668
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,069
Buy a drain cleaner.

669
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,700
What? Drink cleaner?

670
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,507
No, D.R.I.A.N. Drain cleaner.

671
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,741
I can help you clear it when I'm available.

672
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,009
Thank you.

673
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,813
I take you to the terminal.

674
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:17,983
No.

675
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,988
I live in the place nearby.
Take care of the child.

676
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,183
He goes to bed on his own. It's OK.

677
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,782
You leave him alone at home?

678
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,557
What's wrong?

679
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,664
Oh... I forget to make him some milk.

680
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,234
You may go first if you are in a hurry.

681
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,573
He isn't a baby any more.
Still use baby milk bottle?

682
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,610
Yeah, it's his late night refreshment.

683
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,545
I think...

684
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,019
it's difficult... for you to go on like this.

685
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,356
I know you have sentiment on the minibus.

686
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,618
But if you lease it out,

687
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,818
you can put more effort on Laurie.

688
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,724
No, I'm not familiar with any drivers.

689
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,026
What if they crash the vehicle
or go away with it?

690
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,234
Frankly speaking,
do you know how to calculate?

691
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,737
I guess you repay the mortgage
of the vehicle.

692
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,899
Even if it's your own vehicle.
Renting it out is a must.

693
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,204
Two shifts a day. A thousand.

694
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,371
Rent, fuel and tickets...

695
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,073
How much can you earn?

696
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,747
And also the license fee, insurance,
maintenance...

697
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,910
Brake system replacement
at 3-month interval

698
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,817
and tyres 4-month.

699
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,023
Everything needs money.

700
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,750
If you don't do the calculations,
how can you make a profit?

701
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,521
And also the tickets.

702
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,988
If you got more points incurred,
you're disqualified.

703
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,123
You can't count on running
a minibus service then.

704
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,901
With money, you can pay the rent,

705
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,528
tuition and food.

706
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,575
Your sis may be right.

707
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,939
Why are you all the same?

708
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,949
Why do you all...
do calculations on everything?

709
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,384
I believe I can manage.
I don't need your help.

710
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,690
Sorry,

711
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,056
I'm loudmouth.

712
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,798
I'm leaving now. Bye.

713
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,515
Boss, prosperous business?

714
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,084
See. Buy two more fishes.

715
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,091
You really sell the biz to me?

716
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,058
Yeah, I've told you.

717
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:38,820
So, you do? Keep your promise.

718
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,489
I do. No reason to deceive you, right?

719
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,506
It's more comfortable here.

720
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,942
It was like in the jail just now.

721
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,304
C'mon.
