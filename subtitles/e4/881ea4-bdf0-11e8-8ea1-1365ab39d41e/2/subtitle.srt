1
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:06,723
Have a chat each other.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,325
Don't get into fight.

3
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:24,372
Hale, barbecue again?

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,606
Join me for barbecue.

5
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,574
No, I already had a date.

6
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:29,310
Do come with your friends.
The ribs are pretty good.

7
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:30,612
Maybe next time.

8
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,331
Hello... Who's calling?

9
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,261
He's not available at the moment.

10
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,543
Hale, gimme a call at once.

11
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:30,945
Laurie, come on. We back home.

12
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,442
You brought him together during the rides?

13
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,811
Yeah.

14
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:39,917
Let me carry him.

15
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,148
Thanks.

16
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,451
Two hundred and sixty-two.

17
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,093
No tickets. Less the rent and fuel,

18
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,893
I earn two hundred and sixty-two.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,059
Pretty good. Let's go.

20
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,172
You're awake?

21
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,574
I'm hungry.

22
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,276
I cook for you

23
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:14,785
Here comes the meal.

24
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,452
It's hot. Be careful.

25
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,792
I got you a night-shift driver.

26
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:48,453
Go to bed.

27
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,354
What's your name?

28
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:51,916
Hale.

29
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:54,087
What should I call you?

30
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,720
Whatever you like.

31
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,260
How about Hale?

32
00:02:58,567 --> 00:02:59,226
I'm old enough to be your dad,

33
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,893
still call me Hale?

34
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,570
Uncle Beard?

35
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,204
What if I don't have beard?

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,902
What'll you call me?

37
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,570
Lucky.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,705
What? Lucky?

39
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:14,510
Lucky is a puppy's name.

40
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:19,311
Go to bed, good boy.

41
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,725
How about your mum?

42
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:27,153
No idea. Maybe she's on a trip.

43
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:31,297
Do you miss your daddy?

44
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:34,733
Yeah, I miss him so much.

45
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,066
Why does the TV work again?

46
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,668
Lucky got it repaired.

47
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:17,879
Who's Lucky?

48
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,346
That is Hale.

49
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,145
He also did the curtain, right?

50
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:25,686
Don't know.

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,527
The mirror isn't clear.

52
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,665
Do you get the right spectacles?

53
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,367
Sorry, I got the wrong pair.

54
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,310
Can he manage? I'm worried about him.

55
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,403
It's difficult to find such a reliable driver.

56
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,880
He hands you the minibus on time
and refill the fuel.

57
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,450
Ma'am...

58
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,679
Don't think I'm an idiot.

59
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:01,322
I raise four children
with the minibus service.

60
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,982
They all got a university degree.

61
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,251
It's boring to stay at home all the time.

62
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,420
So I just wanna kill time.

63
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,097
Hand over at 3 p.m.
He'll park the vehicle outside your home.

64
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:11,892
Thank you, Uncle Chiu.

65
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:14,367
OK. Bye.

66
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,701
I go to work now.

67
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:28,048
Hale, do me a favour to raise my son too.

68
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:30,181
Iced lemon tea. Got it.

69
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:32,149
You help her only. It isn't fair to me.

70
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:34,586
Hale dress up and got shaved.

71
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,454
You're gonna get her soon.
Still pretend to be cool?

72
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,092
Shut up.

73
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:40,822
Hale, let's place a bet for 3T together.

74
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,228
He has given up on gambling
for a long time.

75
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,357
Besides, he needs to saves money.

76
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:46,223
That's it.

77
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,394
The economy is halted.
Always got a free gift whatever you buy.

78
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:51,064
A widow with a son as a gift.
No need to pay for the napkins.

79
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:51,969
Yeah

80
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,006
What're you talking about?

81
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,771
Just kidding. What's wrong?

82
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:00,478
You wanna make troubles?

83
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,346
Hale...

84
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,749
You think you're still well-off?

85
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,015
Still got vehicles for lease?
That's not the case!

86
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,590
Look at you! What did you say?

87
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,589
Relax. Just minor business, right?

88
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,454
Don't fight over this.

89
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,754
Get on board...

90
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,853
Go. Set off!

91
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,219
The tyres have worn out.

92
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,812
Two seats left. Get on.

93
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,022
Come on!

94
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,794
You steal my passengers!

95
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,330
Another ride.

96
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,397
The tyres have worn out.

97
00:06:58,507 --> 00:06:59,701
Have you called the tow service?

98
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:01,673
It's expensive.

99
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:03,443
Please help me change it.

100
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:06,878
Can't make it.

101
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:08,449
Why?

102
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,519
Trust me. Replace the tyres in the garage.

103
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:12,052
Please hurry up.

104
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,686
Watch out and go back to the pavement.

105
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,813
Ma'am, this doesn't work.

106
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,388
Take it to the garage.

107
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:56,194
Hello?

108
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,357
Hello. Has your vehicle been on tow?

109
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,734
Yeah, thanks.

110
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:02,799
Where're you?

111
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,505
At the terminal.

112
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,338
Can you pick Laurie up?

113
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,376
I can't make it on time.

114
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,039
Yeah, I'll go now.

115
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,375
Bye.

116
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,382
Sorry. Ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:16,951
please get on the next ride.

118
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,314
Sorry...

119
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:21,453
What's the matter?

120
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,952
Hale...

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,667
See you tomorrow.

122
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,664
See you.

123
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:47,241
Sir, you're...

124
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,542
Are you Miss Cheung?

125
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm... a friend of his family.
I'll help take him home.

126
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,322
Laurie, who's he?

127
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,884
Lucky.

128
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,293
I'm a friend of his mom's.

129
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,455
But it used to be his dad
who took him home.

130
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,464
My dad died.

131
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,405
Are you crazy?

132
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,303
Sir...

133
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,903
Please tell his family.

134
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,811
They haven't paid the tuition fees
for two months.

135
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:24,844
Have you taken Laurie home?

136
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:26,818
Not yet. I want to take him out.

137
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,321
Don't you have to work?

138
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,949
I want to take a rest.
I'll bring him home later.

139
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,857
That's fine.

140
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,220
You bought my tuition fee?

141
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,993
Not 'bought' tuition fee.
I 'paid' your tuition fees.

142
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,863
Could you buy me an ice cream?

143
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,561
Sure.

144
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,036
What favour do you like?

145
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:00,714
Watch out.

146
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,894
Did uncle buy you all the gifts?

147
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,492
Where's Uncle Chiu?

148
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:12,795
I've thought about it.
It's better to drive it myself.

149
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,368
Why?

150
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:18,599
I can get more and save more
from driving by myself.

151
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:29,110
You made the soup?

152
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,124
What...

153
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:39,751
Did I forget to pay the tuition fee?

154
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,156
I've paid it for you.

155
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,689
I'll give it back to you.

156
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,993
Take your time.

157
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,897
By the way, I've fixed your sink.

158
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,504
Save your money, man.

159
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,043
It's OK.

160
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:58,241
I bought them for your kid only.

161
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,813
What? Are you OK?

162
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,515
OK.

163
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,087
Miss Lam, my mom send me
to collect the rent.

164
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:20,594
Don't worry. I'll pay you soon.

165
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,634
No way...

166
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,830
You've held it off month after month.

167
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,201
I fear no bad tenant!

168
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:26,967
Miss Lam,

169
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,942
you know the elders live on rent.

170
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:32,275
Don't worry, I'll pay you after two days.

171
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:35,179
OK. I'll wait till that day but no more.

172
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:37,047
I'll come next Monday.

173
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:38,984
Don't hold it off any more at that time.

174
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,923
Don't worry. The landlady is kind.

175
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:49,054
It's her daughter who's troublesome.

176
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,290
She fears that I can't pay the rent.

177
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,197
I work so hard.
How can I make no money?

178
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:56,902
If I hadn't blown the tyre today,

179
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:59,132
I would have made it.

180
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:29,160
Eight dollars for crossing the harbour.
Hop in!

181
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,738
Eight dollars only, get in.

182
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:31,965
Hop in!

183
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,938
Damn, stop!

184
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,034
Stop!

185
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:35,871
Open the door!

186
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:40,972
How dare you! Stop...

187
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:48,854
Damn it! I'll dig you up.

188
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,858
Where did the clunker 1314 come from?

189
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,517
It seemed to come from Eastern District.

190
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,719
Good. Anyway,

191
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,592
tell our men to get her tonight!

192
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:56,322
Got it!

193
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,803
You snatched the passengers
from their turfs?

194
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,944
I'll settle it for you.
Take the kid to school first.

195
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:48,243
What're you doing?

196
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,146
I'm calling the police.

197
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,185
Are you nuts? Can it help?

198
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,548
Do you know them?

199
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,417
I'll revenge if I do.

200
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,790
How do you revenge? Kill him?

201
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,226
Where did you go last night?

202
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,760
How dared you snatch the passengers
from their turfs?

203
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:02,557
They all have triad backgrounds!

204
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:04,529
They ruin my business.
I'm starving to death!

205
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,863
All professions have their own rules.
You must obey them.

206
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:08,334
I believe there's justice in the world.

207
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:09,495
See them with me!

208
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:10,503
I'm not tough like you.

209
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:12,540
Go by yourself. I won't go with you.

210
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:14,231
You only act by yourself!

211
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,744
Hey!

212
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,223
Bitch!

213
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:42,002
Which bastard wrecked my car?

214
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,798
Me! What can you do?

215
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:44,530
How dare you push me?

216
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,198
Is money the only way to go?

217
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:47,941
I wanna earn my bread and butter only.

218
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:48,566
Yeah!

219
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,042
I'll call the police to nail you. I swear it!

220
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,238
Don't push me any more. I warn you!

221
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:54,372
Kill me! If you dare!

222
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,142
Stay here if you have the guts!

223
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,683
Kill me!

224
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:58,250
Don't run away!

225
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,082
Shau Kei Wan. Hurry.

226
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,554
What's with you?

227
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,955
Don't do anything rash. OK?

228
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,549
Listen to me this time. Alright?

229
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:07,525
I'll settle it for you!

230
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:21,836
Listen...

231
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,844
Let me do the talking.
Don't do anything rash.

232
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:26,776
I'll try my best.

233
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,611
Uncle Seven.

234
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,548
Elvis, you're here.

235
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:35,554
Wanna play mah-jong?

236
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:36,453
Come on. Let's...

237
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:37,217
I'll take a rain-check.

238
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,486
Uncle Seven, I'd like to talk with you.

239
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,960
My granddaughter is holding
a birthday party tonight.

240
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,922
Talk to me tomorrow.

241
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:46,329
Sorry, Uncle Seven. Just for a while.

242
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,105
What's the matter?

243
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,609
You know, Man was killed in the crash.

244
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,543
His wife wanna take the route for him.

245
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,339
That's her?

246
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:00,676
Yes.

247
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,746
I have told you

248
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,839
not to queue up.

249
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,942
She can take the route once she pays.

250
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:05,542
I know. Uncle Seven.

251
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,145
But she's got no money.
So we wanna ask for your help.

252
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,882
No money... you two may help her out.

253
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:16,395
And she's really gutsy.

254
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:19,467
If she keeps buggering around,

255
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,229
you'll be in big trouble one day! Got it?

256
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:22,268
I must drive to the terminus.

257
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,337
Terminus?

258
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:24,530
Your man died, and I have to pay you?

259
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,766
Then, what if dad dies,
his son asks for help?

260
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,240
And what if an older bro dies?
Free for his younger bro?

261
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:30,368
Can I still make a living?
Absolutely not!

262
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,037
I must drive to the terminus.

263
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,308
Dad,
today’s your granddaughter's birthday.

264
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,247
Cut anything about death!

265
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:49,988
For your goodies.

266
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,169
Kiddo, you're so cute.

267
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:59,604
How old are you?

268
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,367
Five.

269
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:01,442
Five only?

270
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:02,305
Granddad!

271
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,707
Good gal.

272
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:05,374
Laurie Leung.

273
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,970
Charlene Cheung.

274
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:08,947
I'm celebrating my birthday today.

275
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,018
My auntie wanna drive to the terminus.

276
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,178
For what?

277
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:14,619
I don't know.

278
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,156
Play with me.

279
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,757
I love to.

280
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:21,724
Uncle Seven, they're friends.

281
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,457
They may become very close friends
one day.

282
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:25,624
Yes, it's man who sets the rules.

283
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:26,962
You can always change them.

284
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:30,799
My boy, a dozen grand only.
You can help them.

285
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:33,498
Spare her the charge, please.
Uncle Seven.

286
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,337
That's right.
You'll be rewarded for your good will.

287
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:36,273
Right? Auntie.

288
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:37,743
Auntie? How do you do?

289
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:39,245
OK, well...

290
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,871
I make an exception this time and not next.

291
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,684
All set. What got you into a fuss?

292
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,048
I've told you not to worry.

293
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:47,746
You're just lucky today.

294
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:48,823
To tell the truth, those guys...

295
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,755
are only bluffing. They're just wusses.

296
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,292
I am never scared.

297
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,428
Shush.

298
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:56,128
If they reject me,

299
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,165
I'll ask them to return Man's money to me.

300
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,631
Right, Laurie?

301
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:01,292
You're nuts! OK...

302
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,098
I'll go to the market and buy some food.
Let's celebrate tonight.

303
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:05,732
It's late now. Save it.

304
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,575
Where are you going?

305
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:14,274
Sir, any shrimps and crabs?

306
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,474
All sold out!

307
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,711
Then... any fish?

308
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,277
Can't you see fish?

309
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,854
I sell you all for 30 dollars.

310
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,058
I can't take all these. Too many for a meal.

311
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,717
Two sets are enough.

312
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,193
This fish... can you make it into a dish?

313
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,595
I can pan-fry it to make it a good dish.

314
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,467
The vegetable stall is closing.
Keep this for me.

315
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,629
Sorry, sir. I don't want it.

316
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,298
How much is the cabbage?

317
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,738
Five dollars for one catty.

318
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:44,712
You don't want it?

319
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,178
It is decaying. Dump it.

320
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:48,841
Can you give it to me
if I buy two more catty from you?

321
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,679
Take all home if you like.

322
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,250
Thank you.

323
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:08,293
I waste no food.

324
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:09,995
Don't you know you're in a mess?

325
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:13,671
It's alright if you can't handle it.
Stop push yourself.

326
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,103
It may be OK for a grown-up.
But how about the kid?

327
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,042
If the days go like this,
you are raising him like a dog.

328
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,875
Is it OK to feed him, water him like a dog?

329
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,812
I know you've been helping me a lot.

330
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,477
And I don't want to cause you
any more troubles.

331
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,645
I shouldn't ask for help all the time.

332
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:28,923
It doesn't matter.

333
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:31,185
But no one will sympathize
with you for good.

334
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:35,093
I know.
I don't want to be a laughing stock.

335
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,823
Didn't Man told you at the time of dying...

336
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,695
that I must be tough?

337
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,000
To be frank,

338
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,464
Man at his time of dying
didn't tell me he loved you.

339
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,099
He didn't tell you to be tough.

340
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,007
That's my own words.

341
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:03,890
Why did you lie to me?

342
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,487
You cheated me!

343
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,993
I told you that...

344
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,701
to help you, to make you feel better.

345
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:22,306
But I might be wrong.

346
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:14,158
I am very busy and cannot receive
your call at the moment.

347
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,197
Please leave your phone number.
I'll reply you soon.

348
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,507
Where's Laurie?

349
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:31,402
His mom is dining out with him
for his birthday.

350
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:34,576
I've thought about it.

351
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:35,847
If you think it's not easy,

352
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,815
I'll ask his mom to raise him.

353
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,250
No way.

354
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:42,517
I love you but I love Laurie even more.

355
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,420
It's hard to raise a child.

356
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:47,652
Then, why did you fight for his custody?

357
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:50,526
A woman can't marry
if she got a child with her.

358
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,259
That's it.

359
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,562
You can't dump even a dog like that.

360
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:56,296
Do you agree?

361
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,562
Yes.

362
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:03,671
You've done a very good job.
No one will blame you.

363
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:07,737
For me,
a wife is your solution to your troubles.

364
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,351
You're right.

365
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,780
Let me get one tomorrow.

366
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:16,053
Marry me!

367
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,485
Marry you?

368
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,857
Will you do?

369
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,088
I'll do if you say 'I do'.

370
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,497
No. You'll do if I say 'I do'.

371
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:29,131
Will you say 'I do'?

372
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:30,936
Scare me stiff.

373
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,132
What? What scares you?

374
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,105
You know what scares me.

375
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,267
I have a hard time raising my son.

376
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:36,104
You'll add to my burden.

377
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:39,146
No! You must marry me...

378
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:08,976
Come up with a solution later.
Go to bed early.

379
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:23,155
Susan...

380
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:24,555
I know.

381
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,889
I was not in Hong Kong. So...

382
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:28,752
Are you available?

383
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:31,827
I'd like to talk with you.

384
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,831
I'm married.

385
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:37,170
Why do you know my address?

386
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:39,136
His mom told you?

387
00:23:39,574 --> 00:23:41,405
I can't help you...

388
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:42,667
I've brought him to dad and mom

389
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:44,870
after Man's death.

390
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,503
No... I saw them...

391
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:48,673
I've paid them some grand.

392
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:50,910
What're you up to?
Wanna bring him to me?

393
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,010
No... I can't help you!

394
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,484
At that time, I didn't want to have him.

395
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,559
It's Man who insisted on having him.

396
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,719
We've gone through all the procedure.

397
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,989
I know. But...

398
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:11,900
Who are you?

399
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:16,067
Take him back now, I beg you.

400
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,312
You want money?

401
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:22,611
Give me your account number. I'll pay you.

402
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:25,652
Give me some time if you want a big sum.

403
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:28,415
I'll try my best to discuss with my husband.

404
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:31,617
I... I've got no money...

405
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,688
Let's go.

406
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:47,473
I'm so sorry.

407
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,800
I split up with Man right after his birth.

408
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,179
I've seen him a few times only!

409
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:08,985
Don't worry.

410
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:11,595
I'll bring Laurie to see you when I'm free.

411
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:19,864
Sorry.

412
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:27,738
Do you mean that?

413
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,845
Then tell me how can you deal with it?

414
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:35,512
Any other way out?

415
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:49,993
So hungry. Get something to eat. Go.

416
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:51,162
Let's get something to eat.

417
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,440
Sorry, I wasted your time.

418
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,380
Any other relatives?

419
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,915
They live on pension.

420
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:10,047
His grandma got hurt
when she fell down last week.

421
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:19,092
For the Rent?
Or the instalments on the car?

422
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:21,893
Let me lend you some money.

423
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:26,203
No.

424
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:35,582
Which one do you like?

425
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,712
You may pick more.

426
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:40,115
Really?

427
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:50,059
Don't buy any more.
He'll get the clothes inside.

428
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,791
Let's buy two.

429
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:55,860
Laurie. Take one more.

430
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,834
I'm full.

431
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:58,462
You have fed him three.

432
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,336
He used to love this goody. One more.

433
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,432
You wanna choke him on ice cream?

434
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:06,711
Stop. He'll have loose bowels
with too many ice-creams.

435
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:09,214
He can ease himself in the toilet.
He loves ice cream.

436
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:10,545
One more. Good boy.

437
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,242
Enjoy it...

438
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:13,614
Orphanage

439
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:21,054
Can you bring him in for me?

440
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:22,925
I can't!

441
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:27,095
I can't. He'll hate me for good.

442
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:29,333
I'd rather put your dog down for you.

443
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,303
I can't.

444
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,835
I can't.

445
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:36,173
Laurie, let's go.

446
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,709
Say goodbye to uncle.

447
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,547
Uncle Hale won't go with us?

448
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,563
Where do you want to bring me?

449
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:58,894
I'll be a good boy.

450
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,796
I'll listen to you.

451
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:04,838
Auntie can't keep you.

452
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:08,903
Don't give me up.
I don't know my way home.

453
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,407
But I've got no way out.

454
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:16,210
Laurie must be a good boy.

455
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,080
Beware of the bullies.
Take good care of yourself.

456
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,710
I'll be a good boy.

457
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:22,688
Don't desert me. Mom.

458
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:29,125
I beg you. Take me to Dad and Grandma.

459
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:32,259
Forgive me.

460
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:40,007
Uncle Hale wanna keep me?

461
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,770
Hale...

462
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:52,976
Hale!

463
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:54,413
Hey!

464
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:56,947
What should I do?

465
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,501
Can you really send him away?

466
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:10,901
You should sell your minibus before him.

467
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,706
Don't cry...

468
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:16,970
Let me keep him, OK?

469
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,511
I'll keep him!

470
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,311
Come on. It's OK.

471
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:30,083
Don't cry...

472
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:31,886
Let's go. Go.

473
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:36,661
What will the others think
when they see us?

474
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:40,994
OK. Let's go...

475
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,036
Alright...

476
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:44,668
Don't cry.

477
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:50,576
The kite's high in the sky!

478
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,244
It drops.

479
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:00,381
A fallen kite!

480
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:23,608
Check out your throne.

481
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,904
Come on. Belt up.

482
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,016
Be careful.

483
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:31,140
And this board.

484
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:33,149
You can pull it down...

485
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:37,088
to do homework, drawing...
so safe and comfy.

486
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:39,283
Isn't it great? What's more...

487
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,127
Laurie, you see.

488
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:42,217
Thank you!

489
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,025
I've got something for you, too.

490
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:51,064
Call her mom, not auntie any more.

491
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:52,503
Why?

492
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,700
Coz your auntie will be happy about it.

493
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,140
Got it?

494
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,539
My mom got it from the temple.

495
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:02,577
It's great.

496
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,344
And...

497
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:07,478
I made a pack of keys for you.
It helps you see Laurie.

498
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,317
Terrific.

499
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,249
By the way, I've got an idea.

500
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:13,816
Laurie and you go live with me.

501
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:15,657
And you no longer need to pay the rent.

502
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:19,062
Come to my home when you're free.
It's a nice place.

503
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:21,562
Let me think about it.

504
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,234
Yes, think it over.

505
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:25,897
Coz... if I move,

506
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:28,475
it's wise to live out
the prepayment of two months.

507
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:30,544
That's right. Think it over.

508
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:32,240
I'll go now. You gotta work.

509
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:34,538
Bye.

510
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,240
Thanks a lot.

511
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:36,611
You're welcome.

512
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,585
Bye. Papa!

513
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:43,953
Bye. Sit down.

514
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,351
This kid's brainy and honey mouthed.

515
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,731
What's up?

516
00:31:57,438 --> 00:31:58,996
You pay the instalments on the car
for someone?

517
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,103
Who's bullshitting?

518
00:32:02,677 --> 00:32:04,542
There aren't many car companies around.

519
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,240
It's typically human.

520
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,848
One tends to gossip about others
but not oneself.

521
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,474
I just wanna help the kiddo!

522
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,315
Yes. You're right. But...

523
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:15,548
Got it.

524
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:16,953
What did you get? I haven't finished yet.

525
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,821
I said I got it!

526
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:21,790
It's good to give a helping hand,
but bad to overdo it.

527
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:24,090
What are the scruples
about helping people?

528
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:26,962
I don't mean that. I mean...

529
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:30,333
an existential subject may not be
an empirical one

530
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:33,498
yet an empirical one may not be
a rational one, right?

531
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,710
You must have read
too many hentai comics.

532
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,780
So, you talk like a philosopher.

533
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:52,750
Watch out!

534
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:55,321
You coward.

535
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,364
Aren't you gutsy? What scares you?

536
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:00,229
Give it your hand.

537
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:01,665
Let it shake with you.

538
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:07,465
Come on, let it smell your hand
and know you're Laurie.

539
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:42,976
He'll have a very good sleep
coz he played so tired.

540
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:44,738
I go now.

541
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,005
Hale.

542
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:50,140
Let me go with you.

543
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:52,811
Good idea.

544
00:33:57,992 --> 00:34:00,085
Laurie hasn't played so happily
for such a long time.

545
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:02,758
Me too.

546
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,532
Me too.

547
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:17,737
Sorry.

548
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:38,590
Let's get something to drink.

549
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,230
Ma'am, six bottles of beer, please.

550
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:43,098
Thanks.

551
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:44,933
You like it? I like it.

552
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:47,037
Get more foodstuff.

553
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,608
Fine.

554
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:19,058
Who're you?

555
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,798
I'm... a friend of Holly.

556
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:24,097
What... what're you doing here?

557
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,873
I'm... fixing something for her.

558
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:29,700
It's fixed now.

559
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:32,336
Thank a lot.

560
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:36,145
Holly and I are colleagues.

561
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,074
You also drive a minibus?

562
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:39,618
Yes.

563
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:43,952
I've made it. I'm leaving now.

564
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:48,951
There're soft drinks in the fridge.

565
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:51,697
Bye.

566
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,564
Excuse me.

567
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,710
You're with her?

568
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:09,038
Yes.

569
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:12,843
How's she now?

570
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,949
Quite good... Nothing wrong with her.

571
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:20,652
Do you know... her story?

572
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,486
I know.

573
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:27,599
Not long ago... she's so emotional that...

574
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:30,363
she couldn't make any good judgment.

575
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:32,735
But she's quite good now.

576
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:39,100
She looks tough.
But deep down she's dependent.

577
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:42,339
And she's rash and headstrong.

578
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:45,043
So her mom and I are worried about her...

579
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:47,279
We feared that she'd be cheated.

580
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,220
Would you please look after her for us?

581
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:53,192
Don't worry. I would.

582
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,556
And...

583
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:57,363
Don't tell her I've been here...

584
00:37:57,464 --> 00:37:59,830
though it makes no harm
to tell her about her mom.

585
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:03,025
I got it. I tell her nothing then.

586
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,635
Thank you.

587
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,105
Alright.

588
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:46,971
Hale, let's have buffet with Laurie tonight?

589
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:48,376
Tonight?

590
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:51,107
I have to work till eight or nine o'clock.

591
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:52,942
It's OK. Laurie and I will be waiting.

592
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,078
Hale, go.

593
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,188
I gotta go now.

594
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:32,014
I am very busy and cannot receive
your call at the moment.

595
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:32,649
Please leave your phone number.

596
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,192
I'll reply you soon.

597
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:13,893
Laurie.

598
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:16,928
What's up?

599
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:21,540
Let's call Uncle Hale.

600
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:40,260
Hello?

601
00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:43,655
Hello?

602
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:47,131
Uncle Hale, I'm going to bed now.

603
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,835
Good boy.

604
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,036
How's your mom?

605
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,767
He wants you.

606
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:03,946
He said he must call you.

607
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:05,909
That's OK.

608
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:11,852
Where did you go?

609
00:41:12,392 --> 00:41:14,292
I've just taken a nap.

610
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,430
I thought you wanted to turn
a blind eye to me.

611
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,657
Featherbrain. Why would I do so?

612
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,633
Then, I'll come and see you later.

613
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:31,544
OK.

614
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,257
What do you want?

615
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:51,757
Beer?

616
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:54,166
Six bottles, please.

617
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:55,428
Thanks.

618
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,947
How are you feeling? Not feeling well?

619
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:14,815
I'm fine. Alright.

620
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:18,589
By the way, I asked the landlady
to stop renting out her flat.

621
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:20,853
She only returned me
half of the prepayment.

622
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:23,892
We'll live with you.
If you feel uneasy with us,

623
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:24,929
do tell me.

624
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:26,863
Don't be silly. How can it be?

625
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:30,966
As the saying goes:
Two going well may not live well.

626
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:33,935
You have been taking good care of us
these days.

627
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:44,944
No matter how the days goes,

628
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:48,311
I'll be grateful to you. Thank you.

629
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,840
I have something to say.

630
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:12,205
Turn off the tap. Come over and listen.

631
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,644
Hale, call me when you're back.

632
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,751
Hale, I'm going to board a plane
with our son.

633
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:26,086
Keep on gambling.

634
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:28,388
I tell you you're not a good man

635
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:30,520
or a good husband, a good father.

636
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,029
You don't need a home at all.

637
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:34,327
Why got married? Why had a son?

638
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:35,696
It's too late to mend.

639
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,362
Good boy, say goodbye to dad.

640
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:40,698
Dad! Why are you not with us?

641
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:43,241
What's wrong?
I haven't done with my words!

642
00:44:13,673 --> 00:44:15,470
I begin to do housework only
after they left me.

643
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:17,702
Make a meal, sweep the floor...

644
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:20,241
Stop talking foul languages before the kids.

645
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:22,775
Save money, stop smoking, stop gambling...

646
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:26,016
I used to have four minibuses. But all lost.

647
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:29,021
I'm foolish enough.

648
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:30,414
I cheated myself.

649
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:32,082
I know well they wouldn't come back

650
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:35,025
yet I make a spin
in my minibus every day...

651
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:37,289
I daren't change my phone, move elsewhere

652
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:38,455
or change jobs.

653
00:44:38,565 --> 00:44:40,465
I fear that they can't see me any more.

654
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,933
The truth is, if they do want me,
they'll see me.

655
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,405
I got real at last.

656
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:49,737
I should face reality, forget the past

657
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:51,435
and not stay put.

658
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:52,409
I can't spend my life in...

659
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:55,208
driving from east to west, then back to east.

660
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:56,509
Right?

661
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:01,718
Last time, I told Laurie
and you to live with me.

662
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:02,720
You didn't say 'yes'.

663
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:04,688
I thought it over whole night.

664
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:09,022
I listened to that message,
again and again...

665
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:14,494
I take Laurie and you to be them.

666
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:18,931
I thought I wanna prove myself...

667
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,597
that I can be a good dad

668
00:45:20,707 --> 00:45:22,641
and a good husband.

669
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:32,250
Do you feel grateful to me
or really love me?

670
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:36,019
Do I take you to be her?
Or you take me to be him?

671
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:40,254
If we got another one in our hearts...

672
00:45:43,497 --> 00:45:45,465
it means nothing even if we have sex.

673
00:45:59,746 --> 00:46:01,145
Hale.

674
00:46:02,482 --> 00:46:04,609
You're a very good man.

675
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:53,025
Sorry, the number you just dialled
is not in service.

676
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,999
Turn around, please.

677
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:02,735
Take away your hands.

678
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:05,304
Open your eyes.

679
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:11,139
Gorgeous!

680
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,677
You like it?

681
00:47:14,754 --> 00:47:17,348
With this bouquet... Will you marry me?

682
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:20,186
You're serious?

683
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:21,760
Yes.

684
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:24,018
Let me ask you a question.

685
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,722
If you can answer it, I'll marry you.

686
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:26,799
OK.

687
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,562
What does our plate number mean?

688
00:47:31,471 --> 00:47:33,371
Forever.

689
00:47:41,948 --> 00:47:43,176
I do.

690
00:48:01,034 --> 00:48:04,970
Man, I gotta forget you.

691
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:12,837
Dad.

692
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:15,700
Call him grandpa.

693
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,299
He's grandpa?

694
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,502
Yes.

695
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,579
But I've got a granddad already.

696
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:22,879
Call him. Good boy.

697
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:24,574
He's so young.

698
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:27,419
He's honey mouthed.

699
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,086
Isn't it tough?

700
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,496
I work to kill time.

701
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:40,194
My old buddy opened this shop.

702
00:49:44,037 --> 00:49:45,971
I'll have dinner at home tonight.

703
00:49:46,506 --> 00:49:47,803
Good.

704
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:50,668
I wanna move back home.

705
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:52,872
Of course.

706
00:49:53,113 --> 00:49:54,705
With him.

707
00:50:01,988 --> 00:50:03,046
Are you a good boy?

708
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:04,851
Me? I'm not.

709
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,153
Are you bad-tempered like your mom?

710
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,592
Yes, I'm very bad-tempered.

711
00:50:09,696 --> 00:50:11,596
Will you bicker with me?

712
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:13,723
Yes, I'll.

713
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:17,932
Will you do anything rash?

714
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:20,562
And the more I tell you not to do,
the more you want?

715
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:21,731
Yes.

716
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:24,275
But are you wicked?

717
00:50:24,377 --> 00:50:26,777
And don't let me play anything?

718
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:29,348
You may do whatever you want.

719
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:32,714
But you have to tell me beforehand.

720
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,413
Just tell me. OK?

721
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:44,195
Dad.

722
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:48,266
Put less salt into your soup.

723
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:49,596
Too salty.

724
00:50:49,702 --> 00:50:51,727
Too salty? Really?

725
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:53,066
It's true. I never cheated you.

726
00:50:53,173 --> 00:50:55,266
Laurie, go to pee pee. Quick.

727
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:50,358
Hale, call me back, please.

728
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:53,254
What? Sell or not?

729
00:52:54,227 --> 00:52:55,888
Think it over.

730
00:52:56,562 --> 00:52:57,859
Wait...

731
00:52:57,964 --> 00:52:58,931
Let me make a call.

732
00:52:59,032 --> 00:53:00,329
What?

733
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:02,895
Hello?

734
00:53:03,002 --> 00:53:04,333
Hale?

735
00:53:04,437 --> 00:53:05,665
I just wanted to call you.

736
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:08,400
What's the matter?

737
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:09,873
Tell me first.

738
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:11,637
You gotta tell me first.

739
00:53:12,712 --> 00:53:16,307
I wanna sell the car and do another job.

740
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:18,907
Which one?

741
00:53:19,018 --> 00:53:20,713
Whatever.

742
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:23,846
The sort of business...
once the client come in,

743
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:25,151
they'll be very happy.

744
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:27,055
Sell ice-cream or something.

745
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:29,522
Have you thought over it?

746
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,689
No, I haven't.
I can't waste my time thinking.

747
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:35,296
Do you wanna change your job?

748
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:37,329
Will you sell your car?

749
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:40,238
Where're you?

750
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,500
At a car company in Man Wui Street.

751
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:45,007
Man Wui Street? I'm there too.

752
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:46,578
Really?

753
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:48,337
Papa!

754
00:53:57,657 --> 00:53:58,749
I just wanna tell you.

755
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:01,759
I sold my car and got the money.

756
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:07,164
Wait, stay put...

757
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:11,402
You said last time...

758
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:13,301
I'm a very good man. Right?

759
00:54:13,406 --> 00:54:15,340
If a girl says something
like that to a guy...

760
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:17,136
She means...

761
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:19,541
She won't go out with that guy.

762
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,411
Then...

763
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:24,346
Do you love me?

764
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:29,247
I love... you... a little bit.

765
00:54:29,555 --> 00:54:31,716
A little bit...

766
00:54:32,258 --> 00:54:33,782
That's good enough.

767
00:54:33,893 --> 00:54:36,327
Is it because I have been helping you

768
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:38,397
Or you found out that I'm divorced

769
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:41,433
and lonely, so you feel pity for me?

770
00:54:41,534 --> 00:54:43,229
Of course not.

771
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:48,397
Let's try it.

772
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,274
I'll sell it!
