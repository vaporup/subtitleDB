1
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,526
Speed is very important

2
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,395
when you're driving ...

3
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,365
...but must control it accurately

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,332
with courage and driving skill,

5
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,528
don't you know?

6
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,033
You see I've offend my hands.

7
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,501
So you learn how to balance.

8
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,536
Eyes looking forward,

9
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,634
backward and two sides

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,268
Keep watching all around you.

11
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,229
Maddie, I root you,

12
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,637
defeat that rich guy for me.

13
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,273
What time did you fix with him?

14
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,940
At 12, he's late, what's on?

15
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,772
Maybe that guy is too scared to come.

16
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,830
Damn you!

17
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,903
You're late, why not come next year?

18
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,478
No one ever dare to reprimand me, right?

19
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,754
Yes!

20
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,856
OK, Boss, let me handle.

21
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,065
I recognize you, Maddie, I remember ...

22
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,067
You're ... brother of that Dare Devil,

23
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,463
the prisoner.

24
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,694
Don't bullshit

25
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,428
Who are you?

26
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,904
I'm Fat C, what's your name?

27
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,905
Why only tell me now?

28
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,736
You don't have ask me, I'm Tse.

29
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,802
Don't bullshit, we'll know

30
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,110
who the winner is after the race.

31
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,881
Like Boss like dog.

32
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,119
He is a real flatter.

33
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,848
Sure, his head is big enough to bullshit.

34
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,947
...and not like you

35
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,891
You are so weak.

36
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,321
Your boss give you dog feed

37
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,555
to keep you so fat?

38
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,818
Have you taken money?

39
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,055
We bet on $300 thousand tonight.

40
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,395
Damn, get lost! $300 thousand?

41
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,530
Let's bet on $1 million full.

42
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,433
You boast! $1 million?

43
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,394
If I had $1 million,

44
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,233
I needn't race with you.

45
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,796
Right, you don't have, but I do.

46
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,237
You get the money if you win.

47
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,637
but if I win, I want no money.

48
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,110
What do you want then?

49
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,667
You're strong enough.

50
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,602
I want it!

51
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,377
You're afraid?

52
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,476
Don't be afraid

53
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,814
Let's go

54
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,379
I can't help if you must make me win.

55
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,555
Paddy.

56
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,685
Where's my motor-bike?

57
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,686
The real Chariot Of Fire.

58
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,926
It's superb.

59
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,532
Give me.

60
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,105
Be careful.

61
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,421
Boss says he'll be happy

62
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,583
if you perform well!

63
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:26,821
Thanks.

64
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,915
He'll give some to each of you.

65
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:28,753
Call us if there's such

66
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,021
benefit next time.

67
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,124
Well, to him money is not an object.

68
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,363
but I'm the only flatter around him.

69
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,633
If you like, come here more often.

70
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,601
and do some help or root us.

71
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,068
Yes, promise, thanks.

72
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,174
Dee, is Big Head ready?

73
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,383
Get into position.

74
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,486
You must make a perfect comment.

75
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,609
...just like the car race

76
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,247
commentator on TV, OK?

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,284
Sure, will be like live show.

78
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,222
Paddy.

79
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,026
Is it OK?

80
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,218
Just perfect.

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,262
Really?

82
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,024
Give way! The Boss has come!

83
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,202
Boss.

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,138
Is it OK?

85
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,801
My Boss is mighty.

86
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,775
How come I'll make my Boss lose face?

87
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,565
Ready, start!

88
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,222
Dee, it has started.

89
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,690
Remember, report if anything happens.

90
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,589
Roger.

91
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,784
Really like flying!

92
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,761
They've arrived gas station

93
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,853
of Clear Water Bay Road.

94
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,954
If Sky did not fooling ...

95
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,521
...he'd have lead by quite a distance.

96
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,299
I'll hand to the next stand.

97
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,959
Now they're racing on.

98
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,157
It's really interesting.

99
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,266
The road becomes their racing track.

100
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,165
Maddie is strong too, not bad.

101
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,506
Defeat Sky ...

102
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,768
What are you looking, little girl?

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,672
I have bet on,

104
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,742
so I must know the result.

105
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,780
They're entering Junk Bay Tunnel.

106
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,119
Sky and Maddie are both trying

107
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,557
to surpass the other.

108
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,885
I wonder how many times

109
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,361
they have changed gear.

110
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,404
It's a Porsche, it's really fast, nuts!

111
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,477
Shit, the Porsche is ahead of Sky now!

112
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,179
I wish I could smash its windscreen.

113
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,555
He deserves capsizing!

114
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,022
Out the tunnel now,

115
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,893
Sky changes to 3rd gear.

116
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,057
He'll surpass me soon!

117
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,697
Sky, defeat Maddie ...

118
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,168
Who are you?

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,129
What?

120
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,033
Shit! You lunatic!

121
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,062
Boss is smart!

122
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,234
Boss is the winner!

123
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,374
OK, $1 million, give me 2 month time.

124
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,646
I have money?

125
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,286
We agree to side bet on your leg.

126
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,581
Don't be too much

127
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,554
It's our agreement and stake,

128
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,524
don't you know?

129
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,657
Since you agree,

130
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,025
you must keep your words.

131
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,591
Boss

132
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,026
Don't be so much

133
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:36,759
No, if we must play,

134
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,734
we must play till the end.

135
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,566
You can't step on the accelerator

136
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,629
from now on.

137
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,738
Spanner!

138
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:42,872
Here

139
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:47,944
Where's Paddy?

140
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,246
Knock on him

141
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,353
Why? Let's break his leg.

142
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,710
Sky ...

143
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,118
Don't you know how to?

144
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,387
You can't knock his leg,

145
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,859
but can repair cars?

146
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,590
It's ... like this, to break his leg!

147
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,130
Boss ...

148
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:09,931
We must keep the promise

149
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,300
of what we have said.

150
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,864
Boss, you're leaving?

151
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,676
You're on my bed,
what are you going to do?

152
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,353
The warden knows I love sleeping,

153
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,445
she won't suspect.

154
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,381
Thanks for helping me again.

155
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,048
Do you see Sky? He won or lost?

156
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,221
Of course, Sky is the winner.

157
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,421
That Maddie dare tell others

158
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,623
he's the Dare Devil.

159
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,297
How far away did he win? Tell me.

160
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,259
It's a motor-bike race.

161
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,395
It only takes 3 seconds

162
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,838
to reach 100 k.p.h.

163
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,568
What then? Tell me.

164
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,573
When I arrived,

165
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,544
I saw Sky on that motor-bike.

166
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,369
He's so cool!

167
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,874
Only that motor-bike can match Sky.

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,308
Do you know how powerful

169
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,214
that motor-bike is?

170
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,082
Don't know.

171
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:01,744
Do you know what means

172
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,581
by "Double Speed"?

173
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,986
No idea And Quadrate Speed?

174
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,613
What is it? Tell me.

175
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,089
Let me take you to meet my dream lover

176
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,889
Great!

177
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,718
Does your dream lover have big eyes?

178
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,856
And how tall is he? Tell us.

179
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,532
What does he look like?

180
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,031
Is he handsome? Tell us.

181
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,171
Why don't you say?

182
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,708
Paddy.

183
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,745
Thanks.

184
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,816
I say Sky is a bit too much on that.

185
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,711
Too much of what?

186
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,920
I mean his side bet

187
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,386
with Maddie would be a leg.

188
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,220
It's too much to break

189
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,623
the opponent's leg.

190
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,090
But they mutually agreed.

191
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,358
This world talks of money.

192
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:46,963
I have to go,

193
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,327
stay here and fool with him.

194
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,134
Paddy ... don't go,

195
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,497
the Boss hasn't let you leave yet.

196
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,764
He'll deduce your salary.

197
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,236
Look ...

198
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm happy today.

199
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,973
Your tips.

200
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,741
Why? The price for having sex with you?

201
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,187
I was only joking.

202
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,019
Don't you remember what day is today?

203
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,619
What day?

204
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,496
I was injured ... 6 years ago.

205
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,443
Why I never see your parents?

206
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,216
She hasn't come, look at this card.

207
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,719
Recover soon, Mom.

208
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,718
I know it's written by others.

209
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,756
Is it OK, I am here.

210
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:08,837
OK.

211
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,871
Come on, quick.

212
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,310
Come on.

213
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,575
Turn your face first.

214
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,445
OK.

215
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,178
Sky, your mom has just called up.

216
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,584
...saying that she'll pick you up

217
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,749
for dinner after the meeting.

218
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,815
Dinner will start at 7 sharp,

219
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,224
as she has another meeting at 8.

220
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,486
Forget the dinner.

221
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,890
Ask her to stick to the meetings.

222
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,997
That policeman will not charge you

223
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,191
for careless driving.

224
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,528
as your mom has settled the case.

225
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,693
Sure, the kid shouldn't

226
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,260
have rushed out to the road.

227
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,798
His parents should teach him

228
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,204
road safety instead.

229
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,901
That kid ...

230
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,270
...died last night.

231
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,785
I've forgotten all the unhappy incidents

232
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,358
What will you ... send me next year?

233
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,958
Next year?

234
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,433
I don't want

235
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,573
No?

236
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,786
Let's see next year

237
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,619
I don't want!

238
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,120
You don't want?

239
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,191
You know what I love most

240
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,987
Cars, and you

241
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,430
Hello! You've come home?

242
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,569
How's granny?

243
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,730
I have medical appointment at

244
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,002
Princess Mary Hospital tomorrow.

245
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,709
Don't go there, go to a private hospital.

246
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,509
It's chronic disease.

247
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,978
I know, I'll foot the bill, OK?

248
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,674
Sleep early

249
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,145
I love the bracelet you sent me.

250
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,187
Do you? Put it on then.

251
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,785
Good night, bye.

252
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,400
I know, the National Bureau

253
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,434
is strict on foreign investment.

254
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,379
but if you are able to help me,

255
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,212
everything should be fine.

256
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,516
You mom has just signed an agreement

257
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,452
with a Chinese Group.

258
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,018
if we make it, I'll buy you a car.

259
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,954
Uncle Sam's Ferrari 360 ...

260
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,497
...is laid off,

261
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,466
as his driver licence got suspended.

262
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,268
I'll buy it for you.

263
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,530
It's a limited edition,

264
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,131
only 30 worldwide.

265
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,705
None of my business,

266
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,408
I don't want a used car

267
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,541
I know you don't want a used car.

268
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,842
OK, let me order a brand new one for you.

269
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,673
Does my mom know?

270
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:40,978
No problem.

271
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,828
Don't look back, if you do,

272
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,694
it means you'll come here again.

273
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,591
I've been here 5 years,

274
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,964
I'm beginning to like it here.

275
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,927
You are not bad.

276
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,295
Others come here for a penalty, but you

277
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,168
studied and get several degrees in here.

278
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,169
So HK Government

279
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,832
is nice to bastards like you.

280
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,478
This is for you.

281
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,744
Read more, but not the comics.

282
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,105
or you'll spend the rest of your life here,

283
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,777
like the prisoners.

284
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,818
Brother Fung! Brother Fung!

285
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,589
Brother!

286
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,891
Why, you had an accident?

287
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,357
Don't tell others you're

288
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,831
my blood brother.

289
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,159
Not an accident,

290
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,927
he lost a race and the opponent broke it

291
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,872
It's that dude, Sky.

292
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,873
That guy even says Tang Fung is outdated.

293
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,543
...that he gets too clumsy for car racing.

294
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,572
Look how cocky he is!

295
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,446
He also advises you to retire.

296
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,889
Mind your saliva spoiling my engine.

297
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,417
This is lubricant.

298
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,784
It'll speed up the car instead.

299
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,822
Come and listen to the sound

300
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,529
of the accelerator.

301
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,531
Step on the accelerator OK, mechanic.

302
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,096
Classics ...

303
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,762
It's enough, take it.

304
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,502
Pentium ll 400, 300Mhz.

305
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,671
Thank you!

306
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,412
Throw away your outdated computer now.

307
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,075
Can you manage?

308
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,315
Yes.

309
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,150
I'll see ... this is heart.

310
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,354
Nothing.

311
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,748
Healthy, Boss.

312
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,953
This is kidney ... is it OK, Boss?

313
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,220
Nothing.

314
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,024
Boss, you're healthy, you have employ

315
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,464
two competent guys here.

316
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,523
Paddy is expert of checking engines.

317
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,592
and I am expert of checking your health.

318
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,102
boss, this is the sex organ ...

319
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,176
Is it OK, Boss?

320
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,307
Boss ...

321
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,710
Are you mistaken?

322
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,140
Beat it.

323
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,982
Boss is healthy and

324
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,146
has a powerful sex organ.

325
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,847
Hit my stick hard.

326
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,588
Boss is great!

327
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,991
Boss, have some water.

328
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,902
You left hospital so soon?

329
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,904
You can walk?

330
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,077
You take your uncle with you?

331
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,206
He is my brother ... Tang Fung

332
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,209
You're Sky?

333
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,212
Not a good guy.

334
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,788
You side bet on his leg?

335
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,886
Let's clear things up,

336
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,255
it's mutual agreement.

337
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,455
Right, Tang Fung?

338
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,861
You were apprentice at 14

339
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,332
and started racing in 1982.

340
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,332
in 1983, no one could

341
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,801
follow you by 2 minutes.

342
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,801
From Princess Road to Clear Water Bay.

343
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,168
the fastest time

344
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,140
is 15 minutes 28 seconds.

345
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:30,833
You might finish university

346
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,865
if you studied as hard.

347
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,205
then your mom would be happy.

348
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,312
I'm better than you

349
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,607
You rose to top in 1988,

350
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,839
but you were too greedy.

351
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:37,907
you conspired with robbers

352
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,211
and were sent to jail.

353
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,218
after being released,

354
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,742
you commit a crime again ...

355
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,850
I wonder if you like jail life.

356
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,388
Kid, I know you take me as idol,

357
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,860
like many others do.

358
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,556
Sorry, I don't admire you.

359
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,898
I just read it, take it as a souvenir.

360
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,306
You're son of Black Tone?

361
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,901
Dad, quick ...

362
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,738
You know
how your dad got defeated by me?

363
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,141
You're much inferior than him indeed.

364
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,046
You think you're superior,

365
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,684
just because you're rich.

366
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,718
You think you can become the best car

367
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,587
racer with your money.

368
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,985
but you won't succeed as

369
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,494
you never improve yourself.

370
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,186
Want to challenge me?

371
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,931
I come to teach you something.

372
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,394
Cylinder head, change the gasket 1.6mm.

373
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,560
Decrease the compression ratio,

374
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,068
Turbo mark up to 1.5 bar.

375
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,001
Also need turbo exhaust manifold,

376
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,506
70mm front pipe.

377
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,206
and titanium metal exhausted

378
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,642
air tube at the rear.

379
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,577
Oil-suspension cooler,

380
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,375
and shock absorbers.

381
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,381
and use 14K spring.

382
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,383
Fix STI power lock and clutch.

383
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,177
Also install Mines racing computer,

384
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,448
then it can be called a car.

385
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,555
Quote me the price.

386
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,915
This only provides 300 hp at the maximum.

387
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,652
so be sure you can control it.

388
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,254
Sorry, we never modify Sabaru.

389
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,895
You won't or you dare not?

390
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:01,862
I don't want to,

391
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,231
but I want to race with you.

392
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,803
I like this, how to?

393
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,566
We can bet on whatever the stake is.

394
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,573
I don't want money,

395
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,464
I want a garage to mod Sabaru.

396
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,438
This is not a bad one.

397
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,440
Uncle, you get nuts in jail?

398
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,374
Boss's garage is worth $3 million?

399
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,078
And your stake?

400
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,712
My hand, if you want, both my hands.

401
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,212
Don't you like side bet on other's limbs?

402
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,122
OK, Friday night.

403
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,350
at 9:30 p.m., at Kwun Tong Pier.

404
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,924
See you.

405
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:33,893
Sure.

406
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,778
Boss, have tea.

407
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,084
Don't let saliva come down

408
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,282
like him. Your saliva.

409
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,518
Mind your saliva.

410
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,696
Go, go on.

411
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,956
No drink allowed here.

412
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,563
None of your business I don't mean you.

413
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,262
Sir, don't you hear?

414
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,962
I'm not drinking now!

415
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,366
What's wrong with you?

416
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,271
What do you up to?

417
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,398
What're you going to do?

418
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,976
Take this and clean your head.

419
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,073
The clothes are dirty,

420
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,338
they need cleaning too.

421
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,345
They scared the customers,

422
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,474
ask them to leave.

423
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,482
It's fine then, go ahead.

424
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,855
Don't you know you follow me?

425
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,384
I'm playing with it, you cut the line?

426
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,029
I really didn't mean to.

427
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,060
What's happened?

428
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,030
This bitch.

429
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,929
...wants to cut the line,

430
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,094
when I'm playing

431
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,827
You, say sorry.

432
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,268
What is it?

433
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,130
Nothing, I'm playing with it

434
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,641
and she said I cut the line.

435
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,874
You hold her tight?

436
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,569
She's your girlfriend?

437
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,679
Kid, what girl? Are you of age?

438
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,537
I can kill you!

439
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,643
Kill me?

440
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,946
Take it easy, don't stir up trouble!

441
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,678
Do you know who he is?

442
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,151
He's Brother Sky, Dare devil!

443
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,519
Hurrah, Brother Sky!

444
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,783
Dare Devil? You know who I am?

445
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,417
Who are you?

446
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,494
I'm God of Car in this game centre.

447
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,860
They call me Sugihara Takuumi.

448
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,090
Brother Takuumi It's Brother Takuumip.

449
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:15,929
A Japanese?

450
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,056
What's that got to do with you?

451
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,228
You know who we are?

452
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,870
I'm called Big Head.

453
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,562
I'm called Dee.

454
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,137
Big Head, Dee, without us,

455
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,969
there won't be you, Takuuim?

456
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,706
I'll take you as of age, let's race.

457
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:28,876
Sure.

458
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,981
Don't bullshit, let's race now.

459
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,548
You are very lucky today.

460
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,279
Brother Sky is racing with you,

461
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,081
no problem.

462
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,519
Brother Sky will surely win.

463
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,858
You must lick my toes if you lose.

464
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,160
Lick the toes!

465
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,177
Shit, he's better than me.

466
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,733
Why? What's wrong with you?

467
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,275
Young man, calm down, take it easy!

468
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,608
I want to ask why the power

469
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,513
was suddenly cut off.

470
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,608
we've just taken the lead.

471
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,775
You boast? What shall we do now?

472
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,747
What shall we do?

473
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,481
It's your place here,

474
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,920
and you are God of Car, you suggest.

475
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,120
Nuts!

476
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,317
We're taking the lead.

477
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,391
Brother, what are you doing?

478
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,387
You helped your idol to cheat?

479
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,724
OK, forget it! It's a tie!

480
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,394
OK, when you grow up ...

481
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,603
...I'll race with you on Princess Road.

482
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,300
Get lost.

483
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,135
Come for Brother Sky

484
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,197
when you grow up!

485
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,400
Beat it, if you are afraid.

486
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,348
Brother Sky.

487
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,413
You have released?

488
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,844
Don't let them send you there anymore.

489
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,653
I'll give you a cheque

490
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,678
for the debts I owe you.

491
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,148
OK, thanks.

492
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:24,695
Don't you want to play

493
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,488
with the dancing machine?

494
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,189
Yes.

495
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,323
Where's the dancing machine?

496
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,930
Over there, Boss.

497
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,127
Go with Boss.

498
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,600
It's always leaves

499
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,502
without saying, too cool

500
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,238
Forget it, don't think astray.

501
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,202
You go to play on!

502
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,642
This one is good.

503
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:41,971
You must keep to the beat.

504
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,179
You're bad, why didn't you help me?

505
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,977
I did tell you to follow the beat.

506
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,588
Brother, I'm back.

507
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,033
Breakfast.

508
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,900
Wipe the sweat.

509
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,374
I'm tired.

510
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,874
Last night ...

511
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,680
after leaving the game centre.

512
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,242
...and where did you go?

513
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,579
Brother Sky ignored me,

514
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,018
so I went to disco.

515
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,917
For a dance?

516
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,720
I like dancing too.

517
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,524
Sorry.

518
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,732
You helped me out last time

519
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,361
but were sent to Girls' Home.

520
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,866
Brother, why you say that?

521
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,233
I can choose boyfriends,

522
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,640
but I can't choose a brother.

523
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,937
It's destined, don't say such a thing.

524
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,013
I'll kill whoever dare

525
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,240
say you're mentally retarded.

526
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,714
Will you?

527
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,817
Then ... you'll be sent

528
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,548
to Girls' Home again?

529
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,356
You always fight for me.

530
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,027
I am upset for my dead parents ...

531
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,197
...they passed away when I was young.

532
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,501
Brother, why are you so miserable?

533
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,439
I ...

534
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,635
...I did finish high school.

535
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,776
but have you thought of ...

536
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,011
...going back to school?

537
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,082
No way.

538
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,046
You know what good your school did you?

539
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,152
It let you meet Brother Sky.

540
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,485
You must be nuts.

541
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,086
You're underage,

542
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,427
and you want to woo Sky?

543
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,292
What do you mean?

544
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,901
My voice has changed already.

545
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,103
Right ... a coarse voice indeed.

546
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,739
Why can't I love him?

547
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,108
I've thought over,

548
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,642
I won't go back to school.

549
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,667
but I'll become an apprentice in

550
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,646
your garage, like Big Head and Dee.

551
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,616
I want to learn how to repair cars.

552
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,717
Will ... Sky employ you?

553
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,049
Help me persuade him.

554
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,956
Come on, help me persuade him.

555
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,389
Ask him for me, I'll buy you teddy bear.

556
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,291
Ask him for me, I don't need salary.

557
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,960
Don't bother me! Please ...

558
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,469
Go away ...

559
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,731
Please.

560
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,707
Paddy, 20kg in front, and 10kg

561
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,540
at the rear, increase by 2 bars.

562
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,945
and increase it to 460 hp.

563
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,715
But ... it's been already fixed

564
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,309
with 4 brakes set.

565
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,116
It's getting out of control now.

566
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,622
The most I can do

567
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,283
is increase it by 1.5 bars.

568
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,058
...but the car will be controlling you ...

569
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,355
I can always control cars.

570
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,156
Tell me, you can't or you refuse?

571
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,762
We've known for ages,

572
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,427
and I've never turned you down.

573
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,660
Please dissuade him for me.

574
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,462
Forget our friendship,

575
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,494
I'm boss, you will or won't modify it?

576
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,235
I ask you, will you modify it?

577
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,467
Sky!

578
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,632
What's it?

579
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,173
Stay out, it's men's topic, get upstairs

580
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,747
Get upstairs.

581
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,913
Will you modify it?

582
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,845
Will you?

583
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,847
I ask you, modify it or not?

584
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,189
OK, I'll modify it for you ...

585
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,819
- Will you modify it?
- I will

586
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,853
Trust me, I can control it.

587
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,124
OK, I'll modify it ...

588
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,656
We're partners, we must trust each other.

589
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,125
Come on.

590
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,634
What about you guys?

591
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,473
Where is Sky?

592
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,571
We're in top condition tonight.

593
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,172
All left? They left long ago.

594
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,676
I should have taken a taxi here.

595
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,575
Who sat next to him?

596
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,684
His girlfriend, Kelly, you know her?

597
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,847
You want to take that seat?

598
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,789
If I hadn't arrived late,

599
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,383
it must have been me.

600
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,794
Brother ...

601
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,721
What are you going to do now?

602
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,491
What's happened?

603
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,235
It's vital, today's race

604
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,172
is race of the century.

605
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,504
Tang Fung vs Sky, the track is from

606
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,706
Kwun Tong to Lung Cheung Road.

607
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,443
then up Castle Road to

608
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,246
Texaco Road junction.

609
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,782
Then u-turn and back

610
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,482
to the starting point.

611
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,922
Whoever reaches

612
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,288
there first is the winner.

613
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,199
Kelly!

614
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,228
Kelly!

615
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,837
It hurts! My legs are stuck!

616
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,217
Don't sit on, go and help!

617
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,589
A race never wins unless

618
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,854
he reaches the finale.

619
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,587
I'll rush to the finale now.

620
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,190
I'll pay you $1 million, OK?

621
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,698
Money is not all mighty.

622
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,891
Do me a favour, help me please!

623
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,596
I've never begged others,

624
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,298
please help me!

625
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,776
You must come out.

626
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,074
Help me, Sky!

627
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,585
Sky!

628
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,708
No alcohol taken, normal.

629
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,751
He's racing with Tang Fung,

630
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,182
of course he didn't drink.

631
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,650
All who take part in such underground

632
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,155
races will end up dying.

633
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,355
Is she out?

634
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,493
She's dead,
being under the battered car.

635
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,528
Sir, there's a tip-off.

636
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,573
I want you to come back

637
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,643
to the station with us.

638
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,543
Besides of charging you

639
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,408
with careless driving ...

640
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,106
...we'll charge you

641
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,479
with possessing narcotics.

642
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,722
Take off shoes, put them over there.

643
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,232
KC, it's not a serious case indeed.

644
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,958
My son is only involved in an accident,

645
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,469
why no bail allowed?

646
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,568
Tony, call Eddy Hui,

647
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,800
their Commissionaire.

648
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,307
Yes

649
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,171
Mrs. Yu, we found 500 mg

650
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,804
of heroin in your son's car.

651
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,211
What?

652
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,140
My son is involved in narcotics?

653
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,379
I don't know.

654
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,415
No way, I must call up

655
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,784
Elsie Leung as well.

656
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,861
I'm sure someone wants to frame you!

657
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,196
$1 million, and side bet on limbs?

658
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,898
You want that now?

659
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,270
No! Help!

660
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,167
Sign here.

661
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,009
Thank you.

662
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,313
Sky ...

663
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,874
How come?

664
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,474
I'm OK.

665
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,314
Did they beat you up?

666
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,250
Call for ambulance, quick.

667
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,511
Let's go home first.

668
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,283
Martin, mark down the time and location.

669
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,723
I must sue all cops here!

670
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:55,687
Yes, Mrs. Yu.

671
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,158
I ask you, aren't you policeman

672
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,889
to protect the citizens?

673
00:39:59,029 --> 00:39:59,893
None of our business,

674
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,295
people in the custody beat him.

675
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,464
Let's go home.

676
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,993
Miss, what's up? What do you want?

677
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,464
Sky never touches narcotics,

678
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,097
someone must ...

679
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,434
Leave my sister alone! Help!

680
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,208
Stop ...

681
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,803
What do you mean?
What number are you?

682
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,574
Shut up! Stop fooling, OK?

683
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,875
Let's all go home first.

684
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,279
None of his business ...

685
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,358
I'll take responsibility ...

686
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,249
No ... don't let them frame you ...

687
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,420
Sky, come home with me!

688
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,392
Tell them you never possess narcotics!

689
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,194
Sky, tell them you're innocent!

690
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,822
Paddy need the medication again,

691
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,232
take it to him.

692
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,856
Sky, it hurts!

693
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,770
Elsie, I only have one son.

694
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,280
so please do me a favour.

695
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,907
Yes, I know, but it may be

696
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,916
interfering with justice, right?

697
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,647
Maybe it will, and maybe not.

698
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,750
We used to be school mates,

699
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,350
please help this time.

700
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,288
Give me a hand, please.

701
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,626
OK, I'll call you back later.

702
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,492
I know you are under pressure,

703
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,159
but there's a former case.

704
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:44,826
Anyway, I have good relation

705
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,166
with Mr. Tung.

706
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,203
OK, wait for your good news.

707
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,399
What did he say?

708
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,374
It's in vain, no need to call again!

709
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,244
Sky, your mom has made

710
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,084
all efforts already.

711
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,854
and it should be fine now.

712
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,893
I'm the one who commit a crime.

713
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,855
Don't worry, I won't get you involved.

714
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,128
Shut up!

715
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,126
It's not your affairs only,

716
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,496
we're both involved now.

717
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,094
If you were not my son,

718
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,702
I wouldn't care a dime.

719
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,137
Look at yourself.

720
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,105
I tell you, don't ever drive a car!

721
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,409
I don't want you to die like your dad!

722
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,275
My dad?

723
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,443
How did he die?

724
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,447
I remember you quarreled with him.

725
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,784
and you told me he disappeared,

726
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,458
soon you took me to his tomb.

727
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,689
You told me he was under there,

728
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,989
and wouldn't get up again.

729
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,131
Is he really dead? Is he?

730
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,461
I take him as if he were dead!

731
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,332
You take him as if he were dead?

732
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,527
He's alive?

733
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,864
You cheat me? Where is he?

734
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,462
Where is he?

735
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,805
I don't know!

736
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,936
Tony, arrange for him to leave HK.

737
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,545
I won't go unless I make it clear.

738
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,276
Your mom is right,

739
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,214
you'd better leave HK for the moment.

740
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,850
You want me to disappear?

741
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,823
I'll vanish this minute.

742
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,916
I won't ever come back.

743
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,254
Stand there!

744
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,656
Stand there!

745
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,194
Look at him ...

746
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,428
I do have a secret,

747
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,234
even your mom doesn't know it.

748
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,307
I take your dad as idol.

749
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,404
Black Tone ... is my father?

750
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,077
Black Tone is the real Dare Devil.

751
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,417
The century race between him

752
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,652
and Tang Fung.

753
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,621
...was breath-taking.

754
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,457
and there is never such a race anymore.

755
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,127
Every time when Black Tone won a race ...

756
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,706
...he would give us a ride.

757
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,969
We each gave him $5,000.

758
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,135
Riding in his car from Princess Road

759
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,666
to Clear Water Bay

760
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,237
...was rare experience

761
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,613
You would never forget that experience.

762
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,410
I don't know whether it's out

763
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,581
of excitement or fear.

764
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,686
we wet our pants.

765
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,358
Go and find your dad in Thailand.

766
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,229
Is he in Thailand?

767
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,465
Someone saw him in Thailand years ago.

768
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,205
but don't know where exactly he is.

769
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,299
Granny.

770
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,470
Sky.

771
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,605
Kelly used to say she'd

772
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,199
take you to see me.

773
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,434
but she is dead now.

774
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:18,139
...and we finally meet each other.

775
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,751
Don't be sad.

776
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,321
I'm really sad.

777
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:31,653
But I don't have anymore tears.

778
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,491
She arrived from Taiwan 10 years ago ....

779
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,697
...and lived with me since then.

780
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,336
and you're her only friend.

781
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:54,275
Look, it's quiet here ...

782
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,650
She died in loneliness too.

783
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,221
Granny ...

784
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,988
Take this.

785
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,969
There's something ... that is priceless.

786
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:23,438
There's something we cannot

787
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,972
judge with money.

788
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,636
Go away! You needn't help me up!

789
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,068
Check which club possesses

790
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,129
the best girls.

791
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,536
Aren't we here to locate Sky?

792
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,535
Sky? ...

793
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,142
Bangkok is so big,

794
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,273
it's not easy to find him.

795
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,809
Go and check, got it?

796
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:00,644
Yes.

797
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,158
One day how much?

798
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,797
B220 one day.

799
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,067
Ten days?

800
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,888
Uncle, how is everybody?

801
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,316
We're in trouble as your mom

802
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,758
is charging by the Attorney General.

803
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:45,893
Sorry.

804
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,525
You must use a false name

805
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,657
where're you go.

806
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,495
Cops are smart nowadays,

807
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,330
be careful for everything.

808
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,432
I have enough money with me.

809
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,604
I'll turn off my mobile phone

810
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,269
so cops can't detect my location.

811
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,607
Don't make a call even if it's necessary.

812
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,445
Uncle and your mom are eased

813
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,039
as you've grown up.

814
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,205
Don't worry, Uncle,

815
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,479
I will find my father.

816
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,887
OK, the line is impaired,

817
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,322
I must hang up now.

818
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,625
Bye.

819
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,593
Sky, where are you?

820
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,932
Police are looking for you everywhere.

821
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,298
Tell me, and I'll fly to see you.

822
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,297
No, I'm fine.

823
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,330
I'll contact you later.

824
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,101
Sky!

825
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,406
Brother Sky, where are you?

826
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,206
Brother and I will come to join you.

827
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,639
No, Nancy.

828
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,113
Remember to listen to your brother

829
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,239
and behave yourself.

830
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,883
I will.

831
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,709
Brother Sky, don't lose heart.

832
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,520
We both back you up.

833
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,533
Brother, try this pork.

834
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,566
You speak Cantonese?

835
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,862
I'm Cantonese.

836
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,229
Right, have you seen this guy?

837
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:44,210
No, sorry.

838
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,727
Help!

839
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:05,895
Thief!

840
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,606
What is it?

841
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,778
You're competent,

842
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,347
you have money to flee to Thailand?

843
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,645
All your money has been robbed.

844
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:21,546
Shall I give you $1 million

845
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,845
to go back to HK?

846
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:23,882
We did settle up our affairs

847
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,579
in HK already.

848
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,188
Damn you! Beat him!

849
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,215
Yes!

850
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,259
Catch him!

851
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,596
You broke my leg?

852
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,594
Syringe affected with Aids.

853
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,140
Let me give you injection

854
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,108
and you'll have HlV.

855
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,077
You want to revenge?

856
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,566
Get in the car, I come to help you,

857
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,668
get in ...

858
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,069
Most guys fleeing here

859
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,672
from HK come for me.

860
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,441
So everyone here calls me King of Fleers.

861
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,110
I don't mean I must flee.

862
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,721
and those who flee here

863
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,781
call me King of Fleers.

864
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,418
You say you're so powerful.

865
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,818
...then can you find those robbers

866
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:38,919
and get back my money for me?

867
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,394
What if I can?

868
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,096
Report to the police?

869
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,164
Remember you are a culprit.

870
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,800
and you have lots of rivals in HK.

871
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,766
I want to see a doctor,

872
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,701
lend me some money.

873
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,335
You have valuable belongings?

874
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,570
I'll take it to pawn shop.

875
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,874
I have no money, but I'm rich in HK.

876
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,642
Lend me and I'll remit it to you.

877
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,809
You know why everyone who flees

878
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,515
to Thailand first?

879
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,250
The living standard is low in Thailand,

880
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,520
a little money lets you live like king.

881
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,192
I don't intend to spend my life here.

882
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,287
What do you want then?

883
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,466
I want to find this man.

884
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,803
Isn't he Black Tone?

885
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:23,802
You know him?

886
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,641
When he first came to Thailand,

887
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,940
everyone in HK thought he was dead.

888
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,537
He's still alive?

889
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,874
He's so horny, he won't die young.

890
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,380
Where is he now? He is my father.

891
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,283
I haven't seen him for 10 years now.

892
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,123
He's not in Bangkok.

893
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,493
He may be in Chingmai or in Pattaya.

894
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,994
You're really son of Black Tone?

895
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,270
Yes.

896
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,271
Here's some money.

897
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,381
It's sad on the flee, do take care.

898
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:21,898
Eat now.

899
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,130
Thanks.

900
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,363
Half cooked rice again?

901
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,633
It's a month now,

902
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,939
why don't you cooked the rice well?

903
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,873
I've asked you a whole month already.

904
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:37,709
Tell me where Sky is

905
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,439
if you want cooked rice.

906
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,416
I do want to say,

907
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,783
but Sky won't let me tell you.

908
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,324
He's not on a trip, he's on flee.

909
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,829
Can't we find him though he's fleeing?

910
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,955
You don't talk reason.

911
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:01,702
Paddy!

912
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:03,738
Nancy!

913
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,131
Uncooked rice?

914
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,837
Throw it, I've bought you good food.

915
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,437
Come, sushi, come, let's eat it.

916
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,447
You want to play a fool? What fool?

917
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,812
Stay calm ... you both stay calm.

918
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,385
Don't be so snooty.

919
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:18,748
He beat you, brother.

920
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,817
Sorry You fix her.

921
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:23,718
Calm down.

922
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,751
Take it easy ...

923
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,723
Paddy, my new boss, Tang Fung.

924
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,523
He likes your skills,

925
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,092
he wants you to modify cars for him.

926
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,768
then we can work together again.

927
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,307
That garage belongs to Sky.

928
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:43,235
I always tell you: Money is our boss.

929
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,472
and when Sky returns to HK,

930
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,049
you can go back to him.

931
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,277
Damn you!

932
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,014
Play a trick?

933
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:52,085
Beat my brother?

934
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,214
Stop fighting ...

935
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,153
Stop ...

936
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,682
Brother ...Stop fighting ...

937
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:02,430
Stop, calm down, listen to me

938
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,723
We are always like this

939
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,866
You play like this?

940
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,502
It's OK, we're always like this.

941
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,562
Don't think you're special.

942
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:10,468
if not Brother Fung wants you,

943
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,631
we won't come here.

944
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,437
What do you want?

945
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,635
Take it easy, Boss.

946
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,304
Tell Tang Fung I must revenge

947
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,742
for Sky and Kelly.

948
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,180
Tell me, remember! You ass-hole!

949
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,341
Beat it!

950
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,014
Brother ...

951
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,946
I'm useless, I got a cramp

952
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,513
when I yelled at them.

953
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,984
Brother, you behaved very bravely.

954
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,654
You're the best mechanic

955
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,027
of modifying cars.

956
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,660
Let me cook you some tender rice.

957
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,257
Sky asked me to tell you.

958
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,232
...to behave yourself.

959
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,843
Sky, I must modify it into

960
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,853
the fastest car for you.

961
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,066
Paddy, I've left Bangkok, now on a bus.

962
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,430
...heading south.

963
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,432
I can't leave you any phone number.

964
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,339
How ... about them?

965
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,310
That Tse is ass-hole!

966
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,278
He's real bastard, a real ass-hole!

967
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,381
Don't mention him anymore.

968
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,246
I've open ...

969
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:31,014
a small garage in Yuen Long.

970
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,180
I'm now ...

971
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,158
modifying the fastest car for you.

972
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,691
Come back and try it.

973
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,761
Wait till I come back.

974
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,791
Please take care of

975
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,628
Kelly's grandmother for me.

976
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,626
I will.

977
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:53,166
Anyway, you gave me all that money.

978
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,609
...to open my own garage.

979
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,938
It's your money, not mine.

980
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,342
I want to ask Uncle ...

981
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,451
It's said they're in Canada,

982
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,349
and police are watching them closely.

983
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,455
Remember ...

984
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,717
inform me if you have address.

985
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,956
I don't know where I am at present.

986
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:31,540
Have you seen this guy?

987
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,472
No.

988
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,143
You're from HK?

989
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:37,710
Yes.

990
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,446
He's from HK too, have you seen him?

991
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,318
Is he? I haven't seen him before.

992
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,921
Sky!

993
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:32,471
I want a haircut.

994
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,002
You're from HK?

995
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,671
Your hair is long,

996
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,146
sure you need a haircut.

997
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,308
Don't move!

998
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,682
Are you Black Tone?

999
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,283
You're Black Tone.

1000
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,756
No, I'm not!

1001
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,156
- Black Tone!
- I'm not!

1002
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,425
You're Black Tone?

1003
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:56,557
Stand there and don't move.

1004
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:57,327
You're took me for someone else!

1005
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,164
Black Tone, why did you cut

1006
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,433
my son's hair like this?

1007
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,132
Dad.

1008
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,302
I'm Sky.

1009
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,476
I've been looking for you.

1010
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,520
Mom has been cheating me,

1011
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,583
saying you're dead.

1012
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,777
So many has happened to you?

1013
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,088
Then Uncle asked me to find you here.

1014
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,185
Tony?

1015
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,856
He's a real nice guy.

1016
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:06,334
Your mom is lucky to have him.

1017
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,529
Since Tang Fung's incident,

1018
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,132
I've brought them much trouble.

1019
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,014
Do you have rivals with him?

1020
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,107
Don't say it anymore!

1021
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:22,915
Black Tone is dead,

1022
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:24,576
don't mention the past again.

1023
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,713
Don't keep saying you're dead.

1024
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:32,621
Why do you bring me here?

1025
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,120
Waiting for someone.

1026
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,691
Pa!

1027
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,437
This woman is my wife.

1028
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:44,934
You needn't call her mother.

1029
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,837
This kid is my son, he's called Blackie.

1030
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:49,771
Wife

1031
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,309
My son!

1032
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,982
Honey, this is my son, no ...

1033
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,619
He's my friend.

1034
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:03,691
How are you?

1035
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,856
Have you greeted?

1036
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,728
How are you?

1037
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,962
Honey, watch out, it's hot.

1038
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,602
It smells good!

1039
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,467
Honey, I'm happy.

1040
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,805
Be careful.

1041
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,244
It's tasty!

1042
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,681
It's just like you.

1043
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:29,983
Watch out.

1044
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,483
It's hot.

1045
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,587
My wife makes the perfect Hot Soup.

1046
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,287
It's really hot and spicy.

1047
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,361
Honey, come on, sit down ...

1048
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,500
Son, you keep watching TV all day,

1049
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,873
and you smile whenever I talk to you,

1050
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,136
and you never remember

1051
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,404
the Cantonese I teach you.

1052
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,936
You're half Chinese, you know?

1053
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,311
Honey, you want to smile too?

1054
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,874
You want it day and night, don't you?

1055
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,750
Son, you like these dishes?

1056
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,018
Yes

1057
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:08,782
It's habit in Thailand,

1058
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,689
same dishes for lunch and dinner.

1059
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,988
It's not as varied as in HK.

1060
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,160
See how much I earn today.

1061
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,061
Look.

1062
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,360
What are you doing?

1063
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,366
Nothing, I want to see

1064
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,530
how much I earn today.

1065
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,339
Not much, about 100 Baht.

1066
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,209
My wife ... I think it's about 200 Baht.

1067
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:30,508
So little?

1068
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,581
It's enough for the 3 of us.

1069
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,642
300 Baht a day, it's HK$3,000 a month.

1070
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,052
It's enough, it's not HK here.

1071
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,182
When in HK, the money
I spent one night ...

1072
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,025
is enough for few year expenses here.

1073
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,828
The money I spent on modifying cars

1074
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,592
is enough for my whole life here.

1075
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,727
You know, your mom is rich, right?

1076
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,828
Your mom always buys you cars.

1077
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,171
and each costs $1 million, right?

1078
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:37,676
You needn't go to work today?

1079
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,374
How to make a living?

1080
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:40,378
There aren't many kids

1081
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,350
in Pattaya that need haircut.

1082
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:43,741
so you ask her to work

1083
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:44,844
and make money for you?

1084
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,117
That's why I married her.

1085
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,850
I'm a pimp, right?

1086
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,329
Why are you like this?

1087
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,757
Don't mention it, I'm disabled now.

1088
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,026
How come?

1089
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,997
Nothing, here is OK

1090
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,063
Look.

1091
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,137
I know, it was so noisy

1092
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,299
last night that I couldn't sleep.

1093
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,366
Of course it was noisy ...

1094
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,270
Are you impotent?

1095
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,302
Of course not.

1096
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,406
Of course I can, it's not the same, son.

1097
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,142
This is ...

1098
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,850
I teach you because you're my son.

1099
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,724
I didn't steal it ...

1100
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:31,429
What is it? Take it easy.

1101
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:35,163
She stole my watch while I was sleeping.

1102
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,535
I didn't ...

1103
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,596
I'll have her arrested if

1104
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,163
she doesn't return my Rolex to me.

1105
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:38,696
Man, my wife says

1106
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:39,569
she didn't steal your watch.

1107
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,371
She never tells lies.

1108
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,103
Give me back my watch.

1109
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,040
Give me back my watch.

1110
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,076
You mean I frame her?

1111
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,102
Do you know who's

1112
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,681
most furious in Pattaya?

1113
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,588
Man, give me 2 days' time.

1114
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,327
OK, I'll give you 2 days.

1115
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,654
Come to see me at

1116
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,493
Thai Boxing Gym in 2 days.

1117
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,597
Let's go!

1118
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,602
Dad.

1119
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,312
Do you find me useless?

1120
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,521
I just don't understand.

1121
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,726
Uncle said you were famous

1122
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,126
in Princess Road racing.

1123
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,228
I am so proud of it.

1124
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,498
because that Black Tone is my father.

1125
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,930
That Black Tone is dead.

1126
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,470
He's alive, he's sitting in front of me.

1127
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,002
but he became another person.

1128
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,203
Yes, I'm another person now.

1129
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,308
I'm called Black Tong now.

1130
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,671
You're still young, you can start again.

1131
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,276
But you never fight back

1132
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,752
when others bully you.

1133
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,683
Right, because I'm disabled now.

1134
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,717
so I left HK.

1135
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:07,723
and gave the title

1136
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,128
of Dare Devil to Tang Fung.

1137
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,159
Tang Fung and I had

1138
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,964
2 races on Princess Road.

1139
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,897
and he wasn't up to me.

1140
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,306
so they all called me Dare Devil.

1141
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,004
I'm the Underground

1142
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,340
Champion of Car Racing.

1143
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,116
Tang Fung sent his men
to give me money.

1144
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,717
They took me to Macau and fevered ...

1145
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,818
and that's why your mother left me.

1146
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,818
Once, I lost $5 million in Casino Lisboa

1147
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,762
and this bastard Tang Fung
challenged me

1148
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,095
saying if I won,

1149
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,736
he would pay off debts for me

1150
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:49,895
and if I lost, he would break

1151
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,507
my left arm and right leg

1152
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:55,967
so this is it.

1153
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,076
Have you figured out why you lost?

1154
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,051
I didn't figure out why I lost.

1155
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,257
I used to be snooty.

1156
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,552
I spent money whatever I liked.

1157
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,753
I stressed on car modification

1158
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,388
and not driving skills.

1159
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,692
My friend Paddy advised me

1160
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,598
not to make ample modification.

1161
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,870
but I didn't listen.

1162
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,299
He says ample modification

1163
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,863
makes the car control me.

1164
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:29,569
but I ignore his advice, so ...

1165
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,846
Right.

1166
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,080
Do you want to revenge for me?

1167
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,184
Though I'm disabled,

1168
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,723
I can become your instructor.

1169
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,352
How is it? I'm up there too, come on.

1170
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,385
But you ...

1171
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,025
You're in the car, you must calculate

1172
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,932
...using 3rd gear, then down

1173
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,798
to 2nd gear to turn this turnoff.

1174
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,456
Son, remember that moustache?

1175
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,895
If you defeat him.

1176
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,866
they'll forgive my wife's

1177
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,031
stealing the Rolex.

1178
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:32,498
Who is this guy?

1179
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,272
This is the Dare Devil in Thailand.

1180
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,307
He was 3 time champion in Thailand.

1181
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,679
He represents Thailand going on

1182
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,182
Formulae race as well.

1183
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,015
He's ranked 48 worldwide.

1184
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,588
I must lose then, you want me to die?

1185
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,848
Of course not.

1186
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,591
It was all the past.

1187
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,855
He belonged to the 80s, like I did.

1188
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,565
You know, you and I

1189
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,726
are 2 generation of the Dare Devil.

1190
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,800
So you won't lose?

1191
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:05,969
Come on, driving such a car?

1192
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,738
Yeah, so you must use your skills.

1193
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,024
Ranked 48?

1194
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,034
I really didn't steal the watch.

1195
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,835
Son, my wife said

1196
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,344
she didn't steal the watch.

1197
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,316
Whether she did or not, I must race.

1198
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,615
But I never thought I would race

1199
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,242
for the sake of a Rolex.

1200
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,418
Have you thought of

1201
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,116
how to defeat the 48th?

1202
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,418
Yes, to drive faster than him ...

1203
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,127
How to drive faster than him?

1204
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,057
Then teach me, you're my instructor.

1205
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,536
Without brake and you'll be fast.

1206
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:16,072
Don't let the speedometer threatens you.

1207
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,074
You said it, we must overcome our fear.

1208
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,040
so you must prove it yourself.

1209
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,613
Racing requires a good car,

1210
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,721
but good skills as well.

1211
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,654
Son, you can make it.

1212
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,953
Take this 10 bucks.

1213
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,422
My face is on it.

1214
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:42,326
It's a lucky money.

1215
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,468
Remember, like this.

1216
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,909
Bo Bo, let's go.

1217
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,460
It's dangerous for him.

1218
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,434
Yes, but I can't help.

1219
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,829
Only this can help him overcome his fear

1220
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:18,969
His fear, you understand?

1221
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:20,642
I know, but he's your son,

1222
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,041
if anything happens ...

1223
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,372
Right, he's my son on the track.

1224
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:25,778
Even if he dies,

1225
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,076
I still have another son.

1226
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,979
If you like, we can have

1227
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,952
more children, right?

1228
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,247
You smile, I need it whenever you smile.

1229
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,924
Don't let the speedometer scare

1230
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,757
you if you want speed.

1231
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,155
You must prove yourself

1232
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,663
to overcome the fear.

1233
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,796
Sorry, I've found my watch.

1234
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,433
Man, why didn't you tell me earlier.

1235
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,298
What?

1236
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,897
Nothing, he said he'd found his watch.

1237
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,967
Get me wine, I must drink with them.

1238
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,873
Let's cheers!

1239
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,244
Cheers!

1240
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:54,619
You're Black Tong?

1241
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,521
I want Black Tone, from HK!

1242
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,721
You bastard!

1243
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,691
How are you? Come back to HK with me!

1244
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,353
What?

1245
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,054
OK?

1246
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,926
No, just like today.

1247
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,228
Go back and race on Princess Road!

1248
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,859
I won't!

1249
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,137
No, sit still, man!

1250
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,271
You must care for your health.

1251
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,941
I can't help, the garage is just opened.

1252
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,748
I must ... get more business.

1253
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,753
Look at you, you cough hard.

1254
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,856
Brother, let's go.

1255
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,057
Take the medicine too, why so hurry?

1256
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,185
Where are you going?

1257
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,788
Where's Brother Sky? Not return yet?

1258
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,288
I don't know you well.

1259
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,390
You want both legs broken this time?

1260
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:43,831
Nancy, Maddie does care about Sky.

1261
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,032
Just like me,

1262
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,802
I care about my ex-boss too.

1263
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,772
You make him flee, you care about him?

1264
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,141
Ass-hole!

1265
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:51,411
Don't beat my brother!

1266
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,141
I wonder why Sky employ you,

1267
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,671
you stammering guy

1268
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,681
Boss, don't be mad.

1269
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,646
I know you're expert at modifying cars,

1270
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,177
how about your driving skill?

1271
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,114
My race with Sky didn't finish yet ...

1272
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,818
...as he fell off fly-over,

1273
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,587
and never reached the finale.

1274
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,723
I don't take it as a victory.

1275
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,797
Dare you have a race with me?

1276
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,762
Brother, he's daring you.

1277
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,832
I never race with stupid guys.

1278
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:18,304
but I respect you as you're Sky's man.

1279
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:19,774
If you want to defeat me

1280
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,172
to revenge for him.

1281
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,708
I'll have a race with you any time.

1282
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,038
Boss, we have to go to dinner, come on.

1283
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:27,480
My brother is proved

1284
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,040
to have HlV positive.

1285
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:30,677
If you don't want,

1286
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,209
I'll wait till Sky comes back.

1287
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,116
I must have a race

1288
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,452
to revenge for my brother.

1289
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,489
I promise you.

1290
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,058
Brother, no, they're daring you only.

1291
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:41,956
I promise you!

1292
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,871
I want to test your judgment,

1293
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:51,665
your guts and your skills.

1294
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,007
You rush forward till you

1295
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,168
reach the end of the pier.

1296
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,201
and brake hard, see if you can do it

1297
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,717
I didn't ask you to drive into the sea

1298
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:37,411
Get down.

1299
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:38,646
Jump!

1300
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,857
Tone, a girl comes to see your son.

1301
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,866
Brother Sky ...

1302
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,806
This is my first flight ever ...

1303
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,737
I know nothing,

1304
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:03,006
I don't speak English, or Thai

1305
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:06,074
but I come here with the address

1306
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:07,806
you gave me last time.

1307
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:08,907
I want to ask you, why are you here?

1308
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,882
Where's your brother?

1309
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,854
Brother promised to race with Tang Fung.

1310
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,016
but the stake is life.

1311
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,325
Why must your brother race

1312
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,656
with Tang Fung?

1313
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,356
Why must you push me away from you?

1314
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,023
Can I hold you for longer time?

1315
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,123
But I'm all wet.

1316
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,997
I don't mind!

1317
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,758
Try and dissuade my brother

1318
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,600
to go for the race.

1319
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,033
Say it slowly, why must your brother

1320
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,538
race with Tang Fung?

1321
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,271
Your new girlfriend? You lucky guy.

1322
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,311
No, nuts.

1323
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,781
She's sister of my buddy.

1324
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,516
Sister of your buddy?

1325
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:46,277
I think she's not mature yet.

1326
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,346
She must have something to come

1327
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,517
all the way here for you, right?

1328
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:51,918
No.

1329
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,188
You still miss the girl who died?

1330
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,828
But she's already dead, right?

1331
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:06,800
Don't think about her anymore.

1332
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,091
Sky?

1333
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,359
Want to know why I call you Sky,

1334
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,233
and not Brother Sky?

1335
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:01,892
You're still a little girl,

1336
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,863
don't think astray.

1337
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:12,497
You still take her as a little girl?

1338
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:34,820
Brother Sky.

1339
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,121
What is it?

1340
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,300
I want to tell you something.

1341
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,495
After midnight tonight

1342
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,936
will be my birthday.

1343
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,504
I'm 18 then.

1344
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,809
I won't fight anymore.

1345
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,179
as I'm over age for Girls' Home.

1346
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,545
if I commit anything,

1347
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:57,745
I'll be sent to jail.

1348
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,048
I might die.

1349
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,087
OK, it's good for you

1350
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,614
to think of your future.

1351
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:06,816
So please don't take me

1352
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,523
as a little girl again.

1353
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,909
Come to see the moon.

1354
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,645
Sorry, did I wake you up?

1355
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,289
You are misunderstanding.

1356
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,391
We're not making love, we're ...

1357
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,852
...doing Thai massage,

1358
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,090
my wife is a masseuse

1359
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,223
It's painful yet comfortable.

1360
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,829
Little girl, come here.

1361
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,768
My wife is expert, want to try?

1362
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,770
No? Honey, let's go on.

1363
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,473
Take your time, we'll go.

1364
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,624
Sister, buy flowers.

1365
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,956
It's your birthday?

1366
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,628
Yes

1367
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,464
No, these are ...

1368
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,864
So old fashioned.

1369
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,500
Want them or not?

1370
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,403
You really don't want to go back to HK?

1371
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,913
I'm called Black Tong,

1372
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,682
and here is my paradise.

1373
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,447
HK no longer belongs to me.

1374
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,289
I've thought it over,

1375
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,255
if it is not for my buddy, Paddy.

1376
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,532
...I won't go back to HK.

1377
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:57,097
I want to get marry here and live here.

1378
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,668
I want to count the money

1379
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,503
which I make everyday.

1380
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:04,371
Control your car accurately is

1381
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,403
important while you're driving.

1382
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,014
You must learn to use brake.

1383
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,673
...as you failed to use brake

1384
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,515
so you drove into the sea.

1385
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,582
Sometimes it's right.

1386
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,016
Sometimes you must use brake,

1387
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,986
sometimes the accelerator.

1388
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,229
Some racers don't care about dying.

1389
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,490
but I'm old.

1390
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,434
I'm disabled, I should retire now.

1391
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,569
but you are young,

1392
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,805
you still have a long way to go.

1393
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,810
so you must accelerate.

1394
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,145
Son, return to HK

1395
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,485
and create your own world.

1396
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,455
You'll make it.

1397
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,586
Thanks, dad.

1398
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:59,063
No thanks, I've never been a good father

1399
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,673
Bye, Brother ...

1400
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,147
Bye, Black Tone!

1401
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,749
Remember ...

1402
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,356
Remember what I've taught you!

1403
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,597
Damn it!

1404
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:27,811
Brother.

1405
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,050
Defeat him for me!

1406
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:43,867
Again!

1407
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:49,875
Paddy.

1408
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,976
Forget it, let's wait till Sky

1409
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,207
comes back here.

1410
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,047
Paddy, you're my buddy,

1411
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:57,208
I don't want anything happen to you.

1412
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,219
Buddy?

1413
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,485
If Sky returns, the first he'll do is

1414
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,387
...to settle up with you.

1415
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:14,968
Kid, Brother Fung

1416
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,494
wants a special treat, dare you?

1417
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:19,765
Idiot.

1418
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,306
You dare not?

1419
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:44,689
Mechanic ...

1420
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:45,664
No, don't go mad like him

1421
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,429
You can back out this minute

1422
01:26:58,446 --> 01:26:59,470
Brother.

1423
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:04,552
Brother.

1424
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,193
Nancy, I've decided

1425
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,630
to race with Tang Fung.

1426
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,165
as I must get back my ego.

1427
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:23,067
I don't want others to look down on me.

1428
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,931
It's good idea you become apprentice,

1429
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,565
but you must go to school.

1430
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,906
It's not bad for you to love Sky,

1431
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:30,877
but wait till you grow up.

1432
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:33,879
Be good, brother, Paddy.

1433
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,434
Big Head, where's my brother?

1434
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,602
That bastard Tang Fung insisted

1435
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,663
on racing last night,

1436
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,831
but Paddy's car capsized.

1437
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:03,036
He got trapped in the car.

1438
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:05,409
Come, we're at the mortuary.

1439
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,080
Where's my brother?

1440
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,823
Brother!

1441
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,295
Brother!

1442
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:28,135
Brother ...

1443
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:38,141
Brother ...

1444
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:51,848
Why come here? You traitor, go away!

1445
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:55,593
Go away, traitor! Sorry ...

1446
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,723
I ... did ask Paddy to back out.

1447
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,526
Go away, he doesn't want to see you!

1448
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:01,535
I never expected he'd die ...

1449
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,172
I really didn't know this would happen.

1450
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,232
Go and explain to him, go!

1451
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,807
Paddy ...

1452
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,210
Sorry.

1453
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,320
I asked you to back out.

1454
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:29,562
I really don't know this ...

1455
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:32,698
I don't want to lose a friend.

1456
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:44,008
Get an appointment with Tang Fung, go.

1457
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,442
Take my condolence, don't cry.

1458
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,349
I'm not crying!

1459
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,509
My brother left this,

1460
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,852
but I can't open, help me.

1461
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,701
It's like a note of Maths?

1462
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:46,971
Let me see.

1463
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,770
No, it's notes of how to modify cars.

1464
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:58,517
Paddy's theory of modifying cars.

1465
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,517
With this note ...

1466
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:07,895
You have confidence?

1467
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:08,827
No problem.

1468
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:09,826
Sure!

1469
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:11,688
Let's not waste his efforts.

1470
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:23,701
Brother, I know you'll help us.

1471
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,104
You must bless Brother Sky

1472
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,375
to defeat Tang Fung.

1473
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:54,135
Sky, the car is in excellent condition.

1474
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,579
Hey, does brother's note help?

1475
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:08,612
Does it help?

1476
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,354
The sprat parts are not enough.

1477
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,086
We miss some gears, and axles too.

1478
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:13,156
What is it?

1479
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:14,386
We miss some spare parts.

1480
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:15,156
The computer is not the type

1481
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,094
which mechanic said.

1482
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,356
The 4 spring are impaired too,

1483
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:18,695
this won't work.

1484
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,633
Don't bullshit, let me steal one back.

1485
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:23,796
What have I said?

1486
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:32,903
What is it?

1487
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,778
Here is a carton, what is inside?

1488
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,676
That's the gears and axles we need,

1489
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,878
all brand new.

1490
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:42,219
You ordered them?

1491
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:44,785
Even the computer is new.

1492
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:46,584
Does Santa Claus send them to us?

1493
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:47,955
Don't bullshit!

1494
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,156
I won't accept things from that bastard!

1495
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,463
Come out!

1496
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:04,543
I hope this Christmas present will help.

1497
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:07,338
You stole them?

1498
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:08,745
I stole from you.

1499
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,710
You know you used to spend like king?

1500
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,915
You bought numerous spare parts.

1501
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:17,582
so me and Paddy built a secret drawer,

1502
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:20,423
and hide these spare parts,

1503
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,153
wanting to sell them for cash.

1504
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,330
Now you need them,

1505
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,030
of course I must give them back to you.

1506
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,896
I won't let that Tang Fung have them.

1507
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:37,340
Move them in, no need to say thank you.

1508
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,682
Come in, Santa Claus.

1509
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,188
Help modify the car.

1510
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,251
Boss, you're tired?

1511
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:58,128
Leg massage.

1512
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:07,697
This part talks about nitrogen speeding.

1513
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:09,169
As nitrogen is 3 times

1514
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,336
more powerful than gasoline.

1515
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:11,436
so nitrogen can increase

1516
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,138
the explosive power.

1517
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:15,840
Yet, the time must not exceed 10 seconds

1518
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:21,552
Remember, you control the car.

1519
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,351
Turbo, inter cooler, 4-wheel drive.

1520
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,855
This is a super car ever modified.

1521
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:28,225
It suits you most.

1522
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:29,522
Whatever how stupid the opponent is ...

1523
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:30,723
...I must race with all

1524
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:32,164
I might have to face.

1525
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:39,433
It's on fire!

1526
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:40,562
Take it away, it's nitrogen,

1527
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:41,666
it'll explode!

1528
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,942
Use fire extinguisher!

1529
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:48,973
Is it alright? It's alright

1530
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:49,641
It's the last can.

1531
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:50,978
Sorry.

1532
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,113
Racing wheel,
suspending shock absorbers.

1533
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:57,920
AP break disk,

1534
01:34:58,059 --> 01:34:59,356
titanium alloy exhausted pipe.

1535
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,690
Isn't it a bit too much?

1536
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,820
Do you know the dividend on you?

1537
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:06,633
It's 10 times, so I'll try my best.

1538
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:09,159
After I left the jail, I told myself.

1539
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,402
I mustn't lose again.

1540
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:14,771
Brother, I promise

1541
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:16,208
I won't be bad anymore.

1542
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,470
I must be a fair lady,

1543
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:19,408
I must listen to Brother Sky.

1544
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,851
Who are you talking to?

1545
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:32,889
With my brother.

1546
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:36,025
Before the launching of this toy.

1547
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,530
I found brother like a panda.

1548
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,565
but since it's launched, look

1549
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,727
it looks like my brother a lot

1550
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:44,599
Get up here.

1551
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:45,863
Me?

1552
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:53,612
Do you know I never buy toys?

1553
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,446
As I find they worthless.

1554
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,577
But there's something

1555
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,583
you can buy with money.

1556
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,384
Don't say so, this toy is expensive.

1557
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:05,119
Want to sit next to me?

1558
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:09,094
You let me sit next to you?

1559
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,136
I must revenge for my brother.

1560
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:20,930
How to? I'm the driver.

1561
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,979
Come on, let's do some practice.

1562
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:29,815
Sit still.

1563
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:30,913
OK.

1564
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:33,145
Hold your brother tightly.

1565
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:35,154
Come, 1st gear.

1566
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:38,819
Turn left!

1567
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,284
Then right.

1568
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:41,821
Left!

1569
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:44,091
You really not scared?

1570
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:48,232
No.

1571
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:49,359
OK.

1572
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:27,097
Aren't they here yet?

1573
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,106
That bastard must be too afraid to come.

1574
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,176
No, Sky is not such a guy.

1575
01:37:32,613 --> 01:37:33,272
Both his father and

1576
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,611
himself aren't such guys

1577
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,349
Tonight, the dividend

1578
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:38,646
for Brother Fung is 1 to 1

1579
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,710
and that bastard is 1 to 5

1580
01:37:58,072 --> 01:37:59,403
You drive this lousy car?

1581
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,005
You'll surely lose!

1582
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:03,139
We fear nothing, as you don't fear Aids.

1583
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:07,872
So you're uneducated.

1584
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:10,041
There's a saying:

1585
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:12,712
Tools are vital for a success.

1586
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,311
Car racing requires for driving skills.

1587
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:16,755
But tools are important as well.

1588
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:19,759
I tell you, I have enough tools today.

1589
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:22,322
Is Black Tone fine?

1590
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,362
I tell you, I'll defeat you,

1591
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:26,559
just as I defeated your father.

1592
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,294
I tell you too,

1593
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,834
Black Tone sends you his regards.

1594
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:31,470
He wants me to tell you

1595
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:33,473
he lives like king in Thailand.

1596
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:35,400
Good.

1597
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,438
And my buddy, Paddy.

1598
01:38:55,829 --> 01:39:00,926
Sky, the car is in excellent condition.

1599
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:01,997
Brother will bless you

1600
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:03,401
to defeat that bastard.

1601
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:05,235
Be gentle.

1602
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,271
Sorry.

1603
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:22,048
Give it to me.

1604
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,581
- You gave me that
- Give it to me now.

1605
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:32,491
Lucky.

1606
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:36,770
Take it.

1607
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,707
Kelly's

1608
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:53,849
Remember, you are to control the car.

1609
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:59,848
Some racers don't care about dying.

1610
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:01,587
Sometimes you must use brake,

1611
01:45:02,262 --> 01:45:03,559
sometimes the accelerator.

1612
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:34,586
Why I can't even see his rear lights?
