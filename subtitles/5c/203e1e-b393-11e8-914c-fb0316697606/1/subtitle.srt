00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,302
Monsieur Dreyfus. Oh, monsieur.

59
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:15,699
A catastrophe. A report of a shooting
at the Chateau de la Pierre Blanche.

60
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,106
So?

61
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,826
- M Ballon.
- What, the millionaire?

62
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,023
- Yes.
- That is a catastrophe.

63
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:26,419
It's not so much the shooting
that is a catastrophe.

64
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:31,217
The report had few details, just that
someone was shot, and the address.

65
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:35,141
I only just realised
that it was the home of Ballon.

66
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,902
- So?
- So l made a terrible mistake.

67
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:44,297
Who did you assign to the case?

68
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:47,379
- Clouseau.
- Oh, my God.

00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:51,496

00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,659

72
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:17,298
- Inspector Clouseau.
- Good evening, sir.

73
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:24,099
- What is your name?
- Henri LaFarge.

74
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,179
Make a note of that.

75
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:29,101
- You are the butler?
- The head butler.

76
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:34,387
The head butler. Cross out "butler"
and put down "head butler".

77
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,979
(squelch)

78
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,422
(Henri) This is M Ballon.

79
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,703
M Ballon, it is a great honour.

80
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:44,698
(squelch)

81
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:49,657
Excuse me.
I am lnspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.

82
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:53,707
I apologise for my appearance.
I had a slight accident.

83
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:56,507
Would you like a bathrobe or something?

84
00:10:56,588 --> 00:11:02,185
No, nothing at all. It's just
a little dampness. It will soon go.

85
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:04,828
M Ballon, you reported a shooting.

86
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,024
- No, l didn't. Maurice did.
- Maurice?

87
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,338
- Yes, he's guarding Maria.
- Ah.

88
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,704
I was at the airport at the time.
I've just arrived.

89
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:17,703
Of course. That is not necessary.
I'll have this cleared up in seconds.

90
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:20,746
Would you like to examine the body?

91
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,820
- I would be delighted.
- This way, sir.

92
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,744
(footsteps squelch)

93
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,707
- You are Maurice?
- Yes, monsieur.

94
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:03,788
M Ballon said
you were guarding someone.

95
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:06,429
Yes, monsieur.

96
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,981
This pen has been fired recently.

97
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,742
- And you are?
- Maria Gambrelli.

98
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,784
- I am lnspector Clouseau.
- How do you do?

99
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,301
See what else you can find.
What are you doing?

100
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:44,426
- I'm checking the gun.
- This is my pistol pen.

101
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,148
- I know.
- Get your own pistol pen, please.

102
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,823
This is my own personal one.

103
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:57,227
Don't look in here. Look outside.

104
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,427
- What did you say?
- Nothing, monsieur.

105
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,103
All right, you can go.

106
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,340
Now then.

107
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,828
um...

108
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,901
Please.

109
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,945
You found the body.

110
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,020
- Yes, monsieur.
- Mm.

111
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,146
A friend of yours?

112
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,302
- Have you any idea who killed him?
- I've no idea.

113
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,744
- She killed him.
- That's not true.

114
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,626
- She says it's not true.
- She is lying.

115
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,462
- Watch your tongue.
- I heard four shots.

116
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:48,508
You heardfour shots.
You did not see four...

117
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:49,704
I am sorry.

118
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,224
- You did not see these four shots.
- No.

119
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,461
Then you could not know
who fired those shots.

120
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,020
- The door was locked from the inside.
- What does that prove?

121
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,548
When l broke in l found Miguel where you
see him and Maria with a gun in her hand.

122
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,986
- With the gun in her hand?
- Still smoking.

123
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,824
Did you have the gun in your hand?

124
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,903
- And was it still smoking?
- I suppose so, but...

125
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,902
I don't know how it got there.

126
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,584
- Ridiculous.
- I will decide what is ridiculous.

127
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,709
- Monsieur, you surely don't believe...
- I believe everything.

128
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,701
And l believe nothing.

129
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,065
I suspect everyone.

130
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,141
And l suspect no one.

131
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,860
I gather the facts, examine the clues...

132
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,505
and before you know it, the case is solved.

133
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,103
Oh, yes. There is much here that does not
meet the eye. That is quite obvious.

134
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,101
- What was that you said?
- Nothing, monsieur.

135
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,988
All right. You can go now.

136
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,348
Yes, monsieur.

137
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,539
But do not try to leave. Everyone
in this household is under suspicion.

138
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,621
Yes, monsieur.

139
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,301
- (Clouseau) Tell me what happened.
- He was having difficulty with the buttons.

140
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,382
- Buttons?
- The buttons on my dress.

141
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,748
That is strange because
there are no buttons on this dress.

142
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,063
That is because he was having difficulty
with them. He tore the dress off.

143
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,619
- He attacked you.
- Oh, no.

144
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,748
I would have helped him
but he couldn't wait.

145
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,823
The buttons are probably
all over the room.

146
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:50,382
He was so impetuous.
A passionate Spaniard, you know.

147
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:58,103
And he tore your dress off, eh?

148
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,260
Yes.

149
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:03,629
Suddenly someone opened the door.
Miguel leapt up and...

150
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:09,229
That is the last l remember until Maurice
came in and found me with the gun.

151
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:10,460
Yes.

152
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:15,261
There is, if you'll excuse me, something
here that l do not quite understand.

153
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,740
What don't you understand?

154
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:26,463
I don't understand... when you say
that you don't remember.

155
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,827
- I guess l was unconscious.
- unconscious?

156
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:31,583
- I have a bump.
- A beump?

157
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,265
- Yes.
- Where? Let me see.

158
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:39,189
I don't know how it happened
but it is painful.

159
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,626
That is beautiful perfume.

160
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,429
- It's bath oil.
- Is it?

161
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:46,423
I can't figure it out.
Someone must have hit me.

162
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:51,301
Yes. You have received
a mild concussion with that beump.

163
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:54,030
- You have cream on your nose.
- That's nothing.

164
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,148
- It's from that thing over there.
- You're all wet.

165
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,744
- What?
- Is it raining?

166
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:02,870
No, it's just that my stupid driver
parked too close to the fountain.

167
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:07,422
You should get out of these clothes.
You'll catch pneumonia.

168
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:12,460
I probably will, but it's all part
of life's rich pageant, you know.

169
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:16,464
We police put up with a lot of things
in the course of our duties

170
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,941
that in private life
one wouldn't normally tolerate.

171
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,546
(Clouseau) Why don't we have a smoke?
Helps to calm the nerves

172
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,829
and enable us to think more clearly.

173
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,741
- It is lovely perfume.
- That's not perfume. That's bath oil.

174
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,630
Oh, is it? Well, it's very beautiful.

175
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:40,510
- Thank you.
- I can still smell it.

176
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:44,430
- Now, where were we?
- My bump.

177
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,542
That's right. That you received
when somebody hit you.

178
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:52,830
- At least, we presume somebody hit you.
- How else could it have happened?

179
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:56,666
In the police force, first,
we presume, after, we find out.

180
00:17:56,752 --> 00:18:00,222
That is the way we work.
Because if we work the other way...

181
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,780
Goodness, it's a bit stuffy in here.

182
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,624
- Your coat!
- Yes, it is my coat.

183
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:07,545
- But it's on fire!
- What?

184
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:10,465
My coat is on fire!

185
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:13,146
My goodness, l'm burning!

186
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,146
- Clouseau?
- Argh!

187
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,985
He fell out of the window!

188
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,063
(Dreyfus) Clouseau?

189
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,663
(Maria) Are you all right?

190
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:34,586
Mm? Oh, yes.
I'm perfectly all right, thank you.

191
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:39,462
- In that case, you may go home.
- Go home?

192
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,747
- You are relieved.
- Relieved?

193
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:45,666
I am taking charge. Good night, Clouseau.

194
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,143
Good night, sir.

195
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,949
- Argh!
- I'm sorry, sir.

196
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:05,548
You idiot. You fool. It's a good job
l was able to check my reflexes.

197
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:09,102
I might have killed you with a karate chop.

198
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,111
You...

199
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,661
you fool!

200
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:20,587
Just for that you are... you're off the case.

201
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,864
Back to town.

202
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:41,829
- When can l have the report?
- First thing in the morning.

203
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,984
- Excuse me. M Ballon?
- Yes.

204
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:50,988
- I'm Commissioner Dreyfus.
- Ah. Where's lnspector Clouseau?

205
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,871
I'm taking charge of this investigation.

206
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:57,184
You and Mme Ballon
will not be inconvenienced

207
00:19:57,273 --> 00:20:01,949
and the Ballon name will not suffer
the sensationalism of the press.

208
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,501
He was a strange fellow,
but l rather liked him.

209
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,709
- Huh?
- I mean Clouseau.

210
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:10,991
Oh. Yes, yes.
He's a... he's an extraordinary man.

211
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,505
(creak)

212
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,945
Argh!

213
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:32,067
- Argh!
- (phone rings)

214
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,423
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

215
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:38,506
One moment, please.
Commissioner Dreyfus.

216
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,545
(breathes heavily)

217
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:48,708
- Hello, lnspector Clouseau here.
- Get down here immediately.

218
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:51,706
- You're back on the Gambrelli case.
- The Gambrelli case?

219
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,833
Maria Gambrelli.
The maid who killed the chauffeur.

220
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,348
Oh, Maria Gambrelli, the maid. Yes, yes.

221
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:01,506
Excellent. I'll be down there
right away. Thank you.

222
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:04,791
Well, Kato, l am back on the case.

223
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:09,231
I tell you, Maria Gambrelli is beautiful.
Innocent. Hah!

224
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:14,506
That was a good work-out.
You're improving.

225
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,552
Every day you're getting better.

226
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:19,625
(mutters)

227
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:26,146
Facts, Hercule, facts.

228
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,464
Nothing matters but the facts.

229
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:31,546
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

230
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:34,432
is nothing more than a guessing game.

231
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:39,543
Listen to me, Hercule,
and you will learn something.

232
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,102
The facts in this case are...

233
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,949
the body of the chauffeur was found
in the bedroom of the second maid. Fact.

234
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:50,584
Cause of death - four bullets
in the chest. Fact.

235
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:57,750
The bullets were fired at close range
from a .25 calibre Beretta automatic. Fact.

236
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,670
Maria Gambrelli was discovered
with the murder weapon in her hand. Fact.

237
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:06,987
The murder weapon was registered in
the name of the deceased, Miguel Ostos,

238
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:11,626
and was kept, mark you, in the glove
compartment of the Ballon Rolls-Royce.

239
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,114
Fact.

240
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:18,349
Members of the household staff
have testified that Miguel Ostos beat...

241
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:25,114
Careful, you fool. You broke my pointing
stick. I've got nothing to point with now.

242
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:30,827
..have testified that Miguel Ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

243
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:34,828
Finally comes the sworn statement
of M and Mme Ballon,

244
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:40,911
as well as all the members of the staff,
each of them with perfect alibis.

245
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:47,069
Now then, Hercule,
what is the inescapable conclusion?

246
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:50,909
- Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.
- What? You idiot.

247
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:54,271
- Impossible. She's protecting someone.
- How do you know?

248
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:56,630
- Instinct.
- But the facts...

249
00:23:56,715 --> 00:24:00,264
- You are forgetting the motive.
- He beat her.

250
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,233
- He was Spanish.
- He tore her dress off.

251
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:07,706
Don't be ridiculous. Would you kill
somebody who tore yourdress off?

252
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:11,549
- No, l suppose not.
- No, of course not.

253
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:16,072
No, no. There is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

254
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,830
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

255
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,304
Find them
and you have found the murderer

256
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:26,673
and l shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

257
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:31,194
Maria Gambrelli will tell me
who he is. Oh, yes.

258
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:35,794
- What was that you said?
- uh, nothing.

259
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:39,755
I see. All right.
Well, you can go, Hercule.

260
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:59,475
Argh!

261
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:07,675
I don't understand.

262
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,432
Why in the name of heaven did you
reassign Clouseau to the Gambrelli case?

263
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:16,065
That is a good question,
and it deserves an answer.

264
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:20,786
But what l'm about to tell you
must remain in the strictest confidence.

265
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:25,791
This morning, at six o'clock,
l received a phone call from a superior.

266
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:30,791
I was informed that certain extremely
influential parties were interested

267
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:34,073
in having Clouseau back on the case.

268
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:37,671
- I had no choice but to comply.
- Amazing.

269
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:42,227
If l told you the identity of the caller
you'd realise how amazing it really is.

270
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:43,749
But why?

271
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,545
That's another good question,
and for that l have no answer.

272
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,708
Ah. They're bringing in
the Gambrelli woman.

273
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,910
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

274
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,951
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

275
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,427
Now, where were...

276
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,345
Good morning, monsieur.

277
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:27,470
- Oh. Good morning, Miss Gambrelli.
- Good morning.

278
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:30,151
- You slept well?
- No.

279
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,956
- Wonderful.
- It is not easy to sleep in prison.

280
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:38,393
It isn't? No, no, no, of course it isn't. No.

281
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:42,072
We shall have to do something
about that, won't we?

282
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,356
uh...

283
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:50,712
Stupid box. Yes.

284
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:54,585
But, anyway, first, a few simple questions.

285
00:27:56,277 --> 00:28:00,111
- Is it all right if l smoke?
- Oh, yes, of course.

286
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:02,791
- Have one of mine.
- Thank you.

287
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:06,267
- Ah.
- Well, have one of mine.

288
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:08,871
Mm? Oh, thank you.

289
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,597
That's very kind of you.
Very, very kind of you.

290
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:14,272
- That's all right.
- Allow me.

291
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:18,556
- Thank you. Other way around.
- Hm? What? Oh.

292
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:21,516
It tastes very bad when you do that.

293
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:26,189
Well, now...

294
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:29,275
Are you comfortable?

295
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:33,067
- They should have these chairs in prison.
- Most certainly.

296
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:38,107
- As l recall, the furniture is deplorable.
- Terrible. Might as well sit on the floor.

297
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:42,430
Yes, it's high time that somebody
did something about it, don't you think?

298
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:43,667
Sure.

299
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:47,956
As a matter of fact, l will do
something about it this very moment.

300
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,236
- Give me the prison superintendent.
- (man) Yes, sir.

301
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:57,028
Sometimes it's necessary to cut through
red tape and strike directly at the heart.

302
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,996
Prison is bad enough
without uncomfortable furniture.

303
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,069
(phone rings)

304
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,955
Yes?

305
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,552
Superintendent,
this is lnspector Clouseau.

306
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:11,790
When are you going to do something
about that terrible furniture?

307
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:14,631
We are not savages.
This is not the Middle Ages.

308
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:19,075
I mean, you are running a house
of correction, not a torture chamber.

309
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:24,107
That made him think. I suggest you take
the matter under serious consideration.

310
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:29,431
If one is to cope with a modern criminal,
it is necessary to use modern methods.

311
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:34,751
You can't have a contemporary prison
without, uh, contemporary furniture.

312
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:37,636
Yes. Well, that's my opinion anyway.

313
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:42,035
Oh. And the same to you, Superintendent.

314
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:44,750
Filthy swine.

315
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:47,989
You're not at all like a policeman.

316
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,189
Your dossier.

317
00:29:52,438 --> 00:29:57,513
I always keep my important documents
under lock and key

318
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,397
because one can never be too sure.

319
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:03,470
Now, here...

320
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,028
Oh.

321
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,791
Oh, uh...

322
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,597
Excuse me.

323
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,271
Stupid.

324
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,278
Oh.

325
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,830
Now, um...

326
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:38,111
Miss Gambrelli, your dossier contains
some very, very interesting facts.

327
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:42,795
It seems that you have known
this Miguel Ostos for quite some time.

328
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:43,709
Yes.

329
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,518
- And were you in love with him?
- Yes.

330
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,194
You're in love
with the man that raped you?

331
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,076
That what?

332
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,914
Testimony of Georges Duval, gardener.
Referring to Ostos, you described him,

333
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:01,390
and l quote, as "that crazy Spaniard
who raped me in my father's field".

334
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,437
He did not rape me.

335
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,271
- He did not force you?
- Well, you see, l tripped over a root,

336
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,956
and l grabbed Miguel to keep me
from falling, and somehow we both fell.

337
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:21,839
I cried a little bit afterwards but that
wasn't because l was sorry it happened.

338
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,956
- It was something he said.
- He insulted you.

339
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,715
Oh, no. He lit a cigarette
and took a long puff, and...

340
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,077
Tell me, why do so many men
smoke afterwards?

341
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,435
No wonder tobacco companies get rich.

342
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,072
Yes, l must admit l had never
thought of it quite that way.

343
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,154
Hm. Last night, it was to be our last night.
It was all finished.

344
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,438
- You were leaving him?
- Oh, no. He was leaving me.

345
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,433
Poor Miguel. He was really in one
of his moods last night.

346
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,592
First he babbled in Spanish,
and then he cried.

347
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,955
He really broke down and cried.

348
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,837
- You don't say.
- I do say.

349
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,912
And then when l tried to console him,
make him feel better,

350
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,869
suddenly he was tearing off my clothes
and cursing like a madman.

351
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,359
Hm.

352
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,031
Very strange.

353
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,711
Very strange.

354
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,030
The thing l don't understand...

355
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,793
Ostos was leaving you

356
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,113
and yet by your own account
he was behaving like a jealous madman.

357
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,036
Well, you see, l thought
if he was leaving me he'd suffer,

358
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,236
thinking that l was alone.

359
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,677
And... and so l told him
there was someone else.

360
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,239
Mm-hm.

361
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,552
It was a lie. I admit that.
But only out of kindness.

362
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,153
Ah!

363
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,435
- Oh, uh...
- I'm sorry.

364
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,479
- It's nothing at all, really. Stupid tailor.
- Beautiful suit.

365
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,712
Yes, l know, but don't worry.
A few stitches and you'll never know.

366
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,431
Miguel? Ah!

367
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,112
Hercule?

368
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,751
Must l go back to prison?

369
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,512
unfortunately, yes.

370
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,592
But... don't give up hope.

371
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,677
- What do you want?
- You sent for me.

372
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,751
Of course l sent for you!

373
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,675
Goodbye.

374
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,558
Goodbye, my dar... uh, Miss Gambrelli.

375
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:49,237
Well, there's no doubt in my mind
she is shielding someone.

376
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,358
- Do you think you can break her down?
- Mm.

377
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:57,196
Given enough time l could
have her eating out of my hand.

378
00:33:57,281 --> 00:34:01,240
Anyway, we have no time. We must
catch him before he leaves the country.

379
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:04,631
- But if you don't know who he is...
- She will lead me to him.

380
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:07,394
- Release her.
- Release her?

381
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,279
How can she lead me to him
if she's in prison?

382
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:14,513
- But Commissioner Dreyfus...
- I will assume responsibility.

383
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:18,594
Release her. I will apprehend
this culprit within 24 hours.

384
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,080
Argh!

385
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:24,549
Get me out of here.
Quick, nurse, the screens.

386
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:32,029
I've got Africa all over my hand now.

387
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,512
Nice balloons.

388
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:58,035
Do you have a licence
to sell these balloons?

389
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:00,077
Licence?

390
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,753
(siren)

391
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,872
- Yes?
- Good morning, monsieur.

392
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:43,920
Good morning, Georges.
Is there something l can do for you?

393
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:48,996
Well, yes. And perhaps
there's something l can do for you.

394
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:51,721
What could you possibly do for me?

395
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,362
You remember the night of the murder?

396
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:57,400
- Is that a rhetorical question?
- What?

397
00:35:57,482 --> 00:36:00,679
Now, come along, Georges.
What is it you want?

398
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:03,834
I saw you climbing down
from Maria's room.

399
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:07,911
- You have sharp eyes.
- Oh, yes.

400
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:12,871
And a big stomach. It's so hard
to keep it filled, prices these days.

401
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,671
Are we going to discuss the economy
or will you come to the point?

402
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:19,993
The point is 100,000 francs.

403
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:23,119
You know, for the groceries.

404
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:27,195
Then perhaps my eyes
will grow small again.

405
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:32,754
Yes. Well, we'll certainly have
to do something about your stomach.

406
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,513
(dog barks)

407
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:57,121
Hey!

408
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:01,511
Nice dog. Nice dog.

409
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,354
(dog barks)

410
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:11,038
Nice doggie.

411
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:16,042
Oh. Excuse me. I just happened
to be passing and l...

412
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:18,273
Ah. Ah.

413
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,756
Ah.

414
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,754
Ah, my little...

415
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:27,631
You have been cutting flowers.
You must have been cutting something.

416
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:31,079
- There's blood all over your shears.
- Ah. Ah.

417
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:32,835
That's very strange.

418
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:36,199
Ah!

419
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:38,274
(Clouseau) Ah.

420
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,594
Facts, Hercule. Facts.

421
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:46,881
Behind them lies the whole fabric
of deductive truth.

422
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:50,522
Now, Hercule, let us examine these facts.

423
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:54,835
One - she was found
with the murder weapon in her hand.

424
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:58,598
Two - the murder weapon
was fresh with blood.

425
00:37:58,683 --> 00:38:02,232
Three - there were no fingerprints
on the murder weapon but hers,

426
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:08,717
and four - all the members of the Ballon
household staff have perfect alibis.

427
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:12,955
Now then, Hercule,
what do these facts add up to?

428
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,194
Maria Gambrelli killed
Georges the gardener.

429
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:20,754
Idiot. Only a fresh-faced novice would
come up with a conclusion like that.

430
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,356
- But the facts...
- Listen.

431
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:27,278
Whoever killed Miguel killed Georges
to cover up the first crime.

432
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:30,912
He is trying to blame this poor servant girl.

433
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,597
Well, who do you suspect?

434
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:38,119
I suspect everyone.

435
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,478
- I suppose that is possible.
- Possible?

436
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:43,999
What do you mean "possible"?
l deal in certainties.

437
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:48,281
I have only to break her down, make
her admit she's protecting somebody

438
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:51,958
and then force her to divulge his identity.

439
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:56,274
There can be no more cat and mouse.

440
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:58,958
No more subtle interrogation.

441
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:04,074
For her own sake,
and for the sake ofjustice,

442
00:39:04,164 --> 00:39:10,353
I will resort to any means, short
of brute force, to drag it out of her.

443
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,995
True, she will suffer.

444
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,839
But in the end she will be free
and we will have our killer.

445
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:21,762
- You released her again?
- Yes, sir.

446
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,716
(siren)

447
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:02,675
Shall we settle this now, or do you intend
making me late for the recital?

448
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:06,040
We can't just fire her.
She has given us no cause.

449
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,877
Cause? We are up to our necks
in dead bodies.

450
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:12,001
What are you waiting for?
The last act of Hamlet?

451
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:15,554
If you compare our household
with a Shakespearean tragedy,

452
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:19,398
I suggest that Macbeth
would be more appropriate.

453
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,078
Oh, darling, my cue ball.

454
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:44,720
That was Mme Ballon.

455
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:49,925
Follow her. When you have discovered
her destination, call me immediately.

456
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:54,199
(Maurice) lnspector Clouseau.

457
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:00,603
- Good evening, M Ballon.
- Good evening, lnspector.

458
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:03,119
There are one or two questions
l'd like to ask.

459
00:41:03,205 --> 00:41:05,480
- Of course.
- Some points need clearing up.

460
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,635
Certainly. Do you play billiards?

461
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:10,956
Billiards. Yes, l have played
some billiards in my time.

462
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:15,516
I find it makes for a more relaxed and
friendly conversation. How about you?

463
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:17,243
- Yes.
- Take a cue.

464
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:19,714
Ah. A cue. Yes.

465
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,724
Hm.

466
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:24,796
That should do.

467
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,762
- That's strange.
- You'd be better with an ordinary cue.

468
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:36,633
- That's what we call a bridge.
- Ah, the bridge cue, yes.

469
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:40,115
Yes, l much prefer the good,
old-fashioned, plain cue.

470
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:42,196
Yes, yes.

471
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:50,679
Oh, l'm most terribly sorry.
I'm dreadfully sorry.

472
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:53,359
That's all right.
I've broken a few in my time.

473
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:56,642
Try this one. This is my favourite cue.

474
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:02,795
You'll find that it's great for curved shots.

475
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:20,322
You, uh, had some questions, lnspector.

476
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,441
Yes.

477
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:25,437
I had rather hoped
to have a talk with your wife.

478
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:29,405
- Well, she's out. You just missed her.
- On the contrary.

479
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:33,764
She just missed me
in the driveway going out. Ah!

480
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,116
M Ballon, did you not state...

481
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:49,921
that, uh... on the night of the murder...

482
00:42:50,726 --> 00:42:56,323
you had, uh, just arrived from London
on the 11 o'clock flight?

483
00:42:58,286 --> 00:42:59,878
Yes. Why?

484
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:05,757
- It was cancelled due to bad weather.
- I arrived on an earlier flight.

485
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:11,557
I put it to you directly, M Ballon, that
it was you who murdered Miguel Ostos.

486
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,957
Don't be ridiculous.

487
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:18,245
Oh.

488
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:20,886
uh... Iook, if you can just move...

489
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:24,925
That's it.
These curved cues can be difficult.

490
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:26,997
Now pull.

491
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:32,435
Yes, l disliked Miguel intensely.

492
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:38,715
But l am not in the habit of killing people
because l dislike them. I beg your pardon.

493
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:42,644
(Ballon) l may as well
tell you the whole thing.

494
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:47,481
The night Miguel was killed, l arranged
for him to meet the 11 o'clock plane.

495
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:49,557
I arrived on the nine o'clock.

496
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:52,922
He would be on his way to the airport
while l was on my way home.

497
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,315
My wife was at a dinner party.

498
00:43:55,406 --> 00:44:00,196
This would give me a whole hour,
at least, alone in the house.

499
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,197
For what?

500
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,157
For Maria.

501
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,037
What?

502
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,957
Does that surprise you?

503
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,157
(phone rings)

504
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:25,406
Then l submit, lnspector Ballon,
that you arrived home,

505
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:28,160
found Miguel with Maria Gambrelli,

506
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:31,080
and killed him in a rit of fealous jage.

507
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:35,119
I admit to the affair, but to kill for her?

508
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:38,995
- Would you kill for her?
- Of course... uh, not.

509
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:42,684
- Well, it's still your shot.
- Yes. Mm.

510
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,758
Ah. Mm.

511
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,046
Mm.

512
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,884
(rip)

513
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:08,682
I'm dreadfully sorry, M Ballon.

514
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:11,918
I appear to have grazed your billiard table.

515
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,966
Telephone, monsieur,
for lnspector Clouseau.

516
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,197
Ah, that will be for me.

517
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:29,765
Yes? This is lnspector Clouseau.

518
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:44,397
All right. If you stay there
l will come over immediately.

519
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:47,836
M Ballon, l wonder if you could oblige.

520
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:50,919
I have to meet my assistant
and l am without a car.

521
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:53,441
- I'll have Pierre drive you.
- Excellent.

522
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:58,760
Well, l suppose it's the end of our game.
Do you mind putting my cue away?

523
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:04,046
Have Pierre bring the car around.

524
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,962
Your car is ready, monsieur.

525
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:31,564
Look, l'm, uh, dreadfully sorry, M Ballon.

526
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:35,641
Please don't concern yourself.
Maurice will do it for you.

527
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:43,482
(Clouseau) Let go of my back, you...

528
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:49,159
Thank you, monsieur.

529
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:54,606
Really, whoever invented that rack
should have his head examined.

530
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,485
Well...

531
00:46:56,568 --> 00:47:00,925
- We will continue at another time.
- A pleasure at any time.

532
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:02,157
(thud)

533
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:08,564
I suggest you have your architect
investigated as well.

534
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,358
Mme Ballon is in apartment 12.

535
00:47:23,448 --> 00:47:28,841
You stay here. If l'm not out within
ten minutes, send reinforcements.

- Good morning.

I'm the game warden.

- Hunting licence?

(siren)

548
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,961
He was shooting crows?

549
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,281
He was disguised as a hunter
in order to watch the Ballon house.

550
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,962
Mm-hm.

551
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,161
Give me ten men like Clouseau
and l could destroy the world.

552
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,440
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

553
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,124
After l got his release he got a phone call.

554
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,442
He ran out of his office saying he had an
important lead that would crack the case.

555
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:24,002
This case is already so full of cracks
l guess one more won't make a difference.

556
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,089
- François?
- Yes, Commissioner?

559
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:53,045
Now then. You say you followed Maria
Gambrelli to this godforsaken place.

560
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,406
She took a taxi this far,
then l followed her up the pathway

561
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,481
to the entrance to Camp Sunshine.

562
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,401
- Camp Sunshine?
- Yes.

563
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,482
I'd have called you but then
l saw Dudu the maid also enter.

564
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,481
- up the path?
- Yes, but...

565
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,165
Look, you return to the Ballon residence
and look for more clues.

566
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,640
- Inspector...
- I will try to see what is afoot here.

567
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,929
- Inspector, l think l should...
- Hurry up. There's not a second to lose.

568
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:44,802
Good afternoon.

569
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,449
Hm.

570
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:49,329
I am lnspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.

571
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:51,680
Oh.

572
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:56,003
Tell me, have you anyone registered here
by the name of Maria Gambrelli?

573
00:51:56,091 --> 00:52:00,084
Gambrelli. Yes, l believe
she checked in about an hour ago.

574
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:02,287
Yes. Gambrelli.

575
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:05,761
- 11 .45.
- Where can l find her?

576
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:11,164
Well, she could be most anywhere, but
my guess would be the recreation area.

577
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:13,242
Thank you.

578
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:21,123
- Can l ask you something?
- Yes?

579
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:24,169
Have you been... swimming?

580
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:26,811
Why, yes. How did you know?

581
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:29,485
It is my business to know.

582
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:53,928
Ah, ah, ah.
And where do you think you're going?

583
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,608
I do not think, sir.
I know where l am going.

584
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,921
I am going to the recreation area.

585
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:04,730
- Not like that, you're not.
- What was that you said?

586
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:08,360
I said you're not going
to the recreation area like that.

587
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:11,887
- I am lnspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.
- How do you do? l'm Turk.

588
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:16,250
I am on official business, looking
for someone at the recreation area.

589
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:19,130
Not unless you take off your clothes.

590
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:23,442
- You, sir, are under arrest.
- Arrest? What for?

591
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:26,649
Making lewd and suggestive
remarks to an officer.

592
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:29,292
- Lewd remarks?
- Also for indecent exposure.

593
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,203
- Does no one wear clothes here?
- No.

594
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,011
- What?
- This is a nudist colony.

595
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,289
- A nudist colony?
- Right.

596
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:43,684
And nobody gets in
unless they take their clothes off.

597
00:53:43,772 --> 00:53:45,922
What, all of them?

598
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:49,163
All of them.
Right down to your moustache.

00:56:00,853 --> 00:56:02,844
- Did you call the police?
- I?

602
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:06,243
- Someone called and reported a murder.
- Murder?

603
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,928
- Tell the men to search the camp.
- One of your men is already here.

604
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:13,244
- One of my men?
- Yes. Inspector Clouseau.

605
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,051
Hm.

606
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,725
- Ah!
- I can't understand.

607
00:56:16,813 --> 00:56:18,007
Murder?

608
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:19,492
Oh!

609
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:50,287
Pssst!

610
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,968
- Beg your pardon.
- Clouseau.

611
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:57,493
Over here.

612
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,573
Quick.

613
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:10,407
Listen, that's Dudu.

614
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,803
- Dudu?
- She's dead.

615
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,805
Dead? Dudu?

Come out! Out.

Round up everyone.
Get me that idiot, if you can find him.

620
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:41,929
Straight away, sir.

00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:48,766

please, let it be Clouseau, hm?

622
00:57:56,894 --> 00:58:00,204
- (Maria) What are we going to do?
- We can't leave without clothes.

623
00:58:00,294 --> 00:58:04,492

Just look at those goose pimples.

626
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:55,284
- I know how you feel but...
- I'm having a bad dream. A nightmare.

627
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,889
It's nothing to what could have happened.

628
00:58:57,975 --> 00:59:01,490
- What do we do now?
- Well, you keep down,

629
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:03,850
and then they can only see
the top half of me.

630
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:07,405
Perhaps they will think
that l have just come from the beach.

631
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:10,771
- We can't just keep driving around?
- No.

632
00:59:10,855 --> 00:59:12,607
- Please.
- No, that's right.

633
00:59:12,695 --> 00:59:17,132
I will take us to my apartment and
somehow l will try to get us inside.

634
00:59:17,215 --> 00:59:20,013
Please, whatever happens,
try to keep calm.

635
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:30,886
- I can assure you she's not in the house.
- Sorry, but l must see for myself.

636
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:41,968
- She has not been in the house all day?
- She left before l did this morning

637
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:45,252
and she wasn't here
when l got back an hour ago.

638
00:59:48,535 --> 00:59:50,685
- Henri can verify that.
- Henri?

639
00:59:50,775 --> 00:59:53,892
- The head butler.
- I'd like to talk to Henri.

640
00:59:57,175 --> 01:00:00,247
Well, he could have verified it.

641
01:00:42,216 --> 01:00:46,767
- Only a few more blocks now.
- I feel like l'm losing my mind.

642
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:49,609
I'll start screaming
and l won't be able to stop.

643
01:00:49,696 --> 01:00:52,415
Please, try to hold on to yourself.

644

(siren)

650
01:01:35,616 --> 01:01:37,607
You are off the Gambrelli case.

651
01:01:37,696 --> 01:01:40,415
- Report to the Department of Records.
- Records?

652
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,134
- In Martinique.
- What?

653
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:44,650
Tomorrow,
or you can forget your pension.

654
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:47,534
But that is not fair.
I was only doing my duty.

655
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:52,610
And l am right, you will see.
Maria Gambrelli is not a murderer.

656
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:55,415
There's something personal in this.

657
01:01:55,496 --> 01:01:58,090
Yes. Deeply personal.

658
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:02,725
I hate you.
Every little bit of you. Now get out.

659
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:06,170
You want me to leave?

660
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,013
You are making a terrible mistake.

661
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:16,487
If Maria Gambrelli is not a murderer,
and l say she is not,

662
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:20,855
you are sending an innocent girl
to the guillotine.

663
01:02:22,297 --> 01:02:24,288
Excuse me, François.

664
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:28,048
And another thing.

665
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:39,211
Martinique?

666
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:45,086
He's on his way.

667
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:52,054
What about those influential parties
that wanted Clouseau on the case?

668
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:57,734
Whatever they do to me now,
it is not half of what he has done already.

669
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,887
Ah.

670
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:06,086
Besides, l feel certain l know
who is behind those influential requests.

671
01:03:06,177 --> 01:03:08,611
- Ballon.
- Ballon?

672
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:13,612
- He was having an affair with Gambrelli.
- Most likely.

673
01:03:13,697 --> 01:03:15,847
At first l couldn't understand why anyone

674
01:03:15,937 --> 01:03:19,213
would want a man like Clouseau
in charge of a murder case,

675
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:21,288
especially a case of this importance.

676
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:24,653
- But why would Ballon?
- He wouldn't.

677
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:26,887
unless he was protecting someone.

678
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:31,414
If you were protecting someone, who
would be the perfect man on the case?

679
01:03:31,497 --> 01:03:35,331
A fool. A detective
who is a complete and utter fool.

680
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:37,692
- Clouseau?
- Of course.

681
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:41,816
If Gambrelli is convicted,
Ballon is up to his ears in a nasty scandal

682
01:03:41,897 --> 01:03:46,368
and Clouseau was his insurance policy
against such a scandal.

683
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:49,017
Well, he has gone.

684
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,930
Ah.

685
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:55,850
I feel like a child again.

686
01:03:55,937 --> 01:03:59,533
It's an interesting theory,
but what if you are wrong?

687
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:03,406
I know it's a remote possibility,

688
01:04:03,498 --> 01:04:07,332
but what if you are wrong and
Ballon is not protecting Gambrelli?

689
01:04:07,418 --> 01:04:10,774
What if she is innocent,
as Clouseau claims?

690
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:13,167
- Ridiculous.
- But a possibility.

691
01:04:13,258 --> 01:04:15,533
What if Ballon is protecting someone else,

692
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:19,577
or what if Ballon himself
is the guilty party?

693
01:04:19,658 --> 01:04:23,207
- It's a sadistic thing to suggest.
- But for the sake of discussion,

694
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:25,368
what if you are wrong,

695
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:30,293
and Clouseau - a fool,
a complete and utter fool...

696
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:33,973
- I'd be ruined.
- It's something to consider.

697
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:44,256
- François?
- Yes, Commissioner?

698
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,455
Would you please call for a doctor?

699
01:04:47,538 --> 01:04:49,768
Are you ill?

700
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:54,056
I seem to have stabbed myself
with a letter opener.

701
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,250
Argh!

702
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:19,774
Kato, you fool. Get off of me,
will you? Get off me!

703
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:22,452
Kato, what are you doing? Not now.

704
01:05:28,898 --> 01:05:32,208
Kato. Release me, you fool.

705
01:05:32,298 --> 01:05:34,289
(phone rings)

706
01:05:36,418 --> 01:05:38,648
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

707
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:41,616
Give me that telephone, you idiot.

708
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:46,091
- Inspector Clouseau here.
- This is the commissioner.

709
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:49,012
You are back on the Gambrelli case.

710
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:50,498
(yelps)

711
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,571
Well, Kato, l'm back on the case.

712
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,650
(karate cry)

713
01:05:58,379 --> 01:06:01,451
Now to set the trap, catch the killer,

714
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:07,487
and prove to the world that Maria
Gambrelli is innocent of murder.

715
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:14,131
Hello? This is Clouseau. Connect me
with my assistant immediately.

716
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:18,371
I am ashamed of myself, Kato.
I forgot the first rule of self-defence.

717
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:21,576
No matter what,
always anticipate the unexpected.

718
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:26,210
A real assassin might have killed me.
We have to accelerate our training.

719
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:28,938
You must attack me when l least expect it

720
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:31,817
and you must give no quarter.
understand?

721
01:06:31,899 --> 01:06:34,367
Hello, Hercule? This is Clouseau.

722
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:39,249
I am back on the case.
Right, release Maria Gambrelli at once

723
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:42,854
and make a reservation
for two tonight at the Café Olé.

724
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:44,930
Right. Bye bye.

725
01:06:46,179 --> 01:06:49,171
Kato, unpack my things
and lay out my new blue suit.

726
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:52,535
I'm going to have a lovely hot soak
in a nice warm bath,

727
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:55,338
and l will plan out my strategy.

728
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,570
(Clouseau hums)

729
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:30,250
- (karate cry)
- Argh!

730
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,331
(chuckles and whimpers)

731
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,009
He released her again.

732
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,858
And he's taking her out to dinner.

733
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:49,332
Every paper in Paris has the story,
including the Christian Science Monitor,

734
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,615
and he gave them the story.

735
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,453
You see, he claims
she's protecting her lover

736
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,977
and the best way to force him
into the open is to make him jealous.

737
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,016
Jealous!

738
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,649
That nincompoop. That megalomaniac.

739
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:09,177
He's setting the science of criminal
investigation back a thousand years.

740
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,455
And l can't do anything about it.

741
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,531
- Why not?
- Why not?

742
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,094
What if he's right?

743
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:21,219
- What if he is?
- I'm finished. Washed up.

744
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,339
Sanity and reason become
things of the past. Madness reigns.

745
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,217
- Just relax.
- Relax?

746
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:32,328
With Clouseau loose? Go about offering
irresponsible suggestions like that

747
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,376
and you better find a good analyst.

748
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,054
- Now, just lie down.
- Just lie down.

749
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,812
- And relax.
- Relax.

750
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,653
(chuckles) Don't you think l want to relax?

751
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,857
Don't you think l'd give my arm
for a good night's sleep?

752
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,773
I haven't closed my eyes in three days.

753
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,375
I've only eaten a chicken leg
and some clear broth since Wednesday.

754
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,896
I'm cracking up.
I'm coming apart at the seams.

755
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:55,969
(chuckles)

756
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:00,576
Look at my eye. I used to have
a perfectly good eye. Two eyes, l mean.

757
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:06,371
No, Doctor, there is no hope. There is
no hope unless l can get rid of Clouseau.

758
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,451
I must get rid of Clouseau.

759
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,893
(whimpers)

760
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,211
(Spanish music)

761
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:49,700
Ese gitano de Cordoba,
o sea que eres unico, arsa, mira.

762
01:12:43,182 --> 01:12:45,650
(Polynesian drumming music)

763
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,574
(Russian music)

764
01:13:45,503 --> 01:13:48,415
(all chant) Pei do dna! Pei do dna!

765
01:14:20,863 --> 01:14:23,252
Pei do dna! Pei do dna!

766
01:14:54,344 --> 01:14:55,743
(rip)

767
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,622
(audience stops clapping and laughs)

768
01:15:03,024 --> 01:15:05,015
(dancer) What's wrong?

769
01:15:57,064 --> 01:16:00,818
I'm not gonna let you look at me
going up the stairs, you naughty thing.

770
01:16:00,904 --> 01:16:03,862
Come on, then.

771
01:16:03,944 --> 01:16:06,742
No, l'm just unlocking the door. No.

772
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:12,456
You just split up your pants so you could
lure me into this apartment of yours.

773
01:16:12,544 --> 01:16:15,502
Well, this is my apartment.

774
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:17,973
I know this is your apartment.

775
01:16:18,064 --> 01:16:22,342
- How about a little lure?
- You mustn't lure. You're luring me.

776
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:25,177
Oh, lu-lu-lu-lu-lure.

777
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:27,782
- Do you know?
- What?

778
01:16:27,864 --> 01:16:32,143
I know this is your apartment.
But that won't help you in the least bit.

779
01:16:32,225 --> 01:16:34,614
Why won't that help me in the least bit?

780
01:16:34,705 --> 01:16:36,184
- Because...
- Question...

781
01:16:36,265 --> 01:16:40,224
- Question, answer, Mr Police lnspector.
- Jacques Clouseau is the name.

782
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,341
I've given up sex.

783
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:43,904
Oh.

784
01:16:44,985 --> 01:16:46,816
Quel brutto momento.

785
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:49,260
I've given up sex.

786
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:11,419
- Promise me.
- What, darling?

787
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:16,095
Afterwards, you will not smoke, hm?

788
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:20,854
I give you my word
as an officer and a gentleman.

789
01:17:20,945 --> 01:17:23,698
Also, a policeman.

790
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,776
Policeman.

791
01:17:25,865 --> 01:17:28,060
- Jacques?
- Yes, darling.

792
01:17:29,265 --> 01:17:31,017
Carry me.

793
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:33,699
All right, my darling.

794
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:36,215
Jacques?

795
01:17:36,305 --> 01:17:38,023
- Yes?
- I swore l'd never...

796
01:17:38,105 --> 01:17:38,935
- Ooh!
- Oh.

797
01:17:39,025 --> 01:17:42,495
- Sorry, my darling.
- I swore l'd never do it again.

798
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:46,180
- Yes, darling.
- And l resolve to be so strong.

799
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:50,895
- Yes, darling.
- We all pay for our sins, don't we?

800
01:17:50,985 --> 01:17:56,105
Could you open the door, my darling?
Anything... worth waiting for is worth...

801
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:57,379
Oh.

802
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,854
(thud and smash)

803
01:17:59,945 --> 01:18:01,936
Oh, darling.

804
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:10,501
My darling. My dear, sweet darling.

805
01:18:13,465 --> 01:18:15,501
My sweet darling, let's have the...

806
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:20,975
- Jacques?
- What?

807
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:25,617
- It may be somebody important.
- What could be more important than this?

808
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:28,459
Jacques, look what you are doing.
Look at my sleeve.

809
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:32,619
- It's all right. It looks better that way.
- Jacques, go to the door.

810
01:18:32,706 --> 01:18:35,300
- Probably somebody important.
- Don't go away.

811
01:18:35,386 --> 01:18:37,695
- Don't go away.
- Darling, hurry.

812
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:39,777
Hurry, yes.

813
01:19:12,426 --> 01:19:16,101
- Darling!
- Coming, my lovely little darling.

814
01:19:17,106 --> 01:19:19,301
That's very strange.

815
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:28,735
Darling.

816
01:19:28,826 --> 01:19:31,215
- Oh, my darling.
- Come here.

817
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:38,301
Oh! Oh, this is too much
for a simple policeman.

818
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:41,225
(gargles)

819
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:43,615
Oh, my darling.

820
01:19:43,706 --> 01:19:46,539
Wait, l... Wait, wait, wait.

821
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:49,015
Wait, my darling. Wait.

822
01:19:54,226 --> 01:19:56,217
You beautiful, wonderful...

823
01:19:56,306 --> 01:19:59,139
- You're like a... Iike a little pin.
- Like a pin?

824
01:19:59,226 --> 01:20:01,217
(both laugh)

825
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:08,465
- (Kato) Argh!
- (Clouseau) No!

826
01:20:08,547 --> 01:20:10,026
(Maria screams)

827
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:13,622
- (Maria) No!
- (Clouseau) Kato! Kato, you fool!

828
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:16,267
(Kato shouts in Japanese)

829
01:20:16,347 --> 01:20:17,939
Kato!

830
01:20:20,547 --> 01:20:22,060
Kato!

831
01:20:22,147 --> 01:20:24,615
(Maria shrieks)

832
01:20:24,707 --> 01:20:26,698
(shouts and screams)

833
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:34,900
(shrieks)

834
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:36,056
Jacques!

835
01:20:36,147 --> 01:20:39,139
Don't worry, my darling. It's only Kato.

836
01:20:39,227 --> 01:20:41,218
This poor fool.

837
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:06,979
Jacques, Jacques! Oh, Jacques!

838
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,217
- I killed him.
- Don't worry, you didn't.

839
01:21:09,307 --> 01:21:13,186
He's all right. It's nothing to worry about.
Nothing can happen now.

840
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:15,656
(clock chimes)

841
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,743
"Trail of death
follows lnspector Clouseau."

842
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:36,422
Four people - a doorman,
two customers, and a Cossack.

843
01:21:37,867 --> 01:21:39,903
Most regrettable.

844
01:21:39,987 --> 01:21:45,107
Regrettable? lncluding the Ballon murders
this brings the grand total to eight.

845
01:21:45,187 --> 01:21:49,499
Well, that just goes to prove
what l have said all along.

846
01:21:51,147 --> 01:21:54,584
What you've said all along
qualifies you as the greatest prophet

847
01:21:54,668 --> 01:21:58,297
since General Custer said he was
going to surround all those lndians.

848
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:00,379
Maria did not kill those four people.

849
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:03,187
- Which four people?
- The last four people.

850
01:22:03,268 --> 01:22:05,907
Someone else did.
I was with her all the time.

851
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:08,946
Whoever he is,
he killed the first four people.

852
01:22:09,028 --> 01:22:11,986
- A doorman? A Cossack?
- Innocent bystanders.

853
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:14,457
He was after me. Fortunately he missed.

854
01:22:14,548 --> 01:22:16,618
"Fortunately" is not the word.

855
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,097
It proves my theory is correct.

856
01:22:19,188 --> 01:22:23,181
Because of misguided loyalty Maria will
not divulge the name of her former love

857
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:26,066
and he is so jealous
he will kill rather than lose her.

858
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:29,185
Are you saying that the man
Gambrelli is protecting -

859
01:22:29,268 --> 01:22:32,863
her former lover - killed eight people
because he was jealous?

860
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,142
Insanely jealous.

861
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:37,459
So jealous he made it look
like Gambrelli was the murderer?

862
01:22:37,548 --> 01:22:39,425
He's a madman, a psychotic.

863
01:22:39,508 --> 01:22:41,339
- What about the maid?
- The maid?

864
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:43,896
Was he jealous of her too?
He strangled her.

865
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:46,980
Possibly his intended victim
was a man and he made a mistake.

866
01:22:47,068 --> 01:22:49,377
- In a nudist camp?
- Nobody's perfect.

867
01:22:49,468 --> 01:22:51,538
- Idiot! Nincompoop!
- Sir. Commissioner.

868
01:22:51,628 --> 01:22:53,220
Lunatic!

869
01:22:53,308 --> 01:22:55,458
I will have your murderer by tonight.

870
01:22:55,548 --> 01:22:57,300
What?

871
01:22:57,388 --> 01:23:00,266
- I have a plan.
- What sort of plan?

872
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:03,746
A plan that cannot possibly fail.

873
01:23:18,548 --> 01:23:22,223
Right. Now, remember,
at eight o'clock sharp,

874
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:25,823
you pull the master switch
just as l am about to name the murderer.

875
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:28,297
- Lights off for five seconds.
- No longer.

876
01:23:28,388 --> 01:23:32,859
Just long enough for the murderer
to leave the room. understand? Clear?

877
01:23:32,948 --> 01:23:35,746
Right, now we synchronise watches.

878
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:40,497
In seven seconds it will be precisely...

879
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,540
2.43.

880
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:50,626
- 2.43.
- Your watch must have stopped. I've 7.46.

881
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:53,018
Yes. 7.46, yes.

882
01:23:53,109 --> 01:23:57,466
- No, no, no. Now it's nearly 7.47.
- Yes, all right. 7.47.

883
01:23:57,549 --> 01:24:01,224
- Are we synchronising on 7.47?
- That is what you said.

884
01:24:01,309 --> 01:24:06,383
No, l said it was nearly.
I've now, ooh... ten seconds to 7.47.

885
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:10,222
- I've got ten seconds after 7.47.
- Put your watch back.

886
01:24:10,309 --> 01:24:12,869
- Yes, all right.
- Five seconds.

887
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:14,587
- Yes.
- Four.

888
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:15,818
Three.

889
01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:18,104
(both) Two. One.

890
01:24:18,189 --> 01:24:19,588
Now.

891
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:24,544
That's strange.
The second hand is not moving.

892
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:28,018
- It's ticking.
- It's moving now.

893
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:32,978
What? Yes. Yes, it is. Yes.
I know that. I can see that is moving now.

894
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:36,698
- And now l've 7.47 and 23 seconds.
- All right.

895
01:24:36,789 --> 01:24:40,145
- Let's synchronise on 7.47 and a half.
- Very good.

896
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:42,663
(both) Five. Four.

897
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:43,977
Three.

898
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:46,060
Two. One.

899
01:24:47,109 --> 01:24:49,669
- Now.
- My watch has stopped.

900
01:24:49,749 --> 01:24:51,899
Your watch has stopped?

901
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:55,777
A remarkable coincidence.
It's stopped completely.

902
01:24:55,869 --> 01:24:57,063
Hm.

903
01:24:57,149 --> 01:25:00,380
- Look here. Take my watch.
- What about you?

904
01:25:00,469 --> 01:25:04,462
- I'll keep talking till the lights go out.
- We won't be synchronised.

905
01:25:04,549 --> 01:25:08,827
Yes, it'll be all right. Don't worry.
I'll find a way out of it.

906
01:25:25,549 --> 01:25:27,380
(door opens)

907
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:38,146
Very kind of you. There's no need
for you to stand. Please sit down.

908
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:43,343
Now then. I expect you're wondering
why l've asked you all here.

909
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,739
Whatever the reason,
it's a damn nuisance.

910
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:49,061
We eat at nine and
you've brought everything to a standstill.

911
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:52,745
You will not be inconvenienced
for long, M Ballon.

912
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,947
Your clock has stopped, M Ballon.

913
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:07,340
Yes, but if you want to know the time
it's exactly 7.50.

914
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,785
You are slow, darling. It's 7.52.

915
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:15,820
No, my darling. This watch has not lost
a second since the day you gave it to me.

916
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,504
I didn't give it to you.

917
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:22,023
I have 7.55, monsieur.

918
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,624
- That is what l have.
- You are both fast.

919
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:27,702
No, my watch is right. I'll prove it to you.

920
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:36,427
Would you tell me the right time, please?
7.54. Thank you.

921
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,060
(phone rings)

922
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,823
Yes? lt's for you, lnspector.

923
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:45,299
Ah, it's for me.

924
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:53,585
- Yes?
- What time is it?

925
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,661
What?

926
01:26:56,350 --> 01:27:00,263
- Your watch has stopped.
- Where are you?

927
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,663
In the basement.
I had the operator call you.

928
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,981
I can't pull the switch at eight
if l don't know what time it is.

929
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:09,538
- It's, uh, 7.54.
- 55 now.

930
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:12,269
55 now, yes.

931
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:16,910
I just realised something.
I still won't know when it's eight o'clock.

932
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:19,744
- Count.
- What?

933
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,264
Count.

934
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:23,865
Oh, count. You mean seconds?

935
01:27:23,951 --> 01:27:28,900
Yes, that is exactly what l mean,
and don't dare call me here again.

936
01:27:31,231 --> 01:27:33,222
Now then.

937
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:59,540
Now then. I will tell you...
why l have called you all here tonight.

938
01:28:00,671 --> 01:28:04,949
One of you... is a murderer.

939
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:15,903
36... 37...

940
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:18,186
38... 39.

941
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:22,105
Before l name the killer...

942
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:28,628
I will explain to you the facts
that led me to discover his...

943
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:31,748
or her... identity.

944
01:28:48,551 --> 01:28:51,588
Now then.
The night the chauffeur was...

945
01:28:57,151 --> 01:28:59,949
- What was the chauffeur's name?
- Miguel.

946
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:01,828
- Migwell, yes.
- No, Miguel.

947
01:29:01,911 --> 01:29:04,380
- Migwell.
- Miguel.

948
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:08,385
- Well, this ltalian...
- Well, he was a Spaniard.

949
01:29:08,472 --> 01:29:13,671
Well, this Spaniard, um, Mingwell,
he was furious with Maria Gambrelli.

950
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:16,789
He tore her dress off.
He protested violently.

951
01:29:16,872 --> 01:29:19,386
Argh! Ooh, my foot!

952
01:29:19,472 --> 01:29:24,148
I'm terribly sorry. I beg your pardon.
I did not notice her. Excuse me.

953
01:29:24,232 --> 01:29:29,625
He tore her dress off, and at that
precise moment, the door opened...

954
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:34,022
and somebody... somebody shot him.

955
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:37,991
Maria could not see who the killer was
because she was unconscious.

956
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:41,906
She was unconscious because
she had received a beump on the head.

957
01:29:41,992 --> 01:29:44,062
A what?

958
01:29:44,152 --> 01:29:46,427
A beump.

959
01:29:46,512 --> 01:29:49,902
There is only one way she could
have received a beump like that.

960
01:29:49,992 --> 01:29:52,460
She was hit upon the head by an object,

961
01:29:52,552 --> 01:29:55,783
and the object was the knob
on the closet door.

962
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:59,103
Somebody was hiding in the closet,

963
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:02,741
and when they opened the door
she received a beump upon the head.

964
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:06,268
- For heaven's sake, come to the point.
- Don't tangle words with...

965
01:30:06,352 --> 01:30:10,311
- Ow! You clumsy idiot!
- Sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

966
01:30:10,392 --> 01:30:11,871
Ow!

967
01:30:11,952 --> 01:30:13,704
- (thud)
- (both) Oh!

968
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,510
Oh, those feathers.

969
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:19,426
Oh, l am coming, Maria, my darling.
My darling, l...

970
01:30:22,992 --> 01:30:24,823
Ooh.

971
01:30:24,912 --> 01:30:27,949
Careful, monsieur, with me.
Do not tangle with me.

972
01:30:28,032 --> 01:30:32,230
I'm a trained expert in karate.
My hands are lethal weapons.

973
01:30:34,832 --> 01:30:36,231
Hm.

974
01:30:37,912 --> 01:30:39,903
Now then.

975
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:45,942
There is something that l am very
interested to know. These rumours...

976
01:30:46,032 --> 01:30:50,185
- What happened? What?
- You fell off the sofa, you stupid...

977
01:30:50,273 --> 01:30:53,549
I know l fell off the sofa, madame.
There is no need to tell me.

978
01:30:53,633 --> 01:30:56,431
Everything l do
is carefully planned, madame.

979
01:30:56,513 --> 01:30:58,788
I know that.

980
01:30:58,873 --> 01:31:00,591
Now then.

981
01:31:00,673 --> 01:31:01,867
uh...

982
01:31:02,753 --> 01:31:05,347
What was l saying? uh...

983
01:31:06,073 --> 01:31:09,383
Listen, you, you daydreaming fool.
What are you doing there?

984
01:31:09,473 --> 01:31:13,261
Can't you pay attention when l'm talking?
You're not listening to me.

985
01:31:13,353 --> 01:31:16,072
With the greatest respect,
l heard every word.

986
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:18,587
Would you be kind enough
to tell me what l said?

987
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:22,188
- You were talking about the closet.
- Well, yes?

988
01:31:22,273 --> 01:31:25,743
You said that when the door was opened
Maria received a bump on the head

989
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:29,064
and from that that you inferred
that someone was hiding...

990
01:31:29,153 --> 01:31:31,906
She received a beump on...
And listen, monsieur.

991
01:31:31,993 --> 01:31:36,908
Next time l may test you without warning
so pay attention at all times.

992
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:40,224
- Yes, monsieur.
- Now then.

993
01:31:40,313 --> 01:31:45,785
Whoever was in that closet opened
the door and knocked Maria unconscious.

994
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:50,230
Whoever the man was that was in that
closet had a reason to be in that closet.

995
01:31:50,313 --> 01:31:55,512
- How do you know it was a man?
- Because we found his fingerprints.

996
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:59,302
And... they were your fingerprints.

997
01:31:59,393 --> 01:32:02,112
It's my house.
I've often been in that closet.

998
01:32:02,193 --> 01:32:04,502
- For what reason?
- Last time it was moths.

999
01:32:04,593 --> 01:32:05,742
Meuths?

1000
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,471
- Moths.
- Yes, meuths.

1001
01:32:07,553 --> 01:32:09,828
Maria was complaining of meuths.

1002
01:32:09,913 --> 01:32:11,471
Meuths?

1003
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,909
Is that right, that you were
complaining about these meuths?

1004
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:17,348
Yes, l did complain about moths.

1005
01:32:17,433 --> 01:32:22,461
Oh, you mean meuths. Yes, the flying
meuths, you mean. Yes, of course.

1006
01:32:22,553 --> 01:32:26,592
No, but what l do not understand is
that in a household of this size,

1007
01:32:26,673 --> 01:32:29,904
the question of meuths is brought
to the attention of M Ballon,

1008
01:32:29,993 --> 01:32:33,110
not one of the servants
or the local meuth exterminator.

1009
01:32:33,193 --> 01:32:35,468
However, we will pass over that,

1010
01:32:35,553 --> 01:32:42,153
and we will continue to concentrate
on another type of local exterminator.

1011
01:33:08,394 --> 01:33:12,706
212, 213, 214...

1012
01:33:13,394 --> 01:33:16,909
Maria Gambrelli, even though
she now realises it was a mistake,

1013
01:33:16,994 --> 01:33:21,272
is not a sort of a woman to have an affair
with a man and then expose him.

1014
01:33:21,354 --> 01:33:25,984
And we cannot condemn her, because
she does not believe this man was a killer.

1015
01:33:26,074 --> 01:33:28,508
But this man was not only a killer.

1016
01:33:28,594 --> 01:33:30,425
He was an unprincipled villain

1017
01:33:30,514 --> 01:33:34,712
who would rather see Maria go to the
guillotine than lose her to another man.

1018
01:33:34,794 --> 01:33:38,548
He was hiding in the closet when she
came into the room with the Spaniard.

1019
01:33:38,634 --> 01:33:41,865
He shot the Spaniard,
and put the gun in Maria's hand.

1020
01:33:41,954 --> 01:33:46,311
- You don't know what you're on about.
- Benjamin. Shut up.

1021
01:33:46,394 --> 01:33:49,989
- You have something to say, M Ballon?
- He has nothing to say.

1022
01:33:50,074 --> 01:33:52,463
No, but she has. Why don't you ask her?

1023
01:33:52,554 --> 01:33:54,590
How dare you.

1024
01:33:54,674 --> 01:33:57,029
- She was sleeping with my husband.
- Liar!

1025
01:33:57,114 --> 01:33:59,912
Your husband was having
an affair with my wife.

1026
01:33:59,994 --> 01:34:01,586
- Liar!
- Thank you.

1027
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:03,983
- And what about you and Simone?
- Oh, no!

1028
01:34:04,074 --> 01:34:06,747
- And you and Georges?
- You killed him.

1029
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:10,873
- I saw you go to the greenhouse.
- He's crazy. Why should l kill Georges?

1030
01:34:10,954 --> 01:34:13,309
- You were having an affair.
- Kill him for that?

1031
01:34:13,394 --> 01:34:15,988
No, because you knew
he was carrying on with Madame.

1032
01:34:16,074 --> 01:34:17,746
- I saw you kill Dudu.
- Liar.

1033
01:34:17,834 --> 01:34:20,587
- I saw you.
- It's insane. Why should l kill Dudu?

1034
01:34:20,674 --> 01:34:24,873
Because you discovered...
that she was having an affair with Pierre.

1035
01:34:24,955 --> 01:34:26,434
- Not true.
- She told me.

1036
01:34:26,515 --> 01:34:29,951
Of course, because you and Dudu
were blackmailing Madame.

1037
01:34:30,035 --> 01:34:33,152
- You liar!
- She said she saw Madame kill Miguel.

1038
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:35,146
- Shut up!
- That's not possible.

1039
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:38,910
Georges saw M Ballon climb out
of Maria's window after the shooting.

1040
01:34:38,995 --> 01:34:41,589
I didn't kill him. I was the one in the closet.

1041
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:44,872
My wife expected to find me with Maria
and shot Miguel by accident.

1042
01:34:44,955 --> 01:34:48,470
- I put the gun in Maria's hand.
- I arrest you for putting the gun there.

1043
01:34:48,555 --> 01:34:51,786
- Keep out of this.
- You self-righteous hypocrite.

1044
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,308
- What about Henri?
- What?

1045
01:34:53,395 --> 01:34:55,386
- You killed him.
- Why should l?

1046
01:34:55,475 --> 01:34:57,272
- I arrest you.
- Shut up!

1047
01:34:57,355 --> 01:34:59,585
I saw you drag his body into Maria's room.

1048
01:34:59,675 --> 01:35:01,074
- It was you.
- Yes.

1049
01:35:01,155 --> 01:35:03,953
(Ballon) Why should l kill Henri?

1050
01:35:12,435 --> 01:35:15,950
298, 299.

1051
01:35:17,035 --> 01:35:19,265
(woman screams)

1052
01:35:19,355 --> 01:35:22,153
(Clouseau) Hercule, turn on the lights.

1053
01:35:28,035 --> 01:35:30,629
Let me in, Benjamin. Ow!

1054
01:35:32,675 --> 01:35:34,108
No!

1055
01:35:35,835 --> 01:35:38,793
No! Stop! Come back, you fools!

1056
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:39,864
Come back!

1057
01:35:39,955 --> 01:35:41,024
Clouseau!

1058
01:35:41,115 --> 01:35:42,753
- Stop them. Stop them!
- What?

1059
01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:44,632
- The bomb!
- The what?

1060
01:35:44,715 --> 01:35:46,307
(explosion)

1061
01:35:47,715 --> 01:35:49,706
A bomb?

1062
01:35:51,195 --> 01:35:55,268
- It was meant for you.
- What do you mean it was meant for me?

1063
01:35:55,355 --> 01:35:57,789
The doorman, the two customers
and the Cossack,

1064
01:35:57,875 --> 01:36:00,992
and now, six more innocent people.

1065
01:36:01,075 --> 01:36:04,385
They were all murderers
except Maurice who was a blackmailer.

1066
01:36:04,475 --> 01:36:08,866
- Compared with you they were all saints.
- Commissioner, what are you doing?

1067
01:36:08,955 --> 01:36:11,230
- I hate you, Clouseau.
- Commissioner.

1068
01:36:11,315 --> 01:36:14,752
- I hate you.
- What are you doing to me? Let go of me.

1069
01:36:14,836 --> 01:36:19,114
- (Commissionergrowls)
- Let... Commissioner, let go of my leg.

1070
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:21,915
Hercule! Get him off me.

1071
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:24,385
- Commissioner.
- Commissioner.

1072
01:36:26,436 --> 01:36:29,826
- (Commissionergrowls)
- Argh, Commissioner!

1073
01:36:43,436 --> 01:36:45,028
Jacques.

1074
01:36:46,396 --> 01:36:49,194
Jacques? Are you all right?

1075
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:53,594
It's all over now, darling.

1076
01:36:53,676 --> 01:36:55,667
You're free.

1077
01:37:03,676 --> 01:37:05,667
Argh!

1078
01:37:05,756 --> 01:37:08,634
- (Maria screams)
- (Clouseau) Whoa!
