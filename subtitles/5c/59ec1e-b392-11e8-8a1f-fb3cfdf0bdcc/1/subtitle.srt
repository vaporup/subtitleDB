1
00:00:56,637 --> 00:01:01,506
The King rules heaven

2
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,675
The devil rules hell

3
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:14,016
Between the two there is White Lotus

4
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:19,759
Keeping our country safe

5
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:31,297
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

6
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:34,302
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

7
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:38,807
Welcome Priest Gao Kung
from the South Heaven Gate.

8
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,213
Green Dragon on the left.

9
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:41,977
White Tiger on the right.

10
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,115
On September the first, 1895

11
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:51,218
I became a disciple
of the White Lotus Goddess.

12
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,483
I speak these words before the heavens

13
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:56,989
to show my powers
and spread my word to the people.

14
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:03,167
Mystical powers protect me!

15
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,235
Impervious to water and fire!

16
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,668
Goddess, lend me your powers!

17
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:44,143
Welcome spiritual master, Gao Kung.

18
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:58,691
Goddess, make me as strong as iron -

19
00:02:58,893 --> 00:02:59,882
fearless before blade or sword.

20
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,959
Stabbing and slicing have no effect.

21
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:04,426
I'm fearless before cannons or gunshot!

22
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,264
49 levels of transformation!

23
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,538
Holy Army under my command!

24
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,604
My bones are like pillars
supporting the sky!

25
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:20,843
The fierce flames are like dust to me!

26
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,208
Unlimited mystical powers
at my disposal!

27
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,715
The White Lotus Sect...
eradicates evil!

28
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:06,085
A thousand knives are deflected.

29
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,061
Regiment Commanders!

30
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:12,524
Mystical power protect me!

31
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:17,701
Cannon fire is as flying sand to me!

32
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,098
Bullets are mere raindrops!

33
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:31,148
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

34
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:33,517
Bring out the objects of evil.

35
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,133
What's this animal? It's so ugly!

36
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,566
It's a Western dog, Master!

37
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:55,805
It has spots, so it is evil

38
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,710
kill it!

39
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:02,208
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

40
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,677
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

41
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,010
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

42
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,652
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

43
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,892
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

44
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:14,923
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

45
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,461
Steady, Master.

46
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,060
He doesn't spill a drop to either side.

47
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:08,868
Good footwork.

48
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,936
13th Aunt, the train is rocking so much

49
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,201
how will we eat?

50
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,106
You're not used to it.

51
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,171
Look, the foreigners are coping fine.

52
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,377
Come and sit here.

53
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:18,709
Now it's much better

54
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,346
this journey used to take all day.

55
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,575
The trees look like they're flying.

56
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:27,878
Whoops...

57
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,519
I feel ill.

58
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,554
What's wrong, Foon? So much talk!

59
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:33,593
Nothing...

60
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,756
My stomach is churning.

61
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,025
You're train sick!

62
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,235
Don't eat or you'll throw up.

63
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:47,904
But I must! There's Western food to eat

64
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,741
right, Master?

65
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,275
We haven't ordered yet.

66
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,848
You don't need to order
your food on the train.

67
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,250
Miss, the soup.

68
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:58,284
Thank you.

69
00:08:58,452 --> 00:08:59,612
It's all been prepared.

70
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:01,746
You mean it's not fresh?

71
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:05,792
Solar eclipse?

72
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,219
Don't be so scared, idiot!

73
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,530
13th Aunt, what's going on?

74
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,330
We're in a tunnel.

75
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:14,501
A tunnel?

76
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,899
The train is strong enough

77
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,763
to go through a mountain?

78
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:23,441
Amazing!

79
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,172
Idiot!

80
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,039
Foon, we're all together now, but

81
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:32,218
don't run off when we get to town.

82
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,152
OK.

83
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,723
There will be a lot of foreigners
at the medical convention.

84
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:38,558
Don't embarrass us.

85
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:39,790
I understand, Master.

86
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,756
So many hands!

87
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,609
Fei-hung, eat the soup while it's hot.

88
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,444
Foon, eat the soup while it's hot.

89
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:06,418
Master, I don't know which hand is mine.

90
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:17,988
I can do it that way.

91
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,234
Have you finished your soup, sir?

92
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,869
I'll finish it later.

93
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,233
Only meat? Where's the rice?

94
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:32,738
Miss, have you finished your soup?

95
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,380
I don't want it.

96
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:38,885
Thank you.

97
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:43,315
Fei-hung, it's a steak,
use your knife and fork.

98
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:44,922
I've seen this before.

99
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:48,622
You're always doing this.

100
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:52,195
What a waste! Don't throw it away.

101
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,099
Sorry, Master.

102
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,128
Concentrate on what you are doing.

103
00:10:59,206 --> 00:10:59,968
Watch me.

104
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,301
Are you OK?

105
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:04,143
I'll clean your face.

106
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,078
Yes, I'm fine. Here's your steak.

107
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,482
Master, don't throw it away!

108
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,413
It's all your fault.

109
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:12,878
Forget it, let's eat.

110
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:25,063
Why are you so quiet?

111
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:30,262
No reason. Why are you so quiet?

112
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:33,806
Oh, no, I can't hold it any more!

113
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:34,872
Foon!

114
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:36,042
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,668
I told you not to eat.

116
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,242
Hold on, we'll be in Canton soon.

117
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:42,415
Really?

118
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,750
Yes.

119
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:46,416
Riding in a train is quite a challenge.

120
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:48,646
Waiter, can you pack this?

121
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:49,589
What did you say?

122
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,779
I just don't want to waste it.

123
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,661
Chicken buns!

124
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,095
Give me a pot of tea.

125
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,660
Old man, you owe me money. Pay up!

126
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,631
If I can't play, I can't pay.

127
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,366
Look, a crowd.
What's on the banners?

128
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:12,636
Support the scholar's proposal!

129
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,338
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

130
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,549
Where is Taiwan?

131
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:20,216
We lost the war and gave it to Japan.

132
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:23,149
Taiwan must be near the sea...

133
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,582
or it wouldn't be called Tai-island.

134
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,690
I don't even know how big it is.

135
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,392
We can't even manage Canton, forget it.

136
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,293
Let's drink.

137
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:35,435
Eat, we'll talk later.

138
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:40,139
We object to Li Hung-chang's
concession to Japan!

139
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:44,606
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

140
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,276
Look at the clothes on that woman!

141
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:48,147
Where?

142
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,179
Over there. The one in the rickshaw.

143
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,577
Come and have a look.

144
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:53,453
She's wearing Western clothes.

145
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:55,821
Those Are Western clothes?

146
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,013
They're so ugly!

147
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:58,891
Sister?

148
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,186
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

149
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,260
Let's do the lottery.

150
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:05,192
Nine is my lucky number.

151
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,229
I don't know how to play.

152
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,268
Support the scholar's proposal!

153
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:12,870
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

154
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:17,942
We object to Li Hung-chang's
concession to Japan!

155
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,536
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

156
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:26,550
Support the scholar's proposal!

157
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,420
Money first, look after your tickets.

158
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,385
Get your ticket and move on.

159
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,749
The next draw will be at dinner time!

160
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:31,157
The lottery!

161
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,993
Roast pork buns!

162
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,698
We're here, sir.
Ten cents, please.

163
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,566
Thank you.

164
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,967
Let's eat. Pulling this rickshaw
will be the death of me.

165
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,468
That's a pretty dress.

166
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:49,574
Can I take a picture?

167
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:50,908
You're not a foreigner. Get her!

168
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:52,078
Get her! Get her!

169
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,514
Go away, you pesky kids!

170
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:57,844
Throwing things at people!

171
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:01,684
No manners!

172
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,549
Foon!
Get lost...

173
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,920
Don't hit the children.

174
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,355
I'm bleeding!

175
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,160
Sister?

176
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,425
Look, you've made trouble again.

177
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:11,764
Master...

178
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,729
Let's go, we'll tell Uncle Gao.

179
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,299
Those kids are so naughty,
throwing things at people.

180
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:20,735
Look at the mess.

181
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,273
Attention, please.

182
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:24,842
White Lotus are meeting
at Telegraph House.

183
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,000
We should all go.

184
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:33,549
Don't leave! Don't forget to pay!

185
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,152
Master Wong, I'm going to have a look.

186
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:38,223
13th Aunt... 13th Aunt!

187
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,689
Foon! Foon!

188
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,322
Hurry! They're about to start!

189
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:45,658
Come on, hurry up!

190
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,233
In the name of the people's army
stand down!

191
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,169
Damned soldiers, working for foreigners!

192
00:14:57,544 --> 00:15:00,411
Stone them!

193
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,178
Get out of the way.

194
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,514
Move!

195
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:11,185
Wind and fire come together...
Kill all foreigners.

196
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:15,359
By driving evil away!
Eradicate all evil!

197
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:22,961
Burn down Telegraph House!

198
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:25,701
Excuse me, please.

199
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,237
Aunt, let's take the photo here.

200
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:28,699
Help me set up the tripod.

201
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:29,998
Over there.

202
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:34,309
Wind and fire come together...

203
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:36,306
It's starting now.

204
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,349
I can't see. I can't take pictures.

205
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:40,214
Get on my shoulders.

206
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:41,254
Get on your shoulders?

207
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,459
OK, keep still.

208
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:52,362
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

209
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,794
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

210
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,592
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

211
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,099
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

212
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,103
Foon, this position is no good.

213
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:04,110
So good.

214
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:10,008
Wind and fire come together.
Kill all foreigners.

215
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,449
White Lotus has come to save you
by driving evil away!

216
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:17,050
What was that?

217
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:23,262
Thank you.

218
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,199
She can make lightning, run away!

219
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:30,997
Arrest that evil spirit!

220
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,740
The top one or the bottom one?

221
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,235
The foreigner on top.

222
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:37,443
Arrest her!

223
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:41,511
Calm down!

224
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,443
She is Chinese,
she's not a foreigner!

225
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:45,380
Have a look.

226
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,648
Look at the way you dress.

227
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,014
It proves you're evil. Arrest her!

228
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:53,089
13th Aunt, run! I'll protect you!

229
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:56,823
My camera!

230
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:01,767
13th Aunt!

231
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:06,399
13th Aunt! Where are you, 13th Aunt?

232
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:11,073
Foon! Help me, Foon!

233
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,042
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

234
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,341
Take her to the temple,
burn her to death!

235
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,240
Put her down!

236
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:24,623
Fei-hung!

237
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:25,958
Who the hell are you

238
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:28,487
to stop me?

239
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:30,324
Tell me your name!

240
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,528
I'm Wong Fei-hung from Fushan.

241
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,100
Fei-hung?!

242
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:35,766
And Leung Foon too!

243
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,566
I hear his kung fu is deadly.

244
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,897
Kick you

245
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,858
kick you... to death!

246
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,191
Leave him alone, pick on someone else.
You'll hurt him.

247
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:08,891
Who else? Where?

248
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,195
Hit them, don't hurt them.

249
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,374
That's enough.

250
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:17,777
Ten-finger punch!

251
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,370
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:22,744
Master.

253
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,680
Are you all right, 13th Aunt?

254
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,820
You came just in time.

255
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,352
What is it? It smells sweet.

256
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,096
It's sleeping powder.

257
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:38,461
Foon! Take care of 13th Aunt.
Master

258
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:39,432
Take care of 13th Aunt.

259
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,599
13th Aunt!

260
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:46,294
Mystical power...

261
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,248
All this trickery and mumbo jumbo and

262
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:57,876
you claim to be acting in God's name!

263
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,786
13th Aunt, wake up! 13th Aunt!

264
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:02,516
13th Aunt! Help her up.

265
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:09,154
Foon, take 13th Aunt back to the inn.

266
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,097
Foon, what are you waiting for?

267
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,769
He's one of Canton's Ten Tigers.
His kung fu is legendary.

268
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:25,606
Get back!

269
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,679
What is he taking?

270
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:33,686
Master Wong, don't! That thing is evil!

271
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,347
Stand back!

272
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,118
Master Wong, can I be your apprentice?

273
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,260
Back! Don't follow me!

274
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:00,809
Fei-hung!

275
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:02,348
You're awake.

276
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:06,649
They covered you in sleeping powder.

277
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,081
Did you carry me back here?

278
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,716
No, Foon did.

279
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,016
Why did he carry me back?

280
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,052
Foon is preparing your medicine.

281
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,799
Take it and rest for two days
and you'll be fine.

282
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,940
Master Wong.

283
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:28,841
Come in.

284
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:30,609
Don't go out alone

285
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,041
this town is in turmoil.

286
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,908
Rest a while, don't worry.

287
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:37,572
Fei-hung, I'm all right.

288
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:40,978
I can still be your interpreter
at the convention tomorrow.

289
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,350
Let's talk about that later.

290
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:45,348
Take your medicine now.

291
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,895
Master Wong, sorry to disturb you.
It's OK.

292
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,928
Oh, you're awake.

293
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:57,796
Did you know...
You carried me back.

294
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:58,699
Yes, I did.

295
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,941
The medicine is very hot, be careful.

296
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:11,509
Mr. Mak, what can I do for you?

297
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:14,151
I sent my servant to buy these clothes.

298
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,055
Please ask her to wear them.

299
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,449
That's very kind of you.

300
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,193
Don't mention it. Mystical kung fu
is very popular now.

301
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:23,385
Foreigners make them mad.

302
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,364
Master Wong, I've known you
for a long time

303
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:27,624
I'll be frank with you.

304
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:29,466
If Miss wears her own clothes

305
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,897
she'll definitely get into trouble.

306
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:33,973
I understand.

307
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:35,765
How much were they?

308
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:36,966
There'll be no charge.

309
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:37,843
Thank you.

310
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,908
Thanks for your help, Master Wong.

311
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,683
Here you can see the 5 main regions
of the brain.

312
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:50,587
According to the result of
a medical study and research

313
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:56,261
we understand the function and the nervous
system of a human body are controlled by the brain...

314
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:59,698
If I knew it would be so boring
I'd have asked So to come.

315
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:03,464
Which believes those function comes from
the heart

316
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:07,268
This is a theory I of course
cannot subscribe to

317
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:11,233
and thus I'm afraid to conclude
my lecture

318
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,576
Thank you for your attention.
And now...

319
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:26,786
I'd like to introduce Dr. Wong Fei Hung,
from Fu Shan Region of Canton

320
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:31,285
There's another one!

321
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:37,330
It's not any of them.
Another foreigner.

322
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:39,999
Dr. Wong, it's your turn.

323
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:41,462
Foon, it's our turn.

324
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,307
I'll let you out.
We'll go together.

325
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:44,176
Please don't, master

326
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:45,969
Thank you. Thank you.

327
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:54,547
My topic of discussion
for today is Chinese acupuncture.

328
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:58,085
I beg your pardon, Dr. Wong.
I don't quite understand.

329
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,620
Louder.

330
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,860
There are 360 pressure points...

331
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:04,689
Dr. Wong, what do the lines represent?

332
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:05,626
Do you want him to speak louder?

333
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,597
That's not what he means.

334
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,328
Dr. Wong, may I interpret for you?

335
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,875
Gentlemen, allow me
to translate for Dr. Wong.

336
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,145
Very good!

337
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,242
May I know your name?

338
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,209
My name is Sun Yat-sen.

339
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:31,482
Dr. Sun, I'm most grateful to you.

340
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:32,680
Don't mention it.
Thank you.

341
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:36,954
The five elements are gold, wood,
water, fire and earth.

342
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:37,993
They form a network.

343
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,595
Acupuncture regulates the nervous system.

344
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:49,505
The human body consists of 5 major organs.
Heart, liver, spleen, lungs & kidneys.

345
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,739
These organs are all connected by nerves

346
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:57,140
and acupuncture can regulate
the human nervous system.

347
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:01,052
Dr. Wong, I'm not quite sure
what your chart exactly means.

348
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:04,189
But in western medical studies,
we call it the nervous system.

349
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:07,655
Allow me to give you
a demonstration of what I mean.

350
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,241
Reflex action.

351
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,001
Dr. Wong, Dr. Thompson

352
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,579
doesn't quite understand.

353
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,476
His demonstration shows the Western
understanding of the nervous system.

354
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:34,516
That's quite simple.

355
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,788
I can use needles to close two nerves

356
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:39,116
so that he can't move his leg.

357
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,825
Master, are you going to stick
those in me?

358
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:00,979
Dr. Sun, ask them

359
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:02,772
to test his reflexes now.

360
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,176
Please try again.

361
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,262
Really amazing!

362
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,536
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

363
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:37,180
Foreigners out, leave us in peace!

364
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:50,962
Master!

365
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:57,066
The White Lotus sect again!

366
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,431
Master! I can't move!

367
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:04,941
I'll be shot!

368
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:06,708
I'm a goner!

369
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:11,016
Master, I've only been stabbed
by you, not them.

370
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,091
Mr. Sun, your bag.

371
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:22,227
Leave it.

372
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:31,630
We're finished here.
Back to the Temple!

373
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:33,763
Are you OK?
I'm fine.

374
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,770
Mr. Sun, here's your bag.

375
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,141
If we get the opportunity

376
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:41,037
let's exchange ideas, shall we?

377
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:43,639
China needs more men like you.

378
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,076
You flatter me.

379
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:46,285
See you soon.

380
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:50,715
The White Lotus Sect is
always making trouble.

381
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:54,182
Master, 13th Aunt must be
still at the inn.

382
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,189
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

383
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:04,536
The White Lotus Sect?

384
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,333
Come out!

385
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:10,542
Fei-hung!

386
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,308
Master, what's the matter?

387
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:17,245
Nothing, come on, out.

388
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,208
Master, you look pale

389
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:21,182
something must have happened.

390
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:22,586
It's just a woman changing.

391
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,890
Mind your own business!

392
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:26,755
But you saw it.

393
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:49,671
Don't ask me about the past.

394
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:54,114
I'm so sad and lonely.

395
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:04,618
My future looks bleak and poor.

396
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:14,566
Tears flow when I think of the past.

397
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:23,739
I always wanted to be a soldier.

398
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:34,149
But I was raised in Confucianism.

399
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:43,395
So I lost my dream...

400
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:52,273
And missed my destiny.

401
00:28:52,411 --> 00:29:00,944
I lost my idealism.

402
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:09,085
The winter wind blows...

403
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:16,794
Even the wild geese don't stop.

404
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:23,898
For I have no message
for them to take home.

405
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:31,278
My tears show the reflection of dawn.

406
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:38,185
We are hopelessly in love.

407
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:45,661
Worlds apart, the sky is near.

408
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:53,465
I'll spend the rest of my days alone.

409
00:29:53,572 --> 00:30:14,882
Wandering from place to place till I die.

410
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,391
What a terrible noise!

411
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:17,989
Tell him to stop.

412
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:19,129
Here!

413
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,891
Thank you, thank you...

414
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:26,972
Sir.

415
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,471
Telegraph House is our only contact
with the outside world.

416
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,135
Protect it.

417
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,044
Yes, sir.

418
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:34,946
Sir.

419
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:47,622
There are a lot of bystanders

420
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,021
take care not to hit them.

421
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,462
Drive the White Lotus towards the gate.

422
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:52,397
Yes, sir.

423
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,934
Sir, if this continues

424
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:58,632
we will be outnumbered.

425
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,700
Burn down Telegraph House.

426
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:07,274
Master...

427
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:10,310
Dinner time!

428
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,318
I got a nice treat
to help 13th Aunt get well.

429
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:17,585
It is delicious.

430
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,586
Yes, it is.

431
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:20,588
What is it?

432
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,489
Foon, haven't you told 13th Aunt
what this is?

433
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:26,492
Don't you know?

434
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,973
13th Aunt, do you like dogs?

435
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:40,138
They're man's best friend.
I like them more than cats, anyway.

436
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:42,314
What's the matter?

437
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:46,050
Nothing. Let's eat.

438
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:49,318
People like dogs in different ways.

439
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:54,888
They went that way.

440
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:55,794
Let's go over there and take a look.

441
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:00,894
Canton is in chaos.

442
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,295
Foon, pack our things after dinner.

443
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:04,930
We'll go to the station early tomorrow.

444
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:07,396
Take 13th Aunt back to Fushan.

445
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:08,707
OK.

446
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:10,330
You'd better eat well tonight

447
00:32:10,676 --> 00:32:14,806
you don't want to be sick on the train.

448
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,742
Come outside when you've finished
the dog meat

449
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:21,817
I'd like a word.

450
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,821
You'd like a word with me?

451
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,323
What did you say? This is dog meat?

452
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:30,720
Is it really?

453
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,330
Yes.

454
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:34,996
Yes, Master loves dogs.

455
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:54,142
13th Aunt, I want to teach you kung fu.

456
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,479
Me? Why?

457
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:57,455
These are troubled times.

458
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,256
You could use it for self-defence.

459
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,488
The basic technique has 36 stances.

460
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:06,628
The advanced has 72 stances.

461
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:08,900
There are 108 pressure points...

462
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:09,801
Fei-hung!

463
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,035
Do I need to remember all this?

464
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,498
No, just listen
and try to get the basics.

465
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:19,308
Remember, for punches,
attack from the side.

466
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,013
For kicks, come from below.

467
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:26,713
What if someone has a knife?

468
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:28,852
I'll teach you that another time.

469
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:35,719
Look, this is the single,
this is the double.

470
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,655
Such effort! Why don't I use a gun?

471
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:39,763
Shut up!

472
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:46,628
I was a bit rude.

473
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,204
That's how I speak to my students.

474
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,440
I'm fine, let's continue.

475
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:55,573
OK.

476
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:57,248
The first move.

477
00:33:59,051 --> 00:33:59,847
Go for my head.

478
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:04,151
Pay attention.

479
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,651
Grab the hand, crouch down, then twist.

480
00:34:07,226 --> 00:34:09,160
Grab the hand, crouch down...

481
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:10,028
then twist.

482
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,361
Then twist.

483
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:12,263
Let's try again.

484
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,232
Grab the hand, crouch down, then twist.

485
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,126
The second move, throat lock.

486
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:21,135
Come on, attack my throat, harder.

487
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,940
Grab the hand, crouch down, elbow up.

488
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:07,519
13th Aunt?

489
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:11,084
Be careful!

490
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:13,792
Why aren't you concentrating?

491
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,256
I was practising in my head.

492
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:20,765
Try it once more.

493
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,666
The first move, grab the head.

494
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:24,800
What's next?

495
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:29,941
Then punch!

496
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:33,445
Are you OK?

497
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,135
I'm OK, it's better to be your friend

498
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:36,939
than your enemy.

499
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,808
Sir, we've received a telegram
from Hong Kong.

500
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,543
We've no time for that now.

501
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:48,683
It says someone's planning
a rebellion here.

502
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:51,557
Here's the message.

503
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,832
Sir, it's another telegram
from Hong Kong.

504
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:07,067
This is serious,
guard Telegraph House well.

505
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:09,975
I'll inform the Governor.

506
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:10,882
Yes, sir.

507
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,410
This way please!

508
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,287
Please go inside.

509
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:57,691
Your Excellency.

510
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,860
The British consul invited me here

511
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,032
can't this wait?

512
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,801
Our spies in Hong Kong

513
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,832
cabled us twice today.

514
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:08,865
The Chiu Chow Society are planning

515
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,531
to smuggle weapons to Canton.

516
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:11,504
They want to start a revolution.

517
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:13,711
A revolution?

518
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:14,776
Is it the White Lotus Sect?

519
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:15,947
No.

520
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:19,709
Their leader is called Sun Yat-sen.

521
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:23,479
Sun Yat-sen?

522
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:26,315
Officer, who is this Sun Yat-sen?

523
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,088
Your Excellency

524
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:30,222
He's the one who started

525
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:31,953
the Agricultural Society.

526
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,797
He's a doctor,
he's always giving speeches

527
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,799
and criticising the Government.

528
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,004
He encourages democracy too.

529
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,298
He says China should be a republic.

530
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,738
How can a doctor rebel?

531
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:45,567
Do we not have enough men?

532
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,137
White Lotus has been
causing trouble recently

533
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:49,675
so we're under-manned.

534
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,483
The Government is having trouble

535
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,413
with the French in the north.

536
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,219
I think there'll be war soon.

537
00:37:56,488 --> 00:37:58,752
It won't be easy to get reinforcements.

538
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:05,025
The British are our allies

539
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,026
they'll help keep the other
foreigners at bay.

540
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:18,899
Put the army and navy on alert

541
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:21,711
and extra men at ports and stations
till we find Sun Yat-sen.

542
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:24,449
What was That society?

543
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,215
The Agricultural Society.

544
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,746
Who else is involved with Sun Yat-sen?

545
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:32,248
Someone called Luke Ho-dung
is the money man.

546
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:39,388
Sir, should we bring him in
for questioning?

547
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:42,459
Yes, let's bring him in.

548
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:43,334
Yes, sir.

549
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:49,474
Sir?

550
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:50,308
I'm not going.

551
00:38:52,177 --> 00:38:54,042
A busy night tonight.

552
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,880
Indeed.

553
00:38:58,717 --> 00:38:59,417
Sir.

554
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,430
Chow, tell Snake to get up

555
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,499
it's not his day off!

556
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:23,064
Did you spend all night
at the brothel? Get up!

557
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:23,975
Hurry!

558
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:25,174
Be careful, 13th Aunt.

559
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:26,444
Take it easy.

560
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:28,513
Foon, what are you doing?

561
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:30,908
She twisted her ankle.

562
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,218
How come? I only showed you

563
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:35,714
hand movements. What happened?

564
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,614
I don't know,
it was just hurting when I got up.

565
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,589
Foon insisted on carrying me
when he found out.

566
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:46,359
Foon!

567
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:47,828
I don't mind, Master.

568
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,262
Well, let me carry her,
you take the luggage.

569
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,638
It hurts.

570
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:05,940
I always do the carrying.

571
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:08,709
Now you want to get involved.

572
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,890
Waiter!

573
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:16,894
May I help you?

574
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:18,459
We'd like to check out.

575
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,489
Boss.

576
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:26,159
Master Wong?
We Are leaving now.

577
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,904
Oh, thank God!

578
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,870
No, no, I mean have a safe journey.

579
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:32,406
Sorry for the trouble.

580
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:33,344
If you're ever...

581
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:34,245
Fei-hung, look

582
00:40:34,646 --> 00:40:35,476
what's going on?

583
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:37,579
He is badly hurt.

584
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:38,516
Hey, what's going on?

585
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:40,951
The White Lotus have burned down
Friendship Hall.

586
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:41,982
Take him to see the doctor.

587
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,710
What's Friendship Hall?

588
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,081
It's where they teach foreign languages.

589
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:47,157
It's full of students.

590
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:49,255
Mr. Mak, where's the school?

591
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,027
Near the fruit market.

592
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,523
Don't go there!

593
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:53,493
13th Aunt!

594
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:54,791
Master, where's she going?

595
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:55,728
Foon, you lied to me

596
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:56,764
she's OK.

597
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:59,269
It was her idea, Master.

598
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:00,663
Wait for me.

599
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:04,438
Friendship Hall. Is this it?

600
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:14,912
Master! Wait for me!

601
00:41:32,404 --> 00:41:33,104
What is it?

602
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:34,169
Skin.

603
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,238
It's human skin.

604
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:55,693
Master.

605
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:57,024
It's the younger students.

606
00:41:58,296 --> 00:41:59,388
It's lucky they were hiding.

607
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:05,837
What's happening?

608
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,269
Let's go and have a look.

609
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,039
What's going on in there?

610
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,841
They've gone now.
Don't worry. Be good.

611
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,510
I'm scared.

612
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,112
They stormed in and kicked us.

613
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:21,148
Master Wong! Why are you still here?

614
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,247
Are these children with you?

615
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:24,752
They are students
from the Friendship Hall.

616
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,389
We just needed a rest.

617
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:27,580
They can't stay here!

618
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:29,020
If White Lotus comes

619
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:30,626
I'm finished!

620
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:32,491
I don't know them, even worse

621
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:33,786
they study foreign languages.

622
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,359
Take them to the courthouse.

623
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,496
Can't we rest for a moment?

624
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:40,227
I don't know how to fight.

625
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:41,105
This inn is all I have.

626
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:42,696
I have to support my family.

627
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:44,000
If it's burnt down, I'll...

628
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:45,541
I'll help!

629
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:46,943
Mr. Mak!

630
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,540
He's fainted...

631
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:50,476
Have you got some salts?

632
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,313
You've made him faint.
Who do you think you are?

633
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:57,647
If he dies, I'll call the police.

634
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:58,517
Then I'll back off.

635
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,125
Foon, 13th Aunt, let's go.

636
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,724
Let's send them home.

637
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,195
Where do you live?

638
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:08,626
I'm from Kwangsi Province.

639
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:09,798
I'm also from Kwangsi.

640
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,532
I'm from Fukien Province.

641
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,762
He's from Chuijao

642
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:16,841
they're from Kwangsi.

643
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,976
I guess the rest
are not from here, either.

644
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,436
Do any of you live here?

645
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:26,014
Miss, I live by the north gate,
so does he.

646
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,611
I live in Sha Min.

647
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,412
I think I live near the east gate.

648
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,616
Anybody else?

649
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:39,086
I came here on the train,
I've no idea where did I come from.

650
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:41,059
I stay at school all the time.

651
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,427
We'll take these two home.
The rest come with us.

652
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:46,935
I'll carry you.

653
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,836
Foon! Order some chicken rice

654
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:50,769
for our journey.

655
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,738
Waiter, 20 portions of chicken rice!

656
00:43:54,012 --> 00:43:55,912
Come on, you too.

657
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,726
Sir... what can I do for you?

658
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:16,560
I'd like to know if the children from

659
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:18,292
Friendship Hall came here earlier?

660
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:22,639
Students? No, no, you've come
to the wrong place.

661
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:23,603
Boss

662
00:44:27,846 --> 00:44:29,541
Have any of you seen the students?

663
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:32,181
There are no students here, you fool!

664
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,349
Maybe the boogie man's got them.

665
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:43,755
The King rules heaven
The devil rules hell...

666
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:45,556
It's lucky
the students are gone.

667
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:55,205
Between the two there is White Lotus
Keeping our country safe

668
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:56,374
Lucky tokens!

669
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:57,871
I want one.

670
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,606
The hanging lantern will keep you safe.

671
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:04,108
Lucky tokens will protect your family!

672
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:06,780
Light the lanterns.
Here's the offering.

673
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:11,551
Lucky tokens will protect your family!

674
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:15,053
This will keep you safe.

675
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:17,288
Of course, of course.

676
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:20,322
Give more offerings
to ensure your safety.

677
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:45,716
Finish up in there. We have to leave.

678
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:49,589
Be quiet.

679
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,626
What happened to your hands?

680
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,428
It's not my blood, it's his.
It's everywhere.

681
00:45:58,503 --> 00:46:01,495
Will he die? He's badly injured.
We can't stay here.

682
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,207
I'll go to the courthouse to see

683
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:04,567
if they'll take them.

684
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:06,138
Stay here.

685
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,780
Foon!

686
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:11,113
Help me bandage the poor kid.

687
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,148
I haven't finished yet.

688
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,144
Don't be naughty. Come back here.

689
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:19,721
I just wanted to know
where he was going.

690
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:22,324
Foon, you stink.

691
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,319
You peed on me!

692
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,088
I told you I wasn't done yet.

693
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,915
Sir, Wong Fei-hung
would like to see you.

694
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:19,176
Sir!

695
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:06,357
Sir.

696
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:24,999
Master Wong, now I see why
you're so famous.

697
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:26,274
Thank you. Thank you.

698
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:27,177
It was nothing, sir.

699
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,411
I just wanted to spar with you a little.

700
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:33,443
Master Wong, your Shaolin staff
is excellent.

701
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:36,881
Maybe you can teach me some other time.

702
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:38,222
Have some wine.

703
00:49:39,257 --> 00:49:39,957
Thank you.

704
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:46,955
His Shaolin staff isn't that good.

705
00:49:47,432 --> 00:49:49,059
He hit that pole,
but it didn't even move.

706
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,066
People say he is the master of kung fu

707
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:52,759
I don't think it is true.

708
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:01,578
All our troops are busy
protecting foreigners.

709
00:50:02,013 --> 00:50:03,947
It may not be that safe here either.

710
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:05,844
If the students come here

711
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:08,650
the White Lotus will come
to cause trouble.

712
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:09,586
Sir.

713
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:12,715
I know it's my job to protect the people.

714
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:14,615
The trouble is even though I can fight

715
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:18,421
I don't have the men to support me.

716
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:21,731
I'm deeply ashamed.

717
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:33,177
Foon!

718
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:34,611
Come over here.

719
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:35,612
Stay out of the way.

720
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,473
Stay out of the way.

721
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:40,351
He is still bleeding.

722
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,445
Master isn't back yet.
What shall we do?

723
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:44,655
He's not moving.

724
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:46,253
Why isn't he moving?

725
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:51,124
It's Mozart.

726
00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:53,019
What do you mean?

727
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:55,791
Listen. Can't you hear
the foreign music?

728
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:58,433
There must be a foreign consulate nearby.

729
00:50:59,070 --> 00:50:59,770
A consulate?

730
00:51:06,244 --> 00:51:13,480
Beware of fire!
Beware of thieves!

731
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:15,819
13th Aunt, Foon!

732
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:18,313
I need to pee.

733
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:19,848
Wait until you're home.

734
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:21,786
It's bad for my kidneys.

735
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:23,755
So? They're rotten anyway.

736
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:24,595
Don't move!

737
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:26,130
Stay there!

738
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:33,266
Where has the sect taken
the woman and children?

739
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,734
We aren't with White Lotus.

740
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:37,697
My children are in bed now.

741
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:38,898
My woman has run off...

742
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,202
What?
Master.

743
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,407
Foon, where did you go?

744
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:46,843
13th Aunt took the children
to a safe place.

745
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:48,285
Really?

746
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:51,020
Why are you holding

747
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:52,751
a White Lotus lantern?

748
00:51:53,224 --> 00:51:55,249
To bring us good luck.

749
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,858
But it doesn't seem to have worked.
May I Go now?

750
00:51:58,062 --> 00:52:00,496
Yes!

751
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:01,890
Come on, hurry.

752
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,132
Foon, let's go.

753
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:07,534
Don't you remember me?

754
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:09,535
I came with the children...

755
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,942
and a beautiful lady.

756
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:15,111
I only left to find my master.

757
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:16,146
I don't understand you.

758
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:17,712
Go away!

759
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:18,816
Nonsense!

760
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:22,451
Foon, did 13th Aunt bring
the children here?

761
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:25,121
Yes, he let us in before,
but now he won't.

762
00:52:26,257 --> 00:52:31,957
13th Aunt... I've come with Master!
13th Aunt...

763
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:34,654
Shut up!

764
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,360
Did he ask us to stand up straight?

765
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:37,596
That's what I heard.

766
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:39,536
13th Aunt?

767
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:42,665
13th Aunt,
we are waiting at the entrance.

768
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:44,269
Open the gate, go away.

769
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:45,709
13th Aunt...

770
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:47,401
Master, they're opening the gate.

771
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:49,179
Go away now!

772
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:50,678
How dare you!

773
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,509
Foon, stay calm.

774
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,910
Hands up! Surrender now.

775
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:55,780
Don't hit me!

776
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,884
Tell them why we're here.

777
00:52:57,054 --> 00:52:58,749
I have!
Put your guns down.

778
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,582
They don't understand.

779
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:01,725
Stop!

780
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:02,593
Stop pointing that at me!

781
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:03,819
Stop!

782
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:05,561
Wait!

783
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:08,124
Allow me to clear up the confusion.

784
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:10,429
Alright.

785
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:14,194
Pardon me. My name is
Luke Ho-dung, and yours?

786
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:15,871
I'm Wong Fei-hung from Fushan.

787
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:18,472
Wong Fei-hung?

788
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:20,140
You saved the children!

789
00:53:20,378 --> 00:53:21,777
Yes, they're all inside

790
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:23,443
but the soldiers won't let us in.

791
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:24,848
It's only a mistake.

792
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:25,907
What are you looking?
Stand back.

793
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,208
This Jesus is agony.

794
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:26,710
Luke.

795
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:32,538
Why do foreigners believe in a god
whose face has so much suffering?

796
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,420
Everyone has a god in their heart.

797
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:40,513
When we're young
we believe in one god

798
00:54:40,558 --> 00:54:42,082
when we're older
we believe in another.

799
00:54:44,528 --> 00:54:47,964
Finally we realise all beliefs
are just lies.

800
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,592
Why are you always
looking at your watch?

801
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:51,535
Are you expecting someone?

802
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:55,362
A bad habit I picked up from a friend.

803
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:56,935
He says time is valuable.

804
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:59,869
We Chinese waste a lot of time.

805
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:02,675
What a shame.

806
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,709
I still can't read foreign numbers!

807
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:06,479
I'll never keep good time.

808
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:09,953
What is happening?

809
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:12,923
Reporting Sir, the wounded
are flooding into the embassy.

810
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:19,622
Don't worry, let the wounded in first.
We will take care of everyone.

811
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:25,526
Stay where you are.

812
00:55:32,443 --> 00:55:35,105
Don't be afraid.

813
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:37,677
Foon, take them upstairs.

814
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:43,417
They're foreign merchants
and their families.

815
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:44,951
They've been attacked by White Lotus

816
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,680
and have come to seek refuge.

817
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,618
Have they found the doctor yet?

818
00:55:50,828 --> 00:55:51,760
He is on the way.

819
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:53,329
Go and get him now!

820
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:55,029
He is bleeding badly,
what'd we do then?

821
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:56,066
What to do now?

822
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:57,734
Stop the bleeding,
the doctor is on the way!

823
00:55:57,935 --> 00:55:58,731
They need a doctor.

824
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,237
Master is the one they need.

825
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:01,304
Master.

826
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,502
Excuse me, Sir!

827
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:08,104
They're looking for a doctor.

828
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:09,610
They don't want Chinese doctors.

829
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:13,783
We prefer western medicine.

830
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:18,581
They don't want Chinese doctors.

831
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:26,430
Dr. Sun, ask them

832
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:28,098
Mr. Wong.

833
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:30,767
This is...

834
00:56:30,935 --> 00:56:31,635
No need to introduce me. He's the one

835
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:33,737
who's always looking at his watch.

836
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,160
Burn it down!

837
00:57:05,102 --> 00:57:06,865
White Lotus are making trouble again.

838
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:14,478
Mr. Luke.

839
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:19,674
Which one tells the right time?

840
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:22,549
Your watch is fast, Sun.

841
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,855
Mine can't keep up with yours.

842
00:57:25,122 --> 00:57:26,453
Enough of this,
let's check the injured.

843
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,390
OK.

844
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:33,788
Foon, I never thought
time was so important.

845
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:39,394
I didn't think you'd understand.

846
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:45,902
Burn the foreign devils!
Chase them out!

847
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:06,863
13th Aunt?

848
00:58:07,598 --> 00:58:10,032
Oh, no, they must have taken her soul!

849
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:12,065
If they're so clever,
they would have won by now.

850
00:58:12,503 --> 00:58:14,095
They're just trying to scare us.

851
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:15,635
Don't worry

852
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:17,101
just relax.

853
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:21,535
What if she vomits?

854
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:24,948
We're not on the train now.

855
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:32,054
Try to contact Dr. Lee.

856
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:33,018
Yes, sir!

857
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:36,423
I'm afraid
we don't have enough anaesthetic.

858
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:39,592
Then tell me, what do you suggest?

859
00:58:41,465 --> 00:58:44,730
Mr. Luke, ask Wong to come in.

860
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:46,469
Feeling better?

861
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:50,200
Mr Wong, Dr. Sun would like you

862
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,738
to help him.

863
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,310
Where is he?

864
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:54,401
He's in the reception hall.

865
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:56,708
OK, lead the way.

866
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:45,180
He said thank you. He's never seen
anything like this. He's amazed.

867
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:48,790
I'm filled with the utmost admiration
and respect.

868
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,026
He said thank you.

869
01:00:50,294 --> 01:00:51,886
He has never seen anything like this.

870
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:53,996
He said his view was broadened and
he admired and respected that so much.

871
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:55,789
Not at all, saving lives
is what matters.

872
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,265
Doctor Wong says nothing
is more important than saving lives.

873
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:20,890
Be calm! Keep clear of the window!

874
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:22,890
Call for reinforcements!

875
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:23,793
Yes, sir!

876
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:25,695
What's happening?

877
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:27,823
13th Aunt, don't, stay with me.

878
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:29,929
I won't leave you.

879
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:32,535
The children!

880
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,502
Watch out, Dr. Sun. Get down.

881
01:01:50,988 --> 01:01:51,784
Urgent telegram.

882
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:56,124
The Consulate is under attack.
Deploy troops and prepare for evacuation.

883
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:00,594
The army have closed Telegraph House.

884
01:02:01,198 --> 01:02:02,722
We've lost contact with Hong Kong.

885
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,890
Are we still going ahead with our plans?

886
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:06,970
It's too risky.

887
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:09,870
We'd better lay low for now.

888
01:02:13,844 --> 01:02:14,811
Let's split up and tell the others.

889
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:17,208
The telex at the consulate

890
01:02:17,581 --> 01:02:19,515
is the only way we can contact them.

891
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:22,382
Mr. Luke, you know how to send a telex.

892
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,711
Stay here and keep contact
with the outside world.

893
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,086
Sun, I...

894
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:29,088
I've taken care of your family.

895
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,688
I'll go back to the villa now

896
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:32,055
and then go on to the wedding.

897
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:34,428
If you don't get a message from me...

898
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:35,925
take the boat to Hong Kong

899
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:37,998
tomorrow morning.

900
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:42,829
Don't be late.

901
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:44,907
Take my watch with you.

902
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,002
If I fail...

903
01:02:48,846 --> 01:02:50,040
carry on the fight.

904
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:54,248
I will.

905
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,082
Dr. Sun, Are you leaving?

906
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:02,992
I've got something to do.

907
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,425
I'll see you out.

908
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:05,295
Thank you.

909
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:07,964
Stay here.

910
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,766
Be careful, Fei-hung.

911
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,897
The White Lotus Sect will drive

912
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:13,635
the foreigners out!

913
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:17,974
Dr. Sun, ask them

914
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:19,138
how will you get out?

915
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,940
It's easier to save men
than their country.

916
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:28,744
It seems my medical case

917
01:03:29,253 --> 01:03:30,550
and I can't save them all.

918
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:33,887
Move!

919
01:03:34,024 --> 01:03:34,724
Get them out of here!

920
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:40,663
Get out of here! Go!

921
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:43,197
See you later, Master Wong.

922
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:48,967
Sir, we just want
to expel the foreigners.

923
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:51,266
We wouldn't
kill our own people.

924
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:52,799
I'm glad to hear it.

925
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:54,771
Leave the negotiating to us.

926
01:03:55,045 --> 01:03:56,376
If you were so capable

927
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,274
we wouldn't have lost so much land.

928
01:04:04,588 --> 01:04:05,384
If you continue to make trouble

929
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:06,545
I'll arrest you all.

930
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,154
Take the altar away.

931
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:15,662
Yes, sir. General Lan is here, make way.

932
01:04:22,606 --> 01:04:25,632
Why have they all come in?

933
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:27,900
OK, get out of here!

934
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:30,442
You are not permitted to enter,
leave at once.

935
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:35,049
We suspect you are harbouring a criminal.
His name is Sun Yat Sen.

936
01:04:35,252 --> 01:04:37,152
I have an order to arrest him

937
01:04:37,354 --> 01:04:38,480
this is British Territory!

938
01:04:38,689 --> 01:04:40,816
You are now in China! Not in Britain!

939
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:41,982
You shouldn't talk to me like that!

940
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:46,125
I'm sorry, but according to International
law, we are not under your jurisdiction

941
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,660
and you have no right to search
the British Consulate.

942
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:51,667
We do not intend to offend anybody.

943
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:55,228
Please leave!

944
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:56,398
I see Mr. Luke is hiding here as well.

945
01:04:57,274 --> 01:04:59,936
Get off the premises! Commander,
you must leave now!

946
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:01,442
Mr. Luke.

947
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,117
Let's go!
Yes, sir.

948
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:20,823
Sam Fok, cut the wire pole down.

949
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:24,531
I want to stop all communications.

950
01:05:26,303 --> 01:05:30,103
An army without information
is a dead army.

951
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:32,973
As soldiers we are men of the world.

952
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,677
We must do what is best.

953
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:36,579
Sir...

954
01:05:37,414 --> 01:05:39,541
I know. Just follow my orders.

955
01:05:39,783 --> 01:05:40,483
Yes, sir.

956
01:05:42,386 --> 01:05:43,853
This way, Commander.

957
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:51,922
Carry out the General's instructions.

958
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,693
They protect the rebels
because they want to subjugate us.

959
01:05:57,067 --> 01:05:59,535
Pull it up.

960
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:21,815
You may start now.

961
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:32,362
What is going on?

962
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:36,903
Gun fire!
Don't be distracted! Stay alert!

963
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:40,009
Yes!

964
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:41,974
If you are all up for this

965
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:43,774
let's practise some kung fu.

966
01:06:45,816 --> 01:06:48,250
Once you have your stance, don't move.

967
01:06:48,452 --> 01:06:49,578
This is the Hanging Horse.

968
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,586
One move and you're steady as a rock.
This stance brings unlimited power.

969
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:59,722
Perform the Unicorn Move.
Third move...

970
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,558
Hold the head, grab the hand, twist!

971
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:07,560
Watch carefully!
Return to your original position.

972
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,166
And again! Not bad.

973
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:13,907
Hold that stance for two hours.

974
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:17,313
Foon!

975
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:21,448
Hold the head, grab the hand, twist!

976
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:22,951
Grappling Hand?

977
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,717
Yes, I've learned it

978
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,479
but I don't know how to use it.

979
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,558
That's easy. I'll attack
and you counter attack.

980
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,160
Watch.

981
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:40,766
Is it this way?
It doesn't feel right.

982
01:07:41,238 --> 01:07:42,569
Foon, what are you doing?

983
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:44,835
Why are you holding 13th Aunt?

984
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,301
I'm teaching her Grappling Hand.

985
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:49,510
You teach her?

986
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,347
Do you think I can't teach her?

987
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:53,240
It's not right for you to hold 13th Aunt.

988
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,481
Knee bends, now!

989
01:07:58,422 --> 01:07:59,088
Master, I...

990
01:07:59,089 --> 01:07:59,885
Now!

991
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:08,625
Stop looking at me.
Carry on!

992
01:08:12,035 --> 01:08:14,526
I'm going, Master.

993
01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:19,472
What are you doing?

994
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:21,576
The stance.

995
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:23,344
That's not the way!

996
01:08:26,683 --> 01:08:28,708
Fei-hung, don't be angry with Foon

997
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:31,043
I asked him to teach me.

998
01:08:31,688 --> 01:08:32,552
You did?

999
01:08:39,296 --> 01:08:40,661
Why don't you ask him to come back?

1000
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:43,624
Go on, then.

1001
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:50,637
I'm punished for this?

1002
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,842
What would happen if I
taught her the Bear Hug?

1003
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:02,084
These foreigners are really lazy!

1004
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,210
If White Lotus came, you'd be a goner.

1005
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,585
Trying to scare me?

1006
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:54,968
Wait for her to come down.

1007
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:01,642
Mr. Luke.

1008
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:05,271
Have you seen Foon?

1009
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:08,084
The White Lotus Sect?

1010
01:10:08,118 --> 01:10:09,949
Help!

1011
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:18,819
White Lotus is here!

1012
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:29,872
Foreigner evil.

1013
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:43,714
They're here!

1014
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,092
Wind and fire come together...

1015
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:52,955
Kill all foreigners.

1016
01:10:53,163 --> 01:10:54,687
By driving evil away!

1017
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:57,024
Eradicate all evil!

1018
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:59,228
Go and hide and don't come out.

1019
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:00,197
I'll be right back.

1020
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:12,381
Who is that?

1021
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:13,649
Mr. Luke?
Yes.

1022
01:11:44,414 --> 01:11:45,244
Dr. Wong

1023
01:11:49,886 --> 01:11:51,353
Upstairs.

1024
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:52,783
You Go first.

1025
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:29,454
General...

1026
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:30,852
Be quiet.

1027
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:41,994
Now you'll die, you little brats!

1028
01:12:42,839 --> 01:12:43,999
The stance.

1029
01:13:03,126 --> 01:13:03,826
Master!

1030
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,187
Foon, take care of these

1031
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,997
I'll handle the horses.

1032
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,172
Get off!

1033
01:13:39,496 --> 01:13:40,196
Where are you running to?

1034
01:13:49,906 --> 01:13:50,998
Foon, tie them up.

1035
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:52,873
I'll see if there are any left.

1036
01:13:58,248 --> 01:13:58,948
Arrest them, go!

1037
01:13:58,983 --> 01:14:00,006
Yes, sir.

1038
01:14:06,322 --> 01:14:07,380
Arrest the White Lotus.

1039
01:14:07,824 --> 01:14:10,054
I have orders to protect the Consulate.

1040
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,625
You must co-operate with us

1041
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:14,489
let my men through to search
for the rest of the rebels.

1042
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:30,479
Come on, hurry.

1043
01:14:32,615 --> 01:14:33,877
I saw what you did!

1044
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:37,313
I saw you let the rebels go.
This is a conspiracy.

1045
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:39,988
What are you looking at?

1046
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:41,315
They are fighting.

1047
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:45,520
This is China, not Britain.

1048
01:14:46,663 --> 01:14:47,363
Sir.

1049
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:56,130
Fei-hung, General Lan killed the consul!

1050
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:04,980
Don't move!
Search everywhere!

1051
01:15:05,014 --> 01:15:05,714
Yes, sir.

1052
01:15:05,882 --> 01:15:08,077
What are you doing?

1053
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:21,130
Tell Sun to run for his life.

1054
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:28,296
Fei-hung, I know you look on me
as your aunt...

1055
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,908
but you're the one for me in my heart.

1056
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:40,009
If we lose each other...

1057
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,981
come and find me.

1058
01:15:52,395 --> 01:15:53,123
It's time to go.

1059
01:16:08,144 --> 01:16:09,702
Whatever happens,
we must survive this night...

1060
01:16:11,214 --> 01:16:15,480
so that future generations can see
a new dawn

1061
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:17,575
do you understand?

1062
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:24,554
Foon, you pretend to be Mr. Luke

1063
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:28,891
and distract the soldiers. If you can,
find the name-book in the market for Mr. Luke.

1064
01:16:29,132 --> 01:16:29,797
I will.

1065
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,732
Leung Foon, take this watch.

1066
01:16:32,168 --> 01:16:34,329
Meet me at the pier at seven am.

1067
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:37,572
It's down to you now.

1068
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:51,453
Siu-qun.

1069
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:55,215
You said my name!

1070
01:16:56,526 --> 01:16:58,187
It's the first time you've done that.

1071
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:18,914
Who are you?

1072
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:21,378
I'm the interpreter
from the consulate, sir.

1073
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:24,019
Go on, then.

1074
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:30,390
Foon, go now.

1075
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,769
Mr. Luke.

1076
01:17:42,272 --> 01:17:43,296
Mr. Luke?!

1077
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:44,768
After him!

1078
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:50,277
General.

1079
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:51,347
Wong Fei-hung?

1080
01:17:51,614 --> 01:17:54,412
Sir, I want to destroy their leader.

1081
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:55,818
That way I destroy the whole sect.

1082
01:17:56,052 --> 01:17:57,110
To destroy it from the root!

1083
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,287
And who's that?

1084
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:01,215
Foon! Take care of 13th Aunt.
Master

1085
01:18:01,391 --> 01:18:02,722
come and meet the General.
Sir.

1086
01:18:03,326 --> 01:18:04,759
He was injured by the White Lotus.

1087
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:07,722
Sir, we can't predict what might happen.

1088
01:18:08,231 --> 01:18:11,826
Please take care of the children.

1089
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:16,330
OK, I promise you.

1090
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,933
Escort Master Wong to the temple.

1091
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:20,809
Yes, sir.

1092
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:52,032
White Lotus, I want to join you.

1093
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:59,810
The White Lotus sect welcomes you,
our guests.

1094
01:19:05,188 --> 01:19:06,917
Master Wong, there are so many soldiers

1095
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:07,986
how can we escape?

1096
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:09,923
The temple is so big

1097
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:12,025
we can just disappear.

1098
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:12,961
I'm sure we can get out.

1099
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:17,164
Under the incense,
long live the White Lotus sect.

1100
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:18,534
Is it safe in there?

1101
01:19:19,602 --> 01:19:21,661
Don't worry, just relax.

1102
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:26,635
Anyway, we can't go back now.

1103
01:19:26,843 --> 01:19:27,935
Let's go in, then.

1104
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:36,481
The Goddess comes to save all people.

1105
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:38,948
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

1106
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:42,282
Our sect brings peace to the world.

1107
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:44,059
Prepare for our initiates.

1108
01:19:44,494 --> 01:19:46,928
Kneel!

1109
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:52,562
Wong Fei-hung, Leung Foon,
come to the altar.

1110
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:02,272
Come forward to be purified.

1111
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,675
Let the ceremony begin.

1112
01:20:13,656 --> 01:20:15,681
Swallow the lucky token,
become a child of the sect.

1113
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:17,992
We are all brothers.

1114
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:20,622
We share a common bond -

1115
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,521
for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer -

1116
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:26,130
all are equal.

1117
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:32,263
Drink this
and you'll be a member forever.

1118
01:20:32,575 --> 01:20:35,942
May lightning strike down
all those who betray us.

1119
01:20:36,612 --> 01:20:37,510
Master!

1120
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:40,079
Be loyal before God. Drink it!

1121
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:54,753
Goddess, lend me your powers!

1122
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:57,090
Protected by God,
nothing can harm me -

1123
01:20:58,468 --> 01:20:59,901
A thousand knives are deflected.

1124
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:02,696
A million blades are deflected.

1125
01:21:04,474 --> 01:21:06,704
Protected by God,
nothing can harm me -

1126
01:21:09,712 --> 01:21:12,112
Nothing can penetrate!

1127
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:14,009
Master Wong!

1128
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:16,683
You're despicable.

1129
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:19,321
Take back your evil water.

1130
01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:33,362
Mystical power protect me!

1131
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:36,035
Wong Fei-hung,
how dare you make trouble here!

1132
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:39,639
Priest Gao Kung's name is famous.

1133
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,508
But I need to see him

1134
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:44,776
before joining the sect.

1135
01:21:45,414 --> 01:21:46,676
I need to see him now!

1136
01:21:49,552 --> 01:21:51,918
We won't let you see his righteousness!

1137
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:56,318
You won't?
I'll fight my way in, then!

1138
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:01,296
White Lotus
How dare you!

1139
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:03,122
Leave here.

1140
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:11,163
Surround him!

1141
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:12,840
You'll have to look out for yourself.

1142
01:22:16,812 --> 01:22:18,939
Sky, wind, earth, fire,
eight stances to challenge you!

1143
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,582
Surround him!

1144
01:22:21,784 --> 01:22:23,046
You're all frauds!

1145
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:28,251
That's enough.

1146
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:47,573
God...

1147
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,447
It's all a deception!

1148
01:22:56,519 --> 01:22:59,317
Mystical power protect me!

1149
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:05,323
Gao Kung, why don't you come out?

1150
01:23:08,898 --> 01:23:10,593
This whole thing is a fraud.

1151
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,926
I want to reveal the truth.

1152
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:18,935
Protect the altar!

1153
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:23,668
White Lotus brothers, kill him!

1154
01:23:28,551 --> 01:23:29,916
I'll fight you to the death.

1155
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:47,599
Come and fight me if you dare!

1156
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,396
God will protect us.

1157
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:56,169
Go ahead...

1158
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,347
Stop, or I'll shoot!

1159
01:23:59,548 --> 01:24:00,412
Can't you see this idol

1160
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:02,375
cannot protect you?

1161
01:24:02,718 --> 01:24:03,912
You must stop believing in it.

1162
01:24:04,253 --> 01:24:07,017
You are the one who lies.
Yeah!

1163
01:24:07,323 --> 01:24:07,989
You...

1164
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,718
Mr. Luke

1165
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:11,189
Come this way

1166
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:12,255
and we'll see who doesn't die.

1167
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:13,925
Let me through!

1168
01:24:18,801 --> 01:24:21,099
God will protect me.
Your gun doesn't scare me!

1169
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:28,408
God will protect you!
The body is as strong as iron!

1170
01:24:28,678 --> 01:24:30,976
Little girl, you will lose your life.
Get back!

1171
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,472
Protected by God, nothing can harm us.

1172
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:37,516
Between the two there is White Lotus
Keeping our country safe

1173
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:39,981
Don't be afraid of him!

1174
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:40,956
Come on, hurry.

1175
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,358
I've shot the girl!

1176
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:46,424
Don't worry about that now.

1177
01:24:46,762 --> 01:24:47,462
You first.

1178
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:00,804
Stay there!

1179
01:25:01,444 --> 01:25:02,144
Look at these people.

1180
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:05,005
They're giving up their lives
for this idol.

1181
01:25:05,748 --> 01:25:07,477
Mr. Luke, let's go!

1182
01:25:08,584 --> 01:25:09,744
If they're all like that

1183
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:11,486
how will they ever change?

1184
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:14,586
They know nothing else.

1185
01:25:25,034 --> 01:25:27,867
Surround him!

1186
01:25:28,437 --> 01:25:29,563
There's nowhere to run to.

1187
01:25:31,307 --> 01:25:35,869
We can't escape.
Don't let them get away!

1188
01:25:59,435 --> 01:26:00,732
Beloved God, take over my body.

1189
01:26:03,072 --> 01:26:04,471
God will protect my body giving me

1190
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,571
power to exorcise the evil spirits.

1191
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:18,218
With God in my body,
I'll teach you the true way.

1192
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:23,152
How dare you wake me to come here

1193
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:28,626
you fools!

1194
01:26:28,798 --> 01:26:29,730
Anger the gods and bring them to earth.
I'll teach you!

1195
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,534
Come out, or I'll burn my own altar.

1196
01:26:38,307 --> 01:26:39,706
Gao Kung, the righteous, is here.

1197
01:27:04,066 --> 01:27:06,830
Welcome Priest Gao Kung
from the South Heaven Gate.

1198
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:08,932
The invincible Gao Kung!

1199
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:26,284
The universe is controlled by him!

1200
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:30,748
I became a disciple
of the White Lotus Goddess.

1201
01:27:31,026 --> 01:27:33,290
The Goddess personally taught me.
She instructed me to set up an altar

1202
01:27:33,662 --> 01:27:35,755
to exorcise the evil spirits
and save us from this impure world.

1203
01:27:36,265 --> 01:27:39,393
Come spirit!

1204
01:27:39,869 --> 01:27:43,396
Come, spirit!

1205
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:44,538
Here I come!

1206
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,410
Protect the altar.

1207
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:29,814
Stop.

1208
01:28:39,595 --> 01:28:40,391
Come down here!

1209
01:28:45,434 --> 01:28:46,134
Be gone!

1210
01:28:58,347 --> 01:29:00,941
Trap him! Come on!
Yes, sir!

1211
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,088
Why do you need help?

1212
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,350
I'll do what it takes!

1213
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:21,200
Now!

1214
01:29:25,975 --> 01:29:26,675
Set up the altar.

1215
01:29:29,211 --> 01:29:30,007
Steady!
Yes, sir!

1216
01:29:31,947 --> 01:29:33,812
You set up a useless altar.

1217
01:29:34,216 --> 01:29:34,944
Come up here!

1218
01:29:36,085 --> 01:29:38,178
Supreme Being, come into my body!

1219
01:29:40,389 --> 01:29:41,481
I'll leave this broken altar for you.

1220
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:51,231
Steady, steady!

1221
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,458
How dare you!

1222
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:55,928
How dare you wreck my altar!

1223
01:29:58,540 --> 01:29:59,529
Protect Priest Kung.

1224
01:30:05,748 --> 01:30:06,874
Use the cloth as an altar.

1225
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:10,808
Do you want to die?

1226
01:30:12,688 --> 01:30:14,246
Supreme Being, four Guardians of Heaven

1227
01:30:14,523 --> 01:30:18,220
come to my aid.

1228
01:30:18,494 --> 01:30:20,587
Destroy my enemy.

1229
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:23,564
Guardian of Anger!

1230
01:30:23,732 --> 01:30:26,030
Guardian of Mercy!

1231
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:28,169
Little girl.

1232
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:33,034
Guardian of Defiance! Come!

1233
01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:36,240
Gao Kung,
you've summoned all the guardians!

1234
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:37,976
Are you ready yet?

1235
01:30:38,514 --> 01:30:39,742
If any guardian was of use,
one would be enough.

1236
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:40,778
You have offended them all.

1237
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:44,213
They will all punish you!

1238
01:31:02,638 --> 01:31:03,627
Death to you, the guardian's enemy!

1239
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:11,268
Die now!

1240
01:31:22,758 --> 01:31:23,986
Wind somersault!

1241
01:31:25,994 --> 01:31:27,859
Mighty strike!

1242
01:31:29,965 --> 01:31:30,693
Evil being!

1243
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:35,827
Priest Kung is invincible.

1244
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:38,563
He will exorcise all evil!

1245
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:42,402
Get down!

1246
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:47,378
No Shadow Kick from Fushan!

1247
01:31:49,918 --> 01:31:50,748
Protect Gao Kung!

1248
01:31:56,692 --> 01:31:57,392
Killer Cloth!

1249
01:32:08,537 --> 01:32:09,561
I am not any sort of god.

1250
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:10,939
I'm Wong Fei-hung!

1251
01:32:11,874 --> 01:32:13,432
Can't you tell gods from what is not?

1252
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:17,872
Wong Fei-hung, prepare to die!

1253
01:32:23,952 --> 01:32:24,782
White Lotus opens up!

1254
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:33,828
Put your feet on the ground.

1255
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:39,723
It's all a deception.

1256
01:32:43,071 --> 01:32:45,232
Wong Fei-hung,
how dare you challenge the gods!

1257
01:32:47,543 --> 01:32:48,771
Gods don't burn!

1258
01:32:48,977 --> 01:32:49,739
If that's true, there's no justice.

1259
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,351
Solar explosion!

1260
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:16,963
Gao Kung.
Your show is over now.

1261
01:33:20,409 --> 01:33:21,376
You demon!

1262
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:23,975
You say believe in God
and peace will reign.

1263
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:25,471
How many people have you killed?

1264
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:27,612
Let's see you survive this!

1265
01:33:36,758 --> 01:33:38,316
Nobody can stop me!
I can.

1266
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,125
Claw Knife!

1267
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,053
A metal plate!

1268
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:12,788
His magical powers amount to this.

1269
01:34:15,998 --> 01:34:17,295
Now they've no god

1270
01:34:17,766 --> 01:34:19,199
they must look after themselves.

1271
01:34:20,102 --> 01:34:22,002
Mystical powers protect me!

1272
01:34:22,204 --> 01:34:25,037
Master!

1273
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:29,301
How can this happen?

1274
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:32,313
Let's go.

1275
01:34:40,122 --> 01:34:43,956
What kind of number?

1276
01:34:44,493 --> 01:34:45,755
I can't even read it,
this is no use to me.

1277
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:49,330
Master!

1278
01:34:50,299 --> 01:34:51,926
Good, we meet again.

1279
01:34:56,138 --> 01:34:57,435
It's six o'clock, there's still time.

1280
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,164
Hey, where is the name-book?

1281
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:01,672
Name-book? Oh, no!

1282
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,668
I was distracted by the soldiers

1283
01:35:03,879 --> 01:35:04,846
and forgot it!

1284
01:35:05,247 --> 01:35:06,236
Why are you so careless?!

1285
01:35:07,115 --> 01:35:07,911
I'll go back and get it.

1286
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:09,645
Do we have enough time?

1287
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:11,648
I must get it,
it's a matter of life and death.

1288
01:35:13,789 --> 01:35:14,489
Let's go.

1289
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:24,330
Mr. Luke, it's well-guarded,
do we have to go in?

1290
01:35:24,566 --> 01:35:26,033
I must get the name-book.

1291
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,027
The boat leaves in 30 minutes.

1292
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,494
We can't be late meeting Sun at the pier.

1293
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:35,143
Wait there.

1294
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:50,455
Foon, see If Mr. Luke is ready yet.

1295
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:51,826
I'll keep watch.

1296
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,462
Mr. Luke, can I help?

1297
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:57,331
I've got it, let's go.

1298
01:36:00,869 --> 01:36:02,393
Soldiers, let's hide.

1299
01:36:10,445 --> 01:36:12,003
Master Wong, this way.
Master

1300
01:36:15,617 --> 01:36:18,211
Come on, hurry up!

1301
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:22,988
I'm going to die this time.

1302
01:36:23,258 --> 01:36:24,088
Help him up.

1303
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:27,217
Where are you hurt?

1304
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:28,993
Let me have a look!

1305
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,022
It hurts, it really hurts.

1306
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:37,403
Luckily they shot your watch...

1307
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:42,071
Mr. Luke!

1308
01:36:42,577 --> 01:36:43,566
Get down!

1309
01:36:52,988 --> 01:36:53,750
Foon, you go first.

1310
01:36:54,589 --> 01:36:56,147
Mr. Luke, I'll carry you.

1311
01:36:58,827 --> 01:36:59,691
This way, Master.

1312
01:37:11,807 --> 01:37:12,507
Don't move!

1313
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:22,850
Master, there's a way out.

1314
01:37:24,019 --> 01:37:24,719
There's a way out.

1315
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:27,386
Are you all right?

1316
01:37:27,856 --> 01:37:29,380
I can't go on.

1317
01:37:29,724 --> 01:37:31,419
Leave me here.

1318
01:37:34,463 --> 01:37:35,163
Let me help you.

1319
01:37:36,765 --> 01:37:40,667
The name-book is vitally important.

1320
01:37:41,269 --> 01:37:42,736
Don't let the Government have it or

1321
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:45,504
many Chinese people will be killed.

1322
01:37:46,842 --> 01:37:47,866
Take me over there.

1323
01:37:55,183 --> 01:37:57,743
You can't burn this cloth.

1324
01:37:58,587 --> 01:38:02,683
Master Wong, I beg you,
deliver this to Sun personally.

1325
01:38:02,991 --> 01:38:06,518
Tell him I died for the revolution.

1326
01:38:07,195 --> 01:38:08,856
He must live for the revolution.

1327
01:38:15,537 --> 01:38:17,266
There's blood here.
They're over there!

1328
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,637
Foon, look after Mr. Luke.

1329
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:31,415
General Lan?

1330
01:38:34,556 --> 01:38:35,887
We meet again.

1331
01:38:36,992 --> 01:38:38,482
Arrest the rebels!
Yes, sir!

1332
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:41,896
Hold it.

1333
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,930
What are you burning?

1334
01:38:45,767 --> 01:38:47,496
Wong Fei-hung, this will be

1335
01:38:47,736 --> 01:38:49,294
our last chance to spar.

1336
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:52,940
I wonder how many of my moves
you can withstand.

1337
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,934
Give me that now!

1338
01:38:57,779 --> 01:38:58,643
Here you are!

1339
01:39:06,655 --> 01:39:07,355
How dare you!

1340
01:39:34,549 --> 01:39:36,312
The name-book? Hand it over.

1341
01:39:39,754 --> 01:39:41,381
Foon, stay where you are.

1342
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:42,223
Carry on with what you're doing.

1343
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:43,218
Don't come over.

1344
01:39:45,293 --> 01:39:46,282
Master, take care.

1345
01:40:00,308 --> 01:40:01,008
Mr. Luke.

1346
01:40:07,349 --> 01:40:09,317
Lan, didn't you want to test me?

1347
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:13,721
Wong Fei-hung?

1348
01:40:19,194 --> 01:40:19,956
Come on, then!

1349
01:40:26,935 --> 01:40:27,635
Come down!

1350
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:29,234
You come up!

1351
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:35,109
Come down!

1352
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:42,345
You wanted to fight?

1353
01:40:44,953 --> 01:40:46,079
Son-of-a-bitch! This is too much!

1354
01:40:47,589 --> 01:40:49,284
Why aren't you down yet?

1355
01:40:53,061 --> 01:40:53,761
Mr. Luke.

1356
01:40:54,929 --> 01:41:02,893
Time... is vital.

1357
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:07,471
Be on time... at the pier.
Meet Sun Yat-sen.

1358
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:09,910
Mr. Luke.

1359
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:16,050
Mr. Luke.

1360
01:42:12,073 --> 01:42:14,507
Wong Fei-hung, there's no way out!
Come back.

1361
01:42:16,177 --> 01:42:18,008
You killed the British consul

1362
01:42:18,813 --> 01:42:22,749
everyone will know sooner or later.

1363
01:42:23,985 --> 01:42:26,886
There's no way out for you either.
Well... we're both doomed, then.

1364
01:43:35,123 --> 01:43:36,181
Foon, you can't burn that cloth!

1365
01:44:06,821 --> 01:44:07,521
Master!

1366
01:44:07,856 --> 01:44:08,720
Foon, go quickly.

1367
01:44:08,923 --> 01:44:09,685
Time is vital.

1368
01:44:29,043 --> 01:44:30,169
It's a dead end

1369
01:44:30,345 --> 01:44:31,437
there's no way out.

1370
01:44:40,121 --> 01:44:41,053
Foon, what time is it now?

1371
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:43,816
I can't tell the time

1372
01:44:44,759 --> 01:44:45,487
but it's getting light.

1373
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:04,004
There's not much time left.

1374
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:09,176
Mr. Sun must meet Mr. Luke
before he sails.

1375
01:45:16,591 --> 01:45:17,291
Wong Fei-hung?

1376
01:45:19,661 --> 01:45:21,390
Please give me the name-book

1377
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,791
so I can go back to the Governor.

1378
01:45:26,501 --> 01:45:27,525
He won't let us go.

1379
01:45:28,102 --> 01:45:28,802
Try and find a way out.

1380
01:45:54,862 --> 01:45:55,562
Quick! Go!

1381
01:45:57,732 --> 01:45:58,432
Cloth Staff!

1382
01:46:02,136 --> 01:46:03,603
Foon, make the hole bigger.

1383
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:23,485
Well done!

1384
01:46:35,636 --> 01:46:36,500
Thank you.

1385
01:46:43,211 --> 01:46:43,939
Foon, Get out of here.

1386
01:46:44,078 --> 01:46:44,778
I understand, Master.

1387
01:46:57,658 --> 01:46:58,454
Master, we can go now.

1388
01:46:59,127 --> 01:47:00,321
Yes, you can go to hell!

1389
01:47:04,332 --> 01:47:05,196
Foon!

1390
01:47:11,005 --> 01:47:11,705
No Shadow Kick!

1391
01:48:01,789 --> 01:48:02,489
Master.

1392
01:48:21,976 --> 01:48:22,676
Are you Dr. Sun?

1393
01:48:22,977 --> 01:48:24,274
All aboard! Hurry up, everyone!
All aboard! Hurry up.

1394
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:25,377
We've found him.

1395
01:48:30,952 --> 01:48:32,419
Don't move! You're coming with me.

1396
01:48:36,491 --> 01:48:37,191
Stand back!

1397
01:48:38,059 --> 01:48:40,823
Grab the hand, crouch down and twist.

1398
01:48:53,574 --> 01:48:54,274
Master.

1399
01:48:55,543 --> 01:48:59,070
Fei-hung!
13th Aunt!

1400
01:49:00,615 --> 01:49:01,445
Where is Mr. Luke?

1401
01:49:06,487 --> 01:49:08,455
Dr. Sun!

1402
01:49:25,139 --> 01:49:27,073
May a new dawn break over our land.

1403
01:49:29,644 --> 01:49:31,771
May we never forget our martyr's blood.

1404
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:41,686
Mr. Luke, your spirit will always be
remembered in our hearts.

1405
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:53,828
Don't worry, I'll meet you at the pier!

1406
01:50:23,264 --> 01:50:25,630
Foon, are you missing 13th Aunt?

1407
01:50:26,434 --> 01:50:27,298
Are you, Master?

1408
01:50:28,469 --> 01:50:29,766
I asked you the question.

1409
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,572
I think you're the one
who's missing her.

1410
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:35,909
Really?
