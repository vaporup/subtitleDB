- Yes, l am.

You obviously know automobiles because
we've had this one come back to us twice.

But l got one here l wanna show you.

what kind of deal l can work for you.

that low monthly payment.

- You're not gonna beat that anywhere.

You liked him so much you had
to go back and talk to him twice.

108

- Once at the spring...
- All right, l lied about it.

109
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,190
Now can you just leave me be?

110
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,700
Sutton a relative of yours?

111
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,150

for another 30, 40 years,

169
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,350
somebody'll give me a testimonial
and a $40 watch.

170
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,710
You wanna watch that stuff with Harshaw.
He's a good man, but got a temper.

171
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,590
ls that a fact?

172
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,670
Course, maybe he's got a reason.

173
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,750
(horn)

174
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,310
Hi. Can l help you?

175
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,790
l was just lookin' for George.

176
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,430
- George?
- Mr Harshaw.

177
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,220
l'm his wife.
You must be the new salesman.

178
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,920
Madox. Harry Madox.

179
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,550
Sorry, Mrs Harshaw,
but your husband's gone to lunch.

180
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,900
Oh, damn.

181
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,910
ls there something l can help you with?

182
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,390
Well, l hate to ask you.
l mean, you're workin' and all.

183
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,110
l'm not hurtin' myself.

184
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,350
Well, if you really wouldn't mind,

185
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,230
l've got some papers and clothes
that need unloadin'.

186
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,150
Sure. l'd be glad to.

187
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,230
Well, get in.

188
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,710
l have a pair of shoes like those.

189
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,630
l ought to wear 'em more often.

190
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,030
They seem to be more effective
than l remembered.

191
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,590
lt's awfully nice of you, especially since
George shouldn't carry heavy things.

192
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,990
- Why not?
- He didn't tell you? About his heart?

193
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,710
He's had two attacks already.

194
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,950
The doctor says he's got
to cut back on everything.

195
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,390
- That's why he hired you.
- No, he didn't tell me.

196
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,670
Well, George never did like
to go admittin' certain kinds of reality.

197
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,950
- Ain't you gonna put 'em down?
- What?

198
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,950
Mustn't know your own strength. Here.

199
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,630
- So what you gonna do in our town?
- Whatever there is to do.

200
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,830
Well, there are only two things
to do around here.

201
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,870
- Have you got a TV?
- Nope.

202
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,560
Well, now you're down to one.

203
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,190
Lots of luck.

204
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,390
- Good morning to ya, Lon.
- Howdy, bud.

205
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,270
What are you
in such a good mood about?

206
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,670
Lon, it takes a lot of money to be free.

207
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,460
And l'm gonna sell one of these to
the first sucker that walks in here today.

208
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,550
- You are, are you?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,590
Well, now. How do you
reckon to accomplish that?

210
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,670
Sheer willpower.

211
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,550
ln this life, you gotta take what you want.

212
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,910
You damn sure can't stand around
and wait for somebody to give it to you.

213
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,270
"Gotta take what you want."
That's good. l like that.

214
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,950
- You know what l always say?
- What's that?

215
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,590
Look before you leap.

216
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,360
Mr Harshaw's gone for the weekend.
Huntin'. Said he needed the rest.

217
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,910
Yeah, and l got a notion from what.
l met her yesterday.

218
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,030
Mr Harshaw met her in a real small town.

219
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,790
Huntin' trip, l think it was.

220
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,030
He always said
that she just sort of happened.

221
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,070
Mm-hm.

222
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,950
The smart thing would've been to get out
and let her happen to somebody else.

223
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,030
(phone rings)

224
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,310
- Harshaw Motors.
- Mr Madox?

225
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,390
This is Mrs Harshaw.

226
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,470
l hate to be a pest, but l was wonderin' if
l could ask you a teensy-weensy favour?

227
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,470
Well, sure, Mrs Harshaw.
What do you need?

228
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,190
- Mr Harshaw's cap.
- What?

229
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,350
(doorbell chimes)

230
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,670
Hi.

231
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,070
Well, come on in.

232
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,780
The least l can do is buy you a drink.

233
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,350
Sorry the place is such a mess.

234
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,270
l gave the girl the weekend off.

235
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,390
Oh.

236
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,550
That one thought he was stalkin' George.

237
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,310
Did he ever get a surprise!

238
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,470
Bang, bang.

239
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,550
l hope you like mai tais.

240
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,750
So...

241
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,150
How are you standing the excitement?

242
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,990
(sighs)

243
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,190
Maybe it picks up on Saturday night.

244
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,990
Yeah, it does. They show two vampire
operas at the movies instead of one.

245
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,390
l could buy a TV.

246
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,230
Or you could join the Ladies Club
and collect trash.

247
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,590
Now there's a hot pastime.

248
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,950
l doubt if l could pass
the credentials committee.

249
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,790
Not if you approached 'em one at a time.

250
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,460
You'd be lucky if you ever
got your credentials back.

251
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,870
Which one lives over there?

252
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,270
Mrs Gross.

253
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,510
She's the one with the binoculars.

254
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,830
What do you think of the view?

255
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,190
Better all the time.

256
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,470
That's where the pool was gonna go.

257
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,060
George said l could have one
if l was good.

258
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,550
But... he said his family hadn't had one

259
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,110
and what was good enough for them
was good enough for us.

260
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,030
l meant to ask you... about findin' me.

261
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,510
Did l give you the right directions?

262
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,870
l could find it in the dark.

263
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,590
You sure?

264
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,030
l think you'd better leave.

265
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,630
Like hell.

266
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,060
l thought you said
you lived in a small town.

267
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,110
Then you'd know that bitch over there
watched you arrive.

268
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,030
And she's watchin' right now
for you to leave.

269
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,110
Who cares?

270
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,430
l do.

271
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,630
Bad boy.

272
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,870
Bad, bad boy.

273
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,070
l'm going to bed. You can let yourself out.

274
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,390
- How much?
- A dollar.

275
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

276
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,390
(waitress) l need a double order
of grits and some more toast.

277
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,110
What you reading?

278
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,390
Oh! Oh, nothing. lt's...

279
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,350
it's just... silly.

280
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,390
Would you...

281
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,350
Would you like a soda? Yeah, a soda.

282
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,550
- You don't want a soda.
- Yes, l do.

283
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:47,070
Yes, l do. What could be nicer on a hot
afternoon than a tall, clean, cool soda?

284
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,390
All right.

285
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,550
"He was a stranger in town.
A rough man, mocking, sometimes cruel."

286
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,380
"But Miriam saw past the tough facade
to the bitter wounds that made him

287
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,870
- hide his true self from the world."
- l told you it was silly.

288
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,470
Oh, Junior, better not read that stuff.
lt's bad for you.

289
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,150
(Harry laughs)

290
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,830
l'm sorry about the other day.

291
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,750
l must've had the book open
to the wrong place.

292
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,830
Oh, please.

293
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,790
l realised later what it must've looked like.

294
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,310
My life's just been a succession of jams
over floozies of one kind or another.

295
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,230
l forget how to treat a real lady.

296
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,230
What do you say
we forget about the whole thing?

297
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,310
Start over. Make friends.

298
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,950
How about tonight? Wanna go for a ride?

299
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,470
Hey, look... l have to get back.

300
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,630
l'll drive you.

301
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,030
- lt's just walking distance.
- l'll walk you.

302
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,260
She's a wonderful woman,
the woman who raised me.

303
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,990
She's always takin' people in.

304
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,150
Always feedin' the whole neighbourhood.

305
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,990
She had a daughter,
a little bit older than me.

306
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,580
She was my best friend
in the whole world.

307
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,550
"Was"?

308
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,630
Yeah, she died.

309
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,870
lt was a bad time.

310
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,350
Spunky. Hey!

311
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,430
Look who's waitin' here!

312
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,950
- You're very pretty.
- Oh, l'm just ordinary.

313
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,990
Ordinary?

314
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,150
Well...

315
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,150
Well, what?

316
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,270
Well, don't you ever knock?

317
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,150
Only when l'm not expected.

318
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,150
You were expected all right.

319
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,830
(# blues guitar)

320
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,390
That was pretty ballsy of you, Harry.

321
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,550
Just comin' in my house like that.

322
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,110
What would you have done
if l'd have screamed?

323
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,790
But you didn't scream, did you?

324
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,990
Why don't you pour me another drink?

325
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,980
There isn't any.

326
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,070
The hell there ain't.

327
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,910
What happened to it, l wonder.

328
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,030
Maybe it leaks.

329
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,150
You know, Harry.

330
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,550
We're a lot alike, you and me.

331
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,390
Cos we got these hard, hard outsides.

332
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,380
- But inside...
- We're hard, hard, hard.

333
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,870
Harry?

334
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,030
Do you think l'm fat?

335
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,710
Of course not.

336
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,430
Well, you sure as hell oughta know.

337
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,390
l don't know what the hell l'm doin' here.

338
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,590
You seemed to like it at the time.

339
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,950
What's my batting average

- You'll live.

He was driven to part from all men.

Well.

425
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,260
You look disappointed.

426

Sheriff's deputies.
You're gonna have to come with us,

443
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,260
so why don't you
just make it easy on yourself?

444
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,580
Now let's go back to that first day
that you arrived in town.

445
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:06,140
You went to the bank and there was
a fire that day, too, l believe.

446
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:11,460
Yes, there was... now that l recall.

447
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:16,340
And when you went in, there was nobody
there at the bank as far as you could see?

448
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:19,860
- They'd all gone to the fire.
- Yeah, that's right.

449
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,420
And l believe you'd been told
that the surveillance equipment

450
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,140
had been installed improperly.

451
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,020
But you never gave it another thought...

452
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,100
until there was a robbery

453
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,100
and another fire.

454
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,820
Only l wasn't at the robbery.

455
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,340
l was at the fire.

456
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,740
Why don't you just go ahead and say it.

457
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,900
- What are you talkin' about?
- Your alibi.

458
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,930
He's sitting right there looking at you.

459
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:58,740
He remembers you from the fire - that
big splash you made saving that drunk.

460
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:03,100
Only that was 20 minutes
after the fire started...

461
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,500
after the robbery.

462
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,420
Nobody saw you at that fire

463
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,580
until after the bank was robbed.

464
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:21,340
You know you robbed the bank. We know
you did. That makes it unanimous.

465
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,060
You know you're never
gonna be able to spend this money.

466
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,820
We got all the numbers right here.

467
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:32,300
You might just as well give the money
back. lt'll go a lot lighter on you.

468
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,020
Well.

469
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,660
The man won't listen to reason.

470
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:45,740
Go ahead and lock him up.
Then go home for a little while.

471
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,660
Do all this over tomorrow.

472
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,740
- This is him.
- You're sure?

473
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,010
lt sure sound like him.

474
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,820
He got a kind of a bleep, like a tea kettle.

475
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,900
OK, uncle Mort. Thank you.

476
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,580
Watch your step.

477
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,140
All right, get these other guys outta here.

That's George Harshaw
callin' from Galveston.

486
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:14,890
He says that Mr Madox was
definitely at the fire the whole time.

487
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,980
- Harshaw?
- Mm-hm.

488
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:22,180
- l don't remember seein' him there.
- No, he wasn't.

489
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,140
Mrs Harshaw said that she drove up

490
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,220
just as Mr Madox
was gettin' out of his car,

491
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,940
not five minutes after the fire started.

492
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,530
Mrs Harshaw(!)

493
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:42,300
l guess you're free to leave, Mr Madox.

494
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,620

495
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

496
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:23,860
- l heard you were in jail.
- Yeah. lt's OK now.

497
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,180
Just a mistake.

498
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,060
We got her straightened out.

499
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,060
They were just doin' their job.

500
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,900
l kept seein' your car
out in front of my house.

501
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,900
All l could think about
was our day at the pool.

502
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:47,470
Tell you what. We'll do it again.

503
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,570
When?

504
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,100
Tomorrow.

505
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,660
But first get in. l'll drive you to work.

506
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,740
OK.

507
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,010
Hey! Excuse me, Miss Harper.

508
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,980
l wonder if l might trouble you
for a moment of your time?

509
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,260
ls there something
l could help you with?

510
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,820
Harry.

511
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,940
uh... No, l don't think so.

512
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,980
You think there's anything
he can help us with, Miss Harper?

513
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:25,810
No, l guess not. You see how it is.

514
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,900
Another time, perhaps.

515
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:30,500
We'll give you a holler.

516
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,820
Come on.

517
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,500
Please, Harry.

518
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:42,060
lt's just a personal matter
l have to discuss with Mr Sutton.

519
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,190
- He'll walk me to work.
- (Sutton) Come on!

520
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:52,580
Cheer up, buddy. Chicken don't always
lay its eggs in the same nest.

521
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,700
(phone rings)

522
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,060
Harshaw Motors.

523
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,180
Hello?

524
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:19,660
- Wrong number.
- l guess.

525
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,860
Second time it's done that
in the last ten minutes.

526
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,180
Lon.

527
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,540
Do you know anything
about a guy by the name of Sutton?

528
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,700
- Sutton?
- Yeah.

529
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,580
Deadbeat. Repossession deal.

530
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,140
Yeah, l remember him.

531
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,460
l don't know much about him, though.

532
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,220
l think he used to work for Harshaw.

533
01:09:55,150 --> 01:10:00,500
l think he was gonna put in a pool, but
l never did hear any more about that deal.

534
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,700
Thanks, Lon.

535
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,300
- Gin.
- Shit.

536
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,420
(Madox) Oh, God. There's that guy again.

537
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,570
He must have come in
to check that car out nine times.

538
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,900
Well, maybe tenth time's the charm.

539
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,860
(phone rings)

540
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,740
- Harshaw Motors.
- lt's about time you answered.

541
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,540
l didn't expect you back so soon.
Did you have a nice trip?

542
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,900
Well, ain't you cute.

543
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,780
Been havin' a good time
watchin' that little girl?

544
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,500
Didn't expect you back until Monday.

545
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,500
l'll tell you all about that when l see you.

546
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,500
Harry, meet me about ten tonight
at this place l know.

547
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,100
- l don't think l can make it.
- Oh, don't you really?

548
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,340
Well, ain't that too bad.

549
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,460
By the way.

550
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,660
Wasn't that lucky l saw you there
the other day at the fire?

551
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,620
Just supposin' l'd missed you.

552
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,980
What's the matter?

553
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:12,820
Don't tell me l'm slippin'.

554
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,740
What do you have to see me about?

555
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,940
Well, now l've heard everything.

556
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,220
Well, if that's all it is...

557
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,540
let's get on with it.

558
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,460
lf we hurry,
maybe we can catch the next train home.

559
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,740
Keep your hand to yourself,
or l'll break it off.

560
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,900
Who's on top this time?

561
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,820
lf we hurry, maybe we can just make it.

562
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,420
What if l told you to go to hell?

563
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,660
Well...

564
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:11,780
Then l'd know l just dreamed
the whole thing about the fire.

565
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,660
That'd be just awful, wouldn't it?

566
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,580
(Dolly laughs)

567
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,380
See?

568
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,420
You thought you could leave me

569
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,460
for that Sunday-school kid.

570
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,500
Thought you could leave me for her.

571
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,660
You see? You do like me, don't you?

572
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,620
- No.
- (Dolly laughs)

573
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,700
Not even a little bit.

574
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,660
Ain't that funny? l coulda sworn you did.

575
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:16,380
But, honey... before you get
carried away with not likin' me,

576
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:20,660
l've just remembered there was
something else l wanted to tell you.

577
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:27,380
What's that?

578
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,940
l always get what l want, Harry.

579
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,940
You got a husband who might
have something to say about that.

580
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,700
Never mind him.

581
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:42,580
He got everything he paid for.

582
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,820
Do you know why we came back
from Galveston so soon?

583
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:56,250
No. How could l?

584
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,060
He had chest pains.

585
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:05,500
The doctor in Galveston looked him over
and says he has to have an operation...

586
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,580
quick.

587
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,940
So why did he go huntin' today?

588
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:14,020
He always overdoes it when he's sick.

589
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:18,180
He practically can't help himself.

590
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,660
The doctor says if he has another one,

591
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,220
it'll kill him.

592
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:28,580
So what has that got to do with me?

593
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,060
Anything at all

594
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:35,140
too excitin' will just kill him.

595
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:58,900
No.

596
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,460
He had his first attack
the first day he met me.

597
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,980
Harry.

598
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,980
Harry!

599
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,740
Harry!

600
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,410
Harry!

601
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:27,700
Harry.

602
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,770
You've gotta help me, Harry.

603
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:42,260
(creaking)

604
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,940
l can't be left alone!

605
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,620
Help me, Harry.

606
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:21,140
l told you.
l won't have anything to do with it.

607
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,340
You're too worked up.

608
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:31,250
You're off your head.
You don't know what you're saying.

609
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:37,540
- You better find something to do.
- Something to do?

610
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:40,540
Yeah, get a job. Get a hobby.

611
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,900
Have a kid. l don't know. Do something.

612
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,900
Have a kid?

613
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,940
Hell, no. l don't want that.

614
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,940
But if l was pregnant with your child,

615
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,660
l'd show you what l'd do about that.

616
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,500
l've done it before.

617
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,980
(Harry) My God!

618
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,060
lt's not the falling down, honey.

619
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,100
lt's the climb back up.

620
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,540
(Harry laughs)

621
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,300
Light me a cigarette, Harry.

622
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,580
Poor old Harry.

623
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,660
He don't like me.

624
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,020
You lousy little witch.

625
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,180
What's it got to do with likin' you?

626
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,660
l told you we were a lot alike, didn't l?

627
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:05,450
Now lean down, Harry.

628
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:07,540
You wanna kiss me, don't you?

629
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,660
Kiss you?

630
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,900
l'll kill you.

631
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,980
l swear to God l'll kill you.

632
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,900
No, you won't.

633
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:24,300
Not now.

634
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,380
Now kiss me.

635
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,020
(police radio)

636
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:42,020
Gloria?

637
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:48,220
Are you OK?

638
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:58,100
Remember... l started to tell you about...

639
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,340
about the girl that l grew up with?

640
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:04,380
- The one that died.
- What l...

641
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:07,900
What l didn't tell you is that...
she killed herself.

642
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:14,180
And Sutton drove her to it. He did it.

643
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,220
She was my sister, Harry.

644
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:23,300
l really loved her.

645
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,340
(Gloria) She finally told me.

646
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:35,700
She'd been havin' an affair
with a woman who was a teacher of ours.

647
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:39,740
They'd been meeting in Houston.

648
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,580
Somehow Sutton found out.

649
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:48,180
He seems to know
what people's weaknesses are.

650
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,060
And he was blackmailin' her.

651
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:55,740
But l... l went to her.

652
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,460
Just... Just to comfort her.

653
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:06,300
Sutton was there. He'd been there
the whole time, takin' pictures of us.

654
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:10,140
He said to lrene he had real pictures now.

655
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:16,100
And what had we been doing in that
bedroom we shared when we were girls?

656
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:18,220
(camera clicking)

657
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:23,780
He came into my office after lrene died,
lookin' for money.

658
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:29,500
He had the pictures,
but he was very clever.

659
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,660
He didn't act like a blackmailer.

660
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:36,730
He whined and he said he felt terrible
about what had happened to lrene.

661
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,580
That he was a poor man.

662
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:41,860
Couldn't scrape a livin' in the world.

663
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:44,980
Said it was his only chance for survival.

664
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:49,620
And that if he didn't have the money -
just $500 - to leave town,

665
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,580
that he would go to my momma,

666
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:55,420
give her the pictures,
ask her for the money.

667
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:00,420
l had it there. l gave him the money.

668
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,500
And once you did...

669
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,580
He knew that l had taken it.

670
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:10,980
And he asked for more.

671
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:14,500
He kept comin' back and l just...

672
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:17,660
l couldn't catch up after a while.

673
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:19,900
l'm gonna tell Mr Harshaw.

674
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,780
l don't want Sutton to tell him.

675
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:32,210
l don't... l don't want for anyone
else to have to tell him that.

676
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:11,540
Come on in. Make yourself at home.

677
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,220
Have a seat.

678
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,020
You a tough guy, huh?

679
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,420
No. You're the tough guy.

680
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:29,380
l'm worse.

681
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,780
lt's not loaded.

682
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:39,260
(chuckles)

683
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,340
Well, how about that, huh?

684
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:44,460
So tell me. What, uh...

685
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,940
What seems to be your problem?

686
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:49,700
l mean, not that l'm nosey,
you understand.

687
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,100
(Madox) Gloria Harper.

688
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:57,700
You've been on her back now...
for over a year.

689
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,260
(laughs)

690
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:02,540
Oh, Lord of mine.

691
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:06,820
That little girl's got you
all stoked up, doesn't she?

692
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:10,140
So you drove yourself all the way out here

693
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:13,180
just to tell me to get off it, huh?

694
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:15,580
ls that right?

695
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:18,060
l'm gonna do better than that.

696
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:24,140
l'm gonna help you off.

697
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,100
Get up. Get up!

698
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,380
Don't you go out on me now,
you son of a bitch.

699
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:56,740
Don't you go out on me now!

700
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,650
Come on, get up. Get up!

701
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:43,180
You like pictures, huh?
You like these pictures?

702
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:45,260
You got your goddamn pictures.

703
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:59,410
Come see me, Harry.

704
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,500
l'll meet you anywhere.

705
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,500
Come see me tonight.

706
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:08,660
Harry?

707
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,740
(line goes dead)

708
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,820
(# "The Want To" by Scott Wilk)

709
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:25,580
Nice entrance.

710
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:28,660
What's on your mind?

711
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,740
l'll make it short and to the point.

712
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:36,010
George says you're gettin' serious
about Gloria Harper.

713
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:41,140
lf you think you're gonna ditch me
for that saccharin little candy-ass,

714
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,500
you've got another thing comin'.

715
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:46,700
l don't see as you got
much to say about it.

716
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,980
So that's the way it is, hey?

717
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,300
That's it.

718
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:59,380
You're gonna wish to Christ
you never laid eyes on me.

719
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,980
l already do.

720
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,780
Not yet.

721
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:06,700
Not really.

722
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,340
But you will.

723
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:28,820
(Harshaw) Goddamn it, Dolly.

724
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,820
These Women's Club meetings drag on.

725
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:43,020
George, you're drinkin' and smokin'.
The doctor says you couldn't do neither.

726
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:46,180
Jesus, Dolly. One of each
isn't gonna put me over the top.

727
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:49,460
l've been thinkin'. Good thing for Madox.

728
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:53,020
Gloria Harper. Huh?

729
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:56,540
He ought to get real smart and marry her.

730
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,420
- George?
- She's young, fresh-faced,

731
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:05,220
looks like an ad-writer's dream
of the all-American girl.

732
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,980
Why don't you pour me a drink?

733
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,860
And she's a woman
that you can trust, too.

734
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,220
You know what l mean? Huh?

735
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:17,300
That's really important to a man.

736
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:22,620
George, l'm so tired.

737
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,230
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

738
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:31,140
Come on in my room tonight.

739
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:34,540
Rub a little bit
of that night cream on my shoulders?

740
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,580
You can do that, can't you, George?

741
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:39,420
Hm?

742
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,860
l'm so tired. And l'm so hot.

743
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,940
(squeals)

744
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:50,060
You know, l been thinkin'.
l know l been a bad wife.

745
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:56,700
But now l'm gonna be very, very bad.

746
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:58,860
(chuckles)

747
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,940
How bad exactly?

748
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:18,860
Momma's real angry with you.

749
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,180
(Harshaw chuckles)

750
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:25,250
She's more angry than she's ever been.

751
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:32,540
Now we've just got one more...

752
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:37,620
and then we can get down to business.

753
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,940
Guess what?

754
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,700
All these things l'm doin' to you,

755
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:48,350
l've done to your boy...

756
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:51,460
Harry Madox,

757
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:55,100
down at the sawmill

758
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:59,540
over and over again.

759
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:06,820
What's the matter, George?
Don't you like the game, George?

760
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:10,100
- Don't you feel well, George?
- (Harshaw grunts)

761
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:13,580
Well, maybe Momma
can make it all better.

762
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:16,220
There we go.

763
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:20,580
l'm fuckin' you to death, George.

764
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:26,500
Aagh!

765
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:05,420
Don't pay no mind
to the way my face looks.

766
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,900
l fell out of bed.

767
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,100
What's on your mind?

768
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,620
Thinkin' about buyin' another car.

769
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:33,980
Why don't you just
pay for the one you got?

770
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:36,020
lt's all right.

771
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:38,940
l'm gonna trade mine in on a new 'un.

772
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:44,220
Like perpetual motion, huh?

773
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:48,050
Trade in the car you don't own
for one you can't pay for.

774
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:52,580
Kinda had my eye
on that Lincoln out front.

775
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:01,660
- What are you usin' for money?
- You ain't got it yet, do you?

776
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:05,650
See, now why should l make
another payment on a car

777
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:09,260
when l'm gonna trade it in on a new 'un?

778
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:15,450
l was thinkin' maybe you and me could
take that Lincoln out for a little test drive.

779
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,780
Now, listen, you stupid bastard.

780
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:53,410
l don't know what you're drivin' at.

781
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:56,980
But l can get a bellyful of you
quicker than most.

782
01:36:57,110 --> 01:37:00,140
So why don't you get wise
to yourself and shove?

783
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:04,860
You fall out of bed one more time and
the cockroaches'll start talkin' to you.

784
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:08,740
- That was a hell of a fire, wasn't it?
- What are you talkin' about?

785
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:13,010
See, the day they had the fire,
l was walkin' along here

786
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:16,260
about, oh, half hour after the fire started.

787
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:21,420
l'd been over there watchin',
but fires bore the hell outta me.

788
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:23,740
The way l see it,
there ain't no money in 'em.

789
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:27,020
At least, that's how l saw it back then.

790
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:30,060
You take a smart son of a bitch like you,

791
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,940
boy, he knows there's money in fires.

792
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:39,820
- How 'bout gettin' to it?
- You gotta get that sheriff thinkin'

793
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:43,730
that you got to the fire
the same time as the fire trucks did.

794
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:46,940
Otherwise, you're in real trouble.

795
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:50,500
See, you gotta tell everybody
the same story.

796
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:54,500
l know that l got in trouble
with more little gals that way.

797
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:58,770
Course, l hang around with
a more female type of woman myself.

798
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:02,220
Set your ass down.

799
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:05,380
l ain't real happy with my new face,
mister. Sit down.

800
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:14,500
Now, let's talk about the money.

801
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,500
l tell you what.

802
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,340
l'm gonna let you drive my new Lincoln.

803
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:24,220
lt's my personal favourite.

804
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:40,620
You get the dent ironed out of that fender.

805
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,460
l'll be by on Monday to pick it up,

806
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,540
along with the bread.

807
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,420
How do l know you'll go?

808
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:56,500
You don't.
You're just gonna have to trust me.

809
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,660
See ya tonight, honey.

810
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:27,500
(laughs)

811
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:36,500
He wanted $500, Harry.

812
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:40,250
- You didn't give it to him, did you?
- No, l didn't. Not yet.

813
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:42,420
l don't have it in the office today.

814
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,060
Gloria.

815
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:48,140
Gloria, don't you even
think about givin' it to him.

816
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,300
Blackmailers are all the goddamn same.

817
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:55,050
- Each buy is the last until the next one.
- l know.

818
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:58,020
Except there's something else now, Harry.

819
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:01,820
He told me that he knows
somethin' about you. Something bad.

820
01:40:03,190 --> 01:40:05,940
Harry. What is it?

821
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:08,420
Baby, don't even worry about it.

822
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:10,500
And listen to me.

823
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:13,980
Whatever you do, don't pay him.

824
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:16,220
Do you understand me?

825
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,300
Don't pay him.

826
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:30,940
(man) And Haran died
before his father Terah

827
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,220
in the land of his nativity,
in ur of the Chaldees...

828
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,420
(woman moans)

829
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:33,820
(woman) Oh, that's good.

830
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,900
(moaning)

831
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:42,900
Oh, baby!

832
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:50,780
(moaning intensifies)

833
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:56,060
(woman squeals)

834
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:58,980
(screams)

835
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:03,540
(woman) My God! My face!

836
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,860
Oi!

837
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:07,940
Wake up!

838
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,740
What'd you do?
Tell her you're gonna send me to jail?

839
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:17,380
l told you to stay away
from Gloria Harper.

840
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:20,900
And you made her bring you
the fuckin' money, you sick bastard.

841
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:22,980
Gloria?

842
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:26,660
Yeah, she was here, right on that bed.

843
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:29,220
You know what we was doin'?

844
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,370
She ain't half bad for a girl
that goes both ways, you know?

845
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:36,380
l'll kill you. l'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

846
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:49,650
The minute a guy like Sutton
came in here and paid cash for a car,

847
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,140
l got suspicious.

848
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:55,220
The more l thought about it,
the less l liked it.

849
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:57,380
These numbers match up all right.

850
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:00,820
Lucky for me.

851
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:05,020
- And lucky for you.
- Lucky for me?

852
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:10,340
Yes, sir. There's a reward connected
to the solution of this particular crime.

853
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:15,740
Not a bad 'un either
by most folks' standards - $25,000.

854
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:19,710
- Mr Madox.
- Sheriff.

855
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,700
Harry!

856
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:36,140
- How soon can you be ready to leave?
- Leave?

857
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:38,220
For the Caribbean.

858
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:42,340
- Just you and me... and a wedding ring.
- Caribbean!

859
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:43,740
(phone rings)

860
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:46,740
- Did you say wedding ring?
- Will you go?

861
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:51,740
Yeah. l'll go.

862
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:57,980
(Gulick) Harry! Phone call!

863
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:04,140
l'll be right back.

864
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,060
Yeah, Madox.

865
01:49:14,230 --> 01:49:17,770
Harry? You'll never
guess what's happened.

866
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:19,900
George is dead.

867
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:23,580
- What?
- The hospital just called.

868
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:29,700
You know he was workin' too hard
and overexertin' himself.

869
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,980
Well, his heart just gave way.

870
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:36,260
You might say he died in the saddle.

871
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:39,580
But, you know,
he was concerned with my welfare

872
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:41,820
right up until the very end.

873
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:45,740
And l was wonderin'
if you might be free to come over

874
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,170
and discuss it as soon as possible?

875
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:51,380
Tell it to Gulick, Dolly. l'm outta here.

876
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:53,460
Goodbye, Mrs Harshaw.

877
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,820
(phone rings)

878
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:20,610
Harshaw Finance.

879
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:23,300
Lon, that was Mrs Harshaw.

880
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:26,900
Mr Harshaw's dead.
He died of a heart attack.

881
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,580
Oh, no.

882
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:34,340
- Oh, God. That's awful.
- Think you can take over?

883
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:39,490
um, well, yeah, l could
but ain't you gonna be here, too?

884
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,580
Not with any luck.

885
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:49,900
Excuse me a minute, Lon.

886
01:50:57,150 --> 01:51:00,660
Harry. That was Mrs Harshaw.

887
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:03,780
Mr Harshaw's dead.

888
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:10,020
Harry, l never got a chance to tell him.

889
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:12,180
lt's OK, baby. lt's OK.

890
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,780
l just told Mrs Harshaw
that we'd be right over.

891
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:19,310
l have a few things l wanna
go over with her.

892
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:24,300
l don't think that's a good idea, baby.

893
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:27,420
Harry.

894
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:30,900
We have so much to look forward to.

895
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:37,180
l have to be clear with the past.
l have to do that.

896
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:43,260
You're right.

897
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:47,030
You're absolutely right.

898
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,500
Gloria, l want you
to promise me something.

899
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,980
We're going to the Caribbean.

900
01:51:56,630 --> 01:51:59,740
- You promise?
- Oh, yeah.

901
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:03,660
Nothing anybody's gonna do
is gonna stop us.

902
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:15,100
Harry. l just have to tell you
one thing before we go in.

903
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:18,060
lt's OK, baby.
You don't have to tell me anything.

904
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:22,020
Well, l know that you told me not to,

905
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:24,300
but l gave Sutton that $500.

906
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:28,260
l already know.
We don't even have to discuss it.

907
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:32,820
l just don't wanna lie to you,
that's all, about anything.

908
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,900
Ssh ssh ssh.

909
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,340
God, you look beautiful.

910
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:51,260
Thank y'all for comin'.

911
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:59,210
l know this may even be harder
for you than it is for me.

912
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,460
At least he didn't suffer much.

913
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:14,220
He was in the hospital unconscious
for almost 24 hours.

914
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:16,980
l heard him out in the hall up there and...

915
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:21,980
l guess he must have started
downstairs for somethin' and...

916
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:25,620
he just fell all the way to the bottom.

917
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:30,900
So l ran to him and... l was so scared.

918
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,980
Half out of my mind, really.

919
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:36,300
And then l fell too...

920
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:43,380
Mr Madox, don't you feel well?

921
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:48,740
l feel fine. l'm all right.

922
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:52,380
Well, l know you been wonderin'.

923
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:54,620
About the business, l mean.

924
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:57,500
l wanted you to know right away that...

925
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:59,900
l have no intention of sellin' out.

926
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:04,460
George thought a great deal
of both of you and...

927
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:07,420
l want to try to carry on just the same

928
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:10,250
because it's what he would have wanted.

929
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:15,820
l guess he knew that
it could happen at any time cos...

930
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:19,980
he kept this little notebook

931
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:25,130
and he'd write down all his ideas on
how he wanted the business carried on.

932
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:28,140
l typed it all up.

933
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:32,740
Since you're in charge now, Mr Madox,

934
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:34,820
l think you should read it.

935
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:41,100
And you too, Miss Harper,
if he thinks you should.

936
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:49,590
(Dolly) lt seemed important
so l left a copy with my attorney.

937
01:54:56,670 --> 01:54:59,820
As for that shortage
in your accounts, Miss Harper,

938
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:04,500
l know you'll understand
that Mr Madox was only doing

939
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:07,940
what he thought was right
when he told me about it,

940
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:10,980
and, of course,
l wouldn't think of bringin' charges.

941
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:14,580
You can just continue
right on the way you have been

942
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,860
till it's all taken care of.

943
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:20,780
l want you to know, dear,
that we're your friends

944
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:25,170
and that Mr Madox hated havin' to do it

945
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:28,660
just as much as l hate
havin' to mention it now.

946
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:34,700
Harry insisted that
you be given another chance.

947
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:39,780
l understand, Mrs Harshaw.

948
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:45,100
Of course.

949
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:49,350
l always intended to pay it all back.

950
01:55:55,630 --> 01:55:57,580
So.

951
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:05,420
lf there isn't anything else,

952
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:09,020
y'all don't mind if l leave, do you?

953
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:12,340
Of course not, dear.

954
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:16,460
l'll drive you home.

955
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:19,660
Thank you.

956
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:23,020
l'd rather walk.

957
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:44,540
Harry, darling.

958
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:49,380
l don't think you'll ever have
much luck explainin' it to her.

959
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:02,100
Sutton didn't know.

960
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,500
He wasn't even at the fire.

961
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:11,940
You told him.

962
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:16,460
lt was you.

963
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:24,580
You'll have to beg now.

964
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,700
You had your chance.

965
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:34,540
Now l'm gonna enjoy hearin' you
beg me to marry you.

966
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:38,300
See...

967
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:40,990
you have to look after me, Harry.

968
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:43,380
Something might happen to me.

969
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:47,380
Yes.

970
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:51,660
Something might.

971
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:10,780
(Dolly splutters)

972
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:08,500
You see, Harry?

973
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,900
Then kiss me, Harry.

974
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:36,220
Kiss me.

975
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:40,580
Oh, God.

976
02:00:23,070 --> 02:00:27,300
(Harry) ln this life,
you gotta take what you want.

977
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:30,900
(Dolly) l always get what l want, Harry.

978
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:32,980
(Harry) Yes, indeed.

979
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:36,220
l've found my level.

980
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:39,940
And l'm livin' it.
