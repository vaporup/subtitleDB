00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,208
<i>A diamond sun cuts down</i>

2
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,385
<i>A frozen winter sky</i>

3
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>As the world and I go screaming</i>

4
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:53,182
<i>Into the phantom night</i>

5
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,270
<i>Doesn't matter where it leads</i>

6
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,104
<i>I got nowhere else to go</i>

7
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,731
<i>If there's any chance at all</i>

8
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:06,355
<i>- It's somewhere down this road
- Come on! Put it to the floor! Come on!</i>

9
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:09,735
<i>- To be wild again
- Let's go!</i>

10
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>No one's child again</i>

11
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:15,577
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

12
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,836
<i>Full of fire again</i>

13
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,124
<i>Oh, to be wild again</i>

14
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,090
Here we go.
Here we go.

15
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:29,305
Pull over! Pull over!
Pull over!

16
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,465
Pull over!

17
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:40,355
- Get over!
- Slow down, slow down! Slow down!

18
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,565
Slow down. Slow down.
Slow down.

19
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:46,317
<i>And I never felt so free</i>

20
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,980
<i>Oh, there had to be a crossroad</i>

21
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,610
<i>- Hey!
- A place to draw the line</i>

22
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:55,788
<i>- Come on, come on.
- And it came down to the question</i>

23
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:59,919
<i>- Open up.
- Is this life I'm livin' mine</i>

24
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,540
Defenders of the nation,
I bid thee a fond farewell.

25
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,674
Make a million.
Make a million, buddy.

26
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,725
<i>I wanna find the edge</i>

27
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:20,311
<i>Risk it all to win</i>

28
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:23,850
<i>I wanna see those eyes
in the mirror</i>

29
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,696
<i>Full of fire again</i>

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,485
<i>I wanna be wild again</i>

31
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,283
<i>Wild again</i>

32
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,644
Mike! Mike, looky there.

33
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,519
Mike, look at that.

34
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:02,559
Look at that.
You see that city out there, kid?

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,232
See that big town? One day,
we're gonna own that town, you and me.

36
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,698
What do you think of that?
Yeah.

37
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,319
Smart kid.

38
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,779
<i>There has to be a crossroad</i>

39
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,075
<i>A place to draw the line</i>

40
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,251
<i>And it comes down to the question</i>

41
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,963
<i>What is theirs and what is mine</i>

42
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,418
<i>Wild again</i>

43
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,754
<i>Next stop, Barton Boulevard.</i>

44
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:27,814
Hey!

45
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:31,651
Uncle Pat, you'd better be careful or
you're gonna throw that back out again.

46
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,779
Don't worry about me.
I can handle it.

47
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,821
So, home from the wars, huh?

48
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:40,411
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm doing fine.

49
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,072
Servicing all the widows
in the neighborhood now.

50
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,876
Same old Uncle Pat.

51
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,579
Flat beer from rusty pipes.

52
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,964
If you only knew
how I missed it.

53
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,887
You might have changed a lot,
but they sure didn't beat
the wise guy out of you.

54
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,008
- Not a chance of that.
- I saved the apartment for you.

55
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,017
I sublet it to a couple of yuppies.
They loved your mother's furniture.

56
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:03,676
They said it was quaint.

57
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:06,227
I still remember the day
they came to repossess it.

58
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,151
Yeah, well...
So what are you gonna do now?

59
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,025
Make a million.

60
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:17,238
Well, in the meantime,
I'll ask McDougal to give you a job
while you're waiting.

61
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,987
No way!

62
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,662
- It was good enough for your old man.
- So was arthritis.

63
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,786
He supported a family,
just like you're gonna have to do.

64
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:29,293
No, not me. I am not
falling into that trap.

65
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:32,216
Every man wakes up one fine
morning with a wife and kids.

66
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,970
"Where'd they come from?
They weren't there last time I looked."

67
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,544
That's 'cause most things
in life, good and bad...

68
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,130
just kind of happen to you.

69
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:42,467
Well, I'm gonna make
things happen for me.

70
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,352
Sure you will.

71
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:46,514
That'll be a buck
for the beer.

72
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,108
What?

73
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:53,894
Your nephew comes home
from serving his country...

74
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:56,148
and he doesn't even rate
a beer on the house?

75
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,408
- You don't get rich giving things away.
- Oh, how do you get rich?

76
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,745
I'm gonna give you
your first lesson on the house.

77
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:05,038
I've been here 25 years.

78
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,581
Never bought a drink.
Right, Eddie?

79
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,128
I can testify to that!

80
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:12,831
In 1969, the Mets
won the World Series.

81
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:17,338
Eddie here starts pounding on the bar,
demanding a round on the house.

82
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,964
"Drinks for everybody," he says.
Tell him what I did, Eddie.

83
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:25,720
He whacked me with a club.
Almost knocked the eye out of my head!

84
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,852
That's your way of making money?

85
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,561
You outwork, outthink,
outscheme and outmaneuver.

86
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,059
You make no friends
and trust nobody.

87
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:35,561
And you make damn sure
you're the smartest guy in the room...

88
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:38,692
whenever the subject
of money comes up.

89
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:43,078
I don't know, Uncle Pat.
Doesn't sound like too much fun to me.

90
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,915
Fun? You want fun,
you go play at the beach.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,791
Think I'll try the city first.

92
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:51,328
Well, here.
This'll get you there in style.

93
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:55,171
Ooh! Ten dollars. Uncle Pat!

94
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,381
Why don't you buy Eddie
a binge on me, huh?

95
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:02,177
Eddie, you gotta be
quicker than that, man.

96
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,786
I've always wanted
to work on Wall Street.

97
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,954
<i>I read the Journal.
I know what's going on today...</i>

98
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,206
and I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to succeed.

99
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,466
I appreciate that, Flanagan, but all
our professionals have college degrees.

100
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:40,344
I catch on pretty quick.

101
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,837
- You're wasting your time.
- Just forget the Street.
- No.

102
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:45,340
- We're not interested.
- A guy like you: Advertising.

103
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,178
I have a feel for advertising.

104
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,187
I mean, I can look at an ad
and tell you what's wrong with it.

105
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,645
Mr. Flanagan,
we need solid credentials.

106
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:55,688
- A marketing degree is a prerequisite.
- Try the networks.

107
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,112
In the army, I spent a lot of time
in communications.
I think I can help you.

108
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,606
Well, we need somebody
who can hit the ground running.

109
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,026
Maybe in six or
eight months, but...

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,912
You should pursue
other avenues.

111
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,832
- Maybe you should reenlist.
- I believe in positive thinking.

112
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:12,167
Never quit. Never say "die."
I want to be part of the team.

113
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:16,962
- So, what do you think?
- Your résumé is completely inadequate.

114
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,004
- I'm willing to start at the bottom.
- You're aiming too high.

115
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,633
- I'll do anything.
- You don't have enough experience.

116
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:25,427
- No, I need a job.
- We value education.

117
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,925
- We require a degree.
- You should go to college.

118
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:04,712
- The bar's closed, pal.
- I know. I'm looking for the manager.

119
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:08,555
What's the matter?
Find a hair in your quiche?

120
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,644
No. I'm looking for a job.

121
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:15,518
I see. You want to put a hair
in somebody else's quiche.

122
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,982
- Just get canned?
- I'm looking...

123
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,147
Looking for
something better.

124
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,366
Coughlin's Law:

125
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,115
"Anything else
is always something better."

126
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:28,864
Coughlin's Law?

127
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,791
Douglas Coughlin,
logical negativist.

128
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,580
Flourished in the last part
of the 20th century.

129
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,754
Propounded a set of laws that
the world generally ignored...

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,631
to its detriment.

131
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:40,748
Me.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,889
- Ever work behind the bar?
- My uncle's in the business.

133
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,758
You know how to make a "Red Eye,"
mister... What's your name?

134
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:51,009
Brian Flanagan.
No, I'm...

135
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,262
sorry I haven't had
the pleasure as yet.

136
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:56,273
What about a vodka martini
with a Pernod float?

137
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,565
I'm a fast learner.

138
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,106
Ever throw a 400-pound
psychopath out of a bar?

139
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,238
I guess I could if I had to.

140
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,659
What about a 100-pound ballerina
that's been speeding for three days?

141
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:11,617
Just open the door and let her
pirouette out in the street?

142
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,625
Well, these are just some of the tasks
you'll be asked to perform,
young Flanagan.

143
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:20,046
This is the Upper East Side,
the saloon capital of the world.
The big time.

144
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:23,217
Are you ready for the big time,
young Mr. Flanagan?

145
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,638
I think I can handle it.

146
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,891
- Get your act together!
- Vodka and Rose's, please!

147
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,060
Hey, come on, man!
I got four people waiting for me!
I'm not going back there
with three drinks!

148
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,143
I know! It's coming!

149
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,988
Absolut on the rocks,
Gilbey's and tonic, and a Velvet Hammer.

150
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:45,990
- This isn't what I ordered!
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre!

151
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:49,444
- What was that?
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre!

152
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:54,573
What is this,
"hire the handicapped" week?

153
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,621
If you're gonna sit in the water,
go to Coney Island!

154
00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:59,455
You want me
to bite the top off this?

155
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,955
Here. This has got recipes.

156
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,798
- Ordering a Cuba Libre!
- Could I please have a glass of water?

157
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:08,460
- He doesn't know how to make it!
- Where's my Jim Beam on the rocks?

158
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,140
It's coming!

159
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,976
I'm not leaving
until I get my Cuba Libre!

160
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:15,303
Excuse me.
Could I have an Orgasm?

161
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,397
- This isn't what I ordered!
- A white wine.

162
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,143
You bitch!

163
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:22,274
Why didn't you just tell me
it was a rum and Coke?

164
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,612
- Could I have what I ordered?
- A Bloody Mary.

165
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,272
- A white wine.
- Pink Squirrel!

166
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:29,862
- A Friar Tuck!
- A Ding-a-ling!

167
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:32,444
- A white wine!
- Pink Squirrel!

168
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,330
- Angel Tit!
- A Dirty Mother!

169
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,907
- Can I have what I ordered?
- All right!

170
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,078
All right! Now, what was it
that you ordered?

171
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,163
A martini!

172
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,047
What's in that?

173
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,763
You're supposed to get
ten percent from the waitresses.

174
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,317
I don't deserve it.

175
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:05,102
Hey, schmuck, do you get
money from girls every day?

176
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,355
Listen, I'm sorry
I called you a bitch.

177
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,320
Why? I am a bitch.

178
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:14,236
Got yourself a new disciple?

179
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,039
Good night, my beautiful.

180
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,375
Hey, frogman.

181
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,247
Anyone that can get money
out of her is a major talent.

182
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,915
Come back next Thursday.
I've got five shifts open.

183
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:27,546
- You're offering me a job?
- Uh-huh.

184
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,798
The waitresses hate me.

185
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:35,846
Well, you wait till
you've given them crabs.

186
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,509
Then you'll really know hatred.

187
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:58,830
Today I'd like to continue
our discussion of the demand
for money by focusing on...

188
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,997
the money multiplier.

189
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:04,035
You've got to add increases in currency,
deposits, reserves and bank credit
along the whole system.

190
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,124
Then what we have is a sum
of an infinite series.

191
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,624
Adding together the increases
in currency and deposits...

192
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:12,088
we find that they add up
to one plus CU over CU plus RE.

193
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:14,719
That, simply stated,
is the money multiplier.

194
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,718
Now, moving on.

195
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,515
The essential technique
of bartending:

196
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,811
Less is more.

197
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,642
The less you pour,
the more you score.

198
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,059
The boss does better,
we do better.

199
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,019
And the customer?

200
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:30,897
Think of the customer as a hurdler
thinks of a hurdle: A means to an end.

201
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,901
We dazzle him with ice work...

202
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,532
we baffle him with bottle work.

203
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,863
There are many ways
to fool a customer.

204
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:39,831
The short pour.

205
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,083
The long pour.

206
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,247
The ice mountain,
the spring thaw.

207
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,830
The speed-rack shuffle,
the hot shot.

208
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,167
You will learn them all.

209
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,419
Yes, Obi-Wan.

210
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,506
Both hands. Ladies, ladies,
come on, come on.

211
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,600
Okay, ready?
One, two, three, let go!

212
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,481
Yeah, what does it mean?

213
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,057
What does it mean? Nothing!

214
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:08,477
- Nothing?
- Nothing? All right!

215
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:10,943
Nothing?

216
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,111
Whoa!

217
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:18,654
- Very sophisticated, man!
- What a good jolt!

218
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,788
You got it going!

219
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,709
Come on, let's go with the drinks.
I'm making money tonight.

220
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,928
Let's make some money
for a change!

221
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,351
Ice!

222
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,724
- Catch!
- Thank you!

223
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,730
I guess that's what
you learn in college, right?

224
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,196
What buns! See?

225
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,532
Don't forget my beers, Bri!

226
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,038
- Missed me.
- Ha!

227
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,256
See, the name of the game
is "woman."

228
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,549
The little darlings
come in a-panting.

229
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:17,302
Their little hearts are pitter-patting
for the handsome, all-knowing bartender.

230
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,395
And in their wake,
a parade of slobbering geeks...

231
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:25,262
with one hand on their crotches
and the other hand on their wallets.

232
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,520
You get the women, you get the bucks.
And boy, oh, boy, you've got them.

233
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,734
Buttons were popping,
skirts were rising.

234
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:34,064
When you can see
the color of their panties...

235
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:36,862
then you know
you've got talent.

236
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,360
Stick with me, son.
I'll make you a star.

237
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,577
Thanks, man,
but I gotta be honest.

238
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:44,701
This is just
a part-time gig for me.

239
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,201
I'm in a business programme,
City College, days.

240
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,917
Ah. A seeker of wisdom and truth.

241
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,967
You couldn't have found a better
work-study programme than right here.

242
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:59,466
- To a future leader of America.
- I'll stick with the brew.

243
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,725
Beer is for breakfast around here.
Drink or be gone.

244
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,865
I realize I've got a class
of budding capitalists here.

245
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:20,117
That most of you are seeking
the fast track...

246
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,579
lovely term...

247
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:26,575
to a career in investment banking
or some other socially useful pursuit.

248
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,835
Nevertheless,
certain antiquated skills...

249
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,080
such as reading and writing...

250
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,582
remain a part
of the curriculum.

251
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,843
So, for your first assignment...

252
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,172
I'd like you to write
your own obituaries.

253
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:45,307
Not that I wish you were dead.
At least not yet, anyway.

254
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,353
Brian Flanagan.

255
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,308
Senator Brian Flan...
Billionaire governor...

256
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,697
Brian Flanagan, whose self-propelled,
meteoric rise to wealth and fame...

257
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,946
would have made even
J.D. Rockefeller envious...

258
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,539
died early yesterday morning
at the age of 99...

259
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:09,369
while bedding his
18-year-old seventh wife, Heidi...

260
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,083
who is recovering from exhaustion
at the local hospital...

261
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,542
and will be unable
to attend the funeral.

262
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,174
For your midterm paper...

263
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:25,263
I want you to select a business
in which you are interested...

264
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:29,686
and to prepare a complete plan
for its development.

265
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:33,688
You should include
capitalization...

266
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:36,269
administrative costs...

267
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:39,033
income prospectus...

268
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,240
marketing...

269
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,201
cost analysis...

270
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,870
Blue shirt, fifth row, wake up!

271
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,039
Ah! Light dawns
on marble head.

272
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,335
Where was I?

273
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,426
Yeah! Whoo!

274
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,808
<i>Can't get enough, you know</i>

275
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:11,058
<i>You're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love</i>

276
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:15,063
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

277
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,775
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

278
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:24,113
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

279
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:28,367
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

280
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,670
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

281
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:36,752
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

282
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:41,219
<i>Might as well face it
You're addicted to love</i>

283
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:45,219
I have got serious "fuck me" eyes
coming over here.

284
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,882
Stay in formation. Her old man's
coming in right behind her.

285
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,043
Finnegan, Finnegan.

286
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:15,873
Time, time.

287
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,756
Oh, shit.

288
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,552
- Brian.
- Huh?

289
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:27,970
- Bottle.
- Yeah.

290
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,640
- Brian.
- Yeah.

291
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,604
Try and make it by closing,
would you?

292
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:37,024
I'm doing the best I can!
Okay?

293
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,363
Sexual frustration.

294
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,948
I asked you to prepare
a business plan...

295
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,789
a seemingly simple assignment.

296
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:52,875
And yet one word
describes your papers:

297
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,869
Bankrupt!

298
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:57,168
Bankrupt!

299
00:19:57,256 --> 00:20:00,340
A word some of you will get
to know well in the future.

300
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,917
Like Mr. Ron Lemaster.
Where is Ronnie Lemaster?

301
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:04,043
Yes...

302
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,305
our cosmetics magnate
who hopes to make his fortune...

303
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,847
selling make-up for pets!

304
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,887
Fetch, Ronnie, fetch.

305
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,439
Good boy.

306
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,727
And my own personal favorite,
Mrs. Sheila Rivkin.

307
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,396
Oh, my God.
He's got my paper.

308
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:23,615
Mrs. Rivkin has spent the last 20 years
burning her husband's dinners...

309
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:26,369
but now decides she wants
to become the Donald Trump...

310
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:28,860
of the cookie business... You!

311
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,865
You! You have
something to contribute?

312
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,413
I just said it wasn't worth
getting upset about.

313
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:37,586
- What's your name?
- Brian Flanagan.

314
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:40,838
Now speak up!
Let the class hear you.

315
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,799
- Brian Flanagan!
- Oh, yes, Flanagan.

316
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,008
Mr. Flanagan.
Mr. Brian Flanagan.

317
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:47,135
Let us see.

318
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,679
Yes, Mr. Flanagan is determined...

319
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,843
to revolutionize
the bar business...

320
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:55,270
by franchising his version
of the local New York tavern...

321
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:58,061
to every suburban
shopping mall in America.

322
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,025
Tell me, Mr. Flanagan...

323
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:03,562
do you intend to provide
the smell of stale beer?

324
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,112
Or perhaps a surly bartender...

325
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,952
and three boring drunks
to each outlet?

326
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:12,038
I don't know.
You looking for another job?

327
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,449
Ah. A diamond in the rough.

328
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:18,213
The dreamer who can't
take the criticism.

329
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:21,914
Not from a guy who hides here 'cause
he can't hack it in the real world.

330
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,552
Okay, Flanagan.

331
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,879
Let's see how well you hack it
in the real world...

332
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,965
with an "F" in this course.

333
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,338
"F!"

334
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:38,144
Not a goddam thing any one
of those professors says...

335
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,558
makes a difference
on the street.

336
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:42,894
If you know that,
you're ready to graduate.

337
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:52,235
Maybe I'm just too old
to be a student.

338
00:21:58,128 --> 00:21:59,456
Christ.

339
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:04,255
I've got to find something...
something to do.

340
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,798
Relax.
You're in the perfect job.

341
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:10,884
There's no better way to make it
than behind three feet of mahogany.

342
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,263
Within one square mile
of this saloon...

343
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,759
lies the greatest concentration
of wealth in the world.

344
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:18,063
Yes...

345
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,390
but how is a bartender...

346
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:22,560
gonna get his hands
on any of it?

347
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,104
A bartender is the aristocrat
of the working class.

348
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,817
He can make all kinds of moves
if he's smart.

349
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:33,912
There are investors out there.
There are angels.

350
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,871
There are suckers.

351
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,291
There are rich women with
nothing to do with their money.

352
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:44,001
You can stand in this bar
and you can be struck by lightning.

353
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,084
I've seen it happen.

354
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,464
- Shall I continue?
- Oh, please do.

355
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:56,717
<i>Chantilly lace
and a pretty face</i>

356
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,683
<i>And a ponytail
just a-hangin' down</i>

357
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:02,609
<i>A wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk</i>

358
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,650
<i>Makes the world go round</i>

359
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:07,406
<i>There ain't nothin' in the world
like a big-eyed girl</i>

360
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:10,526
<i>Make me act so funny
Make me spend my money</i>

361
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:14,662
<i>Make me feel loose
Like a real live goose</i>

362
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:17,452
<i>Oh, baby, that's what I like</i>

363
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:22,668
It is not dignified
to get this drunk.

364
00:23:22,755 --> 00:23:25,210
- You are in training.
- I'm in training?

365
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,422
- For stardom.
- For stardom?

366
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,419
I don't care how liberated
this world becomes...

367
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:31,884
- a man will always be judged
on the amount of alcohol...
- I knew I was in training for something.

368
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:33,383
He can consume.

369
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:35,846
- Always.
- And a woman will be impressed...

370
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:38,722
whether she likes it or not.

371
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:42,180
- Now, come on.
- I'm not gonna make it.

372
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:46,652
You are. A star never pukes
or passes out in public.

373
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,196
No.

374
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:49,739
Aah!

375
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:54,658
Holy shit.

376
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:57,737
Hey, are you okay?

377
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,495
You alive?

378
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,629
However...

379
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,673
falling down stairs is allowed.

380
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:15,929
Whoops!

381
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,598
Sure you don't want a slice?

382
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,775
For breakfast?
You've gotta be joking.

383
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,395
- It's better than a Red Eye.
- Not for a hangover.

384
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,944
Coughlin's Diet:

385
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,820
Cocktails and dreams.

386
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:37,663
Hey, that's not
a bad name for a joint.

387
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:40,285
You know, we really ought to think
about setting up our own place.

388
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,035
That takes money.

389
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:47,002
The kind of money your sacred books
dangle but never deliver.

390
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,083
They deliver.

391
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,927
You just gotta know
how to read.

392
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,973
I mean, come on.
We could make a fortune!

393
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,225
I mean, that's why you came to New York.
That's sure as hell why I left Queens.

394
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,518
Positive!
Positive thinking!

395
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:06,809
You can't let a little thing
like cash stand in our way.

396
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,564
Cocktails and Dreams.

397
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:12,482
Cocktails and Dreams.

398
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,567
I see it in pink neon.

399
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:17,233
Blink, blink, dinkity-blink.

400
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,828
That is a little corny, isn't it?
But I could live with it.

401
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:24,783
Yes, but can I live
with young Flanagan?

402
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:29,537
Well, maybe I could
handle a partner.

403
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,175
All right!

404
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,133
All right! Fifty-fifty.

405
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,636
A partner who knows his place.
Seventy-thirty.

406
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:41,092
Well, you do have your pension
to think about...

407
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,475
so I will settle for sixty-forty.

408
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:48,062
To health and friendship.

409
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,318
Life and love.

410
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,977
- Our future.
- To our future.

411
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:55,196
Let's do it.
Let's really do it.

412
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:59,277
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it!

413
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:02,657
- Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Yeah!

414
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,826
- Let's do it.
- Okay!

415
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,661
One, two, three, do it!

416
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,175
<i>You shake it to the left
You shake it to the right</i>

417
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,594
<i>You do the hippy shake-shake
with all of your might</i>

418
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,218
<i>Oh, shake</i>

419
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:21,265
<i>The hippy hippy shake</i>

420
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:23,012
Yeah!

421
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,725
<i>It's in the bag</i>

422
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:28,103
<i>The hippy hippy shake</i>

423
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,559
<i>The hippy hippy shake</i>

424
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,484
<i>The hippy hippy shake</i>

425
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,234
Yeah! Whoo!

426
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,452
Beautiful!
Listen... Hey, listen!

427
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:49,747
Why the fuck are two stars like you
wasting your talent in a hole like this?

428
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,045
- A secret admirer!
- No, I'm serious!

429
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,256
I got the hottest saloon in town.

430
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:57,593
I want you guys working for me.
In two weeks, you'll be famous.

431
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,551
I've been famous for ten years.
Just give me the money.

432
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,726
<i>I got the hippy hippy shake</i>

433
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,526
<i>- She walks down the street
knockin' them dead
- Hey, wait in line!</i>

434
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:16,530
<i>Store window dummies
even turn their heads</i>

435
00:27:16,616 --> 00:27:18,026
<i>Sure 'nuff</i>

436
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,403
<i>Powerful stuff</i>

437
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,116
<i>I think I'm in love</i>

438
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,130
<i>And it's powerful stuff</i>

439
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:35,548
I am the world's
first yuppie poet.

440
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,846
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit!

441
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:43,181
The poem is entitled
"The Bottom Line."

442
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,059
Stick it in your Volvo!

443
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:47,814
"'Money isn't everything,' they say.

444
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,182
Okay, so what is? Sex?"

445
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:53,185
It's better than sushi!

446
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,603
"Did you ever make love to a pauper?

447
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:58,270
- Pee-yoo!"
- I'd rather hump a camel!

448
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,695
"Revolution?

449
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:02,619
It takes money to overthrow
the government, you know."

450
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,447
Whoa, that's deep.

451
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,742
"Art? The more it costs,
the better it is.

452
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,455
And that's the bottom line!"

453
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,623
- Crap.
- Bullshit!

454
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:17,843
- Who wants a drink?
- Who wants a drink?

455
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:21,877
More poets! More poets!
More poets! More poets!

456
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:24,096
We want more!

457
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,312
All right!

458
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:33,271
- Yes!
- Yeah, man!

459
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,352
All right, Brian!

460
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,865
- You want poets?
- Yes, we do!

461
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,238
- You want poets?
- Yeah!

462
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:46,788
I am the world's
last barman poet.

463
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,741
Give us a kiss,
you sexy beast!

464
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,953
Go for it.

465
00:28:52,838 --> 00:28:55,755
I see America drinking...

466
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:58,379
the fabulous cocktails I make.

467
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:02,878
America's getting stinking
on something I stir or shake.

468
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:07,560
- The Sex on the Beach...
- Yeah!

469
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:09,933
The schnapps
made from peach...

470
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:13,473
the Velvet Hammer,
the Alabama Slammer.

471
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:16,853
I make things with juice and froth...

472
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:21,488
- the Pink Squirrel,
the Three-Toed Sloth.
- Make me one!

473
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:24,611
I make drinks
so sweet and snazzy...

474
00:29:24,703 --> 00:29:27,373
the Iced Tea, the Kamikaze.

475
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:31,666
The Orgasm.

476
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,667
Hands off the merchandise!

477
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:38,337
The Death Spasm.

478
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:44,220
- The Singapore Sling, the Ding-a-ling.
- Ding-a-ling?

479
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,976
America, you're just devoted...

480
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,182
to every flavor I've got.

481
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,558
Oh, baby!

482
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,972
But if you want to get loaded...

483
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:57,850
why don't you just order a shot?

484
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,621
Bar's open!

485
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:19,081
I'd like to try
the Orgasm, please.

486
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,550
How many would you like?

487
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:26,465
- Uh, multiple.
- Multiple?

488
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,225
Well, then, why don't we start
with a Turquoise Blue?

489
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:44,071
<i>Well, bless my soul
What's wrong with me</i>

490
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:46,530
<i>I'm itchin' like a man

<i>My friends say I'm actin'

492
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,033
<i>I'm in love
I'm all shook up</i>

493
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:59,047
Yeah! Yeah! Wow! Baby!

494
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,672
You guys are crazy!

495
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,465
<i>Well, my hands are shakin'
and my knees are weak</i>

496
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:08,307
<i>I can't even stand
on my own two feet</i>

497

498
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:13,349
<i>I'm in love
I'm all shook up</i>

499
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,932
Yeah!

500
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,858
Oh, my God!

501
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:30,364
That was fantastic!
That was great!

502
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,827
- You gotta let me take your picture.
- What for?

503
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:35,621
<i>When you're a big celebrity,
I'll put you in Rolling Stone magazine.</i>

504
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,284
- Is that right?
- My protégé. I discovered him.

505
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,381
That's great. Can you move aside,
though? I can't fit you both in.

506
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,800
- Excuse me.
- You look great.

507
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,594
<i>All messed up</i>

508
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:57,814

when I try to speak</i>

510
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,523
<i>My insides shake
like a leaf on a tree</i>

511
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:10,239
<i>There's only one cure
for this body of mine</i>

512
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,246
<i>That's to have that girl
right here, right now</i>

513
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,704
<i>When she touched my hand
what a thrill I got</i>

514
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:18,535
<i>Her lips are like
a volcano that's hot</i>

515
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:20,835
<i>I'm proud to say
that she's my buttercup</i>

516
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:24,256
<i>I'm in love
I'm all shook up</i>

517
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,140
You with the cold hands!

518
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,487
I gotta go.

519
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:49,200
- Tuesday night?
- Tuesday? I'm working.

520
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:51,954
So? I'll sit at the end of the bar
and wait until closing.

521
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,575
Isn't that what
all the bartenders' girlfriends do?

522
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,034
All right.

523
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,832
- Bye.
- Get in there.
You're gonna catch pneumonia.

524
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:16,432
Get out!
Get out of there. Back off!

525
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,932
Get up, damn it.
Get up!

526
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:23,101
God, look at that clown.
Get up!

527
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,103
Good night, sweet prince.

528
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:28,528
Looks like one
of our customers.

529
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:31,451
That bum just cost me
50 bucks.

530
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,026
So what's this great idea
I'm here to piss on?

531
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:40,207
Well, I have been
doing some research...

532
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:43,829
into what it'll cost to set up
Cocktails and Dreams.

533
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:46,628
Now what I have found is,
if we find the right location...

534
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,461
do our own renovation...

535
00:33:48,553 --> 00:33:51,090
we can start it up
for as little as 75,000 cash.

536
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,430
Ah, which the tooth fairy will
deliver to our doorstep, hmm?

537
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,222
No, man.

538
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,225
Which we make in Jamaica, man.

539
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,058
Oh, God, Brian.

540
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,934
I like that. Mmm!
Jamaica, south of Soho.

541
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,068
Oh, yeah, man.
Very south of Soho.

542
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:10,148
The Caribbean,
Jamaica, man.

543
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,317
I was down there last month
doing a shoot...

544
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,660
and I met this bartender
who makes $300 to $400 a day.

545
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:17,122
A day! Whoo!

546
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,282
And he didn't have
any of the talent of you guys.

547
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,368
I should hope not.

548
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:24,378
Winter in the tropics,
spring in New York.

549
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:27,414
Jet-set bartenders, eh?

550
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:29,300
See, we could live
for peanuts down there.

551
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:32,470
There are no taxes.
Cash off the books.

552
00:34:32,555 --> 00:34:34,049
Two, maybe three seasons,
and we are in business.

553
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,678
So you want to wait three years?

554
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,759
I've told you.
New York is where the angels are.

555
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,728
Aw, come on. This is...

556
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,566
- This is a real opportunity!
- Oh, yeah.

557
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:48,102
- We'll have a fantastic time.
- Will we?

558
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:53,234
- Carl, huh?
- Coral. English. Coral.

559
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:54,737
Coral.

560
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:57,490
Yes!

561
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,789
Why is it do you think these chicks are
always named after inanimate objects?

562
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:04,414
There's nothing
inanimate about Coral.

563
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:07,042
Hot number, huh?

564
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:08,792
Yes!

565
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:11,754
- Good shot.
- Ten bucks behind the line?

566
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,221
Sure. Shoot till you miss.

567
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,263
- All right.
- Where does Coral live?

568
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:20,475
76th Street.
She's got a brownstone.

569
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,060
She owns the whole
fucking building.

570
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:26,065
You don't think she lives in
that building all by herself, do you?

571
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,859
That's a bit lucky.

572
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:30,862
- See any pictures?
- Of guys? No.

573
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:36,447
- That's 30 bucks you owe me.
- Jesus Christ.

574
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,074
- I know!
- The man's on a roll,
ladies and gentlemen.

575
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:42,533
She's been saving herself
for young Flanagan all these years?

576
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:45,164
- Maybe she hides the pictures
when she goes out.
- Oh.

577
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:47,045
Have a look
on her ring finger.

578
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,419
See if there's a white circle
from her wedding band.

579
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,132
Man, are you paranoid.

580
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,720
Listen, it's the difference
between a one-nighter...

581
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,724
and a meaningful relationship
with an unattached millionairess.

582
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,886
Hey, I'm not thinking
about her that way, okay?

583
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:04,221
This is more than
just a one-night stand.

584
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:07,683
- This lady's gonna do
a number on you, mate.
- I appreciate the concern.

585
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:12,898
That's 50 bucks
you owe me.

586
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:15,650
- Fifty bucks?
- Fifty bucks.

587
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:17,782
Fifty bucks says
Coral's in the sack...

588
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,946
with some other guy
before the week's out.

589
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:23,249
That's a bet.

590
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,038
Missed.

591
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:31,834
Whoo, yeah, hey.

592
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,383
- Hey.
- Hi, how are you?

593
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:44,554
Okay. How are you?

594
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,041
Keep it.

595
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,287
Brian?

596
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,706
- What'll you have?
- A screwdriver.

597
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,670
- What?
- Screwdriver!

598
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:14,759
I take it back. You're not
going to be famous.

599
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:18,047
Too bad you couldn't keep your
mouth shut about our sex life.

600
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,464
It only gets better.

601
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:28,349
You made a move
on Coral?

602
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:29,520
I had to get
my money back.

603
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:31,483
You knew how
I felt about her.

604
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:33,478
How could you feel anything
for an assembly line hump...

605
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:35,480
that does the book
on the first date?

606
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:38,859
I did you a favor.
Took her off your hands
before she really twisted your mind.

607
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:43,113
You fucking
son of a bitch.

608
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:45,115
Coughlin's Law:
Never tell tales about a woman.

609
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,580
She'll hear you
no matter how far away she is.

610
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:50,206
Come on!
Come on!

611
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,752
- Can't take the truth, eh?
- Bullshit!

612
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:55,462
It was nothing but
taking a cheap shot at me.

613
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:57,544
Where I come from,
you don't do that to your friends.

614
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:01,338
Where you come from,
they're still saluting the flag
and making novenas.

615
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,678
And no brawling in here.

616
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,685
- And that goes for the help as well.
- Come on!

617
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,261
I don't work here
any more.

618
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:10,148
If you want to cut me,
come on!

619
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,775
You'll thank me
for this one day.

620
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:17,523
The fuck I will.

621
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:24,487
Hey! Hey!

622
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:36,837
<i>Bodies in the sand</i>

623
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:41,055
<i>Tropical drink
melting in your hand</i>

624
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:43,215
<i>We'll be falling in love</i>

625
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:47,222
<i>To the rhythm of a steel band</i>

626
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:48,806
<i>Down in Kokomo</i>

627
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:52,396
<i>Aruba, Jamaica
Ooh, I wanna take ya</i>

628
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:54,940
<i>To Bermuda, Bahama</i>

629
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,021
<i>Come on, pretty mama</i>

630
00:38:57,114 --> 00:38:59,023
<i>Key Largo, Montego</i>

631
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:03,196
<i>Ooh, I wanna take you
down to Kokomo</i>

632
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:07,450
<i>We'll get there fast
and then we'll take it slow</i>

633
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:12,084
<i>That's where we wanna go</i>

634
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,708
<i>Way down to Kokomo</i>

635
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:26,724
Buddy. Hey, buddy!

636
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,136
The name is not "buddy."
It's "pal."

637
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:34,398
The brochure promised me
a drink on the house, pal.

638
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:38,486
- I'll take one of those orange things.
- Excuse me, uh...

639
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:41,241
My friend just passed out
on the beach over there.
Do you have a phone anywhere?

640
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:44,279
No, no. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

641
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,037
She was, uh, drinking
champagne in the sun.

642
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:57,043
Champagne: Perfume going in,
sewage coming out.

643
00:39:57,132 --> 00:39:59,670
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Yeah, she's gonna be okay.

644
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,669
Uh, could somebody go down
to the condo office...

645
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:03,256
- and have them call an ambulance?
- Yeah, sure.

646
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:06,383
Just in case.
Let's get her up.

647
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:12,184
The doctor will probably
give her a shot of Ipecac.

648
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:14,728
I don't want
anything more to drink.

649
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:17,688
Oh, don't worry.
It'll make you feel better.
It'll help you throw up.

650
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,735
I don't want
to throw up.

651
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,278
Oh, God, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

652
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,077
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

653
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,488
She can never
make up her mind.

654
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:32,203
Hey, Brian. I gotta
hit the road, man.

655
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:35,045
Okay, Owen.

656
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,871
Well, goodbye.

657
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,875
It has been an adventure.

658
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,346
Mm-hmm.

659
00:40:46,307 --> 00:40:48,845
Owen will take care of you.

660
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:54,142
<i>Here's a little song I wrote</i>

661
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,398
<i>You might want to sing it
note for note</i>

662
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:58,600
<i>Don't worry</i>

663
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,067
<i>Be happy</i>

664
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:08,659
<i>Every life we have
some trouble</i>

665
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:11,237
<i>When you worry
you make it double</i>

666
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:12,577
<i>Don't worry</i>

667
00:41:14,794 --> 00:41:16,586
<i>Be happy</i>

668
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:19,542
- Mark, I haven't forgotten about you.
- No problem.

669
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:23,132
Welcome to my most humble,
dishonorable establishment.

670
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,927
Well, thank you.

671
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:28,429
My worthless, useless services
are at your disposal.

672
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:32,181
Um, I wanted to, uh, come by and
thank you for helping out yesterday.

673
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,559
That's all right.
How's she doing?

674
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:37,055
She, uh, has a hangover.

675
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:42,146
Can I buy you a drink?
One of my rum specialties, perhaps?

676
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,614
I'll have a beer.

677
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:44,730
Beer.

678
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:47,862
My kind of woman.

679
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:55,949
- Hey, guys, how're you doing?
- I'll have the same, Brian.

680
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,998
So it seems like happy hour
all day around here.

681
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:00,832
Yes, happy hour.

682
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:05,919
That great American invention
for spending quality time
with spouse soused.

683
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:10,259
<i>- A bartender
with a line for everything.
- Yeah, the bartender.</i>

684
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,600
The highest evolution
of the species:

685
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,098
"Boozus New Yorkus."

686
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:19,226
Whoa!

687
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:21,559
I used to work at a circus
before I got this job.

688
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,775
Excuse me.

689
00:42:32,956 --> 00:42:34,498
<i>Don't worry</i>

690
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:37,954
<i>Be happy</i>

691
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:45,545
<i>Ain't got no cash
Ain't got no style</i>

692
00:42:45,636 --> 00:42:48,590
<i>Ain't got no gal
to make you smile</i>

693
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,056
<i>But don't worry</i>

694
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,927
<i>Be happy</i>

695
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,771
Want to see a grown man
cry like a baby?

696
00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:58,398
Hey, Bartender.

697
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:00,938
You know how to make
a Red Eye?

698
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:04,189
<i>Don't worry</i>

699
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,816
<i>Be happy</i>

700
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:12,160
What, no tearful greeting?

701
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:13,954
Coughlin's Law:

702
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,325
Never show surprise.
Never lose your cool.

703
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:21,118
Oh, my son,
my rebellious son.

704
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:25,591
Tell your old buddy
how great he looks.

705
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:30,255
You look like a guy who dyes his hair
and shaves with a Brillo pad.

706
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:33,799
A guy who gets an erection
on his birthday, if the wind is right.

707
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:37,428
Isn't this great?
Two years we haven't seen each other,
and we just flow into the old act.

708
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,937
Please, stop molesting
the customers.

709
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:43,481
A daiquiri, if you will,
Bartender.

710
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:50,151
- I taught this young man
everything he knows.
- I doubt that.

711
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,828
Don't you waste your loyalty on him.
He'll dump you after Valentine's Day.

712
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,245
Isn't that clever?

713
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:06,375
What the hell are you
doing down here?

714
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:11,509
This lad is the best bartender
south of 14th Street.
It's his downfall.

715
00:44:11,597 --> 00:44:15,346
- I don't see how being good at
something can be your downfall.
- Thank you.

716
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:18,270
I grant you, it's not an easy
concept to grasp.

717
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,263
Now, you take our hero here.

718
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:22,930
I haven't seen him for a while, and
I've never been in this joint before...

719
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:28,566
but I will bet my bile duct he's got
some kind of success manual
behind the bar.

720
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:31,443
Come on, Flanagan,
I know it's here.

721
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,117
- Touché.
- Voila.

722
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,376
You see, Flanagan's a believer.
Always will be.

723
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:47,792
- He doesn't realize that the doors
are shut to people like us.
- Well, maybe he wants to open them.

724
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,675
Then he has to steal the key,
sweetheart.

725
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:52,299
Something Coughlin here
has been unable to do.

726
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:56,137
Hey, I don't have to, not any more.
I've had my miracle.

727
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,346
Oh, what? Some alky
remember you in his will?

728
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:03,100
Better.

729
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:04,733
I am in love.

730
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,855
Oh.

731
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,525
There is my miracle.

732
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:14,695
Who? Pocahontas over there,
waiting for everyone to notice her?

733
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:17,455
How dare you speak that way
about my wife.

734
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:23,954
- Your wife? In your dreams.
- For real.

735
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:28,171
We are here on our honeymoon.
Sweetheart!

736
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:32,511
Come hither.

737
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,266
You're married?

738
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:45,392
This is true love,
young Flanagan.

739
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:49,861
True love with a kicker.
She's got millions.

740
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:54,359
- Where were you? I thought
you drowned or something.
- No such luck.

741
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,785
Brian Flanagan, Kerry Coughlin.
The love of my life.

742
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:00,367
- Hello.
- Hi.

743
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,580
You see before you
a changed man.

744
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:05,373
The love of a good woman
has made me see the light.

745
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,040
Mmm.

746
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,752
<i>This magic moment</i>

747
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,375
<i>While your lips
are close to mine</i>

748
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,720
<i>Will last forever</i>

749
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,469
<i>Forever till the end of time</i>

750
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:24,682
Brian's cute.
How long have you known him?

751
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:27,561
About ten hours.

752
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,897
Excuse me.

753
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,983
There you go.

754
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:38,326
I have never seen a club
with such intense dance vibes.

755
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,571
Come on.
Let's decimate this dance floor.

756
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,126
I don't get the two of them.

757
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:52,338
Simple. She's just a little rich chick
whose family owns half of Manhattan.

758
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:56,258
And just to piss them off,
she decided to marry a bartender.

759
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,508
True love.

760
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:00,508
Let's dance?

761
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:03,306
<i>Sweeter than wine</i>

762
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:05,969
<i>And softer than
a summer night</i>

763
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:09,185
<i>Everything I want I have</i>

764
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:11,946
<i>Whenever I hold you tight</i>

765
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,654
<i>This magic moment</i>

766
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,947
<i>While your lips
are close to mine</i>

767
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,072
<i>Will last forever</i>

768
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:26,039
<i>Forever till the end of time</i>

769
00:47:26,127 --> 00:47:29,745
Do you ever have the feeling
that you might meet somebody?

770
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,706
You know, when you walk into
some place or something?

771
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:36,672
- Star-crossed lovers' syndrome?
- Mmm.

772
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:40,297
- No.
- Oh!

773
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,725
Because I had a premonition that
I was gonna meet somebody
when I came down here.

774
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:45,354
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

775
00:47:45,438 --> 00:47:47,976
Well, you still got time,
you know.

776
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:51,020
Some woman must have
really done a job on you.

777
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,483
Why does it always
have to be a woman?

778
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,231
Well, it doesn't.
Your friend, uh...

779
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:58,110
what's his name, Doug,
could have done it to you.

780
00:47:58,201 --> 00:47:59,612
What's this?

781
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:02,158
Immune to Coughlin's
fatal charms?

782
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:05,829
Give him a minute,
you'll love him. All women do.

783
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:08,871
Well, I'm not like all women.

784
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:12,378
- I'll give you that.
- Hmm?

785
00:48:12,465 --> 00:48:14,791
Of course,
I'm not like all men either.

786
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:18,882
You are an original
till you prove otherwise.

787
00:48:21,057 --> 00:48:24,142
Uh-oh. I better be careful
not to lose my unique status.

788
00:48:24,227 --> 00:48:26,136
Mmm.

789
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,489
So is this
one-night-stand time?

790
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:39,364
Doesn't make you
a bad person, you know.

791
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,195
Your parents own
half of Manhattan?

792
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,452
No!

793
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:51,205
Then your virtue's
quite safe with me.

794
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,205
For this evening anyway.

795
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:03,088
Come on.
I'll race you!

796
00:49:03,183 --> 00:49:04,974
<i>Tell myself I won't no more</i>

797
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,969
<i>But here I go again</i>

798
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,055
<i>The way I fought
so hard and fast</i>

799
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:10,891
<i>Think I've never been</i>

800
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,525
<i>In love, love, love</i>

801
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,816
<i>Like I've never been</i>

802
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:16,445
<i>In love, love, love</i>

803
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,365
<i>Here I go again</i>

804
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:20,908
<i>Heart aches
take it slow</i>

805
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:22,950
<i>You ain't got far to go</i>

806
00:49:23,036 --> 00:49:24,994
<i>And if you travel smooth</i>

807
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,037
<i>Life be a pleasure cruise</i>

808
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:28,998
<i>Heart aches
take it slow</i>

809
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:31,124
<i>You ain't got far to go</i>

810
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,121
<i>And if you travel smooth</i>

811
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:36,298
<i>Life be a pleasure cruise</i>

812
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:38,127
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

813
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:40,294
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

814
00:49:40,387 --> 00:49:42,214
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

815
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:44,298
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

816
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:46,218
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

817
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,303
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

818
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:50,103
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

819
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:52,312
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

820
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:54,475
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

821
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:00,904
Smile!

822
00:50:02,243 --> 00:50:04,449
So this is your profession?

823
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,654
More like my obsession.

824
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:11,283
- Does it pay the rent?
- Someday it will.

825
00:50:11,377 --> 00:50:15,161
Right now, though,
I'm waiting tables at Jerry's Deli.

826
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:17,248
Sure, I know the place.

827
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:19,334
Home of the famous
cement Danish.

828
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:21,588
Yeah, that's the one.

829
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,090
- Yeah.
- Hey!

830
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:27,182
Don't look.
It's not done.

831
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:29,841
- This doesn't look like me.
- It's the real you.

832
00:50:29,937 --> 00:50:32,607
You've captured
my innermost soul.

833
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,932
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.

834
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:37,896
Are you okay?

835
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:40,560
- Shit!
- Are you okay? Aww!

836
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,205
We should go on
one of those.

837
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,665
Tomorrow?

838
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:56,458
- You know,
there's a guy who makes these.
- One guy?

839
00:50:56,547 --> 00:50:59,003
He must be exhausted.

840
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:02,046
Yes, he is, but still,
he gets up in the morning...

841
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:05,256
and he kisses his wife, and he goes
to his drink umbrella factory...

842
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:09,049
where he rips off 10 billion
of these a year.

843
00:51:09,143 --> 00:51:10,887
This guy's a millionaire.

844
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:14,063
- How about the guy who makes these?
- How about that guy?

845
00:51:14,148 --> 00:51:17,482
Not to mention
the guy who makes these.

846
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:20,190
And those little wrappers
are made by another guy.

847
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,064
What about these plastic things
at the end of these laces?

848
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,485
Mmm. It's probably got
one of those weird names too...

849
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:29,452
like a "flugelbinder."

850
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:31,282
Flugelbinder, right.

851
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:36,786
We sit here, and we're
surrounded by millionaires.

852
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,837
You wrack your brains
day and night...

853
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,963
to try to come up with
a moneymaking scheme...

854
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:44,550
and some guy corners
the flugelbinder market.

855
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:48,089
Aw. Poor baby.
He's frustrated.

856
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:53,935
You get a bar job to keep
your days free for your real gig.

857
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:59,776
After work, you're so charged up,
you have a few drinks.
You know, hey, it's party time.

858
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:02,946
Days get shorter and shorter.
Nights, longer and longer.

859
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:06,067
Before you know it,
your life is just one long night...

860
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,279
with a few comatose
daylight hours.

861
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:14,699
Oh, God. Stop feeling so sorry
for yourself, Flanagan.

862
00:52:14,793 --> 00:52:19,040
Hey, your flugelbinder is out there
waiting to be discovered.

863
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:21,207
Waiting.

864
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:23,588
- Do you think so?
- I do.

865
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:04,213
No. Stay.

866
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,879
Stay there.

867
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:11,182
Uh-oh.

868
00:53:12,434 --> 00:53:13,383
Oh.

869
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:22,020
Ta-da!

870
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:29,992
<i>You know I'm a man</i>

871
00:53:30,077 --> 00:53:33,411
<i>I don't like to brag</i>

872
00:53:33,497 --> 00:53:35,371
<i>But it's been</i>

873
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:38,577
<i>Growin' into a feelin'</i>

874
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:40,329
<i>It's been a drag</i>

875
00:53:40,421 --> 00:53:41,880
<i>I know that I can</i>

876
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:46,507
<i>Run for the shelter
of your love</i>

877
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:55,685
<i>Run for the shelter
of your love</i>

878
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:02,603
<i>Run for the shelter
of your love</i>

879
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:11,733
<i>Run for the shelter
of your love</i>

880
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:17,165
- I wish we could stay here forever.
- Mmm.

881
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,120
I'd build a little hut
over there on the beach.

882
00:54:20,211 --> 00:54:22,204
I'd fish and pick coconuts.

883
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:24,704
No, I'd do the fishing
and coconut picking.

884
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,459
- No.
- Yes.

885
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:28,460
No, you would make thatched skirts
to sell to the tourists.

886
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,261
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

887
00:54:30,346 --> 00:54:32,672
Thatch one, purl two?

888
00:54:32,765 --> 00:54:36,680
Yeah.
And we'd never go home.

889
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:39,439
Our kids would look really great
in dreadlocks too.

890
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:42,270
Kids?

891
00:54:57,165 --> 00:54:59,834
How are you making out
with that little blond chippie?

892
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:03,251
How come I've always got the chippies,
and you're always with the princess?

893
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:06,422
That's a question
only you can answer.

894
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:09,295
This man's phenomenal.
Put him in a room full of women...

895
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:12,221
and he goes for the poorest
and the dumbest every single time.

896
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:15,681
The man's astounding.

897
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:18,056
His wife parades half naked
on the beach...

898
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:20,386
and he thinks she's
just there for the sun.

899
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,434
My wife does not need
other men.

900
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:26,526
You know what they say about
sexual vanity in men over 40?

901
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:30,989
- It's the first sign of senility.
- Please try to keep your envy in check.

902
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:32,901
Ooh, envy.

903
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:34,107
He's my protégé.

904
00:55:34,202 --> 00:55:36,278
I taught him all I know.

905
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:38,862
Together with a token,
it might get me on a subway.

906
00:55:38,957 --> 00:55:41,033
You can only
take a guy so far.

907
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:43,831
Then it's a question of biology.
Biology is destiny.

908
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,590
Ah, the old fool-osopher.

909
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:48,880
You see, there are two kinds
of people in this world:

910
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:50,924
The workers and the hustlers.

911
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:53,004
The hustlers never work
and the workers never hustle.

912
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:56,216
And you, my friend,
are a worker.

913
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:58,016
God knows I've tried to beat
that instinct out of him...

914
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:00,723
but it's there ingrained
in your immigrant blood.

915
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:04,182
Look how tasty your cocktails are.
Look how clean you keep your bar.

916
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:07,394
Why, man, you actually
take pride in your work.

917
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:11,735
I do not.

918
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:14,196
Is he or isn't he
a great bartender?

919
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:17,285
- Oh, the best.
- See, they love you.

920
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:20,824
Listen, Bozo, If you think
I'm stuck in this gig...

921
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:22,909
Face it,
you're a career proletarian.

922
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:27,082
You've been standing in a puddle
so long, you've got webbed feet.

923
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,880
Just because he get's lucky
with a rich chick...

924
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,718
Lucky, he says.
Why, you couldn't do it.

925
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:35,670
I've known this man for three years,
and believe me, he's not a closer.

926
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:40,177
This place is crawling
with moneyed females.

927
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:45,145
Case in point: Rich and ripe
and out of your league.

928
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,318
- Out of my league?
- Mm-hmm.

929
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:52,321
Well, she just happened to be here
checking me out the other night.

930
00:56:52,406 --> 00:56:55,324
Maybe she had
15 minutes to kill.

931
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,163
You know what it'd take to make a score
on a smart woman like that?

932
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,918
You'd have to get over on her,
her managers, her lawyers...

933
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:07,287
her trustees, her maid,
and her tennis coach.

934
00:57:09,674 --> 00:57:12,081
I've been training for this
my whole life.

935
00:57:12,176 --> 00:57:15,711
Well, 50 bucks...

936
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:19,968
says you don't even
make it over the bar.

937
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:24,104
Gentlemen, that's a bet.

938
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:26,893
You guys are in on this.
Be cool.

939
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:31,439
Mademoiselle.

940
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:33,854
Vodka on the rocks
with a squeeze of lime.

941
00:57:33,948 --> 00:57:35,573
Oh, no, no.
This is the tropics.

942
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:37,947
At least try a Jus D'Amour.

943
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:39,446
Pardon me.

944
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:43,286
A Jus D'Amour.
It means "juice of love."

945
00:57:43,374 --> 00:57:46,624
It's made with fresh fruit
right off the vine.

946
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:51,040
And trust me when I tell you
that it is nothing short...

947
00:57:53,217 --> 00:57:55,506
of spectacular.

948
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:02,007
Excuse me. Do I have "fuck me"
written on my forehead?

949
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:07,518
I can't see a thing
without my contacts.

950
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:11,898
You're just full of confidence,
aren't you?

951
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:15,687
Yeah. Kinda makes you
curious, don't it?

952
00:58:17,742 --> 00:58:19,486
Mighty Casey
has struck out.

953
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:22,993
Now, don't.
The game's not over yet.

954
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:26,746
Wouldn't be any fun if they fell over
with their legs in the air,
now, would it?

955
00:58:30,046 --> 00:58:32,205
Bartender.

956
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:36,293
Excuse me.

957
00:58:57,824 --> 00:58:59,568
Oh, you are bad.

958
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:19,418
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

959
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:27,979
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

960
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:34,861
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

961
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:41,315
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

962
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:18,106
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

963
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:26,538
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

964
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:29,327
<i>Run for the shelter of your love</i>

965
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,121
Hey, Dulcy.

966
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,085
Where's, uh, Jordan?

967
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:37,754
She left on a flight back to New York
late last night.

968
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,926
What'd you do to her
anyway?

969
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,406
Brian, are you there?

970
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,414
It's Bonnie.
Brian?

971
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,331
Come in.

972
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,423
Hi.

973
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,134
You found my
secret hiding place.

974
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,056
The guys at the bar told me.

975
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:29,095
I've been thinking
about you all day.

976
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,094
Yeah?

977
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,643
A plane ride home
will cure that.

978
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:37,231
What I got,
there ain't no cure for.

979
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,311
You can't send me
away like this.

980
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,776
I don't know what'll
happen to me if you do.

981
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,071
My business will go to hell.

982
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,198
I'll start writing
bad cheques.

983
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,745
We can't have that now,
can we?

984
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,027
No.

985
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,744
You don't really want me
to go away, do you?

986
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,719
These drinks are going
to be very tasty.

987
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,360
- Into the market now, are we?
- Mm-hmm.

988
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:22,607
What's my greatest talent?
Reading between the lines.

989
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:25,615
And that's what
the market's all about.

990
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,076
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

991
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:32,242
I must admit...

992
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,906
I never thought I'd see you
set up like this.

993
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,919
Well, don't you worry.
I won't forget my close friends.

994
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:44,092
Kerry's old man has just backed me
in the most luxurious joint
Manhattan's ever seen.

995
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,466
We open in a couple of weeks.

996
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:50,220
You come back to New York with us,
and I'll make you head bartender.

997
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:54,887
Well, that sounds very nice,
but I've got plans of my own.

998
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,647
Like what?

999
01:02:57,733 --> 01:03:00,105
Bonnie's hooking me up
with her business.

1000
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:03,029
I'll be heading back
to New York with her.

1001
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,439
Kept man, eh?

1002
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,368
You think you made a breakthrough
cutting that little blond loose.

1003
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,073
Meanwhile, your conscience
is killing you.

1004
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:15,113
If she hadn't left,
you'd be back there begging.

1005
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:19,503
- You think so, eh?
- Uh-huh, and a bottle
of Louis Treize says...

1006
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,874
you'll be working for me
by St Patrick's Day.

1007
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,718
A $500 bottle of brandy.

1008
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,672
I'll have to take that bet.

1009
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:49,614
<i>Wake up! On your feet!
Come on! Whew!</i>

1010
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:52,738
<i>One, two, three, four!
Work those hips!</i>

1011
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,164
<i>Come on, girls.
Work those hips, yeah!</i>

1012
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,584
<i>Feel it burn, yeah!
That fat's burnin'!</i>

1013
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,081
Morning, babe.

1014
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,710
Listen, can you get me some
carrot juice from the fridge?

1015
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,382
Get some for yourself too.
It's addictive.

1016
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,515
<i>- Pick it up! Whoo! One, two!
- Every fucking morning.</i>

1017
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,142
Yeah. Well, just tell him
not to make a move until
he's seen our line, that's all.

1018
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:19,099
And send Harvey
down to Dallas right away.

1019
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,891
Yeah, uh-huh.
Good, Tony.

1020
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:25,655
Great.
You are beautiful.

1021
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:29,403
Yeah. Okay,
I'll be in the office in 15.

1022
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,698
Ciao, Tony.

1023
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:34,491
Tony? Tony Scaduto,
the sales manager?

1024
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:36,822
- Yep.
- I thought he was in Mexico.

1025
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:40,368
- Just got back Friday.
- Then I can go in and see him?

1026
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:43,665
We'll let it wait
just a smidgen longer.

1027
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:46,426
Remember, you're
picking me up at 7:00 tonight.

1028
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:49,759
Why don't you wear the grey pinstripe
we bought you last week?

1029
01:04:49,846 --> 01:04:52,004
Okay.

1030
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:54,387
Did you tell him about
my marketing ideas?

1031
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:58,604
Honey, I don't want them to think I'm
shoving my boyfriend down their throat.

1032
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:00,764
What difference does it make?
You're the boss.

1033
01:05:00,857 --> 01:05:03,063
These guys are
top salesmen, babe.

1034
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:05,724
I can't treat them
like office boys.

1035
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,564
Listen to me.

1036
01:05:07,656 --> 01:05:10,491
Look, you could wait six months...

1037
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:13,778
you'd still be the youngest
sales manager in the business.

1038
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,361
Trust me, baby.

1039
01:05:57,998 --> 01:06:00,406
Hey, come on!
Get that heap out of the way!

1040
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,371
- How am I gonna get out of here?
- Hey, cool down, buddy.

1041
01:06:03,462 --> 01:06:05,501
Ah, you limo drivers
are all alike.

1042
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:07,878
You stand around with your finger
up your ass. Come on, move!

1043
01:06:07,966 --> 01:06:10,967
Come on, give us a break.
Don't have a heart attack.

1044
01:06:14,973 --> 01:06:16,349
- Art.
- Hi.

1045
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:18,342
Hello.

1046
01:06:18,435 --> 01:06:22,136
It's so good to see you.
Hello, darling.

1047
01:06:22,231 --> 01:06:24,354
God, it's been ages.

1048
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:25,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

1049
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:27,685
- You look fabulous in that coat.
- Thanks.

1050
01:06:27,778 --> 01:06:30,186
That color is gorgeous on you.

1051
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:31,691
Darling?

1052
01:06:37,454 --> 01:06:39,494
Take my coat, will you?

1053
01:06:46,547 --> 01:06:49,548
Yeah, I like that piece there.

1054
01:07:04,523 --> 01:07:09,435
- Bonnie, let's get out of here.
- Darling, I think you've had
enough to drink.

1055
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:12,364
- Brian.
- Bonnie. What, are we playing
musical highballs here?

1056
01:07:12,448 --> 01:07:15,117
- Come on, heel, boy, heel.
- Come again?

1057
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:17,573
Haven't got this one
party-broken yet, have you, Bonnie?

1058
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:20,698
Brian, this is Robert Powell.
He's the sculptor.

1059
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,747
Oh!

1060
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:26,037
Oh, how do you do?
Interesting work.

1061
01:07:26,128 --> 01:07:31,004
- Thank you.
- Interesting. It's, uh,
very urban in orientation.

1062
01:07:31,092 --> 01:07:33,713
Robert, tell me, how...

1063
01:07:33,803 --> 01:07:36,092
did you get the cockroach
to stand still long...

1064
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,181
You're drunk.

1065
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,465
You're ugly.

1066
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,395
Brian!

1067
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:47,854
Could you hold this, please?

1068
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:52,779
No, I'm okay.
Robert...

1069
01:07:53,406 --> 01:07:54,402
Ohhhhhhh!

1070
01:07:55,825 --> 01:08:00,404
- Brian, how could you do this?
- Have a nice day.

1071
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:14,500
- Come on. The suspense is killing me.
- Well, at least you could apologize.

1072
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:17,678
Apologize? Yes.

1073
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,718
Brian, we have to talk
about this seriously.

1074
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:27,063
Talk is overrated
as a means of resolving disputes.

1075
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,983
I moved my stuff out of
your place this afternoon.

1076
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,862
Left a can of Spam
in the refrigerator.

1077
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,900
- I hope the brewer's yeast
doesn't take it personally.
- Bastard!

1078
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:44,790
Oh, shit!

1079
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,618
Oh, God, Brian, I'm sorry.

1080
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:52,787
I'm sor...
Brian, listen, baby.

1081
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:56,216
- I've got some interviews
set up for tomorrow...
- Forget it!

1082
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:58,675
I am not a salesman.

1083
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:02,382
I tried to sell out to you,
but I couldn't close the deal.

1084
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,136
Please.

1085
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,220
I don't want to end it this way.

1086
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:11,271
Jesus, everything ends badly,
otherwise it wouldn't end.

1087
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,399
Believe me, Bonnie, you are going
to wake up in the morning...

1088
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,271
with a sigh of relief
because I'm not there.

1089
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:48,932
<i>Rave on
It's a crazy feelin'</i>

1090
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:52,226
<i>And I know
it's got me reelin'</i>

1091
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:57,774
<i>And I'm so glad that you're
revealin' your love to me</i>

1092
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:00,272
- Waitress?
- I'll be there in a second.

1093
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:08,408
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what the specials are, please?

1094
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,742
What are you doing here?

1095
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:13,374
Bet you thought
you'd never see me again.

1096
01:10:13,464 --> 01:10:14,662
"Hoped" is a better word.

1097
01:10:14,757 --> 01:10:17,164
- Excuse me, waitress?
- I'll be there in a minute.

1098
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,466
Miss, we have theatre tickets.

1099
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:23,254
Look, uh, you obviously
are not here to eat,
so I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.

1100
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:24,973
- Miss?
- Waitress?

1101
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:28,428
- I'll be there in a minute.
- I'm not leaving.

1102
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:31,059
Your sexy little smile's
not gonna work this time.

1103
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:36,650
- I'm not leaving. That's it.
- You're not leaving?

1104
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:39,689
Not until you let me
apologize.

1105
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:45,531
- Did you say you'd like
to see the specials, sir?
- I'd like to see the specials.

1106
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:55,496
- Excuse me.
- Look, we've been waiting...

1107
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,756
Today's specials are
meat loaf mozzarella...

1108
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,837
chicken a la king.

1109
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:06,634
May I suggest some
ketchup for your fries?

1110
01:11:09,646 --> 01:11:10,594
Ah, fuck.

1111
01:11:17,237 --> 01:11:18,779
Shit.

1112
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,452
I'd think twice about ordering
the specials if I were you, huh?

1113
01:11:36,506 --> 01:11:39,211
Spare change
for my dry cleaning?

1114
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,174
Sorry. Payday's Friday.

1115
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:43,384
You wouldn't treat a stray dog
like this, would you?

1116
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:45,962
A stray dog can be loyal.

1117
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:48,264
All right, I'm a rat.
There's no hope for me.

1118
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:53,013
But even I have a right
to defend myself, at least to explain.

1119
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:55,931
Taxi!

1120
01:11:57,777 --> 01:11:59,355
Come on in.

1121
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:20,165
Is this our waterfall?

1122
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:21,634
No.

1123
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:24,209
It's terrific.

1124
01:12:24,304 --> 01:12:25,929
Yeah, it's all right.

1125
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:28,386
The name's Mooney, not Monet.

1126
01:12:31,019 --> 01:12:35,480
So, uh, why did you humiliate me
like that in Jamaica?

1127
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:39,731
How did I humiliate you?

1128
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:43,438
Brian, I was there.
I saw you go off with that woman.

1129
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:47,322
You're such an asshole.

1130
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,332
It's not as bad as it seems.

1131
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:00,624
See, Doug landed
a rich chick.

1132
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:04,844
- And that night he bet me
that I couldn't do the same.
- A rich chick.

1133
01:13:04,928 --> 01:13:09,840
- So, you'd go with a woman
just because she had money.
- No, it's not the money.

1134
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:13,552
He bet me that I wasn't
good enough to hustle her.

1135
01:13:13,646 --> 01:13:15,804
Hustle her?

1136
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:20,275
And I was worth so little to you
that you could just take
some stupid juvenile bet?

1137
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:23,812
No. You see, a guy lays down a dare,
you gotta take it.

1138
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:29,156
Brian, how do you think I felt
seeing you go off with some woman...

1139
01:13:29,245 --> 01:13:30,905
after the time
that we spent together?

1140
01:13:30,996 --> 01:13:33,784
Just hold on a second.
You were pushing me down there.

1141
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:36,330
You were coming on
too strong, too fast.

1142
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:38,458
Oh, I was pushing you?

1143
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:40,538
Well, you know,
you happened to be there too.

1144
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:44,296
I-I thought that we had something going.
I didn't play any games with you.

1145
01:13:45,177 --> 01:13:46,755
I know.

1146
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:52,258
I'm sorry. I...

1147
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:56,431
I guess I just got spooked.

1148
01:13:56,522 --> 01:13:59,357
But now I know I can handle it.

1149
01:14:00,484 --> 01:14:03,818
Oh, you can
handle it, huh?

1150
01:14:03,905 --> 01:14:07,854
- So what if you got spooked again?
- I won't.

1151
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:11,569
- I'll bet I can spook you.
- No way.

1152
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:14,366
I'm pregnant.

1153
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,454
I'm spooked.

1154
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:21,337
It's mine?

1155
01:14:22,465 --> 01:14:23,959
I was only asking.

1156
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,885
Look, you're not going
to be bothered or burdened, okay?

1157
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:30,089
You can still go out
and make a million. Don't worry.

1158
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:33,632
I'm not worried.
I mean, I am worried.

1159
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:36,396
- I don't want to talk
about it any more.
- Okay.

1160
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:37,854
Just go!

1161
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:41,438
- Why?
- Because I want you to go,
all right? Just go!

1162
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:47,697
You let me come up here just
so you could kick me out, didn't you?

1163
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:02,959
No.

1164
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,714
No, just get out!

1165
01:15:08,011 --> 01:15:12,472
I know you're upset, but if this
is the way it's going to be,
why did you even tell me about the baby?

1166
01:15:12,557 --> 01:15:16,056
Because I knew it would be the best way
to get you out of my life.

1167
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:44,211
<i>... Square Garden. Syracuse trying
to stay within striking distance...</i>

1168
01:15:44,297 --> 01:15:46,967
<i>of Pittsburgh in the Big East.</i>

1169
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,672
Hey, that's for
cigarette change.

1170
01:15:49,761 --> 01:15:51,801
When you hand it to me,
it's for change.

1171
01:15:51,888 --> 01:15:55,388
When you put it on the edge
of the bar, it's a tip.

1172
01:15:55,475 --> 01:15:57,385
- Hey, kid.
- Hey, Uncle Pat.

1173
01:15:57,477 --> 01:15:59,803
Ed, how are you?

1174
01:15:59,897 --> 01:16:02,019
I got a problem.
You got time for a quick talk?

1175
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:04,265
Well, make it fast.
I'm real busy here.

1176
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,983
What's the matter?

1177
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:18,871
I'm going to be a father.

1178
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:20,997
That's it! Bar's closed!
Finish up!

1179
01:16:21,085 --> 01:16:22,994
- Aw, Pat, come on!
- Hit the road! Let's go!

1180
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:25,874
- Eddie, finish up.
Everybody out of here.
- What?

1181
01:16:27,299 --> 01:16:31,878
Now, you ought to know better
than to come to a bartender for advice.

1182
01:16:31,971 --> 01:16:35,055
- What am I going to do about this girl?
- Nothing.

1183
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:39,848
- What do you mean, nothing?
- She's not trying to shake you down.

1184
01:16:39,937 --> 01:16:42,345
She's not trying to make you marry her.
You don't care about her.

1185
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,598
You can walk away
from the whole thing.

1186
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:51,068
- What if I do care about her?
- Then you've got a problem.

1187
01:16:55,786 --> 01:16:58,573
Jordan, I just want
to talk to you.

1188
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,834
She's not hiding.
She's not home.

1189
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:05,706
She's at her parents' place.
Go bang down their door.

1190
01:17:05,796 --> 01:17:10,624
- You wouldn't happen to know
where that is, would you?
- Sure. Park Avenue, corner of 67th.

1191
01:17:13,054 --> 01:17:15,675
- Park Avenue?
- Yeah. Park Avenue.

1192
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,063
Listen. You get here when you say
you will or you won't work
in this building again.

1193
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,400
- Excuse me...
- So you'll be here what time?

1194
01:17:29,487 --> 01:17:32,820
- I don't mean to bother you...
- What time did you say you'd be here?

1195
01:17:32,907 --> 01:17:34,864
Hello?

1196
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,027
I'm sorry. What apartment
are... are the Mooneys in?

1197
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,405
- It's the penthouse.
Your name, please.
- Brian Flanagan.

1198
01:17:40,498 --> 01:17:43,285
- Are the Mooneys expecting you?
- No, not exactly.

1199
01:17:43,376 --> 01:17:46,579
All visitors have
to be announced, Mr. Flanagan.

1200
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:01,561
Mr. Flanagan,
will you come in, please?

1201
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:03,767
- May I take your coat, sir?
- Okay.

1202
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:10,984
- There will be someone
with you in a moment.
- Thank you.

1203
01:18:29,714 --> 01:18:32,170
I'm Richard Mooney.

1204
01:18:32,258 --> 01:18:34,500
- I'm Jordan's father.
- I'm Brian Flanagan.

1205
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:38,302
- I've come to see her.
- Well, she's not here.

1206
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:41,675
But come in. Come in.
I'd like to talk to you.

1207
01:18:46,398 --> 01:18:48,390
Sit down. Sit down.

1208
01:18:52,237 --> 01:18:56,187
Well, I've certainly heard a lot
about you in the last couple of days.

1209
01:18:59,077 --> 01:19:03,538
You know,
I don't know what really happened
between the two of you, but, uh...

1210
01:19:03,623 --> 01:19:06,411
I must say, I think you've got
a hell of a lot of nerve...

1211
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,874
coming up here after what
you did to my daughter.

1212
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:10,871
I understand that.

1213
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:14,167
And I realize that
Jordan is very upset.

1214
01:19:14,259 --> 01:19:18,672
But if I could talk to her,
make her see that I'm going
to stick by her through this.

1215
01:19:18,764 --> 01:19:21,255
I hope you're not suggesting
that you'll marry her.

1216
01:19:25,562 --> 01:19:29,263
I'm not sure what we're going to do.
We've got a lot to talk about.

1217
01:19:29,358 --> 01:19:33,308
The hell you do.
The hell you do!

1218
01:19:33,403 --> 01:19:36,654
All right, look, I know Jordan
a lot better than you do...

1219
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,410
and I've never seen her
as unhappy as she is at this moment.

1220
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:43,111
She is just not very wise
in the ways of the world.

1221
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:48,282
- And right now what she needs
around her are people she can trust.
- She can trust me.

1222
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:52,838
She doesn't want to see you.
She doesn't want to even talk to you.

1223
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:57,634
Just wait here for one moment
for me, will you, please?

1224
01:20:07,104 --> 01:20:09,809
- Good afternoon, Miss Mooney.
- Hi.

1225
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,738
- Mr. Mooney, I think I'm just...
- Mr. Flanagan, here.

1226
01:20:18,866 --> 01:20:21,820
- What the hell is this?
- That's for you.

1227
01:20:25,456 --> 01:20:27,164
$10,000?

1228
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,169
- Is that all your daughter's worth?
- Okay, how much will it take?

1229
01:20:34,256 --> 01:20:39,168
I don't want your goddam money.
You can't buy me out of Jordan's life.

1230
01:20:39,262 --> 01:20:41,966
You think I'm letting some bartender
walk into my family and destroy
my daughter's life?

1231
01:20:42,056 --> 01:20:44,381
- That is her choice!
- The hell you say.

1232
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:47,096
- Her choice!
- The hell you say!
- What is going on here?

1233
01:20:47,186 --> 01:20:49,642
Jordan, I came by here
to talk to you.

1234
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:53,313
- Look, if you don't get out of here,
Flanagan, I'm going to have you
thrown out on your ass!
- Dad... Dad, I will handle this.

1235
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:57,233
Jordan... Jordan, I know the other night
I didn't say the right things.

1236
01:20:57,321 --> 01:21:00,275
God knows, I have not
done the right things...

1237
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:04,150
but I think there's
a chance for us.

1238
01:21:04,245 --> 01:21:08,457
Brian, there is no "us."
There are just too many things
about us that don't work.

1239
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:12,870
What about the baby? I mean,
a kid... our kid needs a father.

1240
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:16,580
Not one that's not going
to be around in a year.

1241
01:21:16,674 --> 01:21:20,542
- Yeah, with your lifestyle,
what kind of a father would you...
- Dad!

1242
01:21:20,637 --> 01:21:24,006
Jordan,
I want a second chance.

1243
01:21:25,725 --> 01:21:26,888
No.

1244
01:21:26,976 --> 01:21:29,218
I deserve a second chance.

1245
01:21:29,312 --> 01:21:31,388
No!

1246
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:34,601
Brian, how am I ever going to know
that you're being honest with me?

1247
01:21:34,692 --> 01:21:38,275
- I mean, you can barely
be honest with yourself.
- Honest?

1248
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:42,941
Were you so honest? Why didn't you
tell me you were the original
rich chick?

1249
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:49,155
Because you're so hung up on money,
I was afraid that I'd never know
how you really felt about me.

1250
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:50,708
Me!

1251
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:52,868
How you really
feel about me.

1252
01:21:56,089 --> 01:21:58,662
You see this?

1253
01:21:58,758 --> 01:22:02,756
This is your father's idea
of how to get me out of your life.

1254
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:08,848
This...

1255
01:22:08,935 --> 01:22:12,269
is how hung up
on money I am.

1256
01:22:12,355 --> 01:22:16,567
And as for the way
I feel about you...

1257
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:19,985
I guess you'll never know.

1258
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:31,159
Here's a 20. Let me in.

1259
01:22:31,249 --> 01:22:34,085
Hey, what about us?

1260
01:22:34,169 --> 01:22:36,375
Let us in, Henry.
It's cold out here.

1261
01:22:36,463 --> 01:22:38,254
Henry, remember me?

1262
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,712
- I'm Bruce Springsteen's cousin.
- You look more like his couch.

1263
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:43,837
Henry, I'm-I'm Doug's friend.

1264
01:22:43,929 --> 01:22:46,883
Look, Mr. Coughlin doesn't have any
friends on a Saturday night, all right?

1265
01:22:46,974 --> 01:22:49,097
- Good evening, Henry.
- Hey, hey!

1266
01:22:54,106 --> 01:22:55,220
Hey!

1267
01:22:55,315 --> 01:22:58,934
- Hey, where's Doug Coughlin?
- He's over there.
- Over there?

1268
01:22:59,027 --> 01:23:00,854
Hey, you! You!

1269
01:23:00,946 --> 01:23:02,689
Doug!

1270
01:23:02,781 --> 01:23:05,735
- Coughlin!
- Flanagan!

1271
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:08,495
My best friend in the world.
My only friend.

1272
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:13,739
Piss off, Henry. It's okay.
It's great to see you, my only friend.
Sit down. Sit down.

1273
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:16,669
I don't know. Looks like you've got
a lot of friends here this evening.

1274
01:23:16,754 --> 01:23:18,296
- Proctologist's dream.
- What?

1275
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,456
Wall-to-wall assholes.

1276
01:23:20,549 --> 01:23:21,960
Great to see you,
Flanagan.

1277
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:24,755
Yes, because you know
I've come to pay off my bet.

1278
01:23:24,845 --> 01:23:26,885
- Brian.
- Kerry.

1279
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:33,602
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to beg and plead for a job.

1280
01:23:33,687 --> 01:23:37,306
Be great to get some talent
behind the bar.

1281
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:54,281
Well, let's go somewhere
we can appreciate this. Come on.

1282
01:24:04,594 --> 01:24:06,919
What are you doing out here?
Get in there and spend some money.

1283
01:24:07,013 --> 01:24:09,301
Keep me in the manner
that I'm accustomed to.

1284
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:12,841
Very good. How are you? Get in there
and spend some money, you two.

1285
01:24:12,935 --> 01:24:15,177
What do you think
of my rowing boat?

1286
01:24:16,397 --> 01:24:20,098
- Jesus Christ!
- Come aboard, ye land lubber.

1287
01:24:24,363 --> 01:24:27,281
Baccarat crystal.

1288
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:30,782
Louis Treize, voila.

1289
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,863
Should we let it breathe?

1290
01:24:32,955 --> 01:24:35,363
It hasn't breathed
in 50 years.

1291
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:38,079
It's dead.
Let's just drink it.

1292
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:52,596
Health and friendship?

1293
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:55,257
Life and love.

1294
01:25:03,194 --> 01:25:06,148
Douglas Coughlin, your ship...

1295
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:09,573
has certainly come in.

1296
01:25:11,995 --> 01:25:14,533
My ship...

1297
01:25:14,622 --> 01:25:18,869
My ship is going down,
and I'm going down with it.

1298
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,163
- How's that?
- Oh, this is an illusion.

1299
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:25,340
I'm on my ass.
I haven't got a pot to piss in.

1300
01:25:27,427 --> 01:25:29,835
A hundred grand a week. Painful.

1301
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:35,842
I should have read some of your
sacred books, young Flanagan.

1302
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:41,061
The only thing I know about saloons
is how to pour whisky
and run my mouth off.

1303
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:44,234
I knew nothing
about insurance...

1304
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:48,650
or sales tax
or the building code...

1305
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:52,690
or labor costs
or the power company...

1306
01:25:52,786 --> 01:25:55,028
or purchasing or linens.

1307
01:25:55,122 --> 01:25:57,577
Everyone with a hand
stuck it in my pocket.

1308
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,540
You must make enough
to cover that.

1309
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:04,253
If I'd stuck to what I know best,
which is almost nothing.

1310
01:26:05,716 --> 01:26:09,416
Instead I put all
the cash into commodities...

1311
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:12,548
and blew the fucking lot.

1312
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:18,428
On the margin.
Buy, cover, buy, cover.

1313
01:26:19,438 --> 01:26:21,929
I wanted it fast.

1314
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:27,310
See the headlines.

1315
01:26:27,404 --> 01:26:29,611
"Douglas Coughlin.

1316
01:26:29,698 --> 01:26:32,569
From Bartender
to Billionaire."

1317
01:26:38,374 --> 01:26:41,043
- Hey, Doug, take it easy, huh?
- Relax.

1318
01:26:42,211 --> 01:26:46,043
The luck is gone,
the brain is shot...

1319
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:48,753
but the liquor we still got.

1320
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:54,054
Doug!

1321
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:57,674
Doug, are you down there?

1322
01:26:57,768 --> 01:27:00,140
She knows nothing about this.

1323
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:03,146
She thinks I'm a fucking hero.

1324
01:27:08,779 --> 01:27:13,157
My princess, my dream.

1325
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:17,703
Oh, baby, not again.
I want to go home.

1326
01:27:18,623 --> 01:27:21,160
Come here.

1327
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:25,462
A toast, Flanagan,
to the first and last person...

1328
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:29,164
I ever cared about.

1329
01:27:29,258 --> 01:27:30,883
To my wife.

1330
01:27:30,968 --> 01:27:33,376
Doug?

1331
01:27:33,471 --> 01:27:35,677
Doug. Doug, wake up.

1332
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:38,090
I want to go home.

1333
01:27:59,664 --> 01:28:02,700
You know, you're the only person
in the world Doug respects.

1334
01:28:05,837 --> 01:28:07,829
We were a good team once.

1335
01:28:10,008 --> 01:28:14,385
Walk me to my apartment.
I hate going to that place alone.

1336
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:20,598
- I better check on Doug.
- Please.

1337
01:28:22,061 --> 01:28:26,889
I want to talk about Doug,
about his problems.

1338
01:29:03,895 --> 01:29:07,264
Doug says you're
incredible with women.

1339
01:29:07,357 --> 01:29:09,433
A real ladykiller.

1340
01:29:09,526 --> 01:29:11,602
Is that what he says?

1341
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:14,648
What's your secret weapon?

1342
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:19,818
Well, what you see
is what you get.

1343
01:29:38,555 --> 01:29:40,963
- Hold it.
- What did you do that for?

1344
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:49,473
I can't make it with
my best friend's old lady.

1345
01:29:51,402 --> 01:29:53,727
Am I supposed to live
with the same man...

1346
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,063
day in and day out, forever?

1347
01:29:56,156 --> 01:30:00,320
- And have no one else in my life?
- Yes. It's called marriage.

1348
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:04,740
You wanted this as much as I did.
That's why you're up here.

1349
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:08,415
But you can't do it now, can you?
You're scared.

1350
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:15,246
- I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
- You're just scared!

1351
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,241
Hey, Doug.

1352
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:43,443
Doug.

1353
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:50,121
What the...

1354
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,330
Help me!
Somebody help me!

1355
01:30:59,303 --> 01:31:01,379
Somebody help me!

1356
01:31:13,776 --> 01:31:16,813
Is there anything at all
you can tell me about what happened?

1357
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:56,184
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want...

1358
01:32:36,026 --> 01:32:38,778
My dearest Brian...

1359
01:32:38,862 --> 01:32:41,318
a guy like me
looks in the mirror.

1360
01:32:41,406 --> 01:32:44,610
He either grins or he
starts to fade away.

1361
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:49,826
And I haven't seen anything
to grin about in a long time.

1362
01:32:49,915 --> 01:32:53,118
This may not be
the most graceful exit...

1363
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,582
but I know when
the bottle's empty.

1364
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:58,874
About the only thing
I'm really going to miss...

1365
01:32:58,966 --> 01:33:02,216
are the conversations
we had going.

1366
01:33:02,302 --> 01:33:06,217
At least I get the last word
even if I had to mail it in.

1367
01:33:08,392 --> 01:33:13,635
Coughlin's Law: Bury the dead.
They stink up the joint.

1368
01:33:13,731 --> 01:33:16,732
As for the rest of
Coughlin's Laws, ignore them.

1369
01:33:16,817 --> 01:33:19,308
The guy was always
full of shit.

1370
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:25,034
But I guess you
knew that already.

1371
01:33:49,892 --> 01:33:52,348
- Excuse me.
The Mooneys. Brian Flanagan.
- I know who you are, pal.

1372
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:54,844
But I've been instructed
not to let you into the building.

1373
01:33:54,939 --> 01:33:57,691
- If you'd just let...
- Leave now!

1374
01:33:57,775 --> 01:34:01,559
Look, I just want to talk
to her for a few minutes. I don't
want to cause any trouble. Just...

1375
01:34:01,654 --> 01:34:05,023
- Send her a letter. Out!
- Get your hands off me, man.

1376
01:34:05,116 --> 01:34:06,065
Out!

1377
01:34:10,162 --> 01:34:11,111
Hey!

1378
01:34:21,966 --> 01:34:24,539
- Where's Jordan? Where's Jordan?
- She's in there.

1379
01:34:24,635 --> 01:34:27,209
- In there?
- Yeah. Hey, you can't go in there.

1380
01:34:27,305 --> 01:34:30,259
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Jordan? Jordan!

1381
01:34:31,517 --> 01:34:33,593
- What? What's going on?
- Jordan, I have to talk to you.

1382
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:36,936
Please. There's so many things.
I don't know where to begin.

1383
01:34:37,023 --> 01:34:39,016
Doug is dead.

1384
01:34:39,108 --> 01:34:41,778
- What?
- He killed himself.

1385
01:34:41,861 --> 01:34:46,108
- Oh, Brian.
- He was my best friend, but he
was too proud to let me help him.

1386
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:49,116
He was too proud to show how he felt
until it was too late.

1387
01:34:49,202 --> 01:34:51,194
I don't want to make
that same mistake, Jordan.

1388
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:57,580
- He pushed right past me
in the sitting room.
- I thought I told you
to keep that punk out of this house.

1389
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:59,827
- I'm sorry. He got by me.
- Jordan? Jordan, are you in there?

1390
01:34:59,921 --> 01:35:03,871
I have saved money. I've worked out
a loan with my uncle for some more.

1391
01:35:03,967 --> 01:35:07,383
- With hard work, I know I can
turn it into something great.
- Flanagan, open the door!

1392
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:12,465
- Brian, I know you can. I know you can.
But, really, it doesn't really matter.
- No. Listen to me. Listen to me!

1393
01:35:12,559 --> 01:35:14,801
- He was on the elevator
before I even know it.
- Give me the key!

1394
01:35:14,894 --> 01:35:19,853
I love you. I want to marry you.
I've loved you from the first
moment I saw you, Jordan.

1395
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:22,895
- Open the door!
- Please. Please, come with me.

1396
01:35:24,112 --> 01:35:26,817
Flanagan,
get the hell out of my house!

1397
01:35:26,907 --> 01:35:30,525
Jordan, wake up. Don't you see why he's
come back here? He's only come back
for one reason... for the money.

1398
01:35:30,619 --> 01:35:34,533
- That's not true.
I don't want a thing from you.
- You're not going to get anything,
not one penny.

1399
01:35:34,623 --> 01:35:37,030
- He's a loser.
- I'm not a loser.
Please, Jordan, come with me.

1400
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:40,660
- Get him out of here, please.
- Stay out of this. This has
nothing to do with you. Please.

1401
01:35:40,754 --> 01:35:44,586
- Throw this bum out of here!
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold it. Just hold it!

1402
01:35:44,674 --> 01:35:47,130
- Jordan, Jordan, don't go.
- All right. All right. Okay. Okay.

1403
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,461
If you walk out of this house right now,
just don't bother coming back.

1404
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:52,805
- Dad, I'm going.
I love him and I'm going.
- You're not going anywhere.

1405
01:35:52,891 --> 01:35:55,512
Jordan! Stop her!

1406
01:35:55,602 --> 01:35:58,722
- Get off of me!
- Get her hands off of her.
She's pregnant!

1407
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,648
You asshole!

1408
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:19,918
It didn't have to be this way,
you know?

1409
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:32,886
You're on your own.

1410
01:36:32,973 --> 01:36:35,547
That's the only way I want it.

1411
01:36:41,774 --> 01:36:45,107
A toast. To the bride
and to my nephew.

1412
01:36:45,194 --> 01:36:46,985
All the happiness.

1413
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:53,774
<i>I've been lied to</i>

1414
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:58,780
<i>- When will I be loved
- Right now, baby.</i>

1415
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:02,240
Yeah!

1416
01:37:02,336 --> 01:37:06,037
<i>I've been turned down</i>

1417
01:37:06,132 --> 01:37:10,212
<i>I've been pushed around</i>

1418
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:16,388
<i>When will I be loved</i>

1419
01:37:20,021 --> 01:37:22,559
You realize we're both
completely insane.

1420
01:37:22,648 --> 01:37:24,392
Yes.

1421
01:37:24,483 --> 01:37:28,612
- You're probably going to want
to divorce me in three weeks.
- Probably.

1422
01:37:28,696 --> 01:37:31,863
No. You'll want to divorce me.
I'll be all fat and ugly.

1423
01:37:31,949 --> 01:37:36,410
- Just as long as you don't get too fat.
- I am going to be very fat.

1424
01:37:36,496 --> 01:37:38,903
<i>- And you are going to love it.
- I've been cheated</i>

1425
01:37:38,998 --> 01:37:42,663
<i>Been mistreated</i>

1426
01:37:42,752 --> 01:37:50,083
<i>When will I be loved</i>

1427
01:37:50,176 --> 01:37:53,426
- Come on, Brian! Give us a poem!
- Yeah, a poem!

1428
01:37:53,513 --> 01:37:56,882
- We want a poem!
- A poem?
- Let's hear one, Brian!

1429
01:37:56,974 --> 01:37:59,892
A poem!

1430
01:38:00,895 --> 01:38:04,311
- A poem?
- A poem. We want a poem.

1431
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:07,684
- All right, a poem. A poem.
- We want a poem! We want a poem!

1432
01:38:07,777 --> 01:38:09,770
All right!

1433
01:38:16,744 --> 01:38:20,659
- Okay, a poem.
- Yeah, a poem.

1434
01:38:20,748 --> 01:38:23,999
Well, this poem
is entitled...

1435
01:38:24,085 --> 01:38:26,755
"Flanagan's Advice
to His Unborn Child."

1436
01:38:29,924 --> 01:38:31,205
Now...

1437
01:38:31,301 --> 01:38:35,797
if Jordan gives birth
to a fine Irish son...

1438
01:38:35,889 --> 01:38:38,925
there'll be Cocktails & Dreams
for him one day to run.

1439
01:38:40,143 --> 01:38:44,437
- A business that shall yield
a financial windfall...
- It better!

1440
01:38:47,317 --> 01:38:50,768
- To be franchised in every
suburban shopping mall.
- A dynasty!

1441
01:38:50,862 --> 01:38:53,863
You're founding a dynasty!

1442
01:38:53,949 --> 01:38:56,570
Now...

1443
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:01,902
if a daughter arrives
to bless our clan...

1444
01:39:01,998 --> 01:39:04,038
I guess the shit will
certainly hit the fan.

1445
01:39:06,878 --> 01:39:10,543
But this
I shall promise to thee...

1446
01:39:10,632 --> 01:39:13,586
I'll never let her
marry a guy like me.

1447
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:17,590
But still, if our child...

1448
01:39:17,681 --> 01:39:21,132
is the naughtiest of girls
or the wildest of young men...

1449
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:23,978
I swear I'll be
the best dad I can.

1450
01:39:24,062 --> 01:39:28,274
And never, ever
get spooked again.

1451
01:39:32,946 --> 01:39:36,362
- Bet I can still spook you.
- No way.

1452
01:39:42,998 --> 01:39:44,409
Twins?

1453
01:39:46,043 --> 01:39:47,620
Twins?

1454
01:39:48,378 --> 01:39:49,956
- Twins!
- Yeah!

1455
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:54,175
- Drinks are on the house!
- No! No!

1456
01:39:54,259 --> 01:39:57,260
The bar is open!

1457
01:39:57,346 --> 01:39:59,255
<i>In love, love, love</i>

1458
01:39:59,348 --> 01:40:00,972
<i>Like I've never been</i>

1459
01:40:01,058 --> 01:40:03,134
<i>In love, love, love</i>

1460
01:40:03,227 --> 01:40:05,303
<i>Here I go again</i>

1461
01:40:05,396 --> 01:40:09,228
<i>Heart aches, take it slow
You ain't got far to go</i>

1462
01:40:09,316 --> 01:40:14,524
<i>And if you travel smooth
love be a pleasure cruise</i>

1463
01:40:14,613 --> 01:40:16,357
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

1464
01:40:16,448 --> 01:40:18,571
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1465
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,284
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

1466
01:40:20,369 --> 01:40:22,907
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1467
01:40:27,877 --> 01:40:30,035
<i>Took a bus, took a plane
took a railroad train</i>

1468
01:40:30,129 --> 01:40:32,086
<i>Just to get on back</i>

1469
01:40:32,173 --> 01:40:35,707
<i>To that little girl I love
standing in the back</i>

1470
01:40:35,801 --> 01:40:37,841
<i>We love, love, love</i>

1471
01:40:37,928 --> 01:40:39,802
<i>Right there in the back</i>

1472
01:40:39,889 --> 01:40:43,933
<i>We love, love, love
on the railroad track</i>

1473
01:40:44,018 --> 01:40:45,845
<i>Heart aches, take it slow</i>

1474
01:40:45,937 --> 01:40:48,013
<i>You ain't got far to go</i>

1475
01:40:48,105 --> 01:40:53,182
<i>And if you travel smooth
love be a pleasure cruise</i>

1476
01:40:53,277 --> 01:40:55,021
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

1477
01:40:55,112 --> 01:40:57,152
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1478
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,948
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

1479
01:40:59,033 --> 01:41:00,990
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1480
01:41:01,077 --> 01:41:02,951
<i>Oh, I love you so</i>

1481
01:41:03,037 --> 01:41:05,030
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1482
01:41:05,123 --> 01:41:07,032
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1483
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,698
<i>I guess, I guess
I guess you know</i>

1484
01:41:31,065 --> 01:41:34,019
<i>A diamond sun cuts down</i>

1485
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:37,313
<i>A frozen winter sky</i>

1486
01:41:37,405 --> 01:41:40,904
<i>As the world and I go screaming</i>

1487
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:44,028
<i>Into the phantom night</i>

1488
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,406
<i>It doesn't matter where it leads</i>

1489
01:41:47,499 --> 01:41:51,164
<i>I got nowhere left to go</i>

1490
01:41:51,252 --> 01:41:54,088
<i>If there's any chance at all</i>

1491
01:41:54,172 --> 01:41:57,458
<i>It's somewhere down this road</i>

1492
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:00,919
<i>To be wild again</i>

1493
01:42:01,012 --> 01:42:03,966
<i>No one's child again</i>

1494
01:42:04,057 --> 01:42:08,185
<i>Yeah, I wanna live
every minute so hard</i>

1495
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:11,224
<i>That I wear it thin</i>

1496
01:42:11,314 --> 01:42:14,766
<i>I wanna find the edge</i>

1497
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:18,478
<i>Risk it all to win</i>

1498
01:42:18,572 --> 01:42:21,691
<i>I wanna see those eyes
in the mirror</i>

1499
01:42:21,783 --> 01:42:24,903
<i>Full of fire again</i>

1500
01:42:24,995 --> 01:42:27,664
<i>I wanna be wild again</i>

1501
01:42:27,748 --> 01:42:29,408
<i>Wild again</i>

1502
01:42:46,433 --> 01:42:49,719
<i>There has to be a crossroad</i>

1503
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:52,848
<i>A place to draw the line</i>

1504
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:56,225
<i>And it comes down
to the question</i>

1505
01:42:56,318 --> 01:43:01,027
<i>What is theirs
and what is mine</i>

1506
01:43:02,616 --> 01:43:05,487
<i>Wild again</i>
