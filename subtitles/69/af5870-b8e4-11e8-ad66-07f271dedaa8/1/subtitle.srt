1
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,046
<i>Publications like
Rolling Stone and Spare Rib</i>

2
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,011
were created to feed the need

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,019
for alternative narratives from the
established newspapers of the day.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,432
In much the same way, the Pauper <i>Press</i>
of the 1790s in England was developed

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,727
out of a need for mass representation
for the popular classes.

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,818
Those magazines and fanzines
of the '60s and '70s also provided

7
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,858
a means of reaching
beyond the official

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,449
and thus, ultimately,
beyond the ruling classes.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
The Internet, in contrast,

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,248
no longer requires there to be
any notion of the group.

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,290
Its concern is wholly
with the individual.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,040
It is with lucrative serendipity,
or perhaps just good branding,

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,004
that Myspace is so called.

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,589
The juxtaposition suggests
that the act of the individual

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,596
in defining their cyberspace
borders is more important

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,679
than what it is filled with.
It is simply 'your space.'.

17
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,015
For the end of monetized
mass communication

18
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,181
is the end of the press baron
champagne baths.

19
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,611
Thank you, Anna.
Very provocative. Well done.

20
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,240
Does anyone else
have a presentation to make?

21
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,697
All right, make sure you turn
in your final packet to Jacob.

22
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,831
And thank you very much.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,412
Hi.

24
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,378
I don't need to give you mine,
because I've already done it.

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,962
Cool.
- Cool.

26
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,976
If she comes to invite
wearing the same dress as me,

27
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,388
- I will completely freak out!
- Hey, yeah... yeah.

28
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,807
No, it was OK.

29
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,983
It was fine.

30
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,279
<i>Sweetheart,
I really miss you so much.</i>

31
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,788
Mum, can you just...

32
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,700
I'll speak to you in a minute. I have
someone waiting on the other line.

33
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,459
<i>All right, darling. I miss you.</i>

34
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,291
- <i>I love you.</i>
- <i>OK, OK, OK, bye</i>

35
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,587
- Hello?
- Hi, Anna?

36
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,050
<i>- It's Jacob.
- Hi.</i>

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,063
It didn't freak you out?

38
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,188
I guess you wouldn't
be here if it had.

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,229
No, it was nice.
And it was funny.

40
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,275
It was kind of great. I don't think
you're a nutcase, by the way, at all.

41
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,318
I thought I'd better
put that, just in case.

42
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,829
- That was a good disclaimer.
- Yeah, I just wanted to set that out.

43
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,082
- "No nutcases here."
- Yeah.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,208
- Whoa.

45
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,753
These cups are huge.
They're like reservoirs.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,715
It's almost bigger
than my face.

47
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah, so what do you...
What's your major?

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,852
Furniture design.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,808
That's why you're always drawing.

50
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,439
Yeah. You like to write then?

51
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,692
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

52
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,946
journalism is probably what I
would want to kind of go into

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,606
when I graduate. I don't know.

54
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,779
Who knows what we're going
to do when we leave.

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,788
You mean permanently when we leave?
Like when we're dead? We'll be dead.

56
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,370
When we leave.
When we depart this planet.

57
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,018
So are you going to
stay in LA after school?

58
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah, I'd like to,
if I can sort out my visa stuff.

59
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,642
So you grew up with
your mum and dad?

60
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,153
- My mom.
- And your dad?

61
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,279
He passed away when I was ten.

62
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,693
Now, that's shitty.
- Yeah. It's quite shitty.

63
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,038
And what about you?

64
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,746
Yeah, my parents,
I'm very close to them.

65
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,502
It's only ever been...
I'm an only child, so...

66
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,504
Me, too.

67
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,126
Yeah, so I'm quite close to them.

68
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,044
But it's nice being away.

69
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,464
I think it's important to...

70
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,976
to get away from where you've
grown up for some of your life.

71
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,184
I was thinking about
leaving right now, actually.

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,363
Let's go.
Where do you want to go?

73
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,952
Um, do you want to come up?

74
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,865
She likes
to go to bed early.

75
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,329
Oh, no, that's terrible!

76
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,541
So I try not to make too much noise.
Do you want a drink?

77
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,377
I only have whiskey.

78
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,758
Yeah.

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,474
- I don't drink much... actually.

80
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,052
Cheers.

81
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,146
- It's strong.
- Mm.

82
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,527
- Is that the chair where you write?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,997
It's not very comfortable.

84
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,331
It does the job.

85
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,507
- You like Paul Simon?
- Yeah.

86
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,544
- Do you?
- Yeah, I love Paul Simon.

87
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,838
- Really?
- Yeah, I love Graceland.

88
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,972
Oh!

89
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,429
- It's so good.
- That's my favorite album.

90
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,681
Would you mind reading me something?

91
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,609
What do you want me to read?

92
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,188
Something you wrote.

93
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,785
OK.

94
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,081
- You're not allowed to laugh.
- I'm not gonna laugh.

95
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,831
I haven't read it out loud yet.

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,301
So you'll be the first person.

97
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,676
- You sure you want to hear it?
- Mmmm.

98
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,143
"I thought I understood it."

99
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,520
That I could grasp it.
But I didn't.

100
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,805
Not really.

101
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,316
Only the 'smudgeness' of it.

102
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,230
The pink-slippered, all-containered,
semi-precious eagerness of it.

103
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,654
I didn't realize it would
sometimes be more than whole.

104
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,994
That the wholeness
was a rather luxurious idea.

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,535
Because it's the halves
that halve you in half.

106
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,002
Didn't know. Don't know
about the in-between bits.

107
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:22,044
"The gory bits of you
and gory bits of me."

108
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,306
I like "the halves
that halve you in half."

109
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,344
It's a bit childish.
- No.

110
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,229
No.

111
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,513
Bye.

112
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,381
- Hello, darling!
- Oh, my darling!

113
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,093
- I know! Hello!
- All right, enough of that.

114
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,973
Now, let's have a hug.
Come on now.

115
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,931
- "Go! Wait!"

116
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,100
It's just the "L's."

117
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,563
He's a baker.
In fact...

118
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,273
Did you bring me some bread?

119
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,983
- I did.
- He did!

120
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,399
- He packed it in his suitcase.
- It's so good.

121
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,067
- He was baking yesterday.
- Straight from the oven.

122
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,281
It's probably warmed all my shirts.

123
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,492
You're... you're...
you're being...

124
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,656
Oh, for God's sake!

125
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,918
Bernard, stop it. This is something
I just have to ask. I'm sorry.

126
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,249
- We're very open in our house.
- You don't have to answer.

127
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,380
- We're not that open. We are not.
- We are!

128
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,884
We talk... You may not be open,
but Anna and I are.

129
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,638
We talk about everything. I'm sorry.
I have to tell you this right now.

130
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,174
So don't be embarrassed.

131
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,094
You are being grown up?

132
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,557
- You are being adults?

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,518
- You do not have to answer.
- Yes.

134
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,524
Thank you. That's all I needed
to know. That's perfect.

135
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,937
Jacob, do you like whiskey?
Just to change the subject completely.

136
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,652
- That is a very good idea.
- I'm learning. Anna's been teaching me.

137
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,533
She's an expert. Of course,
she learned from the master.

138
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,740
What's your favorite
that we've tried?

139
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,120
- La... Laphroaig.
- Laphroaig!

140
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,284
- I love Laphroaig. It's my favorite.
- She does.

141
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,079
- It's great.
- That's very sophisticated.

142
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,839
- Drive safe. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

143
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,338
Bye.

144
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,258
<i>- OK. Close your eyes.
- Why?</i>

145
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,846
Because. Close your eyes.

146
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,477
- Close your eyes.

147
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,263
Close them. Count to 60.

148
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,730
Fifty-eight Mississippi,
57 Mississippi, 56 Mississippi,

149
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,486
54 Mississippi,
53 Mississippi...

150
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,318
38 Mississippi...

151
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,777
31 Mississippi,
32 Mississippi...

152
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,193
34 Mississippi.

153
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,738
35 Mississippi...
I can open them now?

154
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,781
I can sense you've
brought something.

155
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,182
Thank you. Thank you.

156
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,518
- It's my chair.
- Mmmm.

157
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,142
Look underneath.

158
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,121
It's your first one.

159
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,534
I love you...

160
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,628
like crazy.

161
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,679
What are we going
to do after we graduate?

162
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,313
We... We'll sort something out.

163
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,982
Don't think about it now.

164
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,769
I'll come back
and I'll get a work visa.

165
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,023
I hate thinking about it.

166
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,823
I'm not gonna leave.

167
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,080
- Promise.
- OK.

168
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,705
Yeah. Yeah.

169
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,087
<i>- Sweetheart, you all packed?
- Yeah, pretty much.</i>

170
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,128
I just can't believe it's tomorrow.
The time's gone so quickly.

171
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,137
<i>You certainly left it
to the last minute.</i>

172
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,923
Well, it's difficult,
because I won't see Jacob

173
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,343
- for the whole summer, so...
- How's he doing?

174
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,511
He's good.
He's just in the shower.

175
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,772
He's got his website up and running,
so he's pleased about that.

176
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,604
<i>Darling, I know
you're going to miss him.</i>

177
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,815
Yeah, I just wish I could
stay a bit longer, that's all.

178
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,277
<i>Anna, darling, Dad told you what the
lawyer said about overstaying the visa.</i>

179
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,816
<i>This is important.
You know that.</i>

180
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,235
Yeah, I know.
Those are the rules.

181
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,245
<i>We'll get things sorted
over the summer.</i>

182
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,247
<i>Then you can go back to LA
after Sarah's wedding.</i>

183
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,659
Yeah, I know. So, um...

184
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,044
I'll see you tomorrow, Mum.
I'd better get going.

185
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,125
<i>Yeah, we can't wait.
We can't wait!</i>

186
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,789
Yeah. Bye, Mum.

187
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,804
Are they excited
that you're coming back?

188
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,092
Yeah, they can't wait.
My mum is very excited.

189
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,647
Mm. I'm glad that we're
getting away for a...

190
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,977
for a night.

191
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,642
But we'll come back here
on the way back,

192
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,061
- before I go to the airport?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,023
- What time is the boat?
- 10:30.

194
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,784
- We haven't got that much time.
- Don't worry. It's OK.

195
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm not worried.

196
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,155
Wow.

197
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,325
Ow!

198
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,162
- What happened? You OK?
- Ow! Yeah.

199
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,792
- I just caught my finger.
- Let me see.

200
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,998
- It's OK. It's fine.
- Let me see.

201
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,913
There's nothing to see!
I just hit it.

202
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,672
- I caught it in there.

203
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,549
That feel better?

204
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,862
So, uh...

205
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,372
What are you doing on Catalina?

206
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,378
You look like a fisherman.
Are you a fisherman?

207
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,914
No?

208
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,548
Do you fish?
I love to fish.

209
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,004
I'm just trying to read, Jacob.

210
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
Mm. That's fine.
Fine with me.

211
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,589
It's a fine island.
It's a fine island for reading.

212
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,976
<i>That's my yacht, The Ahi.</i>

213
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,854
Yeah, I like tuna.
I like tuna a lot.

214
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,645
I like tuna enough
to name my boat The Ahi.

215
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,577
I saved a cat from a tree once.

216
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,752
I love you.

217
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,356
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,779
It's OK.

219
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,780
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

220
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,713
In 24 hours, I will be home...

221
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,300
with my parents.

222
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,132
I wish I could come with you.

223
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,142
- It would be fun.
- Yeah.

224
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,773
Well... my parents could always...

225
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,433
- No.
- ...help out.

226
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,112
It's fine. In two and a half months,
you'll be back.

227
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,739
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
I was just thinking...

228
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,865
as an option.

229
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,531
But it will go so quickly, actually,
that we won't even notice it.

230
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,540
- We won't even notice.
No.

231
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,366
Ooh.

232
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,246
It's so nice.

233
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,786
Thank you.

234
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,186
Jacob.

235
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,935
I've made a decision.

236
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,653
I'm gonna stay.

237
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,191
I'm gonna stay for the summer.

238
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,110
And I'll just go back for the wedding
and come back after that.

239
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,700
As much as I'd like that,
you can't do that.

240
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,911
- Why?
- Your visa.

241
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,202
I can't go back.
Then we don't have to be sad.

242
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,335
And we have so much fun.

243
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:36,008
And nothing to do. And we
can stay in bed all summer.

244
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,770
- OK.

245
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,934
Oh, man. OK.

246
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,687
OK.

247
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,677
<i>Attention, Los Angeles
International Airport travelers.</i>

248
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,804
<i>The TSA has limited the items</i>

249
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,842
<i>that may be carried through
the screening checkpoints.</i>

250
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,010
Please state your reason
for entering the country.

251
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,146
- I'm going to be on holiday.
- OK.

252
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,024
- And where will you be staying?
- In Santa Monica.

253
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,370
It appears you violated your prior visa.
Were you aware of that?

254
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:34,210
Um, but I'm traveling
as a tourist... this time.

255
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,089
Wait right here, please.

256
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,323
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

257
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,487
Anna, what's the matter?

258
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,908
I gave her my passport and
she was asking about the visa.

259
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,624
- They said what?
- I'm not gonna be able to come through.

260
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,663
<i>- Where are you right now?
- I've not even gone through.</i>

261
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:20,005
I haven't even gone past passport...
customs yet.

262
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,296
- OK, baby, listen. I'm gonna talk...
- <i>I told them</i> you were coming,

263
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,262
and they said no, it has to be reviewed
when I'm back in England.

264
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:31,554
I was like, "Can I just come through...
through for... just for this trip?"

265
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,601
And she was like, "No,"
because of the violation.

266
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,315
I'm gonna find somebody
and I'll come get you, OK?

267
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,985
<i>- OK, somebody's coming.
- I'm gonna talk to...</i>

268
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,323
<i>- I have to go now.
- I'll see you soon, OK?</i>

269
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,079
<i>I promise I'll see you soon.</i>

270
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,422
Do you know where customs is?

271
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,006
- Customs?
- Over there.

272
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,092
All right, thank you.

273
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,804
- You have no idea?
- No, I'm sorry, sir.

274
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,565
So this is what's gonna happen. You will
not be allowed to leave the airport.

275
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,575
Two agents from Homeland Security are
gonna come in here after I leave.

276
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,034
You'll be placed back on the plane
immediately and returned to the UK.

277
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,368
Do you understand?
Do you have any questions?

278
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:05,694
<i>Hi, Jacob. It's Anna. I'm
sorry I missed your call again, uh...</i>

279
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,449
<i>It's been pretty busy here.</i>

280
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,282
<i>Are you around
at about five today?</i>

281
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,163
<i>So, five, um...
eight for you...</i>

282
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,372
<i>OO... 9am for you.</i>

283
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,663
<i>I can't believe I missed you again.
Let's try for later today,</i>

284
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,002
<i>- and if not, then hopefully on Monday.
- Uh...</i>

285
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,635
<i>Look, I'm gonna head to bed.
Maybe we can try tomorrow.</i>

286
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,424
<i>I know you said you had a thing for
the magazine, but, uh, I'm just, um...</i>

287
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,593
<i>I'm, like, really exhausted
and I have to get up early for work.</i>

288
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,809
<i>So why don't you just send me
an email and let me know, um...</i>

289
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,440
<i>let me know
when it's good for you to talk.</i>

290
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,977
<i>OK, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.</i>

291
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,668
Have you looked at those paginations?
I need you to approve them.

292
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,676
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which pages don't you like?

293
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,179
I'm working with these...
these guys that I've worked with before.

294
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,603
- And, uh...
- Yeah. These.

295
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,184
They're looking for
a bedroom set for their...

296
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,645
They have a two-year-old
and a nine-month-old.

297
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,401
- Can we pull this out?
- Anything you want.

298
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,187
This is fantastic.
Let me see this.

299
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,323
- This is similar.
- This is, this is... yeah.

300
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,156
- Is this home, too?
- Yeah, right up there's home.

301
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,570
- That's great.
- Yeah.

302
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,204
When does he want delivery?

303
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,240
First week of June.

304
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,910
So I'd say we could push it
probably to the tenth of June.

305
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,669
- OK.
- He doesn't need it right away.

306
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,751
He's just getting into
the whole sort of redesign.

307
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,290
Then are you going
to the UK after that?

308
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,833
No.

309
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,219
- You're not? No?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

310
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,802
We sort of, a couple months ago,
we agreed not to...

311
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,012
You guys can just be
like friends, you know?

312
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,098
Yeah.

313
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,183
- Thanks, man. Yep.
- All right. I'll see you later.

314
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,449
- There she is!
- Hey!

315
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,535
How are you GUYS?

316
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,119
- You took so long!
- I know.

317
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,627
Whenever I'm going out the door,
she gives me four more things to do.

318
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,537
- Can I get a whiskey and ginger?
- Whiskey and ginger?

319
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,001
Yeah, and no ice.
Thanks.

320
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,877
- I know, but it's so hard.
- Just save up some money and go.

321
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,843
Once you're in your job,
it's just impossible.

322
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,473
- Let's do a shot!
- Let's do shots.

323
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,851
- Tequila shots?
- Oh, God.

324
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,010
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

325
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,397
Down in one.

326
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,605
Bolivia was two months, maybe.
But I was traveling all around.

327
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,317
Going around the little islands
around South America.

328
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,481
Yeah, it was intense.
Have you traveled?

329
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,948
Yeah, I spent some time in America.

330
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,986
- Where?
- When I was studying.

331
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,576
- Oh, yeah? Where about?
- I went to college in LA.

332
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,116
- Oh, yeah?
- So, um...

333
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,829
- Yeah, I made some...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,164
Some really, really good friends.

335
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cheers.

336
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,248
Hey, I'll be right back.

337
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,698
- Hey.
- Anna?

338
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,666
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

339
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,041
Um...

340
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,251
I'm OK, yeah. I just, um...

341
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,169
I just...
It was a bit of a shock.

342
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,673
<i>How's everything going?</i>

343
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,307
I moved into a new place.

344
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,093
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,762
Yeah, that's great.
That sounds really good.

346
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,522
So, what have you been doing?

347
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,809
<i>I'm just working really hard and...</i>

348
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,195
I'm busy and...

349
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,316
Yeah, stuff's going... going well.

350
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,736
<i>It's been a good few months.</i>

351
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:06,328
- That's great to hear.
- Yeah, I just... I hope it carries on.

352
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,037
<i>It's, uh...</i>

353
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,952
It's nice to hear your voice.

354
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,246
<i>I'm so sorry I woke you up.</i>

355
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,501
OK, well, I'd better go, um...

356
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,045
before it gets too late
and I have to be up.

357
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,807
- All right.
- OK.

358
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,468
<i>OK, bye. I'll talk to you later,
all right?</i>

359
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,978
OK, bye. Bye, Jacob.

360
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,763
- OK, <i>bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

361
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,638
- Hello?
Hey.

362
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,765
Hey...

363
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,677
Um...

364
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,894
Yeah, do you want to come over?

365
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,692
Come over now?

366
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,153
And, uh... I'll just be here?

367
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,364
- Yeah.

368
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,082
- OK.
- Yeah, I'll see you in half an hour.

369
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,744
<i>I'll see you in half an hour.</i>

370
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,538
<i>Just give me a couple
days. I'll get there, OK?</i>

371
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,922
OK.

372
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,169
OK.

373
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,698
What have you been doing?

374
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,370
Waiting for you.

375
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,455
Have you been sleeping
with loads of people?

376
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,211
Yeah.

377
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,838
And then... we have to
go and see my parents.

378
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,123
Yeah, of course.

379
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,292
We should only do
very English things.

380
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,178
Yeah. Let's have tea and crumpets.

381
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,338
Yes!

382
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,348
Have you?

383
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,771
Have you?

384
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,683
Let's not talk about this.

385
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,476
- Just tell me.
- Not yet.

386
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,645
Have you?

387
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,404
I said maybe.

388
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,951
I don't want to talk about it.

389
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,536
You're right.

390
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,202
- You're right. That was stupid.
- Yeah.

391
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,051
It's a man.

392
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,683
Is it a man?

393
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,969
- Hello.
- Hi. I've got a delivery for you.

394
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,103
Oh, wow!

395
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,104
What is it?
- It's a massive box.

396
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,315
Do you know anything about this?

397
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,400
No.

398
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,703
- You got it?
- Yeah.

399
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,963
Oh, it's my chair!

400
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,715
Oh, my God!

401
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,003
Da-da!

402
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,256
Hey, Anna.

403
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,300
- Hello.
- Here you go.

404
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,094
Thank you very much.

405
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,433
Sorry I kept it.
- Was it useful?

406
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,688
It was all right.
- Good.

407
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:44,351
You all right then?
- Oh, amazing, yeah. Yeah.

408
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,270
- Did you have a nice evening?
- It was OK. She burnt the meal again.

409
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,986
- I know. God help her.

410
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,279
All right, thanks a lot.

411
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,285
- OK, thank you.
- Everything all right?

412
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,196
Yeah, good. How are you?
- You sure?

413
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,207
Yeah, don't I seem it?
I'm just, like, cooking away.

414
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,959
I hope I haven't
burnt the chicken,

415
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,336
- but what can you do?
- Well, I'll let you go.

416
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,338
Thank you. I'll see you soon.
- All right, see you.

417
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,669
Take care.
- Bye, Simon.

418
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,841
Hey...

419
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,020
Hello!

420
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,025
- How are you?
- Hello!

421
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,528
- Natalie.
- Jacob. Really nice to meet you.

422
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,064
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Jacob.

423
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,982
- So nice to meet you.
- You, too.

424
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,074
- How's everything going?
- She's moving in with her boyfriend.

425
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,405
- No, I don't think so.
- Who is this?

426
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,868
- John.
- Are you nervous?

427
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,377
- I would be so nervous if I was you.
- I know. It's a big... change.

428
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,291
- Oh... taking that step.
- I know, yeah.

429
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,878
So, the other day,
we got some passes

430
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,671
come through to the office for a spa.
I think it's the one in...

431
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,636
- There's four of them.
- Oh, great! My God, that's amazing!

432
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,017
I had the most incredible massage there.

433
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,678
I'm not free next
weekend, but the weekend after.

434
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,563
- Great. That'd be lovely.
- Oh, that'd be amazing.

435
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,066
Leave early, yes...

436
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,610
"Crazy Love, Vol. ll"]

437
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,613
- Good to see you.

438
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,243
- It's so great to see you.
- Come on in.

439
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,155
- All right. Sorry.
- Hello!

440
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,323
- Hello.
- How are you? Great to see you.

441
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,582
And how's business?

442
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,915
It's been good, actually.

443
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,921
Very, very lucky, um... We...

444
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,707
How many more days
has he got here?

445
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,547
Um... not many.

446
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,256
So, what are you going to do?
I mean, is this how it's going to be?

447
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,925
I don't know.
Don't ask questions like that.

448
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,594
- I don't know, we'll see.
- It's expensive. You can't just keep

449
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,435
- flying back and forth.
- I know that. We're just making it work

450
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,440
how we can at the moment.

451
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,187
And then we'll see what happens.
We're just taking it each...

452
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,359
day as it comes.
- I've just moved in to a loft space.

453
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,278
But we're very lucky because things
have been going really well.

454
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,617
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah.

455
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,123
Ideally, it'd be
great to work out here.

456
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,249
It's just I am so
set up in Los Angeles.

457
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,876
No, I understand.

458
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,458
stop it!

459
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,919
- All right. This is a blended whiskey.
- Oh, no, here we go!

460
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,005
And all I want you to do
is just try it. OK?

461
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,262
And then we'll move on
to something much nicer.

462
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,969
- You have to close your eyes.
- You don't have to close your eyes.

463
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,180
- You do have to close your eyes!
- All right, close your eyes.

464
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,220
All right.

465
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,889
Just a flavor of whiskey
that you know. This...

466
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,809
is a single malt, and it's
been in casks for 12 years.

467
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,945
And I know that because it
<i>says</i> so right on the bottle!

468
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,657
- Oh! That's so good!
- You can share it.

469
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,320
And there is vodka
in it, but not that much.

470
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,329
- Although...
- What else do we need?

471
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,832
I'm not a big...
I have to admit to you all...

472
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,620
- You had the tiniest, tiniest sip!
- ...that I'm not a big fan.

473
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,084
- What, of tomato juice?
- Of the Bloody Mary?

474
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,341
It's such a pity
you have to go back.

475
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,673
Yeah, I wish, I wish I could
stay longer. I really do.

476
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,886
Well, it would be so much easier if the
whole immigration thing was sorted out.

477
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,721
- I asked you...
- Because I know Harry

478
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,227
has been a bit of a slowpoke
handling this stuff,

479
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,765
but once you've annoyed them,
you have to play by the book.

480
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,026
And it takes much more time and,
I tell you, a lot more money.

481
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,858
I realize all you did,
darling, was overstay

482
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,569
- for a couple of months.
- Do we have to go over it again?

483
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,281
No, we don't, but...
- We've been through it so many times.

484
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,286
But why not go
for an easier solution?

485
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,618
- Bernard.
- If you two got married,

486
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,873
it'd save me a lot of money.

487
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,660
- Bernard!
- What?

488
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,205
- Well, it would be.
- Sorry.

489
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,669
I think you've had enough
of the whiskey, all right?

490
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,175
I don't
think I've had enough.

491
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,802
I don't want
to embarrass them.

492
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:45,092
"Tantony." It's the
runty pig of the litter.

493
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,101
You're so stupid!

494
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,899
- Oh, God, I've got to stop it.
- This is far more disciplined

495
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,942
- than we normally are, I might say.
- Right.

496
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,611
Who's dasher now?

497
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,701
- You, Mum.
- Oh, no, no. Really?

498
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,173
I just feel weird.

499
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,966
Why do you feel weird?

500
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,302
I just feel kind of...

501
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,100
You feel weird...

502
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,230
I hate it when you
say you feel weird.

503
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,901
Why?

504
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,155
Because it doesn't feel like
I'm actually part of your life.

505
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,486
I feel like I'm on vacation.

506
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,746
I don't know. That's not
how it feels. It just...

507
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,328
I don't know.

508
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,836
It just feels weird...
sometimes.

509
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,134
Well, would it be easier
if you felt like...

510
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,263
you could see other people...

511
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,391
when we're not together?

512
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,854
Is that what you want to do?

513
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,192
Then why would you bring it up?

514
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,488
Because...

515
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,992
I don't want you to feel like...

516
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,160
you're not
living your life properly...

517
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,378
when we're not together.

518
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,676
Are you attracted to other people?

519
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,674
- No, I'm not attracted to other people.
- Why did you have to think about that?

520
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,387
Because it's a silly question.

521
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,552
No, it's obviously
not a silly question

522
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,517
if you have to think about it.

523
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,649
I don't mean it like that.
I don't mean...

524
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:10,203
that I'm attracted to other people.
I just mean it's hard

525
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,534
to keep stopping and starting.

526
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,120
And I'm sorry about
my dad mentioning stuff

527
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,005
that obviously
disturbs you in some way.

528
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,305
<i>This is a Piccadilly line service</i>

529
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,193
<i>to Heathrow terminals
one, two, three and five.</i>

530
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,100
Do you want
your jeans ironed?

531
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,932
Hmm?

532
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,596
Your jeans.
Do you want me to iron them?

533
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,642
Uh... sure.

534
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,155
Jacob Helm.
This is Samantha.

535
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,115
Hi, how are you?

536
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,407
No. No later than three weeks.

537
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,835
OK. All right.
Just let me know.

538
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,496
OK, bye.

539
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,374
Did they say they could
do it in three weeks?

540
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,962
Yeah.

541
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,344
- Well, they always do.
- I know.

542
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,343
- Oh, hi, Anna.
- Hey.

543
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,393
You fancy a cup of tea?

544
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,638
Yeah. OK.

545
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,144
I actually might stop off
and go to Topshop after work.

546
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,062
Oh, yes.

547
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,822
- Do you want to come with?
- Oh, yes, let's, let's.

548
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,029
So I read your thing.

549
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,654
It's good.

550
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,287
So who is this person?

551
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,414
Um... it's...

552
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,080
it's someone that is...

553
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,213
is very close to me.
And, um,

554
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,377
he's been quite an
inspiration in my life,

555
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,467
and I almost...

556
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,103
Through my writing, I wanted to, um...
give something back.

557
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,731
Yeah. When I was reading it,
it made me think about the fact that

558
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,815
when... when I was...
I was working in New York at Nylon mag,

559
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,574
and my husband was in Los Angeles
so he was driving across country.

560
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:39,738
So on the way over, he would take all
these pictures of himself and the dog

561
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:44,080
at various places.
So I sent photos of me.

562
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:48,247
And then we put them all together, and
they were like this moment in time.

563
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,291
Being separate, but yet we were
together in these photographs.

564
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:56,588
Well, I was going to say that it's a way
of even kind of keeping you together.

565
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,176
- Connecting.
- Yeah.

566
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,387
Now, there's the challenge.

567
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,301
Yeah, it's hard.

568
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,939
It made me miss him more.

569
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,942
So, um...
you know we have this blog.

570
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,411
I would like you
to take over the blog

571
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,117
and start writing for the magazine.

572
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,660
Wow, uh... That's great.

573
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,376
- Yeah, that would be...
- We need a really nice young voice,

574
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,381
and I think that you are that.

575
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,885
- I don't feel very young.
- Well, you are.

576
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,471
No, I would...
it would be a privilege.

577
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,303
Good.

578
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,086
- Yellow, red, maybe an orange.

579
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,221
Some different shades of orange.

580
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,597
Whatever kind of orange you think.

581
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,600
Hey, Anna, could you get the phone?

582
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,180
Jacob Helm. This is Samantha.

583
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,391
If I tried...
if I tried orange...

584
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,185
- Thank you.
- ...It doesn't have to stay on.

585
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,854
As long as they don't
put a veneer on it.

586
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,897
If she likes that and
you like that, great.

587
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,535
Are you mad at me
for some reason?

588
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,921
What? No.

589
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,925
You sure?

590
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,969
Yes. Why would I be mad?

591
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,676
What happened earlier today
didn't upset you?

592
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,594
It was a mistake.

593
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,347
I'm sorry.

594
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,393
It's all right.

595
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,572
- Are we gonna go out tonight?
- Yes. Do you want to?

596
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,982
- Yeah.
- Good.

597
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,914
Hey, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, OK?

598
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,138
- Anna, I...
- I just have to say one thing,

599
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,598
and it's really important
that you just listen to me.

600
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:18,642
I just... It doesn't feel like
this thing is going to go away.

601
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,060
It's always there. I can't...

602
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,697
- I can't get on with my life.
- We agreed.

603
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,984
I know, Jacob, but the things
that we have with each other,

604
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,903
I don't have with any other person.

605
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,665
With any other human being
apart from you.

606
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:38,043
We should be with each other.
And I feel it so strongly.

607
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:43,459
And I feel like... it's right
for us to get married...

608
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:49,593
<i>That's our only option now.
I don't want to have regrets about us.</i>

609
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,849
<i>And we can make this work
if we do that.</i>

610
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,386
I spoke to Harry, and he said
it'll only take six months,

611
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,773
and then I can come back.
And then we can be together.

612
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,150
So will you just
think about it for us?

613
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,686
<i>Just come for a few days,</i>

614
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,025
<i>and then we can make this work.</i>

615
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,861
I know you talked to her.

616
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,533
Yeah.

617
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,788
Yeah.

618
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,540
Come here.

619
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,201
Sam...

620
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,804
You're such a nice,
giving, caring human being.

621
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,093
And...

622
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,640
it's not fair for you to have to...

623
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,644
experience things...

624
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:32,909
and be with someone
that isn't fully there for you.

625
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,739
And I'm sorry,
because I have to go to London.

626
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,587
I'm so sorry, Sam.

627
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,511
I love you.

628
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,475
OK.

629
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,636
I'm sorry, Sam.

630
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,850
Yeah.

631
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,167
<i>- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...</i>

632
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,373
<i>...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...</i>

633
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,504
<i>...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...</i>

634
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,415
<i>...why I, Jacob Matthew Helm...</i>

635
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,084
why I, Jacob Matthew Helm...

636
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,050
may not be joined in matrimony...
- ...may not be joined in matrimony...

637
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,807
to Anna Maria Gardner.
- ...to Anna Maria Gardner.

638
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,263
They now wish
to affirm publicly

639
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,520
their relationship
and to offer each other

640
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,682
the security that
comes from vows sincerely made.

641
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,067
Jacob, place the ring on Anna's finger.

642
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,444
- I give you this ring...
- I give you this ring...

643
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,526
...as a token of my love
and affection.

644
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,611
As a token
of my love and affection.

645
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,204
And, remembering this day,
never allow anything...

646
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,491
And, remembering this day,
never allow anything...

647
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,831
...to destroy the feeling
that we share for each other.

648
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,122
To destroy the feeling
that we share for each other.

649
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,382
Wear it with a feeling
of love and joy...

650
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,463
Always.

651
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,130
You have made a solemn
and binding contract with each other

652
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,799
here in the presence
of your witnesses this morning.

653
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:06,562
It gives me great pleasure to tell you
that you are now husband and wife.

654
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,893
Yay!

655
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,826
You'll need the witnesses.

656
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,538
- Be careful.

657
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,134
I'£'S huge!

658
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,265
I should have grabbed glasses.

659
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,479
- I'm an idiot.
- No!

660
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,690
- Should we just drink it that way?
- Hm-hm.

661
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,855
That's very classy.

662
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,162
Ohh!

663
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,929
"The Wild Hunt"]

664
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,916
We have to wait... patiently.

665
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,543
For six months.

666
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,750
I hate six months.

667
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,251
It's all gonna be OK.

668
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,554
Six months.

669
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,957
Oh, you're killing me.

670
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,302
All right.

671
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,326
All right.

672
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,792
Jacob and... is it Anna?

673
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,453
- Anna.
- Anna.

674
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,122
I see a lot of good
documentation here,

675
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,882
and I have looked
through some of it.

676
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,386
Sorry, I forgot to... They're...

677
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,093
Books?
- ...just books and a record

678
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,474
of our relationship
since we first met,

679
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:16,432
- that, um... that I produced each year.
<i>- </i> Uh-huh.

680
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,439
Let's see.
What are these tickets from?

681
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:24,024
We both really like Paul Simon.
And one of our first dates,

682
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,564
when we'd met,
we went to see him in concert.

683
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:30,325
- When was that, Jacob?
- Uh, two months after we met.

684
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,237
- Mm-hm. How was the concert?
- It was great.

685
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,905
Yeah.
- He's great live.

686
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,495
Yeah.
- And here's your marriage certificate.

687
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,456
I know you got
married here in London

688
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,621
- just a few months ago, yes?
- Yes.

689
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:46,258
Well, I want to tell you
that I don't doubt the authenticity

690
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:51,638
of your relationship. However, what is
at issue... I see here...

691
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,141
four, is it, appeals.

692
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,350
These are the official documents dealing
with the violation of the student visa.

693
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,813
And this imposed a ban.

694
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:08,026
And that, unfortunately is the...
comes down to the reason

695
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:12,989
that I can't process your application
for marriage visa, nor lift the ban.

696
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,700
It has to come from
the student visa office.

697
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:20,117
Yeah, but we've already applied several
times throughout the last couple years,

698
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,708
as you can see. So I don't know how
many times you expect us to do it.

699
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,338
I mean, I don't know how...

700
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,965
We were told...
I was told by my lawyer

701
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,048
that this would be dealt
with separately

702
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,963
from the visa violation,
which is why we're here.

703
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,178
- We've appealed four times.
- He was misinformed.

704
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,934
- That is what is in the way.
- This is a separate situation.

705
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,222
Then I want to know who he spoke to,
because we speak to someone different

706
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,061
- every single time.
- Should there not be one person

707
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,146
who's dealing
with our particular application?

708
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,026
I wish I could
process this right now,

709
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,109
but it is not up to me,

710
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,742
and I will handle it as soon
as I get a lift on the ban.

711
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,451
I'm sorry.

712
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,456
Where did you go?

713
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,213
- Where did you go?
- Why did you just walk off?

714
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,089
I didn't. I went to look at something,

715
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,797
and then I turned around
and you were gone.

716
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,428
- You should have just said.
- Whatever. What do you want to do?

717
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,885
- I don't know. I'm really tired.
- Yeah, so am I.

718
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,846
So do you want to go or what?

719
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,636
Or do you want
to get something to eat?

720
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,271
Sure.

721
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,683
- I'm not really that hungry any more.
- Well, we don't have to.

722
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,977
Do you want to eat?

723
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,068
What does that mean?

724
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,949
Do you want to eat?

725
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,844
So is it worth talking about
you moving to London...

726
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,221
again?

727
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,346
Maybe.

728
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,525
I mean...
you could design furniture here.

729
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,275
Yeah. Absolutely.

730
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,700
Uh...

731
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,913
It would be difficult, but yeah.

732
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,507
- Who are you texting?
- Just work.

733
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,514
An order.

734
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,897
So you're very close
to your work colleagues.

735
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,188
Well... what does that mean?

736
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,902
Why didn't you tell me

737
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:23,319
that there was still something
between you and her?

738
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,455
- Why are you reading my phone?
- I didn't go through your phone.

739
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:30,834
I walked over there
and your messages are out.

740
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,336
- It's not that hard to...
- My messages were out?

741
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:37,466
Yeah. I could see them. It's not...
You don't have to be Einstein.

742
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,877
Just tell me what's happening
with you and her.

743
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:43,013
- There is nothing happening.
- Why didn't you just tell me, Jacob?

744
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,673
I told you.
There's nothing happening.

745
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,217
You're obviously involved in
something with this person.

746
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,887
I am not involved in anything.

747
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,055
You're not involved in anything
with this person?

748
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,974
There's nothing
between you whatsoever?

749
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,734
- Absolutely not.
- That's a lie.

750
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,942
Please don't go through my phone.
It's just going to make you paranoid.

751
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,075
Why didn't you tell me
that it was still...

752
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,577
There was still, like,
a thing between you and her?

753
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,784
- There is no thing between me and her!
- There obviously is a thing

754
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,121
- between you and her. There is!
- No, there is no thing!

755
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,036
- I just read your text message!
- She works with me!

756
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,831
- You shouldn't read my messages!
- Don't shout. Don't shout.

757
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,375
- You shouldn't read my text messages.
- Why did you just shout at me?

758
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,260
- I'm sorry that I shouted.
- Don't raise your voice at me.

759
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,797
People are gonna come around
if you keep shouting.

760
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:25,964
Oh, my God.

761
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,008
It's really important
if people come around.

762
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,892
Who's gonna come around? Simon?

763
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,654
Did you sleep with him?

764
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,282
- Did you? Tell me.
- Don't touch me.

765
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,694
- Jacob, don't touch me!
- Did you sleep with him, yes or no?!

766
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,578
- Did you?
- Jacob, don't.

767
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,865
"Jacob, don't" what?! Did you,
yes or no? It's very simple.

768
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,956
Very simple question,
very simple answer, yes or no. Did you?

769
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,133
I'm not answering your questions.

770
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,298
Why can't you look at me and tell me?

771
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,809
- Look at me and tell me!
- Don't shout!

772
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,561
- I'll shout if I want to shout.
- No, you won't shout in my house.

773
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,189
All right then!
I'll go back to my house!

774
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,850
- Yeah.
- I'd love to go back to my house!

775
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,065
- I'd go right now if I could!
- Why are you shouting at me?!

776
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,150
I don't understand why
you can say things like that!

777
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,317
- Don't shout!
- Yes, I'd rather fucking be there!

778
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,937
Hi, baby.

779
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,015
- Is this mine?
- Uh-huh.

780
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,553
Thank you very much.

781
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,276
Have a good day.
- Thank you very much.

782
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,695
Great.

783
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,866
Who said I was
terrified of heights?

784
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:53,403
- It was just that one time. One time.
- I've seen you on a Ferris wheel.

785
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,038
That Ferris wheel was shaking

786
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,245
in a way that Ferris
wheels aren't supposed to shake.

787
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,673
Did you want to see me?
- Yes.

788
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,176
I wanted to know how my new
junior editor was doing.

789
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,259
- Yes-
Oh, wow!

790
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:17,223
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

791
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,934
Thank you!
- Oh, I'm deaf.

792
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,940
- I shouted in your ear.
- Yes.

793
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,734
- Hello.
- Hello.

794
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:32,366
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

795
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,660
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

796
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,663
- What's so funny'?
- Just, um...

797
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,038
I just got a little... job promotion.

798
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,419
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

799
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,751
- About time!
- Yes!

800
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,878
- Well done, darling.
- Mm.

801
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,720
Whoo!

802
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,893
Well... good for you.
You stuck it out.

803
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,054
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

804
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,813
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

805
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,769
- About time.
- Yeah.

806
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,107
- You tell Mum and Dad yet?
- No, I haven't, actually.

807
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,991
- I'll give them a call later.
- Bring them around.

808
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,323
Yeah, we'll have a dinner.

809
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,285
Patience... always pays off.

810
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,839
I lost my bracelet.
Where's my bracelet?

811
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,926
It's there.
Here, here, here.

812
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,712
Oh, shit.

813
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,261
It's broken.

814
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:21,889
- You all right?
- Yeah.

815
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,358
- Hey.
- Hi.

816
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,991
- You must be really starved?
- Yeah.

817
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,197
What you doing?

818
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,699
Just work stuff.

819
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,338
- Ready'?
- Yeah.

820
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,715
Yeah.

821
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,501
- Are you done?
- You sure?

822
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,921
Yeah, yeah. I'm ready to go.
I've got my shoes on and everything.

823
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,885
I'd better just get my coat.

824
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,142
OK. Do you want me
to meet you downstairs?

825
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,974
Yeah, I'll meet you down there.
Give me two seconds.

826
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,779
Hi.

827
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:41,236
Your breakfast.
- Oh, man.

828
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,152
- How long have you been up?
- An hour and a half.

829
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:47,572
Thank you. Even though I know
I don't get to eat the bacon.

830
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,708
I don't share bacon.

831
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,088
<i>Mm.</i>

832
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,499
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

833
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,803
<i>So I've actually got
the approval letter in my hand</i>

834
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:09,390
<i>and I spoke with the embassy today,
and everything is sorted.</i>

835
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,556
<i>- You must be so excited.
- No, it's, um...</i>

836
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,566
It's great.

837
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,819
<i>I knew it
would come through eventually.</i>

838
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,900
Yeah, I'm, um...

839
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,816
I'm very excited, uh...

840
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:29,164
I didn't think
this was gonna happen.

841
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,575
<i>I know. These things
are very unpredictable,</i>

842
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,870
- <i>but you just have to keep pushing.</i>
- Yeah.

843
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,792
Yeah, um, well, thank you.
Thank you for all your work.

844
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,928
<i>Oh, God, please, don't mention it.
I'd do anything for your parents.</i>

845
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,679
<i>Should I give them a ring
and let them know?</i>

846
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,261
OK. No, I would...
I will call them.

847
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,598
- <i>All right. They'll be really excited.</i>
- <i>Yes, they'll be very excited...</i>

848
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:55,265
<i>- Very excited.
- OK, congratulate Jacob,</i>

849
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,648
<i>and we'll talk soon.</i>

850
01:13:56,807 --> 01:14:00,653
OK, thank you again, um...
for everything.

851
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,871
Go forward, my countess.
- Forward, forward.

852
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,579
- Spin around 15 times.
- Are you gonna make me spin around?

853
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:14,958
- Just joking.
- Ow!

854
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,790
Just joking!

855
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,832
- Where am I going?
- Outer space.

856
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,633
- What's that?
- Ooh. Oh!

857
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,544
Bingo! Sit down.

858
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,391
Oh, wow.

859
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,434
That's... very stylish!

860
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,313
Where'd you put the other one?

861
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,812
It's in the closet.

862
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,866
- I'm glad you're happy.
- Yeah, it's lovely. Thank you.

863
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,027
- Thank you.
- Ah. Meh.

864
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,627
- Cheers.
- Cheers to your promotion.

865
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,292
- To your promotion.
- Jolly good.

866
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,678
- Thank you, guys.
- It's so wonderful!

867
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,761
You haven't touched your wine.
Would you like some other wine?

868
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,596
Could I get a whiskey?
Do you have any?

869
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,510
No, we haven't got any whiskey.

870
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,725
- What?!
- No. We're cutting down.

871
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,560
We've cut down so much.
In London,

872
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,192
you can just be
drinking all the time.

873
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,694
- Yes.
- Bernard.

874
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,571
What?
- New rules.

875
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,403
- New rules? Why'?
- New rules'?

876
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,693
New Simon house rules.
- Clamping down, clamping down.

877
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,237
- He's clamping down on my drinking.
- Place is on lockdown.

878
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,577
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's bad for your skin.

879
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,539
- It is?
- I am on a very tough,

880
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:42,296
- Simon-designed fitness regime.
- Yeah, it's called Simon Says.

881
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:46,005
- Oh.
- Simon Says...

882
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,090
Yeah, we have her up at 6:30 now.

883
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,799
- Every morning, running.
- No.

884
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,430
For the last two weeks.

885
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,262
- Every morning?
- That's what it is!

886
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,802
You're glowing.
I have to say, you do...

887
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,436
- You do look different.
- Even more than usual.

888
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,097
You're the first person
that has ever

889
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,561
- got Anna to do any exercise.
- Really?

890
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,692
I thought it was the new promotion,
but all right.

891
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,603
I thought it was
the promotion, too.

892
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,444
But she has a very...
She has a very healthy breakfast.

893
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,950
A bit of oats
and some egg whites in there.

894
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,031
- You have changed.
- A sprinkle of cinnamon, no sugar.

895
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,492
- You have changed!
- If you want to lose weight, no sugar.

896
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:19,158
That would be it. Everything's moving in
the right direction. I'm really happy.

897
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,836
- This is delicious.
- It's good, isn't it?

898
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,372
It's very, very good.

899
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,710
Are we going
to play Balderdash?

900
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,046
- Oh, yes!
- That'll keep us going.

901
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,837
- Actually, the night is young.
- Yeah, we can play Balderdash.

902
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,677
Oh, lovely!
- But just before, um...

903
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,393
I just want to say
thank you for coming over.

904
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:40,430
- It's been a really special evening.
- Thanks for coming.

905
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,145
Thanks to you for
inviting us, my goodness!

906
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,486
I just...
You know, I like to think of life

907
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,898
as a bit of a puzzle.

908
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,819
- A jigsaw.
- Oh, no. He's going to make a speech.

909
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,281
Just stick with me on this.

910
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,788
And, um, for the longest time
there was always one piece missing.

911
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,500
A big piece in the middle.
And I looked around forever.

912
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,882
And I just couldn't find it.

913
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,795
So, um, along comes Anna.

914
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,136
And can I just
commend you two on producing

915
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,051
such a wonderful young woman?

916
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,016
She's pretty exceptional.

917
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,806
I mean, we've only been
together, what, six months?

918
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,815
But I've known
her almost three years,

919
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:32,073
and she just fit this... puzzle.

920
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,781
The picture was,
from my angle, complete.

921
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,968
You're beautiful, driven, intelligent.

922
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,128
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

923
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:01,803
Will you marry me?

924
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,811
Listen, I know there's a lot of
things to be worked out here.

925
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:13,857
I know that there's issues
that need to be ironed out.

926
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,403
But it's very important to me that you
know how much I love your daughter.

927
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:20,697
Darling, that's really sweet.

928
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:28,334
I think, um...

929
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,715
- Yeah, maybe, um...
- I'll get my jacket.

930
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,549
- Yes, and my handbag, darling?
- Absolutely. Of course.

931
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,179
It's late, we have to be going.

932
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,011
Got to get up early
for work anyway.

933
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,642
Yeah, it's been...
lovely.

934
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,347
Absolutely.

935
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,480
Well then, good night.
It was a pleasure.

936
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,153
- Take care.
- Good night, Dad.

937
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,156
All right. Come on, let's go.

938
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,174
Well... there you go.

939
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:01,634
Thank you.

940
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,341
- And send Jacob our love.
- I will.

941
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,923
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, angel.

942
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,668
- Hello!
- Hey.

943
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,468
- Hello. Oh, no!
- These are for you.

944
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,632
Thank you. Oh, they're lovely.

945
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,678
- How was your flight?
- It was good, yeah. Long.

946
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,220
Are you tired?

947
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,894
Uh... a bit.

948
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

949
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,943
"Crazy Love, Vol. ll"]

950
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,091
- Wow.
- Here it is.

951
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,102
- Wow!
- Yeah.

952
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,240
- Should we put them in water?
- Yeah, let me do that.

953
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,535
" What?"

954
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,120
Nothing.

955
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,336
Maybe we could have...
a drink to celebrate.

956
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,341
Great.

957
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,379
God, I haven't drank for ages.

958
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,174
- Really?
- Well, not this.

959
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,640
What have you been drinking?
Laphroaig.

960
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,890
Uh, trying to be healthy.

961
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,317
Not drink so much.

962
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,520
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

963
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,499
I'm gonna grab your luggage, OK?

964
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,655
There's a market research
assistant post.

965
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:51,698
Mmm...

966
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,908
Well, it doesn't look that cool.

967
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,291
What about something under magazine?
Ls there anything in that?

968
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,843
That's good.
- I'm just, you know, sketching.

969
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,478
- I think I might have a shower.
- OK.

970
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,352
I'll take one with you.

971
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,859
- OK?
- OK.

972
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,689
- This is cold.
- Is it?

973
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,692
There we go, that's good.

974
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,029
Mm. That's nice.
