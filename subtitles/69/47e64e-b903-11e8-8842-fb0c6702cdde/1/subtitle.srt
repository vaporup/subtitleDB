00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,652
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

163
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,750
Sounds anti-British, sir.

164
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,941
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

165
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,480
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

166
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,515
[Speaking German]

167
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,312
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

168
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,819
[Speaking German]

169
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,447
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

170
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,150
- Tension?
- Suspense.

171
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,662
- You really liked it?
- At the end of every chapter you are left guessing
what he'll be up to next.

172
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,994
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

173
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,330
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

174
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:02,237
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

175
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:07,677
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

176
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,683
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

177
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:17,688
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tires on the black market.

178
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,588
I wonder what my father
would have said.

179
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:26,154
- I'm afraid the police meant more than that.
- They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

180
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,029
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

181
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,534
Even so, I'm not going to leave it at this.

182
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,537
Will you help me?

183
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:40,274
I wish I could.
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

184
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,405
I have to be
careful with the police.

185
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,507
I'm afraid I can't help you.

186
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,952
Except with advice, of course.

187
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,955
Advice.

188
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,760
We came out of his place
like this...

189
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,455
and were walking this way.

190
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,692
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

191
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,430
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

192
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,507
It was just about here.

193
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,605
- Here?
- Yes.

194
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,307
His friend and I picked him up...

195
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,580
- carried him across over here.
- [Car Horn Honks]

196
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,986
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

197
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,458
We laid him down just about here.

198
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,664
And this is where he died.

199
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,893
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

200
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,401
What did he say?

201
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,234
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

202
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,106
- I may call you Holly, mayrt I?
He always called you that to us.
- [Dog Whimpers]

203
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,179
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived...

204
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,909
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

205
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,918
But he said he died instantaneously.

206
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,347
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

207
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,226
Well, there was only you and this, uh -
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

208
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,629
A Romanian. Mr. Ropescu.

209
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,861
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

210
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,139
[Dog Whimpering]

211
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,436
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

212
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,605
- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

213
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,513
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

214
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,881
Who used to visit Mr. Lime?

215
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,046
Visit? Eh -

216
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,420
[Speaking German]

217
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,331
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

218
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,904
[Speaking German]

219
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,634
[German]

220
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,045
Excuse me.

221
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,013
Who was at the funeral besides you?

222
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,746
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

223
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,186
Wasrt there a girl there?

224
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,453
Some girl of theJosefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

225
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,529
You oughtrt to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

226
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,691
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

227
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,497
What's the good
of another postmortem?

228
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,335
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

229
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,672
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

230
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,406
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

231
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,005
One has to work the best way
one can, you know.

232
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,516
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

233
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,678
I don't think I ever heard it.

234
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,689
You did mention the theater.

235
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,918
Josefstadt.

236
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,462
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

237
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,361
You'd do better
to think of yourself.

238
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,230
[Chuckles]
I'll be all right.

239
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,930
Of course.
I'm so glad I've met you.

240
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,339
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

241
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,043
- Number 8, please.
- Major Calloway's compliments, sir.

242
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,380
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- Tell the major I won't need it.

243
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,353
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for theJosefstadt Theater.

244
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,356
- Ah, Mr. Martinsl
- Good evening, Mr. Crabbin.

245
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,087
He said I was to drive you to the airfield
or take you to the bus, whichever you prefer.

246
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,722
Didrt you hear Mr. Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the H.Q. B.M.T.?

247
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,166
[Speaking German]

248
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,246
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

249
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,490
- [Laughter, Chattering]
- Afterwards.

250
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,255

[Man Speaking German]

253
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,480
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

254
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,880
Oh, come in.

255
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,884
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

256
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,511
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Excuse me.

257
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,522
- Danke. Gute Nacht, Anna.
- Gute Nacht.

258
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,649
You were -You were awfully good.

259
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,322
- Do you understand German?
- No, I - Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

260
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,333
- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me.
My name is Holly Martins.

261
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,426
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

262
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,437
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

263
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,439
Someone threw me this packet last week.

264
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,908
Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

265
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,003
That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

266
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,413
- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

267
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,784
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

268
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,122
- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you - No, thank you.

269
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,492
I wanted to talk to you about him.

270
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,033
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

271
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,159
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

272
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,364
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

273
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,071
You were in love with him,
werert you?

274
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,706
I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

275
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,912
I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

276
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,147
Some more tea?

277
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,249
No. No tea.
Would you like a cigarette?

278
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,885
Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

279
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:08,330
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

280
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,458
- Do you know him?
- No.

281
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,732
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

282
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,501
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

283
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,771
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

284
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,108
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

285
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,615
Hmm.
He said he remembered me too.

286
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,709
Seems to show
he wasrt in much pain.

287
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,050
Dr. Winkel told me that.

288
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,784
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

289
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:38,556
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

290
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,996
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

291
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,432
Well, were you at the inquest?

292
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,437
Yes. They said it wasrt
the driver's fault.

293
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,440
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

294
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,443
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:57,845
Well, uh, I don't get it.

296
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,443
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh, Popescu...

297
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,784
his own driver knocking him over...

298
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,381
his own doctor just passing by.

299
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,926
No strangers there at all.

300
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,588
I know. I've wondered
about it a hundred times...

301
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,166
if it really was an accident.

302
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,237
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

303
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,309
- But if it wasrt an -
- [Woman] Fräulein Schmidt.

- [Speaking German]
- [German]

305
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,814
I must hurry. They don't like
us to use the lights.

306
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,249
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

307
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,823
Look, do you know that porter?

308
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,159
Yes.

309

[Speaking German]

310
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,827
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

311
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,667
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

312
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,833
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

313
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,208
Heard. I heard the brakes.
[Makes Screeching Sound]

314
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,771
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side...

315
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,785
uh, of theJosef- theJosef-

EmperorJosef statue.

317
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,357
Why didn't they
bring him in the house?

318
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,080
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

319
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,555
- [German]
- Uh, was he -was he -was he still alive?

320
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,820
Ah, alive!
He couldn't have been alive...

321
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,226
not with his head in the way it was.

322
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,321
I was told that
he did not die at once.

324
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,902
No, I mean that -

[German]

326
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,133
- No, you -

He fixed my papers for me.

659
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:42,034
He heard the Russians were repatriating
people like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

660
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,233
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

Yeah.

662
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:50,003
When he was 14, he taught me
the three-card trick.

- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

around him, that's all.

00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,798
I don't ever want to.

668
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,425
Come on out and have a drink.

669
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,004
Why did you say that?

670
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,539
Seemed like a good idea.

671
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,337
It was just what he used to say.

672
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,403
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

673
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,075
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,244
What's the hurry? Can't we talk
quietly for a couple of minutes?

00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,585

- A moment ago, you said you
didn't want to see the porter.

- We're both in it, Harry.
- Holly.

I'm so sorry.

- Yes.

- [Man] What author has chiefly influenced you?

- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr. Martins's little joke, of course.

Mr. James Joyce?

00:52:54,604 --> 00:53:00,065
- In what category?
- Can I ask, is Mr. Martins engaged on a new book?

759
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,012
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

- It's a murder story.

- Mixing fact and fiction.

- Why, no, Mr. Martins.

I'd say stick to fiction.

enough penicillin to go round.

and selling it to patients.

- Are you too busy...

to investigate a murder?

01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,574
I said another man
was buried in his place.

992
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,576
Where's Harry?

993
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,272
That's what we want to find out.

994
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:17,613
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I -

995
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,620
He is alive.

996
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,781
Now this minute,
he is doing something.

997
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,884
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

998
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,225
You may as well help us.
In a few minutes...

999
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,765
Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you
about your papers.

1000
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:35,428
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

1001
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,835
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

1002
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,406
Martins always said you were a fool.

1003
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:46,038
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

1004
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,048
Poor Harry.

1005
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,616
I wish he was dead.

1006
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:55,188
He would be safe
from all of you then.

1007
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:08,166
Why, that's you!
Come up.

1008
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,068
Winkel, look who is here.

1009
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,073
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

1010
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,666
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

1011
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:19,213
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

1012
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,508
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

1013
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:26,213
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

1014
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,919
Be reasonable.
Come up and talk.

1015
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,620
No, thank you.
I like the open.

1016
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,493
Tell him I'll wait
by that wheel there.

1017
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,591
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr. Winkel?

1018
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,001
You got an opinion on that?

1019
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:50,768
- Hello, old man. How are you?
- Hello, Harry.

1020
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,500
Well, well, they seem to be
giving you quite some busy time.

1021
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,509
- Well, listen.
- Hmm, yes?

1022
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:59,809
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk to me? Well, of course. Come on.

1023
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,982
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

1024
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:09,285
- But they haven't the money now, poor devils.
- [German]

1025
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,292
Listen, Harry.
I didn't believe that -

1026
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,988
- It's good to see you, Holly.
- I was at your funeral.

1027
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,531
That was pretty smart, wasrt it?

1028
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,760
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

1029
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,995
These are the only things
that help - these tablets.

1030
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,800
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe anymore.

1031
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,306
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

1032
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,105
- She's been arrested.
- Tough. Very tough. But don't worry, old man.

1033
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,840
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

1034
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,143
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

1035
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,150
- You can help somehow.
- Holly...

1036
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,982
exactly who did you tell
about me, hmm?

1037
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:43,023
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

1038
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,286
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

1039
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:48,090
Did the, uh, police believe you?

1040
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:50,130
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

1041
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,132
[Chuckling]
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

1042
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,668
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do? Be reasonable.

1043
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,432
- You can get somebody else -
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

1044
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:01,441
- Why not?
- "It's a far, far better thing that I do,"
the old limelight, the fall of the curtain -

1045
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:05,309
No. Holly, you and I aren't heroes.
The world doesn't make any heroes -

1046
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,575
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- outside of your stories.

1047
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,844
I've got to be so careful.

1048
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:13,318
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm
only safe as long as they can use me.

1049
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,516
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

1050
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:20,083
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

1051
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,129
Don't try to be a policeman,
old man.

1052
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,562
- What do you expect me to be? Part of your-
- Part?

1053
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:28,693
You can have any part you want as long as you don't
interfere. I've never cut you out of anything.

1054
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:32,205
- Yes, I remember when they raided
the gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.
- Sure!

1055
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,208
Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

1056
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:39,940
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

1057
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,983
You ought to leave this thing alone.

1058
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,883
Have you ever seen
any of your victims?

1059
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,354
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

1060
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,949
Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

1061
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,955
Tell me.

1062
01:18:56,064 --> 01:19:00,865
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

1063
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,132
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped...

1064
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,639
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

1065
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:10,735
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

1066
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,747
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax -

1067
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,545
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

1068
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:20,087
- A lot of good your money will do you in jail.
- That jail's in another zone.

1069
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,087
There's no proof against me...

1070
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,092
besides you.

1071
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,562
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

1072
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,840
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

1073
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,775
I carry a gun.

1074
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:47,315
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

1075
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,177
They dug up your coffin.

1076
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,924
And found Harbin?

1077
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,464
Mm-hmm.

1078
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,604
Pity.
[Chuckles] Holly.

1079
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:12,264
What fools we are
talking to each other this way...

1080
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,104
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

1081
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,974
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

1082
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,810
Nobody thinks in terms
ofhuman beings.

1083
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,817
Governments don't.
Why should we?

1084
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:27,548
They talk about the people and the proletariat.
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

1085
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:33,492
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

1086
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,222
You used to believe in God.

1087
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:39,094
I still do believe in God, old man.

1088
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,932
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

1089
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,371
But the dead are happier dead.

1090
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,534
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

1091
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,148
What do you believe in?

1092
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,686
Oh, if you ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

1093
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,755
I think you'll find she's won'th it.

1094
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,916
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

1095
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,756
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

1096
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,890
There's nobody left in Vienna I can really trust,
and we've always done everything together.

1097
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,367
When you make up your mind, send me a message.
I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

1098
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,405
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see...

1099
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,633
not the police.

1100
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,642
Remember that, won't you?

1101
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:26,271
[Chuckling] And don't be so gloomy.
After all, it's not that awful.

1102
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,815
Remember what the fella said:

1103
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:33,547
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had
warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed...

1104
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:37,250
but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

1105
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,725
In Switzerland,
they had brotherly love.

1106
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:44,322
They had 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce?

1107
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:47,196
The cuckoo clock.
So long, Holly.

1108
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,207
But look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at -

1109
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,838
at some little caf'e here
in the international zone.

1110
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:03,008
- Wouldrt work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

1111
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,882
Calloway, you expect too much.

1112
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,922
Oh, I know he deserves to hang.
You've proved your stuff...

1113
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,460
but 20 years is a long time.

1114
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,154
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

1115
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,493
Okay. Forget it.

1116
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,727
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

1117
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,498
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

1118
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,001
[Calloway] I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

1119
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:31,545
We shall apply for her at
the Four Rower meeting tomorrow.

1120
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,240
She has no right to be here.

1121
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,683
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1122
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,450
That's a different case.
It is being looked into.

1123
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,923
- So long, Major.
- [Door Closes]

1124
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:50,157
[Calloway] In the last war, a general would
hang his opponent's picture on the wall.

1125
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,358
He got to know him that way.

1126
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,334
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1127
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,498
I think this would've worked,
with your help.

1128
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,847
What price would you pay?

1129
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,923
Name it.

Here we are.
You'll be all right here, miss.

1133
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,894
I don't understand
Major Calloway. I -

1134
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:57,863
- I expect he's got a soft spot for you, miss.
- Why has he done all this?

1135
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:01,902
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

1136
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,971
There we are, miss.

1137
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,530
- Thank you. You've been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

1138
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:12,269
- Good night, miss.
- Good-bye.

[Train Whistle Blows]

1141
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,176
Are you going too?

1142
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,255
Oh.

1143
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:57,620
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you off.

1144
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,454
See me off?
From here?

1145
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,052
Oh, I watched you onto the train, uh -

1146
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:05,724
- No harm in that, is there?
- How did you know I'd be here?

1147
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:09,668
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

1148
