00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,711
You sell crack?

3
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,515
No, it's cool. I'm only a cop on TV.

4
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,080
How much... right on.

5
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,139
Is this crack?

6
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,610
You know how to do it?

7
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,704
Yes. Yes, hello.

8
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,075
I'm having a medical situation.

9
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,178
Yeah, okay,
I don't have a belly button.

10
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:32,087
I do not have a belly button
where I should on my belly,

11
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,362
and I'm concerned
because I don't know if that's...

12
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,534
Can a person live
without a belly button?

13
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,972
'Cause if you think about it,
you're born with one...

14
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,840
and if you don't have one
you're unborn,

15
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,441
and it's really hazy
whether you're alive or not.

16
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,816
I guess I'm wondering...

17
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,646
...am I alive?

18
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,351
Or what if I'm God?

19
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,591
I don't think I need an ambulance,

20
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,725
but I should probably
go to the hospital.

21
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,133
Yeah, I should.

22
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,022
Like you've never done worse!

23
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,357
Okay, yes, he totaled a car,

24
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,590
but it was
an environmentally friendly car.

25
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,188
Why doesn't that
get reported?

26
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,758
He was heartbroken, betrayed.

27
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,328
You say you understand,
but you don't... you can't.

28
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,897
You're like a big, giant Vulcan.

29
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,704
He's coming.
I'll call you later.

30
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,339
Hi. Margaret.
I work for Lola.

31
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,849
- Gary.
- I know.

32
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,410
We need to go out the back.

33
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,090
- Are there reporters out front?
- A few.

34
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,719
Not Hugh Grant level,
more like Robert Downey Jr.

35
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,958
When he broke into that family's house
and slept in the kid's bed.

36
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,523
I handled episodes two
through four for Robert,

37
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,899
so this sort of thing
is my specialty.

38
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,596
Okay, just so it's said,
this house is flammable.

39
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,109
I didn't mean
to burn down my house.

40
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,408
Yeah, and I didn't mean to eat my way
into a ten-year shame spiral,

41
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,312
but I did, and it's healthier
to acknowledge it.

42
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,375
So, this flammable house

43
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,250
belongs to one of Lola's
other fabulous clients,

44
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,257
who is currently shooting
a pilot in Toronto.

45
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,793
- An actor?
- Writer.

46
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,355
So, for the next six weeks,
su casa es su casa.

47
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,127
I say feel free to wear his clothes.

48
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,760
He'll probably get
a sick thrill out of it.

49
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,894
The gays.

50
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,165
He has dogs.

51
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,173
Yeah, they're away at summer camp.

52
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,640
Now, try the bed.

53
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,949
It's fine.

54
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,645
- Comfortable?
- Sure.

55
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,181
Look, Gary, I know this
has been crazy and stressful.

56
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,285
I want you to feel
safe and comfortable.

57
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,126
- I do.
- I'm a fan of yours, you know.

58
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,098
Your number-one fan!

59
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,100
But if you fuck this up,

60
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,500
I will smash your ankles
with a sledgehammer.

61
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,102
And that wouldn't be comfortable
for either one of us.

62
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,271
Nine dogs ran through the field.

63
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,777
The koala sits in the tree.

64
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,685
It's computer voice-recognition.

65
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,692
The parole system can call
you any time, day or night.

66
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,694
If you don't pick up
within five rings,

67
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,629
the police come
and haul your ass off.

68
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,029
What if I'm not here?

69
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,125
That's why they call it
"house arrest."

70
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,932
You stay inside your house.

71
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,137
He can take direction,
I promise.

72
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,877
I'll be coming by twice a day
to check up on you.

73
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,005
I should be
the only person coming by...

74
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,073
no pals, no buddies,
no heroin dealers.

75
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,482
I don't do heroin.

76
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,952
Yeah, crack is classy.

77
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,454
And I'm not buying you porn.

78
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,286
There's spray-per-view
on cable.

79
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,451
Great, 'cause I really
wasn't concerned

80
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,927
about my career,
family, or future.

81
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,124
- I just wanted to jerk off.
- Let me see your phone.

82
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,469
Come on, all my numbers
are in there.

83
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,029
Dial ten digits at random.

84
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,201
Whoever answers will be better
than the people on that phone.

85
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,939
You have my cell number,
you have delivery menus.

86
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,844
You're fine, right?

87
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,879
Bad idea.

88
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,346
Be good!

89
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,748
Keep it.

90
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,857
Someone was trying
to destroy the evidence.

91
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,423
Someone failed.

92
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,960
Once we get these samples
back to the crime lab...

93
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,374
we'll know
who the real killer is.

94
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,948
Somebody there?

95
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,916
Hello!

96
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,263
Hello?

97
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,007
Yes.

98
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,507
Nine leopards
ran through the jungle.

99
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,346
I bought two cakes
at the store.

100
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,187
The house is haunted.

101
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,456
There's a zeitgeist
or some...

102
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,191
Poltergeist, and no.

103
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,733
Maybe they were rats.
L.A.'s teeming with rats.

104
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,268
They live in the palm trees.

105
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,496
Maybe.

106
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,130
Okay, you know,
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

107
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,699
Really?

108
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,972
No, I'm a publicist.

109
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,037
My job is what
other people think of you,

110
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,083
not what you think of yourself,
so pull your shit together.

111
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,482
I am this close to getting

112
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,884
Christine Walsh to do
your piece in Parade.

113
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,287
Parade? I fucking hate Parade.

114
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,722
Everybody hates Parade,

115
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,387
but the people that watch Crim9 Lab
love their Marilyn Vos Savant.

116
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,898
One heartfelt act of contrition,
and maybe the show writer

117
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,491
won't kill off your character
between seasons.

118
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,900
I swear to God,
if you go bat-shit on me...

119
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,199
I'm not crazy.

120
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,265
Exactly. Exactly.

121
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,462
Sorry! I'm sorry.

122
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,694
Over here, to your left.

123
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,963
Right. Sorry, right.

124
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,734
I was practicing my putting,
if you can believe that.

125
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,865
Not really.

126
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,939
Okay, maybe I was
just looking for a way

127
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,482
to meet my infamous neighbor.

128
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,111
You see, I'm under house arrest too.

129
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,619
What'd you do?

130
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,621
I had sex with my husband.

131
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,486
That's awful.

132
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,190
Nine months later,
I had Jaden.

133
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
That's her over there.

134
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,331
She's a cutie.

135
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,768
She's sleeping for another...

136
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,733
Seventeen minutes.
She likes to keep to a schedule.

137
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,298
She seems really boring.

138
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,570
She is.

139
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,946
You're rich.

140
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,175
Shouldn't you have
a nanny from Ecuador?

141
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,878
I'm Canadian.

142
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,752
Can't work in the U.S.

143
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,314
Plus, I want to keep
this air of moral superiority

144
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,326
by doing everything myself.

145
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,350
Very Canadian.

146
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,418
Thanks.

147
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,262
Jaden goes down again
around 2:30.

148
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,703
Maybe I could stop by?

149
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,501
I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

150
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a date.

151
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,442
Is it?

152
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,114
- I'm Sarah, by the way.
- Gary.

153
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,312
Yeah, I know.

154
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,339
"The best of all possible worlds."

155
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,243
Okay.

156
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,511
Voltaire, Candide.
Are you actually reading it?

157
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,085
I thought I was.

158
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,487
Sorry I bailed.
Jaden had a fever.

159
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,148
How boring of her.

160
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,491
Housewarming gift!

161
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,790
Demon liquor.

162
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,196
And the best part is I can drink it.
I pumped before I came.

163
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,665
So did I.

164
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,566
It's hard to prove
that I was only trying

165
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,195
to burn my ex-girlfriend's stuff
and not the entire house.

166
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,265
Yeah, fire's tricky that way.

167
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,640
Yeah. How 'bout you?

168
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,679
Any history of arson?

169
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,045
Strangely enough...

170
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,844
I knew it. I could see
that little spark.

171
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,319
Well, it wasn't arson, probably.

172
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,250
When I was a little girl,
our house caught on fire.

173
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,554
Oh, shit.

174
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,188
I'll never forget the look
on my father's face

175
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,323
as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced

176
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,334
through the burning building
out onto the pavement.

177
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,734
I stood there,
shivering in my pajamas,

178
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,933
and watched the whole world
go up in flames.

179
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,813
And when it was over,
I said to myself,

180
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,873
"Is that all there is to a fire?"

181
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,613
Is that all there is?

182
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,418
Is that all there is?

183
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,222
Is that all there is?

184
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,960
If that's all there is, my friends

185
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,231
Then let's keep dancing

186
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,034
Let's break out the booze

187
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,234
And have a ball

188
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:20,480
If that's all there is

189
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,952
And then I met
the most wonderful boy in the world.

190
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,787
We would take long walks
by the river.

191
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,589
We'd sit for hours
gazing into each other's eyes.

192
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,721
We were so very much in love.

193
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,223
And then one day he went away,

194
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,361
and I thought I'd die, but I didn't.

195
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,238
And when I didn't, I said to myself,

196
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,176
"Is that all there is to love?"

197
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,848
Is that all there is

198
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,387
Is that all there is

199
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,948
If that's all there is, my friends

200
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,027
Then let's keep...

201
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,395
I know what you're thinking.

202
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,525
If that's the way she feels about it,
why doesn't she just end it all?

203
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,068
Oh, no.

204
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,402
I'm in no hurry
for that final disappointment.

205
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,934
I know as sure as I'm
standing here talking to you,

206
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,809
that when
that final moment comes

207
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,007
and I'm breathing my last breath,

208
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,983
I'll be saying to myself...

209
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,510
Is that all there is

210
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,489
Is that all there is

211
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,323
If that's all there is, my friends

212
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,855
Then let's keep dancing

213
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:48,270
Let's break out the booze
and have a ball

214
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,075
If that's all...

215
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,672
- I need to go.
- What?

216
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,548
Sorry, sorry.

217
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,881
Where are my shoes?

218
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,614
- Wait, just...
- Sorry.

219
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,657
Don't worry about it. Just...

220
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,284
I should go. Good-bye.

221
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,418
You coming back?

222
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,415
And if that mockingbird won't sing

223
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:11,582
Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

224
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,819
And if that cart and bull fall down

225
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,353
You'll still be the sweetest
little baby in town

226
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,864
Good night, sweetheart.

227
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:21,956
Good night.

228
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,571
The cat says, "Meow."

229
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,834
The pig says, "Oink."

230
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,968
The cow says, "Moo."

231
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,012
The cow says, "Moo."

232
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,015
The cow says, "Moo."

233
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,518
The dog says, "Nine.

234
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,182
Nine, nine, nine, nine."

235
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:49,883
Hello?

236
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,356
Yes.

237
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,765
Two trains run through the forest.

238
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:08,946
Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine...

239
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,658
Fuck.

240
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,734
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

241
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,602
What... I don't... I'm sorry.

242
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,577
Oh, no, I'm...

243
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,874
I'm fine. I'll be fine, yeah.

244
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,482
Where are your parents?

245
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,156
No, no, no, your mom and dad.
Where's your mom and dad?

246
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,891
I don't know what you're saying.

247
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,455
Look, hey, look,
I don't speak that,

248
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:40,233
so just go back
to wherever you came from.

249
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,967
You shouldn't be out here.
No, no, no. Go...

250
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,942
It's not safe for you to be out here.
You should go back, okay?

251
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,846
Oh, shit.

252
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,198
Evening, Officers.

253
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,774
Once again, house arrest means
you stay inside your house.

254
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,743
Think of it like
an electronic leash.

255
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,437
Think of it like
an electronic leash.

256
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,504
If you even go more than
100 feet from the base station,

257
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,777
the cops come,
and they throw your ass in jail.

258
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,943
If you ever try to take it off,
the cops come,

259
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,543
and they throw your ass in jail.

260
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,419
If they ever detect drugs
or alcohol in your system...

261
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,890
Cops come.
Throw my ass in jail.

262
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,952
No, I kick your ass.

263
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,190
Then the cops come
and throw your ass in jail.

264
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,857
Do I still have to answer the phone?

265
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,697
I'll be doing that from now on.
I'm moving into the guest room.

266
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,202
I don't need a babysitter.

267
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,400
Despite all evidence
to the contrary.

268
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,374
Don't worry,
I'm a cool roomie.

269
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,469
Who do you think taught
Affleck how to gamble?

270
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,880
Let's never hear that again!

271
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,323
...ninety-seven,
ninety-eight, ninety-nine.

272
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,189
One hundred feet.

273
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,198
Behold, the edge of your world.

274
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,290
In the world,
out of the world.

275
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,061
In the world,
out of the world...

276
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,937
Hey, I'm dancing!

277
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,006
Sure, absolutely.

278
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,639
So the guy's like,
"Do you know fencing?"

279
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,183
And I say, "That's what it says
on my headshot."

280
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,913
- Lies.
- Oh, always. Always.

281
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,922
So he says to me,
"Foil or epi?"

282
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,424
- Epee!
- And I say I'm about equal in both...

283
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,983
- Which is true!
- Exactly.

284
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,497
Anyway, he throws me
this fucking Conan sword, right?

285
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:51,195
And then he just starts
going after me.

286
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,258
I'm just swinging.

287
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,931
I'm just trying to stay alive,
right, with my eyes closed,

288
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,270
and I end up accidentally
cutting his ear.

289
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,502
You cut off his ear?

290
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,908
Yeah... well, no, no,
just a little, right.

291
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,674
But I ended up getting the job.

292
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,079
Wait, you were in
Pirates of the Caribbean?

293
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,050
Yeah. No, no.

294
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,143
No, not the movie, the ride.

295
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,452
I was all, like, "Arr, keep
both hands inside the boat."

296
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,588
Don't. No finger.

297
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,220
Good night, fuckface.

298
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,821
Good night, you filthy whore.

299
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,997
It's incredible.

300
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,568
Whenever I see them,
I always feel like... damn.

301
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,237
I was born at the wrong time.

302
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,076
Exactly.

303
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,710
- Where's the warden?
- Groceries.

304
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,346
Quite the little missus.

305
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,423
- How's Jaden?
- Boring.

306
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,589
We haven't had nearly the grand old time
you two have been having.

307
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,790
You've been watching.

308
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,130
Well, I don't want
to meddle in your affairs.

309
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,395
My affairs?

310
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,334
Everyone needs affection.
I get it.

311
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,032
I don't. Are you seriously jealous?

312
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,167
The opposite.
I just want to protect her.

313
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,213
- From what?
- From you.

314
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,182
Look at you. You date models,
actresses, tennis players.

315
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,240
Yeah?

316
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,549
On a scale of one to ten,
you belong with the nines.

317
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,749
We both know
you won't settle for less.

318
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,594
What are the nines?

319
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:04,930
What?

320
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,334
"Look for the nines"?

321
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,471
It's not mine.

322
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,511
- It's your handwriting.
- I didn't write it.

323
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,875
Okay.

324
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,926
Allee--allee--all come free.

325
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,085
What?

326
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,859
Nothing.

327
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,629
Seriously. What?

328
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,196
Nothing. I thought you were...

329
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:46,307
Forget it. Done. Sorry.

330
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,461
Hiya. Hi.

331
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,557
What?

332
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,465
I have to take this.

333
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,061
Who thought
it was a good idea

334
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,106
to let Courtney
into a pottery shop?

335
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,787
I know who you are.

336
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,687
- Really.
- I know what you are.

337
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,162
If you come near him again...

338
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,528
You'll what?

339
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,634
What are you gonna do about it?

340
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,433
Sorry, what's he calling you?

341
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,701
Margaret.

342
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,074
I like that. Margaret. Classic.

343
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,477
- Why don't you leave him alone?
- Alone?

344
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,175
He can't be left alone.
He's an actor.

345
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,708
If no one's watching him,
he doesn't really exist.

346
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,449
And for the record...

347
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,688
I'm not the one deceiving him.

348
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,388
He'll figure it out eventually,

349
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,023
and when he does, who do you
think he's going to blame?

350
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,141
Good night, rat face.

351
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,211
Good night.

352
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,392
Hey, neighbor.

353
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,705
Sorry for the psychotic episode.

354
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,034
Okay.

355
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,032
Are you okay?

356
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,703
You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish.

357
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,611
How many times should
the number nine come up?

358
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,046
Probablistically?

359
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,349
"Probablistically"?

360
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,050
You know what I mean.

361
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,251
One time out of ten.

362
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,294
How about every time?

363
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,931
But they only show up
when you look for them.

364
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,094
Looking for them changes things.

365
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,597
Some of these are prices,
and there's gonna be a lot of nines.

366
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,973
There's something wrong.

367
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,539
There's something wrong
with the world.

368
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:51,349
I can get you out of here,
but you have to trust me.

369
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,349
Good morning.
Everything okay?

370
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,656
Peachy.

371
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,822
Peachy's good.
I like peaches.

372
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,729
You want coffee?

373
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,360
Yeah.

374
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,311
What do I do?

375
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,179
Do you trust me?

376
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,559
You okay?

377
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,934
No.

378
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,263
Tell me about the nines.

379
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,276
The nines?

380
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,775
The nines.

381
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,774
It's sort of hard to start there.

382
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:55,012
Try, and don't tell me
I'm imagining it,

383
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,283
'cause they're showing up everywhere,
and I want to know why.

384
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,752
Best guess?

385
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:05,524
They're your subconscious
trying to remind you who you are.

386
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,695
I'm a nine?

387
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,133
Yes.

388
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,967
Doesn't make much sense
out of context.

389
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,873
You're not gonna
understand this yet, but...

390
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,775
we've known each other
for, like, 25 years.

391
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,480
One day when I was 12,

392
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,781
you called me out of the blue

393
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,481
and we've been talking
ever since.

394
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,581
Talking.

395
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,149
On the phone, usually.

396
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,354
I never met you
before I came here.

397
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,462
You, Gary, never met me, no,

398
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,526
but you're not always...

399
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,232
I can understand
why you're a little confused.

400
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,775
No, no.

401
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,575
I'm a lot confused.

402
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,086
Theories?

403
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,563
- This is all a dream?
- No.

404
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,293
- I'm in a coma?
- No.

405
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,339
Then I'm dead?

406
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,174
This is hell or a purgatorium
or something?

407
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,613
Okay, purgatorium
is where Romans vomited,

408
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:36,847
but no, this is as real
as anything can be.

409
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,616
What does that mean?

410
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,157
Everything is what it is,

411
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,023
but you're not
who you think you are.

412
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,827
God, no, Gary, please don't.

413
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,130
You can't trust her.
She's a nine.

414
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,467
You don't know
what you're doing.

415
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,905
Okay, so what happens
if I cross this line?

416
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,671
I don't know,
but it's not good.

417
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,683
Shit.

418
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,409
Previously
on Behind the Screen...

419
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,605
Gavin Taylor is one
of the best TV writers out there.

420
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,241
Every network would kill
to work with him.

421
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,217
- Good to see you!
- You look wonderful.

422
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,015
My name's Gavin Taylor.
I'm a film and television writer.

423
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,215
Knowing is a one-hour drama

424
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,417
about a woman
whose husband disappears.

425
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,222
She believes that her daughter
is the key to a dark conspiracy.

426
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,162
Even way back into The Fugitive,
where they didn't have

427
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,927
the full setup
and the payoff in each episode.

428
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,595
Knowing is not
gonna be Crim9 Lab,

429
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,162
not the popular kind of
mystery shows that are out there

430
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,799
where we get all the answers.

431
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,843
...trying to figure out how long

432
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,072
is the attention span
of today's audience.

433
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,238
So, boil it down for me.

434
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:14,341
Give me one line that we
can really set Roger on fire with.

435
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,081
Basically, it's like
Rosemary's Toddler.

436
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,950
My favorite movie.
That's my favorite film.

437
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,626
We sold it in the room.

438
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,198
Just tell me Roger
liked the script.

439
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,496
You're shooting a pilot.

440
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,630
Melissa McCarthy is my first
and only choice for the lead.

441
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,106
...writing a show
for you. For you.

442
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,767
- Really?
- Yes.

443
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,643
Gavin and I have been
friends forever.

444
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,182
It's delightful to be working
on Knowing,

445
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,184
and it's, you know,
not surprisingly,

446
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,516
a fantastic script,
and it's a great cast.

447
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,351
Gilmore Girls has been great,

448
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,391
but, you know,
I'm excited to go

449
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,325
and to have something
this great to go into.

450
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,521
I totally trust Gavin.

451
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,897
The only way we can afford
to shoot the pilot is in Canada.

452
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,561
- I can't believe we're shooting it...
- A 15-day shoot versus...

453
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,365
This is not an argument
I'm going to win.

454
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,930
It's really hard to think about
leaving for six weeks.

455
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,006
Puggies.

456
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,206
Action.

457
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,700
Puggies!

458
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,769
Where's your brother?

459
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,369
It's just so weird being back.

460
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,177
It just doesn't feel like
my house anymore.

461
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,501
At this stage,

462
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,479
you have the script that you wrote
and the film that you shot,

463
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,640
but you don't know how
it's gonna come together.

464
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,616
You just know how
you want it to feel.

465
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,991
Understand?
You have to use big girl hands.

466
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,559
You want to see
where we were today?

467
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,333
Okay, hit play. This button.

468
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,112
There's you and there's Daddy.

469
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,580
Oh, a little movie star.

470
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,655
Oh, he'll be back soon.
Don't you worry.

471
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,486
I don't know if we need
the cold open.

472
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,555
I think we want to get
right to the story.

473
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,931
- The story's so strong.
- Excuse me?

474
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,833
Is there any way
we could be more clear

475
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,963
about why Mary's
so freaked out at that moment?

476
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:27,568
Wow... I think it's
pretty obvious and dramatic.

477
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,806
It is, it's dramatic,
but, you know,

478
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,711
that's Roger's
big thing this season,

479
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,647
is never let the audience
be confused.

480
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,414
Oh, my God, that's just
a huge thing to remove.

481
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,150
No, it's just, you know,
let's see it without it.

482
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,557
Humor. You know, life is full
of funny little strange moments.

483
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,085
I'm just wondering if there
could be, like, not a belly laugh...

484
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,099
I invited Susan to see a rough cut
because I trust her taste.

485
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:54,433
More importantly, I trust her
as a barometer of Roger's taste.

486
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,268
...to give the audience a little...

487
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,906
Yeah, I mean...

488
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,640
Unfortunately, in this process,

489
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,275
it comes down to the decision of
one person, and that person's Roger.

490
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,978
I was thinking
we could all go down

491
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,520
to El Cholo for dinner tonight.

492
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,423
How do you feel about
some blue corn enchiladas?

493
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,550
Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?

494
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,130
He's not coming back.

495
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,364
Okay, stop.

496
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,893
We just need to slip a wild line
for you over the shot of Noelle.

497
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:28,961
What's the line?

498
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,200
"How could you."

499
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,004
- How could you.
- How could you.

500
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,477
It sounds like kosher
drug paraphernalia.

501
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,572
"Hey, Schmuley!
Have a hook on the Hookajew."

502
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,584
I know. It's just
for the test screening.

503
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,746
They really think
people won't get it?

504
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,723
The dumb people might not.

505
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,455
I didn't think we were
making the show for dumb people.

506
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,052
Yeah.

507
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,392
He's not coming back.

508
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,966
How could you?

509
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,662
How could you?!

510
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:01,831
How could you.

511
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,439
How could you.

512
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,499
How could you...?

513
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,476
- One more.
- How could you?

514
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,533
Cut. Perfect.

515
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,240
- I feel so dirty.
- That's how I like it.

516
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,578
I like that one.

517
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,013
I want to thank you all
very much for coming.

518
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,423
The show is Knowing.
It's a brand-new pilot.

519
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,930
Here, in this audience today,
you are the very first people to see it,

520
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,261
and after it's over,
I will come back here

521
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,733
and we'll all fill out
a comment card on our thoughts.

522
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,702
That being said,
enjoy the show.

523
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,482
Please take as much time
as you like.

524
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,215
There's no rush
with this whatsoever.

525
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,157
When you are finished, we're gonna
break into two separate groups...

526
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,786
men and women...
and then we'll discuss.

527
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,231
One of the most important things
in any new show

528
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,427
is how you feel
about the characters.

529
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,901
If you like the characters,

530
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,133
you're more likely
to tune in next week.

531
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,107
Let's find out about
these characters.

532
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,041
Show of hands...
how many of you liked

533
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,908
the character of Gabriel?

534
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,675
One, two, three, four, five, six.

535
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,341
How 'bout Mary?

536
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,113
One, two, three, four.

537
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,245
Noelle?

538
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,987
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

539
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,184
So, it's everybody.

540
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,317
Sierra?

541
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,853
One, two, three, four.

542
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,728
That's it?

543
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,359
Is there anything confusing
in the storyline

544
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,596
that's not resolved for you?

545
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,730
Look at this guy.
This guy hasn't budged.

546
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,604
His eyes are shut.
That's helpful. Thank you.

547
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,735
I hate it in movies
and TV shows when they

548
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,371
leave the car windows down
when they totally wouldn't.

549
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,075
- So they can see the camera?
- What's the difference.

550
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,412
Want to see the camera?

551
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,680
Was this an issue
for anybody else?

552
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,619
One.

553
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,155
Any other confusions?

554
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,626
Yeah. Was the little girl deaf
or was she just mute?

555
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,296
Is the little girl deaf or mute...
is she deaf or mute?

556
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,060
I'm saying what would
you say to him?

557
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,567
I'm not saying I don't know.

558
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,469
Come on. We're not signing to her,
she's signing to us.

559
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,167
We're just speaking to her,
and she seems to understand it.

560
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,107
I thought that was quite clear.

561
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,644
That guy's staring at me.

562
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,709
He can't see you.

563
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,615
God, he's staring at me.

564
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,778
I just waved,
and he nodded his head.

565
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,284
He can't see you.
Can't see us.

566
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,057
Susan, he's looking right at me.

567
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,056
You didn't raise your hand
to any questions. Any thoughts?

568
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,068
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

569
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,934
The show's not real.
Why can't you see that? Jesus!

570
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,906
What, are you fucking blind?!

571
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,067
You think you're
above this, don't you?

572
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,169
You are trapped here
with the rest of us, brother.

573
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,339
Get out. Get out!

574
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,349
Oblivio accebit!

575
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,551
Oh, my God.

576
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:12,956
You okay?

577
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,657
Yeah, but what was that?

578
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,327
Oh, my God.

579
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,663
I don't know.
The guy was crazy, clearly, I just...

580
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:25,799
I mean, the show's a little bit twisted,
so maybe it flipped something in him.

581
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,400
What did he say?

582
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,446
He said, "Oblivio accebit."

583
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,679
It's Latin,
"oblivion approaches."

584
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,050
What does that mean?

585
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,452
Other than the world
is coming to an end?

586
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,324
"Oblivio" can also mean forgetting.

587
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,917
Forgetfulness.

588
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,065
But I think that's
what I'm gonna do.

589
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,260
Forget it.

590
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,964
He was a terrible comedian
and his mom ran the lmprov.

591
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,164
Oh, my God, Pauly Shore.

592
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,867
You're not helping me at all!

593
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,609
Designer that was killed in Miami
outside of his house.

594
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,807
Gianni Versace!

595
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,317
One word for both of them.

596
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,285
Brangelina.

597
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,724
This is a hard one,
and I don't know how to do it.

598
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,018
You're giving...
you and I should switch,

599
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,428
because that's... you're...

600
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,703
...three weeks later.
I remember that.

601
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,876
Did you have a chance
to look at those cards yet?

602
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,710
From the screening?

603
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,579
Pardon me.

604
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,178
- Daddy needs a drink.
- Help yourself then.

605
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,017
Hey, woman! Where's my drink?

606
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,150
I'm-a comin'!
But I still love you most.

607
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,218
People will write things
on those cards

608
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,127
that they won't say
in a focus group.

609
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,789
They get more specific.

610
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,562
Roger says, you know,
forget about the people

611
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,603
who score you
in the twos and threes,

612
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,662
because they're never
gonna like your show.

613
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,573
- Instead, look for the nines.
- The nines.

614
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,373
They're the ones
who think your show is almost

615
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,141
the best thing
they've ever seen.

616
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,183
They get your vision,
they just want it to be better.

617
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,118
Round two is starting
without you!

618
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:20,156
- You gonna look at those cards?
- Absolutely.

619
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,212
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

620
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,375
Sometimes the numbers
point things out

621
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,746
that you didn't want to admit to yourself,
and in this case, it's Melissa.

622
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,548
Well, her overall scores were okay,

623
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,611
but if you look at the people
who scored the show the highest,

624
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,658
the one consistent dip
was Melissa.

625
00:49:55,726 --> 00:50:00,129
There's some sort of subtle
undertones of negativity there.

626
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,291
Well, Gavin, the show is testing
very well in the Midwest,

627
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,599
but it's not doing well in the urban areas,
and it's not doing well with men.

628
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,036
We've got a major problem,

629
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,597
and I really need you
to think about this with me.

630
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,673
It's Melissa, and it's just
what I thought it was gonna be.

631
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,805
If you'd read the cards,
you'd understand.

632
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,372
I read some of the cards,
but I don't believe in that stuff.

633
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,181
I don't believe you can let
these armchair quarterbacks...

634
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,587
They're not connecting to Melissa.
And I love her. She's so strong.

635
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,488
I am with you on the fact
that she is not

636
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,153
your traditional lead
of a network television show.

637
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,197
She doesn't have
a ton to do in the pilot.

638
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,561
There's so much to set it up.

639
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,930
That's one of the challenges
of the premise pilot.

640
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,630
- But the network still likes the show.
- Roger is your biggest cheerleader.

641
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,104
Okay, how about above Roger?

642
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,902
Roger's calling the shots on this.

643
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,910
But we all know that Roger
consults with the "higher powers."

644
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,843
- That is true.
- They tell him what to do.

645
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,404
- I'm wondering if they liked the show.
- They haven't seen it.

646
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,076
They're gonna watch
all of the pilots on Friday.

647
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,517
That's what I'm telling you.

648
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,783
I want to have something
to present to them...

649
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,482
Why are you focusing
on Melissa?

650
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,450
She's our biggest concern.

651
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,428
She's also the biggest star
on the show.

652
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,964
No, no, no.
You are the biggest star.

653
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,624
Roger has a huge deal with you,

654
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,192
and he went along with casting Melissa
when it was against his instinct.

655
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,295
Hooray for Roger.

656
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,170
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

657
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,401
Meet with someone.

658
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,311
- Who?
- Dahlia Salem.

659
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,906
I know you like her.

660
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,348
Oh, God.
Are you kidding me?

661
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,648
The network has
a huge holding deal with her.

662
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,348
Yes, and they put her
in Gatins' pilot.

663
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,948
That's dead.
I mean, it's dying.

664
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,290
But the network,
they love Dahlia,

665
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,488
so if she could just
jump into your show...

666
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,826
Just jump over to my show?

667
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:45,197
There's no such thing...
there's re-shooting the pilot,

668
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,828
and I brought this up
months and months ago.

669
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,838
You guys kept pushing
other people on me,

670
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,500
and I kept saying Melissa,
Melissa, Melissa.

671
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,477
You kept pushing Melissa on us,
and now we have a problem.

672
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,070
You're very lucky
in that Roger will pay for this.

673
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,777
Roger is willing to re-shoot
this entire fucking thing.

674
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,244
Is this really
about Melissa?

675
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,958
This is about getting
your show on the air, right?

676
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,090
I need you to focus on that.
In the end, that's all that matters.

677
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,063
That's my job.

678
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,238
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

679
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:21,727
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

680
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,603
- Well, nice to...
- Thank you for doing this.

681
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,302
Absolutely. I've been looking
forward to this, actually.

682
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,709
- I have a question for you.
- Yes?

683
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,508
Is it "Dalia" or "Dahlia"?

684
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,515
Thank you for asking.
It's "Dalia."

685
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,948
- Dalia. I knew it!
- You did?

686
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,918
I contested this
with someone earlier.

687
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,011
Well, good.

688
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,488
We have the same birthday.
I looked you up on IMDb.

689
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,458
I wanted to see everything you...
yes, we have the same birthday!

690
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,119
Same year, same day,
everything.

691
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,060
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

692
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,995
- Isn't that cool?
- That's insane.

693
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,363
- November 21st.
- Oh, my God.

694
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,369
So you're completely
and utterly crazy too!

695
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,668
- She works more than me!
- That's the thing that's killing me,

696
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,539
because she gave up
Gilmore Girls to do this show.

697
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,111
She's a very strong character,

698
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,272
and I'm attracted
to strong roles.

699
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,043
Yeah, I'm hoping
to fill her out even more,

700
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:11,383
and obviously collaborate
with the person that's playing her.

701
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,321
I mean, I see why
the network loves her.

702
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,723
She's adorable,
but it's just that in my head,

703
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,852
you know, I wrote
the role for Melissa.

704
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,456
She's one of my best friends,
and I can only imagine it with her.

705
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,931
Could Dahlia do it?

706
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,529
Absolutely. She's terrific.

707
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,232
It could work, I just don't know
if I want it to work.

708
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,436
When I get stressed out,
I play videogames.

709
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,842
It's my therapy.

710
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,642
Can't have them on my computer
at home 'cause I'd never write.

711
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,240
I love these games
that you can kind of...

712
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,013
lose yourself a little bit in them.

713
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,544
I love that it's a different world
that's existing at the same time.

714
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,147
They're better than real life,

715
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,251
because when you get stuck,
you can always hit "reset."

716
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,287
That's what life needs.
Needs a reset button.

717
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,424
I have to let Melissa go.

718
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,127
What happens
if you don't let Melissa go?

719
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,139
If I don't let Melissa go?

720
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,543
My world ends, so...

721
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,448
I can't let that happen.

722
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,314
If we're gonna replace Melissa,
I want to hear it from Roger.

723
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,751
Roger's on a plane to London,

724
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,881
but I talked with him before he left,
and he said yes on Dahlia.

725
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,549
What does that mean?

726
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,594
It means yes.

727
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,128
Yes, replace Melissa?

728
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:30,292
Roger wants your show
on the air starring Dahlia,

729
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,064
and I just got off the phone
with her agents, and they love it,

730
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,627
and she loves, loves you.

731
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,694
What about Melissa?

732
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,469
- You want me to call her agents?
- Oh, God, no.

733
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,009
No, I'll tell her.

734
00:54:52,956 --> 00:55:00,192
As long as he needs me

735
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,528
I know where I must be

736
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,969
I am trying to get
my one-woman show together

737
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:11,166
that I'm trying to squeeze
in between the pilot and the series.

738
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,004
When you add that cry to the voice:

739
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,271
As long as...

740
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,845
I've always been kind of
obsessed with nuns.

741
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,081
You know, they're kind of
like God's fag-hags, so...

742
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,555
I went to private
Catholic schools for 12 years,

743
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,457
so I have a lot of... nuns.

744
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,054
I'm sorry.
I swear, I don't usually...

745
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,359
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

746
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,364
I have to take this. I'm so sorry.

747
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,462
Yeah, I guess we still mean it.

748
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,904
They accepted our offer.

749
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,637
All right, we will call you back.

750
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,507
Thank you. No, no, no, it's good.

751
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,409
I know I sound nervous.
Okay, bye.

752
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,844
I think we just bought a house.

753
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,646
Pretty good.
Pretty good, right?

754
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,708
That's good.

755
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,344
- Right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

756
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:01,185
Go to take a phone call...
we just bought a house!

757
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,488
Well, I think that the show
that Gavin wrote for her

758
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,188
could be a really big deal for her,

759
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,992
'cause she's been more
of a supporting character,

760
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,693
and now she's right in the thick.

761
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,204
So, it's exciting.
She's really excited, a little nervous.

762
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,297
Then you will know

763
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,572
If someone needs you

764
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,875
You love them so

765
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,877
I won't...

766
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:35,416
Betray his trust

767
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:40,225
Though people say I must

768
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:45,758
I've got to stay true to...

769
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:54,476
As long as he needs me

770
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,719
Then he's like,
"I'm straight, remember?"

771
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,988
Suddenly stricken
with some sort of gay panic.

772
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,619
"I'm your straight husband."

773
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,824
- You can throw color swatches at me.
- I know. Oh, I will.

774
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,130
I think my house is haunted.

775
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,229
Well, your house is really old.

776
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,103
Ever since I got back,
I just, I feel like there's...

777
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,040
I feel like there's
someone else there,

778
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,341
and then last night,
I thought I heard something,

779
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,040
like, a woman singing.

780
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:36,843
- What? Like a ghost?
- I guess. I don't know.

781
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,219
Then I saw something.
I actually ran into someone.

782
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,383
I mean, I saw...

783
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,092
Was it the singing ghost?

784
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,224
It was a man.
I think it was me.

785
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,062
What? Your house
is haunted by yourself?

786
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,638
Yeah, I don't, I mean, I'm like...

787
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,646
having a nervous breakdown
or something.

788
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,443
I'm literally so focused
on this show

789
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,814
that I feel like I'm living
inside of the show.

790
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,944
I can't tell where
it ends and I begin,

791
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,147
and I'm having
conversations with people,

792
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,817
and I'm ten feet outside
of my body and looking down.

793
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,417
There I am, having
this conversation with somebody,

794
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,963
and I'm just observing it,
you know.

795
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,228
Just, I don't feel good.

796
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,902
You're just stressed, right?

797
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,175
The network wants
to replace you.

798
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,710
Oh, my God.

799
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,214
And I'm letting them,

800
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:45,118
because I really want
this show on the air.

801
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,147
I have all these characters
inside my head,

802
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,556
and they wanna live,
and I'm the only way...

803
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,357
This is the only way
that they can.

804
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,333
- I have five seasons mapped out.
- Oh, five?

805
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,427
Well, it sucks.

806
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,471
Either you go away
or the show goes,

807
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,564
and I had to make a decision,

808
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,632
and that's the decision
that I made.

809
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,573
And I am so sorry.

810
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,379
I understand.

811
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,386
I mean, it's not your fault, right?

812
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,048
I mean, it couldn't be your fault.

813
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:25,185
You are morally incapable
of doing the right thing.

814
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,058
Right? Don't do that.

815
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,189
Don't get me wrong.

816
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,960
I think you do feel bad for me.

817
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,468
That's all I think you feel for me.

818
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,231
Okay, I am still the fat girl

819
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,240
you call on Friday nights
when your date falls through.

820
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,037
"Hey, let's go see a movie!"

821
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,339
"Let's go to Fubar."

822
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,006
"Then when I pick up
a hot piece of ass, I'll drop you,

823
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,140
"and that's okay...
don't worry about Melissa.

824
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,810
I mean, you can call her tomorrow
and apologize, or not."

825
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:53,287
It doesn't really matter 'cause we're not
actually friends, are we, Gavin?

826
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,052
- That's just not true.
- Isn't it, really?

827
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,593
I prefer to not do this
on camera, okay?

828
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,720
- Is this not a good idea?
- Please lower your voice.

829
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,924
I'm not gonna lower my voice.
Is that embarrassing?

830
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,432
You can't control this one.

831
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,525
Your little puppets
are off their strings,

832
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,197
running around saying shit
that you didn't write.

833
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,968
Well, this is reality,
and it scares the shit out of you.

834
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,872
Reality scares me?
Does it really?

835
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,912
I'm gonna tell you, you wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for me.

836
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,642
I gave you your first few roles
and your career as a result.

837
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,081
That's reality, Melissa.

838
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,642
Thank you for finally
playing that fucking card,

839
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,814
the "I invented
Melissa McCarthy" card.

840
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,914
I bought a house, Gavin!

841
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,517
I bought a house
'cause of what we talked about.

842
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,258
Fuck you, and don't ever
fucking pity me again.

843
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,471
Cut, please.

844
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,640
Please.

845
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,551
Upfronts is the week each year

846
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,994
when the networks present
their fall schedule to the advertisers.

847
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,032
It's a very important event for us,

848
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,499
and the weeks preceding it
are pretty stressful

849
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,662
because the schedule is a secret
right up until it's announced.

850
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,933
"Upfronts"
is a complete oxymoron

851
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:21,773
because nobody's
remotely honest, so it's...

852
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,108
It's really a show
for the advertisers

853
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,980
to get them really jazzed up
about the new product for the fall.

854
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,076
"Here's our new shit. Like it?"

855
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,485
There's lots of upsides...
you're in New York.

856
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,217
Any time you're in New York City
is a good time.

857
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,687
So, have you heard from Susan?

858
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:42,993
No, I've not heard
from Susan as of yet.

859
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,399
I left her four or five messages

860
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,937
telling her what
went down with Melissa,

861
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,473
and that I let her go,
and that I met with Dahlia...

862
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,542
and I've not yet
heard back from her.

863
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,610
I feel bad about
what happened with Melissa,

864
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,080
but it's a two-way street
and I'm a little angry, too.

865
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,276
We've been friends for years.

866
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,843
I think we'll be friends again.

867
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,117
We'll move on.

868
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,092
Ice cold water, ice cold water.

869
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,185
Only one dollar.

870
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,993
I was 12 when we got in this car.

871
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,328
I've not yet heard from Susan.

872
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,804
Got off the plane,
checked messages, nothing.

873
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,505
I suppose that we have a...

874
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,177
I suppose we have
a reciprocal relationship,

875
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,806
my show and your show.

876
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,647
That's the thing
about reality television, isn't it...

877
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,085
the worse it gets for me,
the better it is for you.

878
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,390
It certainly inspires
a newfound sympathy

879
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,688
for my characters.

880
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,457
You know,
I put them through hell.

881
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,330
I kill off their husbands
or throw them off cliffs.

882
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,028
I'm a cruel god...

883
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,938
all in the name of a good story
or compelling television.

884
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,439
What's funny is that I'm
a character in your show.

885
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,140
I'm disposable.

886
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,877
Kill off the hero.
No one will see it coming.

887
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,513
I dare you.

888
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,685
I think I'm just tired, you know?

889
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:19,921
I'm just tired.

890
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,337
It's just so surreal being here.

891
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:31,204
It's not at all how I imagined.

892
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:37,710
Hey, you!

893
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,941
Hey, hi!

894
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,711
God, Gavin.

895
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,012
Get in here, get in here!

896
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,575
You're doing your show.

897
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,248
And so are you.
Welcome to reality television.

898
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,449
Did you just get in?

899
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,650
Just now.

900
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:54,059
This whole last 24 hours
have been surreal.

901
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,155
Right. I just said that. Surreal.

902
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,525
- You're good?
- Yeah, great.

903
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,932
I wanted to call you, and...

904
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,337
Oh, yeah? Call anytime.
Seriously, I don't sleep, so...

905
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:08,571
I just felt really weird
about what happened.

906
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,544
It's just too bad.

907
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,875
What happened?

908
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:15,111
So I just bumped
into Dahlia Salem,

909
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,412
star of my show.

910
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:23,214
She tells me that
Gatins' show got picked up,

911
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,260
so, no, she won't
be starring in my show,

912
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,523
which makes me wonder
if my show even exists.

913
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,994
No, no, I left word for Roger,
and I left word for Susan too.

914
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,301
It's like they dropped off
the face of the Earth.

915
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,876
Just call me
when you know something.

916
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,411
At this moment,
I can't be certain

917
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,978
whether Knowing will end up
on the schedule at all.

918
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,616
As far as Gavin's concerned,
the show is on the air.

919
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:00,025
You don't normally fly to New York
and find out at the last fucking second

920
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,858
that your show's
been pulled off the air.

921
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,799
- Excuse me.
- So what is the situation right now?

922
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,496
I don't know. Right now,
the entire schedule is in flux,

923
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,699
and I get these missives
from Roger and the "higher powers,"

924
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,072
but you're not really sure
what they add up to.

925
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,666
What's up?

926
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,145
They flew you out here anyway, huh?

927
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,479
- Oh, see you... you know!
- No, I mean...

928
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,485
It would've been great if you'd extended
the common courtesy of a call.

929
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,714
Gavin, this is
the television business.

930
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,656
It's like high school.
I don't know what to tell you, man.

931
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,660
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

932
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,855
But I'm kind of not.
I want my show on the air,

933
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,161
just like you want
your show on the air.

934
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,361
It was shitty of you to go
behind my back after Dahlia, okay?

935
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,801
That was shitty.

936
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,203
And you fired
Melissa McCarthy without...

937
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,971
you didn't even have a backup.

938
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,172
Why would they pick up
your show without a star?

939
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,977
- The network wanted Dahlia.
- They wanted Dahlia in my show.

940
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,883
We tested before your show.
We tested through the roof.

941
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,547
You should see the numbers.
I'll show them to you.

942
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,786
- Really?
- Yeah. Who's your exec?

943
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,384
Susan Howard.

944
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,760
Susan Howard.
She was there.

945
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,025
Ask her.

946
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,623
She would know.

947
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,407
I'm at the UTA party.

948
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,344
Did you hear
about Ricky's assistant?

949
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,847
She literally shat herself.

950
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,611
- No, I saw it!
- Hey!

951
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,150
I'll break your fucking finger!

952
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,583
I'll call you back.

953
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,488
All right, let me explain
why I didn't call you back.

954
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,555
Roger wanted to talk
to you personally.

955
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:47,261
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- We're only picking up two dramas.

956
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,794
- The rest is what, reality?
- You can go mid-season.

957
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,501
You can go to hell, okay?

958
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,440
All right.

959
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,173
I've been the only one here
trying to protect you...

960
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,613
Oh, God, don't start!
Protecting me from what?

961
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,378
From you? You're psychotic.
All I wanna know is why.

962
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,716
- You want a motive?
- I do.

963
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:05,988
This isn't Crim9 Lab.
Nobody got murdered.

964
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,046
This isn't Crim9 Lab.
Nobody got murdered.

965
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:11,150
My show did. Tell me why.

966
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,991
I had to get you away from her.
She was holding you back.

967
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,520
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

968
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,293
If she really mattered so much,

969
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,665
you couldn't have
betrayed her so easily.

970
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,762
Do you manipulate everybody
or am I special?

971
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,033
Are you the victim here?

972
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,803
The big creator can't stand up
to one little d-girl?

973
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,504
- It was your choice.
- Give me a break.

974
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,810
I didn't have a choice.
It was either Dahlia or no show.

975
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,873
That was the only thing...
oh, fuck you!

976
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,316
Fuck you!

977
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,752
Your dialogue
used to be a lot sharper.

978
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,619
Maybe Gatins
could give it a polish.

979
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,325
Is that all there is?

980
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,768
You feel like a man?

981
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,329
Because I'll tell you
a little secret.

982
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,238
You're not.

983
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,777
Hey, look, my...
I don't wanna do this anymore.

984
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,220
My show is not gonna happen,

985
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,315
so this show's over, done, gone,
good-bye, thank you very much.

986
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,587
I'm not gonna be
your fuckin' puppet!

987
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:56,159
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

988
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,756
Who you talkin' to?

989
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,451
Oh, God.

990
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,678
I can understand
why you're a little confused.

991
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:49,979
No, no.

992
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,247
I'm a lot confused.

993
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,320
Theories?

994
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,519
This is all a dream?

995
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:01,585
No.

996
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,467
I'm in a coma?

997
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,398
No.

998
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,264
Then I'm dead?

999
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,898
This is hell

1000
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,103
or a purgatorium or something?

1001
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,509
Okay, purgatorium

1002
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,309
is where Romans vomited,

1003
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,748
but no, this is as real

1004
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:23,910
as anything can be.

1005
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,817
What does that mean?

1006
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,015
Everything is what it is,

1007
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,548
but you're not who you think you are.

1008
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,526
Okay. Then who am I?

1009
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,833
You are...

1010
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,431
a multi-dimensional being

1011
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:48,033
of vast, almost infinite power.

1012
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,477
You, this body you're in,

1013
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,641
it's just one of your incarnations,

1014
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,083
avatars, call you what you will.

1015
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,520
Are you saying I'm God?

1016
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,682
Technically, no.

1017
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,091
If God is a ten,

1018
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,458
a theoretical ultimate,

1019
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,054
you're more of a nine.

1020
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,056
What are you?

1021
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,570
Humans are sevens.

1022
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,071
Monkeys are sixes.

1023
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,201
What are the eights?

1024
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,641
Koalas.

1025
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,972
They're telepathic,

1026
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,847
plus they control the weather.

1027
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:27,145
But the important thing is you.

1028
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,416
You created this world on a whim

1029
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,853
and decided to stick around

1030
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,824
to see how it turned out.

1031
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,224
You can destroy the world

1032
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,693
with a single thought.

1033
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,629
Don't, incidentally.

1034
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,225
Just file that away.

1035
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,395
But... the truth is,

1036
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,564
you hold all the cards.

1037
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,036
When people pray,

1038
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,338
they don't want this thing

1039
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,106
or that thing.

1040
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,204
They don't want to be forgotten.

1041
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,720
So... you understand?

1042
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,724
I mean, I would've told you earlier,

1043
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:10,781
but I didn't...

1044
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,053
Yeah.

1045
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,958
Okay?

1046
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,519
I understand.

1047
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,131
But I don't believe you.

1048
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,762
Noelle, don't get too far ahead.

1049
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,765
No! You had ice cream at lunch.

1050
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,033
Evidently, frozen yogurt
doesn't count.

1051
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,609
I'll make note.

1052
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:05,511
That's blazing speed
right there!

1053
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,508
Did you hit it?

1054
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,213
Shouldn't have to.

1055
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,997
Honey, I think we left
the overhead light on.

1056
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,593
Battery's dead.
At least the starter is.

1057
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,503
- How do we, uh...?
- We call the service.

1058
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,972
There's not much else we can do.

1059
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,976
Just the little battery, right?
The big one's probably fine.

1060
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,602
I guess.

1061
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,045
We can't jump it
from one battery to another?

1062
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,707
You cross over somehow?

1063
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,843
Who do you think
you married, MacGyver?

1064
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,581
Come on. Hold on.

1065
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,486
- Are you getting a signal?
- No.

1066
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:54,586
You?

1067
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,223
Yes. One bar.

1068
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,602
Don't worry.
Daddy's calling people to help us.

1069
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,906
Minute you place a call,
the bar goes away.

1070
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,343
Keep trying.

1071
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:14,644
I'll keep trying, Mary,
but it's gonna keep happening.

1072
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,445
What do you wanna do?

1073
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:18,910
I don't know.

1074
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,888
Maybe if you hold it up higher.

1075
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,129
Okay, look, the problem is
that we're boxed in.

1076
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,567
It's a canyon.

1077
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,264
Where we came off the main road,
it was more open and higher, too.

1078
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,302
- That's at least a mile.
- I can run that.

1079
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,944
So, what, we stay here?

1080
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,515
You okay with that?

1081
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,520
I don't think we have
much of a choice, so...

1082
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:55,455
- Yeah. Go.
- Okay.

1083
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,187
Daddy's gonna get
a truck to help us out.

1084
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,785
Take care of Mommy, okay?
All right.

1085
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,127
Be right back.

1086
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:13,033
Excuse me.

1087
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:16,070
Hi. Do you have a cell phone?

1088
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,438
Oh, no, I don't.
There's no service up here.

1089
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,442
Yeah, I'm finding that out.

1090
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,640
You can usually get a signal
down at the ranger's station.

1091
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,979
Yeah, you just follow
the road down.

1092
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,019
It's probably... I don't know.
You got a car?

1093
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,453
No, it's dead.
That's why I need a...

1094
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,254
Are you headed
back to your car now?

1095
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,727
If you could give me a ride
to a gas station, wherever?

1096
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:47,168
Look, I'm not
some crazy Ted Bundy guy.

1097
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,396
I'm not gonna rape
or kill you or anything.

1098
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,804
Which is, of course,
what a Ted Bundy would say.

1099
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,040
Look, I'm a videogame designer.

1100
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,241
My wife is an editor,
my daughter's eight.

1101
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,716
Look, I just... they're waiting
back at the car.

1102
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,344
Just a little help before it gets dark.

1103
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,388
I'll call somebody
when I get back to town.

1104
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,016
I believe you, I do, it's just
you don't know where the car is,

1105
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,218
and the guy might not come.

1106
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,057
- We can't be up here all night, so...
- Sorry.

1107
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,155
- Don't be sorry, just help me out.
- No.

1108
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:18,392
I can't.

1109
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,335
Why won't you trust me?

1110
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,465
Okay, but you have to be careful.

1111
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,969
Understand? You have
to use big girl hands.

1112
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,098
You want to see
where we were today?

1113
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,108
Okay, hit play. This button.

1114
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,306
There's you and there's Daddy.

1115
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,476
A little movie star.

1116
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,192
He'll be back soon.
Don't you worry.

1117
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,436
Are you following me?

1118
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,906
Since I was sure
you weren't following me.

1119
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,309
I'm sorry, it's just...

1120
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,247
- You thought I was Ted Bundy.
- Kind of.

1121
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,183
My name's Gabriel... Bundy.

1122
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,948
Sierra.

1123
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,347
It's weird
that there's no cars at all.

1124
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,620
Yeah, I'll say.

1125
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,958
Anyway, my car
is parked over there.

1126
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,760
It's not that far,

1127
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,028
and if you want, I could
give you a ride to town.

1128
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,296
That'd be great.
Thank you.

1129
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,805
- Make up some karma.
- Please, lead the way.

1130
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:10,806
Just a sec.

1131
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,242
Okay, confession.

1132
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,447
I kind of recognized you.

1133
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,445
Really.

1134
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,719
I wasn't sure,
but I think I saw a picture of you

1135
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,193
in my boyfriend's
videogame magazine.

1136
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,820
Right? You're, like, the shit.

1137
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:29,886
No, no.

1138
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,729
You're like the Quentin Tarantino
of their world,

1139
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,325
videogame god.

1140
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,563
- Not really, no.
- Fine.

1141
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:39,198
You seriously recognized me
off one photo?

1142
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,708
I thought you were
kind of hot, considering.

1143
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,801
Considering...?

1144
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,403
Within the subset
of videogame people.

1145
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,013
I wasn't masturbating
to your picture or anything.

1146
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,073
I guess I'm flattered.

1147
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,643
You should be.
I'm stingy with compliments.

1148
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,484
Your boyfriend
plays videogames?

1149
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,926
Ex-boyfriend.
And yes, way too many.

1150
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:02,122
He used to play Evercrack
back in the day,

1151
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,721
but your game was, like,

1152
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,926
I don't know,
what's worse than crack?

1153
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,093
Supercrack?

1154
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,534
He was spending
40 hours a week

1155
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,696
collecting Thunderleaf
or whatever,

1156
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:14,538
and I was his mule, hauling it around,
'cause he ran out of space.

1157
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,837
You had an account?

1158
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,674
Part of your world,
and you didn't know it.

1159
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,373
I'm sorry.

1160
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,438
You can make it up to me.

1161
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,042
Shit.

1162
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,849
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1163
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:38,426
And I am so sorry.

1164
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:44,603
I understand.
It's not your fault, right?

1165
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,708
It couldn't be your fault.

1166
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,246
You're morally incapable
of doing the right thing.

1167
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:53,406
- I don't...
- Right?

1168
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,609
So, you play a lot
of characters at once?

1169
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,483
A couple.
Most people do.

1170
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,283
But you're not most people.

1171
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:04,656
You created the world.
You know all the secret codes.

1172
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,490
- What, like god mode?
- Is that what you call it?

1173
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:10,429
It's when you have all the powers
and you can't be killed.

1174
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,193
It's actually boring to play, though.

1175
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,996
A game isn't fun
unless there are rules.

1176
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,764
And you make the rules.

1177
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,837
Yeah, I do.

1178
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,241
Thanks.

1179
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,674
Do you think that I'm pretty?

1180
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:28,371
What?

1181
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,145
Do you think I'm hot...

1182
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,415
on a purely physical level?

1183
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,379
Sure.

1184
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,825
That's a rave.

1185
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,021
Well, I don't know
why you're asking.

1186
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,259
My ex-boyfriend the orc,
used to say,

1187
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:45,856
"The thing that I like about you

1188
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:49,131
is you're not so hot
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you."

1189
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,263
So where's the orc now?

1190
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,499
He's dead.

1191
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,106
I spiked his water bottle
with a massive quantity of GHB.

1192
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:01,137
He hallucinated,
went into convulsions, and died.

1193
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,379
Remind me not
to piss you off, Sarah.

1194
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,412
Sierra!

1195
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:09,784
Sorry.

1196
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,224
What makes you think
you haven't pissed me off already?

1197
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,603
How you doin', kiddo?

1198
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:27,006
I was thinking we could all go
to El Cholo for dinner tonight.

1199
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,568
How do you feel about
some blue corn enchiladas?

1200
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,704
Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?

1201
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,515
He's not coming back.

1202
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,454
How could you?

1203
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,021
How could you?!

1204
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,016
How could you.

1205
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,251
How could you.

1206
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:47,821
How could you...?

1207
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:50,594
- How could you?
- Cut. Perfect.

1208
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,360
I feel so dirty.

1209
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:53,560
That's how I like it.

1210
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:13,543
Wait.

1211
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,985
Something's wrong.

1212
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,355
I feel...

1213
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:40,136
Wait.

1214
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,874
I have a wife and a daughter.
They're waiting for me.

1215
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,420
- Where are they?
- Back at the car.

1216
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:47,477
Which direction?

1217
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,162
Face it, G, you don't know
where they are.

1218
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,459
You don't know where you are.

1219
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,466
We've been walking
in circles for an hour.

1220
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,900
- Where is your car?
- There is no car.

1221
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:06,464
It was all a pretense,
an excuse to get you on your own.

1222
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,605
You getting dizzy?

1223
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,308
It's just the GHB in the water.

1224
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,312
What's happening?

1225
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,911
I'm sorry that it had
to come to this, G.

1226
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,853
I promise it's gonna
be over soon.

1227
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,722
You're trying to kill me?

1228
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:28,354
No, this is not a murder.
It's an intervention.

1229
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,024
Do you feel like a man?
You're not.

1230
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,932
I had to get you away from her.
She was holding you back.

1231
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,492
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

1232
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,368
- Allee--allee--all come free!
- There's something wrong...

1233
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,635
I can get you out of here,

1234
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,471
but you have to trust me.

1235
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,375
Do you feel like a man?

1236
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,006
'Cause I'll tell you
a little secret.

1237
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,913
You're not.

1238
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,100
Why are you doing this?

1239
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,695
You did this to yourself.

1240
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,273
And admitting that
is the first step.

1241
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:18,171
You're a crackhead, G.

1242
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:24,276
Thing is, this planet
and these people,

1243
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,377
they're your drug of choice.

1244
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,487
It wasn't that hard
to make a universe.

1245
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:34,690
At first you just checked in
every once in a while...

1246
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:37,026
...see how the Neanderthals
were doing,

1247
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,999
move a couple
of continents around.

1248
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,536
But then you got
more into it.

1249
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:45,664
You started playing a couple
of characters of your own.

1250
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:49,504
Slaves, kings, messiahs.

1251
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,807
Pretty soon you were playing 24/7.

1252
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,211
How long have I been...

1253
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:56,444
You've been gone
for 4,000 years,

1254
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:59,043
not that time means
the same for us.

1255
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,885
You came looking for me?

1256
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,516
That's what a girl does.

1257
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,253
Why now?

1258
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,023
Because you forgot
who you were.

1259
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,088
You forgot this wasn't real.

1260
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,226
We couldn't just storm in
on a fiery chariot.

1261
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:17,294
It was your universe.
We had to play by your rules.

1262
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:21,206
We had to show you how limited
and corrupt your little world was.

1263
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:25,303
Don't get me wrong,
it's a nice place.

1264
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,009
It's cozy...

1265
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,544
...but do you remember
where you came from?

1266
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:42,054
Do you remember
where you came from?

1267
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,497
It was warm.

1268
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:50,535
And white, like a...

1269
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,199
You can't describe it
with human words.

1270
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,765
You can't think it
with human thoughts.

1271
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:57,777
We need you to come back.

1272
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,540
With us.

1273
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:03,614
Come back with me.

1274
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:12,727
You can destroy the world
with a single thought.

1275
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,161
You can destroy the world
with a single thought.

1276
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:20,696
Don't, incidentally.
Just file that away.

1277
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:23,931
The truth is you hold all the cards.

1278
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:29,170
When people pray, they
don't want this thing or that thing.

1279
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:32,008
They just... they don't
want to be forgotten.

1280
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,014
You understand?

1281
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,106
Noelle?

1282
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,276
I would have
told you earlier, but...

1283
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,512
Noelle?!

1284
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:51,253
Maybe if I just cut back;
didn't get so involved.

1285
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:53,197
We both know
that'll never work.

1286
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,998
Next week you'll be back here
redesigning the pinecones.

1287
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,937
You have to quit, cold turkey.

1288
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,166
I can't.

1289
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,439
You can,
but I can't force you to leave.

1290
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:04,739
You have to want it.

1291
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,591
Noelle!

1292
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:28,930
Come on!
Answer Mama!

1293
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,000
Answer me!

1294
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,404
She's here.

1295
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,936
I didn't forget
about you guys.

1296
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,611
Everything okay?

1297
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,953
Yeah, everything's fine.
Absolutely.

1298
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,547
Let's go home.

1299
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,514
Good night, Jellybean.

1300
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:06,519
You need to go, don't you?

1301
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:09,226
No.

1302
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,629
I can stay.

1303
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,894
How long, forever?

1304
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,199
Every day you'd be here,
you'd know what you were missing.

1305
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,370
What happens if you go?

1306
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:23,967
Worst case scenario?

1307
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:32,518
Disintegration of everything
into a fiery void, oblivio accebit.

1308
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:34,384
The end of everything.

1309
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:36,514
That's all?

1310
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,525
Probably wouldn't happen.

1311
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,625
I guess I'm more worried
about the human factor.

1312
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,291
You guys kill each other a lot.

1313
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:47,527
In fairness, it's usually in your name.

1314
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:50,162
Plus, we've gotten
much more efficient at it.

1315
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,106
I like this world.

1316
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:58,701
I like my life here
with you and Noelle.

1317
01:31:58,813 --> 01:31:59,973
It's not real.

1318
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:03,106
I'm not really your wife.

1319
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,379
You're not really my husband.

1320
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:09,153
On some level, it's all pretend.

1321
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,328
How many versions were there?

1322
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:18,727
Ninety.
This is the last one.

1323
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:25,704
I've destroyed billions of people
with a thought...

1324
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:28,902
and you'd like to think
that it's painless.

1325
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:30,375
Stop.

1326
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:36,107
You don't have to explain
or apologize.

1327
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:41,311
Everything that is
is because of you.

1328
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:49,586
And if that's all there is,
that's enough.

1329
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,703
So.

1330
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,341
So.

1331
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,305
Guess you don't really
need to pack anything.

1332
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,210
I'm good.

1333
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:10,443
You're great.

1334
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:16,322
- It has been a pleasure.
- Likewise.

1335
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:20,388
I love you.

1336
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:24,329
I love you, too,
you big lug.

1337
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,700
You're my favorite.

1338
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,794
...should we measure it first?

1339
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:36,860
Got flour, we have flour.

1340
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:38,495
All right, so I need oil.

1341
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:39,800
We need nutmeg.

1342
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:41,705
Honey, do we have nutmeg?

1343
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:45,305
We should.

1344
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,342
Good. Good, good, good.

1345
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,407
- Nutmeg.
- Cinnamon, too.

1346
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:53,715
If I had a horse,
I would name her Cinnamon.

1347
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,983
- And if I had another horse...
- Nutmeg?

1348
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:57,388
No, Flash.

1349
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,449
What? Why Flash?

1350
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,255
I mean, I would name her Flash

1351
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,889
because she'd be
the fastest horse in the world.

1352
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:05,261
I mean in the whole world.

1353
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:07,527
- In the whole world?
- Ever whole.

1354
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,195
The ever whole world?
That's pretty good.

1355
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,363
That's pretty fast.

1356
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,408
Yes, and I would be a princess.

1357
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:15,840
Sweetie?

1358
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:23,240
This might sound really strange,
but what's my name?

1359
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:28,812
Mommy.

1360
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:32,222
Right. Exactly.

1361
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:34,955
He's not coming back.

1362
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:38,294
But it's gonna be okay.

1363
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:41,232
He put all the pieces together.

1364
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:44,465
- It's like...
- The best of all possible worlds.

1365
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:49,241
Honey, is it supposed
to stick like this?

1366
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,809
- Better help him.
- Let's go.

1367
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,315
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Oh, my gosh.

1368
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:59,079
...consistency.
Is it maybe a little... it's too thick.

1369
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:00,778
We can safely say
that's too thick?

1370
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:02,812
Will you get some milk?

1371
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,291
- Get milk?
- See, it says milk on the recipe.

1372
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,349
Ready?

1373
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:10,296
Oh, my. Oh, no!
All right.

1374
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,696
Oh, don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up.

1375
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:15,363
Thank you.

1376
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,802
Shouldn't we
be using a machine?

1377
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:20,397
- Isn't there a machine we can...
- I'm the machine!

1378
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:21,839
You're our machine?

1379
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:24,470
- All right.
- Come on, machine.

1380
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:26,536
Okay, hold on. Let's...
