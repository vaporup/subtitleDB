00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:03,790
so McWorter,
you can run "Little Geek."

326
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:06,661
Goddamn it. You know McWorter
can't run an R.O.V.

327

<i>- [One Night] Then you better go.
- I'll go.</i>

328
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:13,165
- Good!
- What is your problem, huh?

329
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:16,242
<i>On this dive, you'll do
absolutely nothing...</i>

330
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:19,744
without direct orders from me,
and you'll follow those orders
without discussion.

331
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:22,474
Is that clear?

332
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,483
<i>All right.</i>

333
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:27,315
I want everyone finished, prepped and
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

<i>One of you guys give me a hand,
okay? Let's get suited up.</i>

335

Guys, guys.
Hold it a second.

336
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,390
Hold it! Whoa!

337
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,468
Okay, here we go.
All right.

338
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,937
Look, um,
it's 3:00 a.m.

339
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,441
These guys are running on bad coffee
and about four hours of sleep.

340
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:54,480
- Maybe you could think about
cutting them some slack.
- I can't afford slack.

341
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:57,243
Hey, you come on my rig.
You don't talk to me.

342
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:00,616
You start orderin' my people around.
It's not gonna work.

343
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:05,249
You got to know how to handle
these people. We got a way
of doin' things around here.

344
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,089
Right now, I'm not interested
in your way of doing things.

345
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:10,925
Just get your team
ready to dive.

346
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,830
These guys got
no sense of humor.

347

348
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:28,374

of them cyalumes, please.
- Yeah, sure.

351
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,951
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

352
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:42,017
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid-breathing system.
We just got them.

353
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:45,929
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

354
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,661
- Deep.
- How deep?

355
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,536
It's classified. Anyway, you breathe
liquid so you can't get compressed.

356
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,834
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

357
00:26:56,827 --> 00:27:00,319
- Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit.

358
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:04,029
Check this out.

359
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:07,429

- What are you doin'?

360

- Hey, no, no, no.
- You're gonna kill her!

361
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:14,471
- It's okay. I've done this myself.
- Are you just drownin' her?

362
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:16,478
She's gonna be fine.

363
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,048
I've breathed this myself.
It's gonna be fine.

364
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:21,811
No, man. She's gonna drown!
Look! She's freakin' out!

- Does this look normal to you?</i>

366
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:28,823
<i>- She's gonna drown!
- He's taking the fluid into his lungs.</i>

367
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:32,827
He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

368
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:38,433
There he goes.
There's a bit of anxiety here.

369
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:41,993
<i>Now he's starting to relax.
He's breathing fine.</i>

370
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:44,938
<i>See his chest moving?
He's getting plenty of oxygen.</i>

371
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,601
<i>Ha. Damn rat's
breathin'that shit.</i>

372
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:52,444
That is no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.

373
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,950
See, the fluid's harder to push in
and out than air.

374
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:59,180
<i>It's a little more work to breathe,
but he's doing fine.</i>

375
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,190
- He's diggin' it.
- She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.

376
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,953
Let her out now. Now!

377
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,654
Okay. All right.

378
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:10,494
Okay, now we let
the fluid drain from his lungs.

379
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,125
All right. Give her here.
Give her. Give her.

380
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,568

- 24 trident missiles.
8 MI RVs per missile.

[Breathing Heavily]

485
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:07,066
Hey, Jammer.

00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:10,733
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! You okay?

487
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,901
Deep and slow,

488
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:15,343
Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.

Everybody's dead!
They're all dead.

490

- I'm taking you back out. Let's go.
- No!

I'm okay. I'm okay.

492
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:31,456

- Okay, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

493
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:34,691
I've got to check out
this compartment, all right?

494
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,861
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold on the end of this rope here.

495
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:43,169
- You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.
- I got it.

496
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:47,575
Pull it hard. Five more minutes.
Just relax. You'll be okay.

497
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,273
- Okay.
- Be right back.

Okay, just a few

There's a couple compartments
up ahead that might have air.

It's his mixture.
Too much oxygen.

520
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:59,843
Got to get the O-2 cut down!
Turn him over!

521
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,049
Crank it down, man!
You're losin' him!

All right. We got to get him
out of here. Let's go. Let's move it.

Are they out yet?

525
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:21,132
Negative, Lindsey.
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

526
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:25,042
Let's give them two minutes more max,
and then I'll sound a diver recall...

00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,959
[Bud Over Radio]
Lindsey, do you copy?

528
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,165
Meet me at Flatbed. This is a diver
emergency. Linds, do you copy?

529
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:55,401
Uh, yeah, copy you, Bud.
L-I'm on my way.

530
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:05,819
Look, I'm just a medic,
which is mostly about patchin' holes.

531
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,017
This type of thing, it's...
There's not much I can do.

532
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:14,027
A coma could last
hours or days.

533
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:23,469
So you didn't get
anything on the cameras.

534
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,903
No. I didn't get
a picture of it.

535
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:28,134
- What about the video?
- No.

536
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:33,112
We lost power right then. Look, I just
don't want to talk about this, okay?

537
00:44:33,214 --> 00:44:35,876
Fine. Be that way.

538
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:38,418
Look, I don't know
what I saw, Bud, okay?

539
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,650
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible, fine,
it's a Russian submersible.

540
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:47,285
- No problem.
- Yeah, but you think
it was somethin' else.

541
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:51,058
What?
One of ours?

542
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:57,404
- No.
- Well, whose then?

543
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,503
Come on, Lindsey,
talk to me.

544
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,444
Look, Jammer saw something
down there, something that
scared the hell out of him.

545
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:10,177
His mixture got screwed up.
Jammer panicked.

546
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:12,845
He pranged his regulator,
and his mixture got screwed up.

547
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:15,388
But what did he see
that made him panic?

548
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:19,393
Well, what do you
think he saw?

549
00:45:21,362 --> 00:45:23,660
I don't know.

550
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:27,826
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

551
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,904
It could have been
a Russian bogey.

552
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:34,771
Oh, Cinclantfleet's
gonna go ape shit.

553
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:38,972
Two Russian attack subs,
a Tango and a Victor,
were tracked within 50 miles of here.

554
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,481
<i>Now they don't know
where the hell they are. Okay.</i>

555
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:45,576

I haven't got any choice.

556
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:48,053
I'm confirming you
to go to phase two.

<i>You'll recover
one warhead, arm it...</i>

<i>and wait for
further instructions.</i>

00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:57,475
- We got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

560
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:02,213
- [Whistles] Better come on.
- Turn it up, folks.

561
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,447
<i>Sources have not confirmed any reports
that the Montana encountered...</i>

562
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:08,616
a Soviet fast-attack sub
prior to its sinking,

563
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:11,751
and the Kremlin continues
to deny any involvement.

564
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:13,955
Oh, that's us.
That's us, man.

565
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:17,659
Benthic Petroleum are apparently
participating in the recovery operation,

566
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:20,202
but we have little information
about their involvement.

567
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:22,772
Bullshit.
We want names.

<i>- That's the Explorer. We're famous.
- Shh, quiet.</i>

There is a tremendous
amount of activity.

With Cuba only 80 miles away,

571
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,078
the massive buildup
of American forces...

572
00:46:34,184 --> 00:46:37,449
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

573
00:46:37,554 --> 00:46:42,116
<i>Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,</i>

the area,</i>

<i>- and Soviet aircraft have
repeatedly been warned away.

Hippy, what's the matter
with you?

577
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:52,767
What's the matter with me?
Nothing.

00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,770
We're just in the middle
of some big-time international incident,

579
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:57,840
like the Cuban missile crisis
or something.

00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,068
Figured that out for yourself,
did you, Hip?

581
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:02,077
We got Russian subs
creepin' around.

582
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:06,081
Anything goes wrong, they could say
whatever they want happened.

583
00:47:06,183 --> 00:47:08,674
Relax, will you?
You're makin' the women nervous.

584
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:13,415
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, those SEALs
ain't telling us diddly.

we need it right now?
- He didn't pay attention.

Shit! Coffey! Come back!

593
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:39,273
We need the big arm
to unhook the umbilical.

594
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:42,648
There's a goddamn
hurricane comin'!

596
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:48,089
Go back down.

597
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:51,786
Tell those men to get below
and stay there.

598
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:05,236
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now.

All right, do it then.

600

No problem, except your boys
went sightseeing with Flatbed.

- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?

603
00:48:15,152 --> 00:48:18,849
We're gonna get the shit kicked
out of us by our pal Fred in two hours.

604
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:29,229
- Set cold tab fitting to 200 P.S.I.
- Set.

605
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:32,700
There she goes. She's breaking loose.
Bringing her up.

606
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:36,796
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

607
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:42,743
Get clear of the hatch. Keep goin'
with it. Keep goin'. That's it, up.

608

Sir, the missile
looks intact.

constituted
an unprovoked attack.

00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:20,778
It's all yours, sir.

621
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:25,583
- Swing it away and drop it.
- Check. Okay.

Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

six in counterclockwise sequence.

Sometime this morning,
all U.S. And NATO military forces
have been put on full alert.

Well, you just
feel so helpless.

00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:16,562
You can see it coming, but what
can you do? What can anyone do?

634
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:22,134
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.
So why are we doin' this?

635

If it happens,
it happens.

There's nothing I can do about it,
right? I just don't think about it.

637
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,184
All right. Let's get their gear off!
Then clear the sub.

Come on. Let's go. Let's move it.

a little pressed for time.

642

Prick. This ain't no drill,
slick. Make me proud.

a stateroom. Otherwise, it was bunks.

Everything was all right there

Then she got promoted to chief engineer
on this thing a couple years ago.

816

She went front office
on you, man?

Copy you, Hippy.
What's the matter?

830
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:44,522
Oh, shit. The power's jackin'
around with us again.

Hippy, do you copy?

Bud, do you copy? Over.

Come on, you guys.
Come on.

844
01:12:27,484 --> 01:12:31,045
That's the smaller one. You can
kinda see how it's zigging around.

845

- Yeah, whatever it is.
- I'm telling you what it is.

846

- You're just not hearing me.
- Now, Lindsey, you...

847
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:40,027
There is something down there.
Something not us.

848
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,826
You could be more... specific.

849
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:45,834
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

850

Not human. Get it?

851
01:12:48,672 --> 01:12:51,300
Something nonhuman, but intelligent.

852
01:12:57,681 --> 01:13:01,549
A nonterrestrial intelligence.

853
01:13:01,652 --> 01:13:04,212
- A nonterrestrial intelligence.
- Yes.

854
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:07,552

that's better than U.F.O.s.

But that works too, huh?
Underwater flying objects.

856
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:18,994
Are we talking
little space friends here?

857

Hell, yeah! Hot rods of the gods!
Right, Linds?

858
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,199
No, really.
It could be N.T.I.s.

859

The C.I.A. Has known
about 'em forever.

Stay off my side.

- Certainly.

Something really important
is happening here.

I'm trying to keep this situation
under control.

this kind of hysteria.
- Who's hysterical?

- Nobody's hysterical!
- Shh.

869

All I'm saying is, when you're
hangin' on by your fingernails,

you don't go
waving your arms around.

871
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:00,810
Look, I saw something. I'm not gonna
say I didn't see it when I did.

872
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:02,811
I'm sorry.
Please.

873
01:14:02,913 --> 01:14:05,313
You are the most stubborn woman
I ever knew.

Yes. I am.

But I need you
to believe me right now.

876

Come on, look at me.
Am I stressed out?

877
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,549
Do I have any symptoms of pressure
sickness? Tremor? Slurred speech?

878
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,153
- No.
- No.

879
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:24,291
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.
Okay?

880
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:28,235
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

881
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:30,568
Now watch my lips.

882
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,734
I saw these things.

883
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,744
I touched one of them,

884
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,748
and it wasn't some clunky steel can
like we would build.

885
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,085
It glided.

886
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:47,255
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

887
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:51,493
Oh, God,
I wish you'd been there.

888
01:14:51,595 --> 01:14:54,996
It was a machine...
It was a machine, but it was alive.

889
01:14:55,098 --> 01:14:57,692
It was like a...
like a dance of light.

890
01:15:00,737 --> 01:15:03,171
Please. You have to trust me.

891
01:15:03,273 --> 01:15:06,902
Now, I don't think they mean us
any harm. I don't know how I know that.

892
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:09,877
It's just a feeling.

893
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,881
Geez. I'm supposed to
go on a feeling?

894
01:15:12,983 --> 01:15:15,884
How can I? You think Coffey's
gonna go on a feeling?

895
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:19,285
Well, we all see
what we wanna see.

896
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:22,085
Coffey looks,
and he sees Russians.

897
01:15:22,192 --> 01:15:24,092
He sees hate and fear.

898
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:28,893
You have to look
with better eyes than that.

899
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:37,215
- Please.
- I can't, Linds.

900
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,593

All right,

I want a round-the-clock manning of the
sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

Oh, give me a break,

- Nope.

Look, he's operating
on his own,

990
01:22:09,914 --> 01:22:12,314
he's cut off from
his chain of command,

991
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:15,648
he's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis...

992

a nuclear weapon.

your tongue in neutral for a while.

his primary guidance chip

- No. Bad idea, Lindsey. Bad.
- Why? Hip, come on.

take the pressure at that depth,

They can plasticize it, polymerize it,
