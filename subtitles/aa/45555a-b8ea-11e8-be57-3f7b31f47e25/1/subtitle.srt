1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,999
In the year of our Lord...

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,918
...Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,679
In the seventh year of the reign
of Augustus Caesar...

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,238
...an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,799
...each to return
to his place of birth...

6
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,239
...to be counted and taxed.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,919
The converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...

8
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,039
...the troubled heart of their land.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,639
The old city was dominated
by the fortress of Antonia...

10
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:52,159
...the seat of Roman power...

11
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,398
...and by the great golden temple...

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,678
...the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,439
Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...

14
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,678
...the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,759
...always remembering
the promise of their prophets...

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,118
...that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,478
...to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.

18
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,079
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,239
- Name?
- Samuel.

20
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:29,479
- What city?
- Joppa.

21
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:31,038
- What family?
- Michael.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,279
- Move on. Move on.
- Yes.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,838
- Name?
- Joseph.

24
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,119
- What city?
- Nazareth.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,998
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,639
- And the woman?
- My wife.

27
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:44,198
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,759
Come on, come on.

29
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,719
What village is this?

30
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,079
Nazareth.

31
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,198
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

32
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,359
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

33
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,679
We've seen Romans before.

34
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,959
Yes...

35
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,998
...and we will see them again.

36
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,839
My table is not finished.

37
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,519
Where is your son?

38
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,838
He's walking in the hills.

39
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,678
He neglects his work, Joseph.

40
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,159
No.

41
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,718
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

42
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,478
"I must be about my father's business."

43
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:52,119
Then why isn't he here, working?

44
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,638
He's working.

45
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,838
Trumpeters of the legion!

46
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,679
Welcome, Messala.

47
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,479
The command is yours.

48
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,038
Thank you.

49
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,559
Thank you for relieving me.

50
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,878
Drusus...

51
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,958
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

52
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,559
Now the wheel has turned.

53
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,439
I am in command.

54
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,518
Attention!

55
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,079
Aisle one, face right!

56
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,878
Forward!

57
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,999
I'd forgotten the heat.

58
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,239
If it were only the heat.

59
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,838
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

60
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,438
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.

61
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,519
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

62
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,679
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

63
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,719
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

64
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,599
I asked to be sent here.

65
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,839
I think you'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

66
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,598
In what way?

67
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,838
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome...

68
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,278
There's nothing new in all that.

69
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,238
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

70
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,159
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

71
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,518
Punish them.

72
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,559
We do.

73
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,278
When we can find them.

74
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,639
Find the leaders.

75
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,038
Oh, you don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

76
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,559
I tell you, there are strange forces
at work here.

77
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,158
For instance,
this "messiah" business...

78
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,959
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

79
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,518
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

80
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,559
Makes your head spin.

81
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,439
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

82
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,558
...who drowns people in water.

83
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,679
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

84
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,118
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

85
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,399
No, no, no. This man is different.

86
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,038
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

87
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,039
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

88
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,839
You've been too long away from Rome.

89
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,438
Go back, Sextus.

90
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,999
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

91
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,198
...and forget that
God is in every man.

92
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,239
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.

93
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,879
The emperor is displeased.

94
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,918
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

95
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,198
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.

96
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,759
But how? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

97
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,998
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?

98
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,999
Especially a new idea.

99
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,359
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

100
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,638
I assume he has a name.

101
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,119
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!

102
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,598
Tell him I will join him.

103
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,999
Yes, tribune.

104
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,238
Centurion!

105
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,718
This was his country
before it was ours.

106
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,279
Don't forget that.

107
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,479
Yes, tribune.

108
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,999
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

109
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,038
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

110
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,118
We were friends as boys.

111
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,718
We were like brothers.

112
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,319
Sextus...

113
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,878
...you ask how to fight an idea.

114
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,798
Well, I'll tell you how.

115
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,159
With another idea.

116
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,158
I said I'd come back.

117
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,399
I never thought you would.

118
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,758
I'm so glad.

119
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,399
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

120
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:17,038
You've come back a tribune.

121
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,798
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

122
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,679
We'll drink another now.

123
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,319
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.

124
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,319
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

125
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,799
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.

126
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,679
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

127
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,238
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

128
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,479
I can't wait to see them.

129
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,119
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

130
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,879
Or have you become too dignified?

131
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,158
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!

132
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,758
Where the beams cross?

133
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,959
Good.

134
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,038
After all these years!

135
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,879
Still close.

136
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,679
In every way.

137
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,838
I hope so.

138
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,039
I know.

139
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,678
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

140
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,518
...whose life you once saved.

141
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,118
The best thing I ever did.

142
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,838
Judah...

143
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,319
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

144
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,079
I'm going to need help.

145
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,079
Your help. Your advice.

146
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,279
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

147
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,758
Withdraw your legions.

148
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,519
Give us our freedom.

149
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,038
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

150
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,439
He's particularly fond of Judea.

151
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,358
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

152
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,678
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

153
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,918
My quarters.

154
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,158
A bit grim.

155
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,758
Not grim.

156
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,439
Austere. Virtuous.

157
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,079
Roman.

158
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,558
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

159
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,998
He's arriving in a few days
with two more legions.

160
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,079
Then the rumors are true.

161
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,038
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

162
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:37,039
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

163
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,278
But you and your family
need have no concern.

164
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,158
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

165
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,278
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!

166
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,679
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

167
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,599
Rabble? They're my people.
I'm one of them.

168
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,239
Be wise, Judah.

169
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,359
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,318
You've changed.

171
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,919
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,679
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

173
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,559
...was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,359
Your legions.

175
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,278
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,798
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,038
Oh, no.

178
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,199
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,278
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,838
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,318
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:42,079
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,878
How?

184
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,918
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,319
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.

186
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:53,039
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,639
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:59,079
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,519
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,119
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,278
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,959
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,518
Then we're agreed!

194
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,518
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,119
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.

196
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,878
And now for our toast.

197
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,798
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,798
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,358
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,078
It's an insane world.

201
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,918
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,919
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,399
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,759
Will you drink to that?

205
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,438
With all my heart.

206
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,039
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,919
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,118
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:39,599
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.

210
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,799
I would have that time again.

211
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,359
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,958
Except for the fountain.

213
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,159
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.

214
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,919
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,519
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?

216
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,118
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,519
With great responsibilities.

218
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,798
Come.

219
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,119
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,198
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,998
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,119
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,759
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:31,279
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,599
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,558
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,438
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,839
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,798
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,838
Thank you for this.

231
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,838
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,398
What do you think of it?

233
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,359
Magnificent.

234
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,638
It's Arabic.

235
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,119
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,919
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,559
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,398
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,639
Oh, Judah.

240
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,238
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,878
Judah, tell me, did you...

242
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,959
...think about what I said?

243
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,719
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,558
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,519
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,679
Most? Not all?

247
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,078
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?

248
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,078
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

249
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,239
Who are they?

250
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,239
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

251
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,719
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

252
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,998
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

253
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,959
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

254
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,599
Patriots?!

255
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,518
Judah.

256
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,919
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,078
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,118
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,679
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:57,038
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,119
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,959
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,838
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,719
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,238
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,838
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God. The only God.

267
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,919
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

268
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,878
Not that.

269
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,558
Help me, Judah.

270
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,518
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

271
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,879
...except betray my own people.

272
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:41,519
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,878
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,358
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,198
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,919
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:05,479
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,758
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,038
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,478
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,518
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,518
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,079
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,198
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,078
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,118
- I warn you...
- No! I warn you.

287
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,038
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,438
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,039
But not forever.

290
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,839
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

291
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,719
...such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,198
Judah.

293
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,158
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

294
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,359
You're either for me or against me.

295
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,759
If that is the choice...

296
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,959
...then I am against you.

297
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,838
There they are.

298
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,878
Where's Messala?

299
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,359
- Where's?
- He's gone.

300
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,279
Gone?

301
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,159
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.

302
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,678
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.

303
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,558
Come. Let us have dinner.

304
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,039
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

305
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,598
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

306
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,238
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

307
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,678
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

308
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,598
Judah.

309
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,479
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.

310
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,079
Simonides.

311
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,639
- Welcome.
- Judah.

312
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,279
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.

313
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,958
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

314
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,879
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

315
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,839
And for the master, lberian wine.

316
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,878
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

317
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,718
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

318
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:47,399
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.

319
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,319
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.

320
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,798
And what of Numidia?

321
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,478
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

322
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,198
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

323
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,078
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

324
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,079
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

325
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,799
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

326
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:09,199
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

327
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,039
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.

328
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,119
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

329
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,799
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

330
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,519
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

331
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,318
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

332
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,799
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.

333
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,798
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

334
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,199
You're eager to marry, Esther?

335
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,319
It is my father's wish.

336
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,318
Your husband will be fortunate.

337
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,358
What is his name?

338
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,238
David, son of Mathias.

339
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,998
Of what house?

340
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,239
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.

341
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,199
Tell me more about him.

342
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,758
I have seen him only once.

343
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,999
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

344
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,599
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

345
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,559
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

346
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,439
You are generous, master.

347
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,319
Do you love this man?

348
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,719
I will learn to love him.

349
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,118
You have my permission to marry.

350
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,239
We'll drink to your happiness.

351
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,559
And a safe return to Antioch.

352
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,118
I disturbed you.

353
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,839
No.

354
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,999
What were you thinking?

355
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,199
I was saying goodbye...

356
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,398
...to this city...

357
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,918
...and this house.

358
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,879
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

359
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,558
My father sometimes brought me here...

360
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,358
...when I was little.

361
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,319
It was a house
where I was always happy.

362
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,599
Except once.

363
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,719
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

364
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,919
- Messala.
- Yes.

365
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,718
You had been out hunting...

366
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,479
...and they brought you home injured.

367
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,759
I touched your face
as you lay there...

368
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,839
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die."

369
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,639
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

370
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,598
Yes, master.

371
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,119
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

372
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,879
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

373
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,439
And now...

374
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,678
...I hardly feel free.

375
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,519
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

376
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,758
...if there was among his slaves...

377
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,638
...some girl who filled his eyes...

378
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,839
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

379
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,479
...and take her to him.

380
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,479
Wise days of Solomon.

381
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,519
Different days.

382
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,879
And long ago.

383
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,959
If you were not a bride...

384
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,119
...I should kiss you goodbye.

385
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,758
If I were not a bride...

386
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,758
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

387
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,278
Your slave ring.

388
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,319
Fair exchange.

389
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,998
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

390
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,039
You will wear it?

391
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,838
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

392
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,318
Until then.

393
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,839
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

394
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,158
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

395
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,999
Thank you, tribune.

396
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,358
I see no delegation from the city.

397
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,639
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?

398
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,119
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

399
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:04,999
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

400
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,118
Let us proceed.

401
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,958
There's Messala.

402
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,438
He saw you, Judah.

403
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,279
The new governor.

404
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,918
Stand back!

405
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,239
- Stand back.
- Up there. You, come!

406
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,319
Had to be the Jews!

407
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:23,079
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

408
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,759
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

409
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,798
Open up in the name of Rome!

410
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,959
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.

411
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,238
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.

412
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,919
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

413
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:50,119
Open the gates!

414
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,519
I'll speak to them.

415
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,519
- Arrest him!
- Wait. Let me tell you what happened.

416
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,918
Hold those women.
Not them!

417
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,118
- Judah!
- It was an accident.

418
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,559
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

419
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,158
- This is the man, sir. We saw him.
- It was an accident.

420
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,638
- Accident?
- I swear it.

421
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,999
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

422
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,998
Take him. Take all of them.

423
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,278
He's telling the truth!
- It was me! Let them go!

424
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,439
Judah!

425
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,519
Attention!

426
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,399
Messala.

427
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,119
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

428
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,278
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

429
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,918
It was an accident.

430
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,919
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

431
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,359
Messala!
Messala.

432
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,759
Let the servants go.

433
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,519
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

434
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,719
- Come.
- Where?

435
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,558
Tirus.

436
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:48,718
Tirus?

437
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,359
I've had no trial.

438
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:55,759
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

439
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:58,559
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

440
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,919
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

441
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,559
Tie his hands.

442
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,519
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

443
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,519
Get along. Keep moving.

444
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,318
Jailer!

445
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,839
Guard, in there!

446
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,119
Up the stairs!

447
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:06,439
Jailer!

448
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,758
To the right.

449
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,999
Wait!
Send them out.

450
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,439
Send them out.

451
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,439
You can go.

452
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,198
Go!

453
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:19,958
The door.

454
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,439
Where are my mother and sister?

455
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,799
Where are they?

456
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:47,999
Here, within these walls.

457
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,599
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

458
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,719
Of course, they will be sentenced.

459
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,679
Is it possible, Messala?

460
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:06,839
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

461
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:09,679
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

462
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,398
You'll let them go.

463
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,958
You must.
You will gladly let them go!

464
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,799
Messala!

465
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:22,398
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad. I'm not a murderer!

466
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,199
I know you're not.

467
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,318
You know?

468
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,359
You are evil.

469
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:35,199
No, Judah, I am not evil.

470
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,559
I wanted your help.

471
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,119
Now you've given it to me.

472
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:44,078
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

473
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,119
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

474
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,718
But not my family.

475
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,718
Let them go.

476
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:57,279
Please.

477
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,998
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?!

478
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,039
Didn't I beg you?

479
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,879
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

480
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,879
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die today...

481
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,319
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

482
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,919
Go on, Judah.

483
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,158
Kill me!

484
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,759
May God grant me vengeance.

485
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,639
I will pray that
you live till I return.

486
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,598
Return?

487
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:52,999
Take him.

488
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:30,679
Sentries, salute.

489
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,238
The tribune will see you now.

490
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,879
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

491
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,558
I remember you.

492
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,479
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

493
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,319
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

494
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,038
Better than you.

495
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:23,558
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

496
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,919
The prisoners have been sentenced.

497
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,279
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.

498
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,839
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

499
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,719
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

500
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,118
In your heart, you must know it.

501
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,359
Drusus.

502
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,319
This man had better be kept here
until we have time to question him.

503
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:45,838
Hold!

504
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,319
Water for the soldiers.

505
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:43,359
Soldiers first!

506
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,638
Get away from that well!
No water for them!

507
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,599
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

508
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,558
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

509
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:01,159
Water. Water.
Soldiers first!

510
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,718
Here.

511
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,799
Wait.

512
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,398
No water for him.

513
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,838
God...

514
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:01,439
...help me.

515
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,879
You! I said no water for him!

516
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,839
All right, on your feet, all of you!

517
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,398
Get them on their feet!

518
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:35,519
Back in line, you dog!

519
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:49,398
On your feet!

520
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,158
Get them going!

521
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,439
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

522
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,318
Forward, you dogs!

523
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,239
In a few minutes, the consul's barge
will be coming alongside.

524
00:57:07,439 --> 00:57:09,238
Be ready to raise oars.

525
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,959
Raise oars!

526
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,398
Down oars!

527
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,759
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

528
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,078
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.

529
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,999
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.

530
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,519
This man is ill. Replace him.

531
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,799
- Change him.
- Right, sir.

532
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,999
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.

533
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,158
That will stop.

534
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,279
What service have you seen?

535
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:25,518
Forty-one.

536
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,559
A month's less a day in this ship.

537
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,799
You keep an exact account.
And before?

538
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,358
Three years in other ships.

539
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,598
Three years.

540
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,359
You have the spirit to fight back...

541
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,158
...but the good sense to control it.

542
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,118
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

543
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,518
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

544
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,598
It gives him strength.

545
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,199
Now, listen to me, all of you.

546
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:30,079
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

547
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,319
So row well...

548
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,718
...and live.

549
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,519
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.

550
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,238
Strike oars!

551
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:13,038
You know that a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

552
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:15,918
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

553
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:19,279
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

554
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:22,039
...of seeking out and destroying them.

555
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,318
Battle speed, hortator.

556
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,718
Battle speed!

557
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,198
Attack speed.

558
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,399
Attack speed!

559
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,278
Ramming speed.

560
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:13,998
Ramming speed!

561
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,119
Rest.

562
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,399
Halt!

563
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,719
Rest!

564
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:32,398
Why are you here?

565
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,958
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

566
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:39,599
Oh, yes.

567
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,679
I'd forgotten.

568
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,798
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

569
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,079
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

570
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:54,598
I'm not ready to die.

571
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,839
What do you think will save you?

572
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,558
The God of my fathers.

573
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,958
Hmm. Your God has forsaken you.

574
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,239
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

575
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:10,118
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

576
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,719
I might.

577
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:14,959
Does that interest you, 41?

578
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,959
I can see that it does.

579
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,239
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

580
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:26,119
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

581
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,318
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

582
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,638
Would you like to become one of them?

583
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:33,919
To die as your slave?

584
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,558
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

585
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,119
I will not be here forever.

586
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:41,439
No?

587
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,078
What would you do if you escaped?

588
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,158
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

589
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,518
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

590
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,479
Do not say that you were innocent.

591
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,838
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.

592
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:05,959
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

593
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,158
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

594
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,198
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these three years...

595
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,118
...to die chained to an oar.

596
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,798
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

597
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:21,759
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

598
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:25,999
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

599
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,598
As you have.

600
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:30,318
What drove it out of you?

601
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,318
Go back to your oar, 41.

602
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,158
Consul, enemy sighted.

603
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,558
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

604
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,839
All the watch to battle posts.

605
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:11,638
Stand by to load.
Make ready to fire.

606
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,199
Hurry, quick!

607
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,279
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

608
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,679
Raise oars!

609
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:29,119
Down oars!

610
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,199
Chain rowers!

611
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,639
Guard.

612
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,639
Unlock 41.

613
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,199
No! I don't want to die!

614
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,119
I don't want to die!

615
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,399
41, why did he do that?

616
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:36,518
I don't know.

617
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:41,998
Once before, a man helped me.

618
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,878
I didn't know why then.

619
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:49,439
Normal speed!

620
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:26,239
Number 1, flame.

621
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,318
- Fire.
Fire!

622
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,479
Fire!

623
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,119
Fire!

624
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,479
Hold withdrawal on command.

625
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:54,599
Lift oars! Raise!

626
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,718
Withdraw!

627
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,239
Steersman, right.

628
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:09,358
Extend oars!

629
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,879
Fire!
Fire!

630
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,198
Fire!

631
01:11:32,799 --> 01:11:34,279
Watch out!
Fire!

632
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:35,879
Fire!

633
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,119
Steersman, ram course! Order below!
Ramming speed!

634
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:55,438
Ramming speed!

635
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:08,878
Consul, barge on ramming course.

636
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,639
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

637
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:03,998
Why did you save me?

638
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,119
Why did you have me unchained?

639
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,399
What is your name, 41?

640
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,079
Judah Ben-Hur.

641
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,878
Judah Ben-Hur...

642
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,719
...let me die.

643
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,999
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

644
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,878
Row well and live.

645
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,438
Is the sail square?

646
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,199
I can't tell.

647
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,039
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

648
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,438
My death.

649
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:17,638
Your freedom.

650
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,159
It's a Roman sail.

651
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,118
Face rear!

652
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,159
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

653
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,559
Water.

654
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,719
The fleet, all lost?

655
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:10,519
Five galleys.

656
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,318
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.

657
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,999
You have a victory.

658
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,439
It was a victory?
Complete.

659
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,559
In his eagerness to save you...

660
01:19:39,799 --> 01:19:43,279
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

661
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,878
Hail Arrius!

662
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,719
Hail Arrius!

663
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,359
Right oars!

664
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,998
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

665
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,199
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

666
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,558
This man riding beside you, who is he?

667
01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:31,919
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

668
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,119
Is that all you know about him?

669
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,038
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

670
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,078
But he was innocent.

671
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,958
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

672
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:50,399
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

673
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:54,159
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

674
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,439
We have all the information
on this man...

675
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:27,999
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

676
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:32,359
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

677
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,279
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

678
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,959
Consul, allow us to continue.

679
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,439
Allow us to be generous.

680
01:24:43,599 --> 01:24:46,718
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

681
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,519
...we shall not send him
back to the galleys.

682
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:53,838
We give him to you as your slave
to do with him as you like.

683
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:57,158
Such is the will of the senate...

684
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,839
...and the people of Rome.

685
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,359
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

686
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:22,239
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

687
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,519
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

688
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:28,559
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

689
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:39,639
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

690
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,239
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

691
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,719
...which I thought
I should never have again.

692
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:53,038
Nothing could make stronger
the bond between us...

693
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,638
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

694
01:26:56,759 --> 01:27:00,558
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

695
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,799
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

696
01:27:03,999 --> 01:27:06,159
...and the heir to my property.

697
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:12,879
This ring of my ancestors...

698
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,439
...would have gone to my son.

699
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,279
So now it is yours.

700
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,999
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

701
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,319
...a new home...

702
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,639
...a new father.

703
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:52,118
It brought me here.

704
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,679
It may take me away.

705
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:57,198
But wherever I may be...

706
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,399
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

707
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,918
With gratitude and affection...

708
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,439
...and with honor.

709
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:25,318
I present my son to you.

710
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:28,638
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

711
01:28:28,879 --> 01:28:31,918
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

712
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,039
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

713
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,438
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

714
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,999
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.

715
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,879
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

716
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:43,919
Not for Judeans.

717
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,639
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

718
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:52,559
- Of Judea?
- Yes.

719
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,158
I asked for Alexandria.

720
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,079
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

721
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,239
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

722
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:03,758
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

723
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:05,599
Goats and Jehovah.

724
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,398
You're leaving.

725
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:29,879
I must.

726
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,559
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

727
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,319
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

728
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:43,118
But still, my counsel is to wait.

729
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,678
Gratus is to be replaced.

730
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,998
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

731
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,719
When?

732
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:55,598
Very soon.

733
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,359
It's very much to our purpose.

734
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,918
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

735
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:10,999
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

736
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,919
Will Rome see you again?

737
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,158
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

738
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:33,398
I shall remember it.

739
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,718
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

740
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,959
They have their way.

741
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,119
Forgive me.

742
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:23,599
You're a stranger here.

743
01:32:24,799 --> 01:32:27,118
Would you be from Nazareth?

744
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,639
Why do you ask?

745
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,078
I thought...

746
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,839
...you might be the one...

747
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,199
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

748
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,359
He would be about your age.

749
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,318
Who?

750
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,599
When I find him...

751
01:32:55,919 --> 01:32:57,398
...I shall know him.

752
01:33:02,519 --> 01:33:05,759
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

753
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,759
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

754
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,919
Hyah! Hyah! Sack of flesh without brains!

755
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:13,758
No! No! Not the whip!

756
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:16,319
That is my host.

757
01:33:16,519 --> 01:33:17,639
Gently! Gently!

758
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,599
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

759
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:25,039
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood!

760
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:29,199
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

761
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:37,559
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

762
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,559
Beautiful horses.

763
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:53,118
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

764
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,959
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

765
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,518
No! No!

766
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,358
Abadon, stop him!

767
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:13,599
Stop that whip!

768
01:34:13,799 --> 01:34:15,718
I'll kill him! I'll kill!

769
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,039
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

770
01:34:26,999 --> 01:34:29,639
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?

771
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:33,799
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

772
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,559
Get off, idiot!

773
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:42,198
Drive goats, not horses!

774
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,479
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

775
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,798
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

776
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:49,439
Hmm?

777
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:52,478
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

778
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,039
Not a team?

779
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,959
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

780
01:34:57,159 --> 01:34:59,358
- Antares.
- The slow one?

781
01:34:59,599 --> 01:35:00,759
Uh-huh.

782
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,438
I think he should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

783
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:12,518
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

784
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,519
In the circus in Rome.

785
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:18,958
You have driven in the great circus?

786
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:24,759
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

787
01:35:24,999 --> 01:35:26,478
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

788
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,678
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

789
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,919
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

790
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,198
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

791
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,638
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

792
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:42,239
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

793
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:44,998
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

794
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,679
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

795
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:52,278
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

796
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,799
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

797
01:35:56,279 --> 01:35:58,198
Judah Ben-Hur.

798
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,119
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

799
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:02,438
Yes.

800
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:07,798
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

801
01:36:08,599 --> 01:36:11,119
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

802
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:13,798
We might have achieved wonders.

803
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,758
You have to go.

804
01:36:19,999 --> 01:36:21,959
I make a journey which will not wait.

805
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,398
Well, then perhaps you will come back.

806
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,919
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

807
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,758
I have no wives.

808
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,838
No wives at all?

809
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,359
I have six, no, seven.

810
01:36:33,559 --> 01:36:35,159
Ha, ha. I've counted eight.

811
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,518
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

812
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,959
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

813
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,479
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!

814
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:49,159
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

815
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:50,799
It is not generous.

816
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,999
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.

817
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,318
Thank you. Thank you.

818
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,998
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

819
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,599
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

820
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:25,919
When they're ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

821
01:37:26,119 --> 01:37:28,838
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

822
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:31,598
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.

823
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,679
Stay and see them.

824
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,798
Come, my children. Come.

825
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,238
Strangers make them shy.

826
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,398
Come.

827
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:02,558
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

828
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,079
There, my children.

829
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:13,118
They are descended from
the Arabians of the first Pharaohs...

830
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,559
...and I have named them
for the stars.

831
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,719
Come, Antares.

832
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,478
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

833
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,999
What? Yes, yes.

834
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,839
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

835
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,239
Come, Rigel.

836
01:38:30,439 --> 01:38:33,199
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

837
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:35,519
There's my good Rigel.

838
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,919
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

839
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,399
The day's work done for you, eh?

840
01:38:43,559 --> 01:38:47,079
Ah. Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

841
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,639
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

842
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,759
Ah! Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

843
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,518
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

844
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,239
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

845
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,358
You should see their mother, Mira.

846
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:08,479
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

847
01:39:08,679 --> 01:39:10,559
All right, all right.

848
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,398
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

849
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,559
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

850
01:39:23,319 --> 01:39:27,399
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

851
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:30,519
You must be strong and swift.

852
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,078
Go, my children. Go.

853
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,238
When they reach Jerusalem,
they'll race the world's finest teams...

854
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,078
...not to mention the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

855
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,838
He stops at nothing to win.

856
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,799
- Messala? In the circus?
- Yes.

857
01:39:48,999 --> 01:39:50,599
You knew him?

858
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:52,799
I know him.

859
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,278
Perhaps without much liking.

860
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,078
Judah Ben-Hur,
my people are praying for a man...

861
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,039
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

862
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:05,279
You could be that man, the one...

863
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:07,518
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

864
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:10,719
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

865
01:40:10,959 --> 01:40:14,439
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

866
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,319
It's not possible.

867
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,119
That is a pity.

868
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,038
Think of it. To break his pride...

869
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,598
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

870
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:30,158
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

871
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,839
I know it is not possible.

872
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,839
Does it not delight your imagination?

873
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:39,478
Does it not answer your purpose?

874
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,598
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

875
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,319
And your way is to kill him.

876
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,719
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.

877
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,119
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to take his life.

878
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,798
He will be punished inevitably.

879
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,398
I don't believe in miracles.

880
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,239
But all life is a miracle.

881
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:06,679
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

882
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,278
You do not believe in miracles.

883
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:15,039
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

884
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:17,799
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

885
01:41:17,999 --> 01:41:20,959
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

886
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,958
And God lived in this child.

887
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:27,758
By now, he is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

888
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,599
That is why I have returned here...

889
01:41:29,799 --> 01:41:32,479
...so that I may be at hand
when he comes among us.

890
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:36,118
He is near.

891
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:40,559
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

892
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,839
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

893
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,559
Perhaps he is a shepherd...

894
01:41:47,759 --> 01:41:50,518
...a merchant, a fisherman.

895
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,639
But he lives...

896
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:56,999
...and all our lives from now on
will carry his mark.

897
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,718
There are many paths to God, my son.

898
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,959
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

899
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,118
I'm ready for sleep.

900
01:42:30,959 --> 01:42:33,278
Balthasar is a good man...

901
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:37,558
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

902
01:42:37,839 --> 01:42:39,839
And our intention true.

903
01:42:40,959 --> 01:42:42,638
So I must leave you.

904
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,559
One last thought.

905
01:42:46,759 --> 01:42:49,358
There is no law in the arena.

906
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,958
Many are killed.

907
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,278
I hope to see you again.

908
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,478
Fine Damascus silk.

909
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:15,999
Fine Damascus silk.

910
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:18,919
Esther?

911
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:31,998
It's Judah.

912
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,839
Judah.

913
01:45:39,919 --> 01:45:41,759
- You are alive.
- Esther.

914
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,919
You are alive.

915
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,798
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

916
01:45:56,119 --> 01:45:57,799
Shh.

917
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:00,719
I'm here.

918
01:46:02,599 --> 01:46:03,719
I'm with you.

919
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,439
Esther.

920
01:46:09,959 --> 01:46:11,559
Where's your father?

921
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,439
Hmm?

922
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:20,039
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

923
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,198
They tortured him.

924
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,998
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

925
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,959
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

926
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:35,679
You never went back to Antioch?

927
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:37,159
No.

928
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:41,638
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

929
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:47,719
Esther.

930
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,799
Where are my mother and sister?

931
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,519
Esther.

932
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,998
Let me tell him first.

933
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:19,918
Father.

934
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,719
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

935
01:47:24,999 --> 01:47:26,999
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.

936
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,558
He has come home. He is here.

937
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:49,798
Judah.

938
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,798
Judah Ben-Hur.

939
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,438
My dear old friend.

940
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:02,239
Let me look at you.

941
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,238
Let me see you.

942
01:48:05,599 --> 01:48:08,438
Yes, yes. It is true.

943
01:48:09,159 --> 01:48:12,598
Praise God for his mercy.

944
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:34,599
Where are they?

945
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:38,839
Since that terrible day...

946
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:42,159
...there has been no word of them.

947
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,279
You should have been less loyal.

948
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:01,398
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

949
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,519
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

950
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,959
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

951
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,159
We were released on the same day.

952
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:16,999
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

953
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,518
Since then, I have been his tongue...

954
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,319
...and he has been my legs.

955
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,598
Together, we make a considerable man.

956
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,998
Old friend.

957
01:49:29,399 --> 01:49:32,079
She always said you would return.

958
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:34,519
She never gave up hope.

959
01:49:36,519 --> 01:49:38,998
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

960
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:43,918
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

961
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,399
But suppose that isn't possible.

962
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,078
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

963
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,999
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

964
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,998
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

965
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,279
It is there still...

966
01:49:57,479 --> 01:50:00,758
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

967
01:50:03,919 --> 01:50:06,158
That's not why I came back.

968
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:09,199
Judah, they are dead.

969
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:14,078
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

970
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,439
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

971
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,238
Yes, it is true.

972
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,198
Judah Ben-Hur.

973
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,358
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

974
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:38,559
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

975
01:50:38,759 --> 01:50:40,039
- Let us laugh.
- We will.

976
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,038
There will be joy again in this house.

977
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,398
We will celebrate among the dust.

978
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,918
I will take him.

979
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,079
We stood here before.

980
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:36,159
A long while ago.

981
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,599
Four years.

982
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,038
But now it seems as if...

983
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,479
...only yesterday...

984
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:49,759
I was saying:

985
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,519
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye."

986
01:51:57,479 --> 01:51:59,519
"If I were not a bride...

987
01:51:59,719 --> 01:52:02,399
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said."

988
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,439
I am not a bride.

989
01:52:45,079 --> 01:52:47,239
Why did you never marry?

990
01:52:49,319 --> 01:52:51,039
My father needed me.

991
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:56,919
And also...

992
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,399
It's still on my finger.

993
01:53:09,639 --> 01:53:14,199
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

994
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,399
It's become a part of my hand.

995
01:53:31,839 --> 01:53:34,759
If Messala once knew you were here...

996
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,559
As he must.

997
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,998
He will know where they are.

998
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,399
And if you should find?

999
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:54,598
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.

1000
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,039
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

1001
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,718
My father is burned up with it.

1002
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:12,158
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

1003
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,079
...and love more powerful than hatred.

1004
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,599
I believe it.

1005
01:54:18,199 --> 01:54:20,039
- Esther.
- Judah.

1006
01:54:20,559 --> 01:54:22,158
Stay alive.

1007
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,599
Keep away from Messala.

1008
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,559
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

1009
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:31,518
That time isn't yet come.

1010
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:36,038
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

1011
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,119
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

1012
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:41,439
This time you will be destroyed.

1013
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:43,119
You'll die.

1014
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:28,558
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

1015
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,318
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

1016
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,518
Thank him. Bring him to me.

1017
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:39,398
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.

1018
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:42,039
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?

1019
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:45,438
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.

1020
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,919
It's magnificent.

1021
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:50,959
And from a man I've never met.

1022
01:55:51,159 --> 01:55:53,118
You're wrong, Messala.

1023
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,559
Judah.

1024
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:19,558
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1025
01:56:20,839 --> 01:56:23,039
You were the magician, Messala.

1026
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,439
You condemned me to the galleys.

1027
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,839
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1028
01:56:40,559 --> 01:56:42,119
You know his seal?

1029
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,478
Now I have come back...

1030
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,039
...as I swore I would.

1031
01:57:03,319 --> 01:57:07,359
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1032
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,959
You suggest I use it on myself?

1033
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:16,119
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1034
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,638
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1035
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,558
Find them, Messala.

1036
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,438
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

1037
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:32,039
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1038
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:38,438
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.

1039
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,759
Then get it.

1040
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:46,479
I will come back tomorrow.

1041
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:50,039
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1042
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,919
What became of them?

1043
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,599
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1044
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,318
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1045
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,638
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!

1046
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,959
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

1047
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,599
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1048
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,359
East section...

1049
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,038
...lower level.

1050
01:58:40,119 --> 01:58:43,239
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1051
01:59:00,199 --> 01:59:01,319
Water.

1052
01:59:01,839 --> 01:59:02,918
Water.

1053
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,759
Let me out!

1054
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:07,199
Hear us! Hear us!

1055
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:41,679
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.

1056
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,799
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1057
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,559
The food disappears.

1058
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:24,918
Lepers.

1059
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,758
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1060
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,558
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1061
02:01:42,559 --> 02:01:44,038
Is someone there?

1062
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,478
There is someone there.

1063
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,519
Who are you?

1064
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:10,199
Don't come any closer.

1065
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:14,358
Who are you?

1066
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:18,559
Esther.

1067
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,758
It's Miriam.

1068
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:23,359
Miriam.

1069
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:26,838
Miriam?

1070
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:31,478
Stay where you are.

1071
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,399
You have come home.

1072
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:39,119
Stand back, Esther.

1073
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:48,798
We are lepers.

1074
02:03:01,839 --> 02:03:03,399
Oh, Esther.

1075
02:03:05,239 --> 02:03:06,478
Tirzah.

1076
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,279
Esther...

1077
02:03:17,999 --> 02:03:20,198
...is Judah living?

1078
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,679
Yes, he is alive.

1079
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:26,078
He is here.

1080
02:03:28,999 --> 02:03:30,439
Where?

1081
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,919
He is searching for you now.

1082
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:38,038
I must find him and tell him.

1083
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:39,398
No!
- Tell my father.

1084
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,719
No.

1085
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,279
Tell no one.

1086
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:49,199
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1087
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,119
We won't return.

1088
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:53,999
But...

1089
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,199
...Judah has to be told.

1090
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:57,599
No.

1091
02:04:00,519 --> 02:04:01,598
Please.

1092
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:22,478
I couldn't see his face.

1093
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:25,758
Is it changed?

1094
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,518
No, he is not changed.

1095
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:33,438
He...

1096
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,679
He's not changed.

1097
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,959
You love him, Esther.

1098
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:55,238
Promise me...

1099
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,838
...on your love for him...

1100
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,599
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1101
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:12,238
Is he never to know?

1102
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:18,518
Let him remember us as we were.

1103
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:21,199
Promise me.

1104
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:34,598
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1105
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:37,198
Only this.

1106
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:45,678
I promise you.

1107
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,279
I am content.

1108
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,039
Wait.

1109
02:06:55,239 --> 02:06:57,278
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1110
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:01,398
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1111
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:03,399
He'll free them.

1112
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:05,638
He wants to survive.

1113
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:08,798
He cannot free them, Judah.

1114
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,478
What do you mean?

1115
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:25,238
- I saw them.
- You saw them?

1116
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,559
Where?

1117
02:07:26,759 --> 02:07:28,359
When did you see them?

1118
02:07:33,759 --> 02:07:39,238
They were dead.

1119
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:42,239
When?

1120
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,118
When? When?

1121
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,719
In the prison.

1122
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,598
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1123
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,758
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:07,599
I couldn't tell you.

1125
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,479
Nor even you, Father.

1126
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,399
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala...

1127
02:08:15,159 --> 02:08:18,279
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1128
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:19,799
It's over now.

1129
02:08:20,279 --> 02:08:21,439
Over?

1130
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:23,838
- Judah.
- Over?

1131
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:28,159
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

1132
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:16,319
Gentlemen. Officers.

1133
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,878
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...

1134
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:23,279
...may I enter?

1135
02:10:23,919 --> 02:10:25,359
Certainly, sheik.

1136
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,679
You do us an unexpected honor.

1137
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:31,038
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1138
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:43,118
And now,
the question you're all asking yourselves:

1139
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:44,919
Why am I here?

1140
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,238
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1141
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:48,679
The games approach.

1142
02:10:48,879 --> 02:10:53,078
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1143
02:10:53,239 --> 02:10:56,039
But I will back my own poor horses.

1144
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:57,679
No limits?

1145
02:11:14,079 --> 02:11:15,559
Mark me first!
- And me!

1146
02:11:15,759 --> 02:11:17,279
What odds?
- A moment, please...

1147
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:20,319
...my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

1148
02:11:20,559 --> 02:11:21,918
May I first, uh, sit down?

1149
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:24,078
Sit down. Lie down.
How much will you wager?

1150
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,799
- Yes, let's call his game.
Give the Arab a seat.

1151
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:28,839
A bench, quickly.

1152
02:11:29,839 --> 02:11:31,118
Thank you.

1153
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:36,399
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.

1154
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:39,038
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!

1155
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:41,199
Your spirit does you credit,
but do not be impatient.

1156
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:43,838
There is time and money enough for all.

1157
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,199
First, gentlemen, the odds.

1158
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:51,039
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

1159
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:54,158
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1160
02:11:55,239 --> 02:11:56,478
Two to one.

1161
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:02,198
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth...

1162
02:12:02,399 --> 02:12:05,918
...where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

1163
02:12:06,079 --> 02:12:08,678
I can get better odds
on any street market.

1164
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:10,838
Three to one.

1165
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:13,478
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1166
02:12:13,719 --> 02:12:16,959
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

1167
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:19,279
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.

1168
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:23,318
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

1169
02:12:25,799 --> 02:12:29,159
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

1170
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:31,278
The Prince of Hur.

1171
02:12:32,919 --> 02:12:35,359
Judah Ben-Hur.

1172
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,798
Prince of Hur?

1173
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,959
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.

1174
02:12:41,159 --> 02:12:43,279
Returned? Impossible.

1175
02:12:43,479 --> 02:12:46,839
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

1176
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:50,399
Well?

1177
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:54,799
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

1178
02:12:58,159 --> 02:13:00,398
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

1179
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:05,598
You, tribune...

1180
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,839
...will you give me four to one?

1181
02:13:11,919 --> 02:13:13,199
Four to one.

1182
02:13:13,439 --> 02:13:14,918
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.

1183
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:19,718
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

1184
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,439
Or an Arab.

1185
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,638
Bravely spoken.

1186
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:34,839
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture...

1187
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,118
A thousand talents?

1188
02:13:48,679 --> 02:13:52,598
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.

1189
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,999
Of course, if it is too much...

1190
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:03,438
A thousand talents it will be.

1191
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:04,998
Agreed.

1192
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,759
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

1193
02:15:03,919 --> 02:15:05,438
You're good fellows.

1194
02:15:05,759 --> 02:15:08,159
If only men were this good.
Hey!

1195
02:15:09,959 --> 02:15:11,198
Remember, Altair...

1196
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:13,919
...nine times around the circus, huh?

1197
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:17,439
Aldebaran.

1198
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:20,798
Hey, ha, ha.

1199
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:23,239
Rigel, did you hear?

1200
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:25,279
Nine lives to live.

1201
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,959
My swift fellow.

1202
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,998
You must not win the race
the first time around.

1203
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:35,918
You win the last time around.

1204
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:41,199
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

1205
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:46,438
Steady Antares.

1206
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:48,159
Like a rock.

1207
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:51,319
You will be our anchor.

1208
02:15:58,559 --> 02:16:01,158
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

1209
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,639
They have taken me into their family.

1210
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,399
Rest well, my stars.

1211
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:08,599
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1212
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:13,399
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it...

1213
02:16:13,639 --> 02:16:16,399
...the news will scorch the streets
of the whole Roman world.

1214
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:17,639
Pontius Pilate here?

1215
02:16:17,839 --> 02:16:19,758
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

1216
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:23,198
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

1217
02:16:23,759 --> 02:16:27,038
I only know that
I race against Messala.

1218
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,999
Look for the yoke.

1219
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:47,679
Ease that strap.

1220
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:31,599
God forgive me for seeking
vengeance, but my path is set.

1221
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:36,079
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.

1222
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:52,598
The Star of David.

1223
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:55,839
To shine out for your people
and my people together...

1224
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,039
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

1225
02:18:00,839 --> 02:18:02,638
They are ready.

1226
02:18:24,439 --> 02:18:26,599
Ready, off!

1227
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,959
Easy, girl, easy.

1228
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:10,599
Number five.

1229
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:13,678
Where is number five?

1230
02:19:43,199 --> 02:19:46,959
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

1231
02:19:47,279 --> 02:19:50,479
Yes, this is the day.

1232
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,198
Judah!

1233
02:19:53,559 --> 02:19:56,478
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1234
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:15,678
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

1235
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:30,119
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1236
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:03,998
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1237
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,798
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

1238
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:51,718
Citizens...

1239
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:57,119
...I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1240
02:24:57,759 --> 02:25:00,238
We dedicate them to his glory...

1241
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:02,879
...and to the glory of Rome...

1242
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:05,639
...of which you are all part.

1243
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:11,878
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

1244
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:14,798
They come here from Alexandria...

1245
02:25:15,039 --> 02:25:16,158
...Messina...

1246
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:17,678
...Carthage...

1247
02:25:17,919 --> 02:25:19,079
...Cyprus...

1248
02:25:19,279 --> 02:25:20,398
...Rome...

1249
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:21,798
...Corinth...

1250
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:23,359
...Athens...

1251
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:24,758
...Phrygia...

1252
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:26,639
...and Judea.

1253
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:37,599
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

1254
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,359
The race begins.

1255
02:25:40,959 --> 02:25:43,119
Hail, Caesar!

1256
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,279
Hail, Caesar!

1257
02:26:50,919 --> 02:26:52,678
Oh, you dog!

1258
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,638
Come, my children, come!

1259
02:29:54,959 --> 02:29:56,478
The Roman pig!

1260
02:30:32,679 --> 02:30:34,597
Hyah! Hyah!

1261
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:19,358
Steady! Now, now!

1262
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:14,119
Salute.

1263
02:36:28,159 --> 02:36:29,839
A great victory.

1264
02:36:30,039 --> 02:36:32,558
You are the people's one true god...

1265
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:34,318
...for the time being.

1266
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:36,559
Permit us to worship.

1267
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,559
I crown their god.

1268
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:09,318
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

1269
02:37:09,999 --> 02:37:14,078
A long life, young Arrius,
and the good sense to live it.

1270
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:40,319
We cannot wait, tribune.

1271
02:37:40,559 --> 02:37:42,758
He will come. He will...

1272
02:37:50,559 --> 02:37:52,559
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1273
02:37:52,759 --> 02:37:54,438
He will come!

1274
02:37:57,839 --> 02:37:59,238
He will come.

1275
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:03,279
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1276
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:07,679
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

1277
02:38:08,399 --> 02:38:09,679
Do you understand?

1278
02:38:09,879 --> 02:38:11,919
To hack the legs off me?

1279
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:15,719
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1280
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:18,639
I don't receive him with half a body.

1281
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:33,119
No. No!

1282
02:38:40,479 --> 02:38:43,398
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1283
02:38:43,759 --> 02:38:45,318
Here he is.

1284
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,918
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.

1285
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:25,598
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1286
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:32,478
I see no enemy.

1287
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:35,799
What do you think you see?

1288
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,798
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1289
02:39:41,359 --> 02:39:44,958
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

1290
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:51,439
Let me help you.

1291
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:08,798
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

1292
02:40:09,639 --> 02:40:12,279
Dead. And the race over.

1293
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:16,719
It isn't over, Judah.

1294
02:40:17,559 --> 02:40:18,678
They're not dead.

1295
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:26,653
Where are they?

1296
02:40:47,199 --> 02:40:48,838
Look for them...

1297
02:40:49,119 --> 02:40:52,678
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

1298
02:40:54,599 --> 02:40:56,639
...if you can recognize them.

1299
02:41:11,759 --> 02:41:13,359
It goes on.

1300
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:16,759
It goes on, Judah.

1301
02:41:18,879 --> 02:41:20,199
The race...

1302
02:41:22,479 --> 02:41:26,718
The race is not over.

1303
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:15,119
Is there a way down here?

1304
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:18,439
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

1305
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:06,559
Man.

1306
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:15,039
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

1307
02:44:17,479 --> 02:44:20,478
There... There are many women.

1308
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:24,318
Of the family of Hur.

1309
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:28,359
We have no names here.

1310
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:26,359
For them?

1311
02:45:31,479 --> 02:45:34,278
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.

1312
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:38,439
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

1313
02:45:38,759 --> 02:45:40,398
Not to see them?

1314
02:45:40,679 --> 02:45:41,759
They are coming.

1315
02:45:41,959 --> 02:45:46,478
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

1316
02:45:46,719 --> 02:45:51,039
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please! Judah!

1317
02:47:00,639 --> 02:47:01,878
Is Judah well?

1318
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:05,119
Is he happy?

1319
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:09,158
Yes, he is well.

1320
02:47:12,279 --> 02:47:14,839
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1321
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:17,039
He is well, Miriam.

1322
02:47:26,599 --> 02:47:28,039
God be with you.

1323
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:04,319
They have gone.

1324
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:12,439
We can go back.

1325
02:48:16,759 --> 02:48:19,358
Go back to what?

1326
02:48:21,679 --> 02:48:24,079
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1327
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:27,559
To think you remember them
as they were...

1328
02:48:28,839 --> 02:48:30,758
...and live your own life.

1329
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:35,039
Forget what is here.

1330
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:36,398
Forget?

1331
02:48:39,239 --> 02:48:40,959
It's as though
they were alive in a grave.

1332
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:43,719
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.

1333
02:48:43,919 --> 02:48:47,238
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

1334
02:48:47,440 --> 02:48:49,879
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1335
02:48:54,039 --> 02:48:58,239
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

1336
02:49:59,759 --> 02:50:00,799
Judah!

1337
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:03,119
Judah.

1338
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:07,679
He is here. I have found him.
The child has become a man.

1339
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:11,999
And the man, I know it now,
is the son of God.

1340
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,718
The promise is true.

1341
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:22,559
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

1342
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:24,759
Life has been answered.

1343
02:50:24,999 --> 02:50:26,798
God has answered it.

1344
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:43,159
Come. Come with me.

1345
02:50:46,359 --> 02:50:48,718
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys...

1346
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:50,918
...thirst had nearly killed me.

1347
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:53,759
A man gave me water to drink.

1348
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,639
I went on living.

1349
02:50:55,999 --> 02:50:59,239
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

1350
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:00,758
No.

1351
02:51:01,199 --> 02:51:02,678
I am thirsty still.

1352
02:51:03,399 --> 02:51:05,158
Come and listen.

1353
02:51:07,079 --> 02:51:09,038
I have business with Rome.

1354
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:12,759
You insist on death.

1355
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:19,239
Goodbye, Judah.

1356
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:08,799
You sent for me?

1357
02:53:08,999 --> 02:53:11,878
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

1358
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:15,119
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

1359
02:53:17,119 --> 02:53:20,079
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.

1360
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:22,478
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1361
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:28,238
Do you say nothing to this?

1362
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:34,118
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone...

1363
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:38,078
...where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

1364
02:53:38,239 --> 02:53:42,918
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

1365
02:53:43,159 --> 02:53:47,319
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

1366
02:53:47,559 --> 02:53:52,039
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

1367
02:53:52,239 --> 02:53:54,759
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

1368
02:53:54,959 --> 02:53:58,278
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

1369
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:01,238
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

1370
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:05,678
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

1371
02:54:05,919 --> 02:54:09,959
Where there is greatness,
great government or power...

1372
02:54:10,159 --> 02:54:12,358
...even great feeling or compassion...

1373
02:54:12,639 --> 02:54:14,958
...error also is great.

1374
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:17,158
We progress and mature by fault.

1375
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:20,878
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

1376
02:54:21,159 --> 02:54:22,559
There are other voices.

1377
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:26,118
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

1378
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:28,718
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place...

1379
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:32,238
...not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment...

1380
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:34,478
...or impossible loyalties.

1381
02:54:34,719 --> 02:54:36,918
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1382
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:39,918
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

1383
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:43,439
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1384
02:54:44,439 --> 02:54:46,719
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

1385
02:54:48,719 --> 02:54:50,559
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1386
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:04,679
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship...

1387
02:55:04,879 --> 02:55:06,999
...as I would speak to Arrius.

1388
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:10,958
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar...

1389
02:55:11,199 --> 02:55:13,599
...ready to crush all those
who challenge his authority.

1390
02:55:14,359 --> 02:55:16,479
There are too many small men
of envy and ambition...

1391
02:55:16,679 --> 02:55:18,758
...who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

1392
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:21,439
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

1393
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:25,959
They look to you,
their one true god, as I called you.

1394
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:30,199
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

1395
02:55:31,119 --> 02:55:34,039
I am already part of this tragedy.

1396
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:42,198
Return this to Arrius.

1397
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:46,119
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

1398
02:55:55,440 --> 02:55:57,558
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you...

1399
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:00,318
...from personal disaster
if you stay here.

1400
02:56:01,119 --> 02:56:03,078
You are too great a danger.

1401
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:19,999
Leave Judea.

1402
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:23,559
You have my word.

1403
02:56:43,759 --> 02:56:44,919
Judah!

1404
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,718
Oh, Judah!

1405
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:58,718
I was afraid
you would never come back...

1406
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:01,119
...afraid of what would happen to you.

1407
02:57:02,839 --> 02:57:04,758
But I see you again.

1408
02:57:07,119 --> 02:57:09,558
Your father's waiting for me.

1409
02:57:13,720 --> 02:57:14,879
Where is he?

1410
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:18,878
What do you mean to do?

1411
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:28,279
Oh, Judah.

1412
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:31,758
Rest, sleep.

1413
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:35,119
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

1414
02:57:35,319 --> 02:57:36,639
Peace?

1415
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:38,679
Love and peace.

1416
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:41,759
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

1417
02:57:42,079 --> 02:57:43,158
Where do you see them?

1418
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:46,598
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

1419
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:48,039
Balthasar's word.

1420
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:52,319
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1421
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:56,679
His voice traveled
with such a still purpose.

1422
02:57:57,039 --> 02:57:59,039
It was more than a voice.

1423
02:57:59,919 --> 02:58:02,078
A man more than a man.

1424
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:09,439
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...

1425
02:58:09,639 --> 02:58:11,838
...for they shall obtain mercy.

1426
02:58:12,679 --> 02:58:14,879
Blessed are the peacemakers...

1427
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:18,079
...for they shall be called
the children of God."

1428
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:19,839
Children of God?

1429
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:23,559
In that dead valley
where we left them?

1430
02:58:23,759 --> 02:58:27,399
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean...

1431
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:30,679
...until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth...

1432
02:58:30,879 --> 02:58:32,999
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1433
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:36,879
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

1434
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:38,759
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!

1435
02:58:40,879 --> 02:58:42,639
I know there is a law in life.

1436
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:46,638
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

1437
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:48,878
Death generates death...

1438
02:58:49,119 --> 02:58:51,598
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1439
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:54,799
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

1440
02:58:54,999 --> 02:58:56,639
"Love your enemy.

1441
02:58:56,959 --> 02:58:59,999
Do good to those who
despitefully use you."

1442
02:59:00,679 --> 02:59:04,039
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1443
02:59:04,239 --> 02:59:06,438
As you make us do now.

1444
02:59:09,959 --> 02:59:12,239
Are we to bear nothing together?

1445
02:59:13,959 --> 02:59:15,239
Even love?

1446
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:21,279
I can hardly draw breath...

1447
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:23,838
...without feeling you in my heart.

1448
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:26,479
But I know...

1449
02:59:28,120 --> 02:59:30,479
...that everything I do
from this moment...

1450
02:59:30,679 --> 02:59:33,759
...will be as great a pain to you
as you have ever suffered.

1451
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:37,118
It is better not to love me.

1452
02:59:38,639 --> 02:59:42,998
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

1453
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:46,279
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy...

1454
02:59:46,479 --> 02:59:50,759
...giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

1455
02:59:50,959 --> 02:59:52,799
It's as though you had become Messala.

1456
03:00:01,159 --> 03:00:03,158
I've lost you, Judah.

1457
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,878
No further.

1458
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:07,078
What are you doing here?

1459
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:10,238
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

1460
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:12,799
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

1461
03:01:13,679 --> 03:01:15,078
Where is Tirzah?

1462
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:19,878
Leave the food.

1463
03:01:20,959 --> 03:01:23,599
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1464
03:01:23,799 --> 03:01:26,079
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.

1465
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:28,999
I've heard him again,
the man from Nazareth.

1466
03:01:29,199 --> 03:01:33,398
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything he says.

1467
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:36,639
I cannot bear that
you should have never known...

1468
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:40,479
...this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

1469
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:43,838
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.

1470
03:01:43,999 --> 03:01:46,318
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find him.

1471
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:51,238
Tirzah is dying.

1472
03:01:57,399 --> 03:01:59,839
Leave the food and go.

1473
03:02:01,959 --> 03:02:03,559
It's Judah.

1474
03:02:07,599 --> 03:02:09,638
Why did you tell him?

1475
03:02:10,400 --> 03:02:12,238
Yes, Judah, yes.

1476
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,918
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1477
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:17,119
Mother.

1478
03:02:19,919 --> 03:02:22,759
Wait, Mother, wait.

1479
03:02:22,959 --> 03:02:24,038
Let me talk with you.

1480
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:25,599
Please.

1481
03:02:25,799 --> 03:02:28,278
No, no further. Please.

1482
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:32,039
No, Judah. Son, no.

1483
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:35,678
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1484
03:02:35,839 --> 03:02:36,798
Tirzah is dying.

1485
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:50,118
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know...

1486
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:52,239
...that life is everlasting...

1487
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:55,958
...and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

1488
03:02:58,479 --> 03:03:00,078
I will take them to him.

1489
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:03,118
No!

1490
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,158
God, no!

1491
03:03:18,639 --> 03:03:21,439
No, no, dear son.

1492
03:03:22,439 --> 03:03:23,599
Mother...

1493
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:27,719
...where is Tirzah?

1494
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:35,039
Judah, no.

1495
03:03:43,439 --> 03:03:46,239
You must not go to her, dear son.

1496
03:03:47,559 --> 03:03:48,839
Please.

1497
03:03:49,440 --> 03:03:50,879
Dear son.

1498
03:04:40,079 --> 03:04:41,639
I am afraid.

1499
03:04:42,559 --> 03:04:44,159
No cause.

1500
03:04:45,559 --> 03:04:47,839
The world is more than we know.

1501
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:25,679
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1502
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:27,118
No.

1503
03:05:28,120 --> 03:05:29,878
No, Judah.

1504
03:05:31,919 --> 03:05:33,718
No, Judah. No.

1505
03:06:11,760 --> 03:06:14,239
Alms for the blind?

1506
03:06:15,239 --> 03:06:17,799
Alms for the blind?

1507
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:24,919
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?

1508
03:06:25,119 --> 03:06:28,799
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.

1509
03:06:28,959 --> 03:06:31,799
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial? Whose trial?

1510
03:06:31,999 --> 03:06:35,158
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

1511
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:37,399
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?

1512
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:40,078
What has he done?

1513
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:43,839
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

1514
03:06:44,039 --> 03:06:45,919
Help for the blind.

1515
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:48,158
Look, lepers!
Lepers!

1516
03:06:48,760 --> 03:06:52,079
Go away!
Get away! Stay away!

1517
03:06:53,320 --> 03:06:54,559
Go away!

1518
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:10,358
Lepers! Lepers!

1519
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:33,119
How can this be?

1520
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:44,118
I know this man.

1521
03:09:57,640 --> 03:09:59,478
Will someone help him?

1522
03:10:06,680 --> 03:10:07,919
Take pity on him.

1523
03:10:13,919 --> 03:10:16,799
Have mercy. Have mercy.

1524
03:10:38,039 --> 03:10:39,839
In his pain...

1525
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:42,759
...this look of peace.

1526
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:46,559
Watch over them, Esther.

1527
03:11:23,039 --> 03:11:24,319
We must go back.

1528
03:11:24,480 --> 03:11:26,759
I brought you here to this...

1529
03:11:27,480 --> 03:11:29,119
...when I hoped...

1530
03:11:31,919 --> 03:11:34,199
You haven't failed, Esther.

1531
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,479
Hail King of the Jews!

1532
03:14:26,040 --> 03:14:29,439
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

1533
03:14:35,959 --> 03:14:37,679
He gave me water...

1534
03:14:38,400 --> 03:14:40,319
...and a heart to live.

1535
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:44,959
What has he done to merit this?

1536
03:14:47,079 --> 03:14:50,719
He has taken the world
of our sins onto himself.

1537
03:14:51,879 --> 03:14:54,679
To this end he said he was born...

1538
03:14:55,839 --> 03:14:57,719
...in that stable...

1539
03:14:58,400 --> 03:15:00,439
...where I first saw him.

1540
03:15:03,880 --> 03:15:07,078
For this cause,
he came into the world.

1541
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:15,239
For this death?

1542
03:15:17,919 --> 03:15:19,359
This beginning.

1543
03:15:50,559 --> 03:15:52,598
I have lived too long.

1544
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:25,398
As though he were carrying
in that cross...

1545
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:27,679
...the pain of the world.

1546
03:16:29,119 --> 03:16:33,439
So fearful, and yet why is it...

1547
03:16:33,639 --> 03:16:35,838
...I'm not afraid anymore?

1548
03:16:44,759 --> 03:16:46,999
The shadow of a storm.

1549
03:17:11,519 --> 03:17:13,719
A strange darkness...

1550
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:15,799
...but still day.

1551
03:17:24,359 --> 03:17:26,519
His life is over.

1552
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:48,159
What is it?

1553
03:17:56,879 --> 03:17:58,398
This tearing.

1554
03:17:59,319 --> 03:18:01,118
I am in pain.

1555
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:03,998
I feel it too.

1556
03:18:33,160 --> 03:18:34,198
Miriam.

1557
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:40,719
I thought I...

1558
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:43,039
Miriam.

1559
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,759
Do you see your hand?

1560
03:18:51,999 --> 03:18:53,039
Tirzah.

1561
03:18:56,519 --> 03:18:57,559
Miriam.

1562
03:19:09,159 --> 03:19:10,199
Tirzah.

1563
03:21:20,679 --> 03:21:23,039
Almost at the moment he died...

1564
03:21:24,480 --> 03:21:27,839
...I heard him say,
"Father, forgive them...

1565
03:21:28,079 --> 03:21:30,278
...for they know not what they do."

1566
03:21:32,439 --> 03:21:35,519
- Even then.
- Even then.

1567
03:21:40,959 --> 03:21:45,279
And I felt his voice take
the sword out of my hand.
