1
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,788
Those sons of bitches haven't come out yet

2
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,768
Yeah, they are still inside

3
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,042
Do you know how to rap?

4
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:11,986
Come on!

5
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:09,912
I'm sorry...

6
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,252
I'm sorry... Don't go... Don't go...

7
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,229
Stand up... Stand up!

8
00:02:57,236 --> 00:03:00,933
Daijiro, by the time you read this letter,

9
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,237
I am already in HK, working as
a receptionist in Jackie Chan's office

10
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:08,371
Having a chance to meet Jackie Chan,
I am really happy

11
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:12,076
After seeing Jackie Chan's movies,
his face comes up in my mind all the time

12
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:15,313
We had a good time together,

13
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:22,023
- but life doesn't stop there
- What?

14
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:26,087
- It is time for me to see the world
- Ling has gone

15
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,565
Let us start another new life on our own

16
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,104
Let us treasure our good times
and let it be our memory

17
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:34,298
Who cooks for me then?

18
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:38,867
Who buys condoms for me?
Who sleeps with me?

19
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:46,208
Hey, Hitomi, this Daijiro

20
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,486
Have you seen Ling?

21
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,752
She left me because of Jackie Chan

22
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,326
What? You also want to see him!
Crazy!

23
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,932
Hey, Takako

24
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,626
It's me

25
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:08,002
Ling... She went to HK to be the receptionist
in Jackie Chan's office

26
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:11,668
What?
You want Leslie Cheung's poster?

27
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,837
What are you talking about? Idiot!

28
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:20,114
This is Daijiro! Did you see Ling?

29
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:21,880
In Shinjuku or Shibuya?

30
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,446
I don't think she is in Hong Kong yet!

31
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:29,927
Won't she call you then? Won't she?

32
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,354
Hey, don't hang up on me

33
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,497
Excuse me, do you have the poster of
Jackie Chan in "Rumble in the Bronx"?

34
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,141
We don't sell Jackie Chan posters

35
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,771
How about that one?

36
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,179
That one is not Jackie Chan...
That is Jackie Chun

37
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:53,479
That is not for sale

38
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:57,454
But we do have Jackie Chan dolls

39
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:01,493
Look, Jackie Chan doll

40
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,063
Jackie Chan...

41
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:07,291
Take it, this is for you

42
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:12,300
Wait, don't watch so many
Jackie Chan movies

43
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,872
What a nasty couple...

44
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:20,471
Hello?

45
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,647
Kenichi...

46
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:24,243
Ling...

47
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,376
Jackie Chan is here, wait

48
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,113
Really?

49
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,415
Hello

50
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:41,932
Hello, Jackie

51
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,436
I love you! Do you love me?

52
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:58,239
I know you got hurt
in "The Armour of God"

53
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:02,447
When you acted in "Rumble in the Bronx",
your leg got injured... But you insisted to continue

54
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,783
I have seen all you movies!

55
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,987
Idiot, it's me!

56
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:11,986
Stupid!

57
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:30,309
You are fired!

58
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:34,415
I wish your company to be successful

59
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,254
and our boss to be healthy

60
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,291
I wish all the best for you

61
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:56,271
Daijiro

62
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:03,107
I bought you your favorite snacks

63
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:06,879
It is so hard to find you in this mess

64
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:11,687
Cheer up!
Hey, I brought Sushi. It is good, try it!

65
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:20,525
Why don't you go back with me?
Stop dreaming of being a star

66
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,828
Get real, find a job

67
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:27,065
Is Ling too good for me?

68
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,074
Don't be like this, okay?

69
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:33,270
A lot of people suffer more than you do

70
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:36,410
Besides, you have
your own good qualities

71
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,574
Like what?

72
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,781
Like...

73
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:48,784
You can't even name one

74
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:53,661
You are smart

75
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,625
I didn't even pass
the entrance examinations

76
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,902
You can fight

77
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,943
I'm always the first to run away

78
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,707
You are caring!

79
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,011
I didn't even give you
a Mother's Day gift

80
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:18,816
Cut it out!
I'm trying to cheer you up

81
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:23,759
About Ling, you should stick to her
and go after her again

82
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:29,733
Stop talking nonsense, go! Get a grip!

83
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:33,999
Mom... What did you just say?

84
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,404
Nothing... Nothing!

85
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,875
Mom, you are right.
You are absolutely right

86
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,980
I will go to Hong Kong

87
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,278
Are you serious?
You don't even know any Cantonese

88
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,943
I have to bring Ling back

89
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,118
Ling, wait for me!

90
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,291
Hong Kong, wait for me!

91
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,683
You are very lucky

92
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:20,649
Why?

93
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:23,586
I've already started to live with my girlfriend

94
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:27,152
Yes! You can keep my room

95
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,386
It is very cheap, only $4000

96
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,553
$4000!

97
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:35,693
That only gives me
6 months to stay here

98
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:42,703
6 months will be enough time
to bring Ling back to Japan

99
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,143
I thought you were
looking for a job here?

100
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,233
What can I do?

101
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,369
Stuntman!

102
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,439
Can I? I'm afraid of pain

103
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:55,449
Is there any ghost?

104
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,454
Yes, that's why it's so cheap!

105
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,157
I can't live without Ling

106
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:13,804
That is why my mom let me
come to Hong Kong to look for her

107
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,368
It really hurts me

108
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:19,244
I understand

109
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:22,940
What do you understand?
Do you know how it is to be a short man?

110
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,777
Don't be like this

111
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,883
The jockeys are short too,
but girls love them

112
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:31,218
Jockeys are exceptions
I am talking about real Love

113
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:33,985
Real Love?

114
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:38,588
You have to help me find Ling

115
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,525
My life relies on you

116
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:46,504
Love? You can't push it

117
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:50,401
Maybe, next time when you meet Ling

118
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:55,970
you may see Jackie Chan
and Hung Kam Po

119
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,541
Really?

120
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,514
Yes!

121
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,606
Really?

122
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:04,212
Relax! If there is any news on her,
my friends will call me

123
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:06,518
Camera? Where is my camera?

124
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:12,962
Did I bring my camera?
Where is my camera?

125
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:18,101
It will be great when I really get to meet
Jackie Chan and Hung Kam Po and so on...

126
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:21,935
Will they come?

127
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,168
Really?

128
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:28,541
You don't have to be so excited!
I can bring you to the studio

129
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,739
Really?

130
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,282
But I don't know whether they will come

131
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:33,908
I can't believe
you have become a stuntman

132
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,688
Jackie Chan was a stuntman before too

133
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,950
Among all my friends, only you made it

134
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:40,082
So did Shimizu

135
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,824
What is he doing?

136
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,485
He robbed a bank with two jointed pike

137
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,893
What happened at the end?

138
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,294
He ended up in hospital

139
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,422
The police beat him down?

140
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,763
No, he injured himself

141
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,667
What a fool

142
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:55,239
What about you?
Are you still practicing?

143
00:11:55,541 --> 00:12:00,308
Not really,
but I still have a couple of moves left

144
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,538
Show it to me, okay?

145
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,006
Okay!

146
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:37,247
I really miss the good old days

147
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,910
Right, everybody was working hard then

148
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:44,248
It's all over anyway

149
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,324
You really want to go back?

150
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,218
I really want to go back

151
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,851
You can't!

152
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,224
I really want to go back

153
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,922
You can't go back

154
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,960
I really want to go back

155
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,659
I really want to go back!

156
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,733
Hello!

157
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,073
What's up?

158
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:15,911
Hello sir?

159
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,251
Hung Kam Po!

160
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,257
Wait, whatever he asks you,
just say "No Problem"

161
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,121
Yes!

162
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,396
He wants to become a stuntman,
he wants to learn from you

163
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,487
Do you have anything for him to do?

164
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,367
You want to become a stuntman?

165
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,458
No Problem!

166
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,468
Can you stand it?

167
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:33,629
No Problem!

168
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,263
Come over here!

169
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,064
Have you had breakfast yet?

170
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:38,165
No Problem!

171
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,244
Take this!

172
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,334
No Problem!

173
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:54,516
Are you okay?

174
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,956
Why did he kick me? No problem

175
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:00,722
Okay, wait for my notice!

176
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:05,097
Kenichi, am I in the group?

177
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:09,573
You took that kick, right?

178
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:12,235
Really?

179
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:18,883
Right, if you see Ling,
you have to be calm

180
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:24,178
don't make a fool out of yourself.
Keep in mind

181
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,722
I see!

182
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,516
My name is Kun...

183
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,287
Why did you hire a 6-feet-tall man?

184
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,657
You can do it!

185
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:35,928
Don't think I can't hurt you,
I can jump over your head

186
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,525
Did you wear any pads?

187
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:38,898
Yeah!

188
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,472
You wear them here!
You should wear them there!

189
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:45,976
Kenichi, he looks like me

190
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:50,172
That guy! He is hot here!

191
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:53,116
But he's a jerk!

192
00:14:53,318 --> 00:15:01,783
Really? Our height is more or less the same,
so is our hairstyle

193
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,322
Protect with your hand!

194
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:09,033
Why you hit so hard, you want to kill me?

195
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,634
Boss, you are great!
You've got a pair of string legs, are you okay?

196
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:19,643
No problem?

197
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,101
Who is this guy?

198
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,406
Why you hit so hard?

199
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:29,186
Sir, he is my playmate in Japan,
the first day here

200
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:33,553
Rookie? Let me try! Come on

201
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:35,950
He wants you to fight with him

202
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:40,120
If you want to work here,
you have to let me beat you up first

203
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,290
Take it easy!

204
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,062
Take one punch and one kick

205
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:45,361
Yes!

206
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,907
You can't block, understand?

207
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:51,941
Yes...

208
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:59,276
Boss, are you okay?

209
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,682
What is the matter with you?
Why you dodge?

210
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,009
Boss are you okay?

211
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:05,420
Sorry...

212
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:08,455
You hurt him, you have to replace him

213
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:10,127
Straight to the gate!

214
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:13,957
Ready?

215
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,202
Camera roll... Action!

216
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,644
Cut! Everything okay?

217
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:36,743
No problem!

218
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,322
Bring him down slowly

219
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,518
Are you okay?

220
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,994
Check if I am bleeding or not

221
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,192
No problem!

222
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:54,330
The director said that you did well

223
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,428
Really?

224
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,175
He's asking whether you want to be
the main actor's stuntman

225
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,406
Of course

226
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:06,580
Calm down

227
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,084
Look over there!

228
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:18,462
Have some tart, Jackie's treat

229
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:22,125
Come and have one

230
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:26,401
Let's eat, come on

231
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,029
Can I have one?

232
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,040
Wait for a moment please...

233
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,933
I am here

234
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:38,072
Where is Jackie Chan?

235
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,307
Jackie Chan?

236
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:46,085
Jackie is busy.
He asked me to bring you guys the tart

237
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,553
Let me see him!

238
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,557
Jackie Chan?

239
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:54,490
Maybe, I will let you meet him later

240
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,158
You look slimmer

241
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:03,203
The pain of live cause me to get thinner

242
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,677
You are blaming me?

243
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:13,608
No, I am not, I come to talk to you

244
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,688
About us...

245
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,123
I made it very clear in the letter

246
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:29,026
I want to start a new life,
see some new things

247
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,268
We can do it together

248
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,697
If you want me to go bald, I will

249
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,300
Bald?

250
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,473
You always forced me to follow your way
in Japan, I want to be myself

251
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:47,376
Why did you treat me like that?

252
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:53,047
I won't say anything, you find your way

253
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:03,632
That's why
I decided to come to Hong Kong

254
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:10,068
I'd rather share you with someone
than lose you completely

255
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:14,774
I am not an object that
you can share around with other people

256
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,814
Ling, let's go!

257
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,344
Coming

258
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,203
I'll fix Maggie's schedule

259
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,302
Okay

260
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:56,581
Hello. Hold a moment please

261
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:05,288
Hello, Willie?

262
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:08,165
Okay... hold on

263
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,630
Ling!

264
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:20,702
You are going to dump me like this?

265
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:27,483
Do you think I am
some kind of cheap lighter?

266
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:32,751
No one is perfect

267
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:39,762
Even you can't remember you get fired
because you stole a vacuum once?

268
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:45,893
Haven't you returned Yamada's CD?
And you farted in the library!

269
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:49,838
Ling, Jackie is asking if the
person outside is your friend?

270
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:51,340
Yes! Sorry!

271
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:54,776
If he won't leave in 5 minutes,
he will ask someone to take him away

272
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,145
Sorry! I understand

273
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:03,518
You know how horrible Dioxine is?

274
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:08,422
Ling! Do you hear me? Hello!

275
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:11,655
Get lost!

276
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:13,992
Can you hear me?

277
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,147
What is it? It is so bitter!

278
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:37,049
Whatever you drink now is bitter!

279
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:43,925
This is Chinese medicine
which can cure your flu

280
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:47,221
It is too bitter

281
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:52,603
I have to be famous

282
00:21:56,508 --> 00:22:01,810
then Ling will come back to me

283
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,513
I want her to worship me
like she worships Jackie Chan

284
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,553
Just make a lot of girlfriends
so that you don't need Ling anymore

285
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:11,315
Okay!

286
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,751
But I am not cold-hearted

287
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:20,155
if Ling understands she is wrong
and comes back to me...

288
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,103
Do you know what you are doing?

289
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,170
You want to learn how to fight

290
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,606
Stop

291
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,082
Come and fix Mr. Kwan's wire

292
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,318
Fight like a man? Stupid!

293
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,478
Kenichi, take him away

294
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,112
What are you doing?

295
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:21,591
Mr Kwan, sorry.
I will pay for everything tonight!

296
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:25,929
Take off your make-up

297
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,625
No need, I'll do it at home!

298
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:54,316
It's me, Daijiro...

299
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:58,624
Daijiro?! What are you doing here?

300
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,857
That actor is not here?

301
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,297
Of course no

302
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,501
Bye bye!

303
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:39,834
Stupid scary face in "Ring"

304
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:41,869
Calling Control, over

305
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,667
Still don't know where the gorilla went to

306
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:58,352
I haven't found it yet, over

307
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:03,085
You have to grow up, you know?

308
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,999
Cheers!

309
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,231
Good friends

310
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,797
You know that you are small & can't fight
but you still came to help me

311
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:20,776
Let me tell you,
if you need anything from now on

312
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:24,371
No matter what I will help you

313
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:30,715
He said that no matter what,
if you need help, he will help you

314
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,020
You help me, I help you

315
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,115
We will help each other!

316
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,171
Have you seen an illegal immigrant?

317
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:35,183
Seen Anybody? Anyone
you don't know come into your house?

318
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:37,516
Sorry,
I don't know what you are talking about

319
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:40,147
Thief!

320
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,590
I really don't know what you are talking about!
Sorry!

321
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:50,599
Sorry... Sorry...

322
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:54,799
Hello, Ling...

323
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,839
You can't sleep yet.
do you want to buy something to eat?

324
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,480
You will sleep better
with your stomach full

325
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:09,576
What? Do it in the bathroom?

326
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:10,979
No, really?

327
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:14,581
You've get a great body
and a pair of big breasts

328
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:17,126
It is so big and soft!

329
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:18,889
Do you really like it?

330
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:22,831
I am coming! Don't touch me there

331
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,300
I am coming

332
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,330
Hello

333
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,104
It's me

334
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,543
Kenichi?

335
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,137
Yes. What are you doing?

336
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:40,809
I am talking to Ling

337
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,913
Ling? I just met her at the studio.
She had time to talk to you?

338
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:47,753
I am talking to her answering machine

339
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,327
What?

340
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,295
I decided that

341
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,561
I will not sleep with any other woman
for the next 6 months

342
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,262
Suit yourself!

343
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,770
Can I hang up with you?

344
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:04,808
Okay!

345
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:07,639
I will call you later, bye!

346
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:12,709
Hello!

347
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:14,876
Hi, Ling

348
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:19,146
Stupid

349
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,912
Hey, who are you? Come out!

350
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,914
This knife is very sharp, look

351
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:04,300
Who are you?

352
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,870
Don't touch my things

353
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,207
I am Ching, I came from Szechuan

354
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,048
Police?

355
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:29,887
If anything happens, call us

356
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:34,186
Hello!

357
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:35,821
What?

358
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,498
No problem!

359
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:39,968
Can't understand you!

360
00:29:57,488 --> 00:30:00,457
Come out!

361
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,997
Don't call the police. I am leaving

362
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:17,005
Police...

363
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:18,903
Police?

364
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:28,243
Hello

365
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,753
Stop it, okay?

366
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:34,052
You have filled my answering machine

367
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:36,123
Sorry!

368
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:40,926
But something big has happened

369
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:48,263
There is an illegal immigrant
who sneaked into my house

370
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:50,706
Should we call the police?

371
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:54,642
But she looks nice

372
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,372
Is she pretty?

373
00:30:57,915 --> 00:30:59,644
Very pretty

374
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:04,410
Why don't you go after her?

375
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:10,289
What are you talking about?
All I want to say is she is nice

376
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,620
Can you talk to her?

377
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,894
Who are you? What is you name?

378
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:22,666
My name is Ching,
I come from Szechuan

379
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:24,332
You sneaked in illegally?

380
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:28,873
I met a man from Hong Kong a year ago

381
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,973
He treated me really nice
and I fell in love with him

382
00:31:33,418 --> 00:31:36,785
He told me he was going to marry me
and he'd take me to Hong Kong

383
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:43,783
I didn't care about his money,
I only wanted to live with him

384
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,026
Of course living in Hong Kong is
better than living in Mainland China

385
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:54,468
Later he told me that
he was poor and couldn't marry me

386
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:57,230
I didn't mind and went to stay with him
in Shenzhen

387
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:03,472
One day he called me and
told me that he was really sick

388
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:07,081
And he had no money
and couldn't come back

389
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,543
After that, he disappeared

390
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:12,014
He only left me an address

391
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:14,921
I was worried about his health

392
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:19,891
So I sneaked into Hong Kong
trying to look for him

393
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:30,671
But who would know the boss wanted me
to work as a hooker to pay him back...

394
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,836
I refused and ran away

395
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:41,248
He then accused me of stealing his wallet

396
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:48,524
That is why I sneaked into
this Japanese man's house and hid myself here

397
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,430
That is why I sneaked into this Japanese man's house and hid myself here

398
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:57,395
Can I wait until morning?

399
00:32:58,336 --> 00:33:00,896
It is another love story

400
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,065
To be dumped by your lover is
very painful

401
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,774
I have that feeling too

402
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,674
I come all the way to this strange place

403
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,477
I understand

404
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,210
I understand your feeling

405
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:16,582
I cried many nights too!

406
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:26,359
You are the translator and
you have to tell every single word!

407
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:33,861
He said that it's so poor to be dumped

408
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,132
He has the same feeling of it

409
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,773
Come to another country to seek his lover

410
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:43,836
He understands how you feel

411
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,377
You still love her?

412
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:48,210
Yes! Very much

413
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,881
Is she here?

414
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,685
Yes

415
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:58,425
Why don't you stay here for a while?

416
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,025
Thanks!

417
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:05,191
I don't expect you taking me in,
I don't want to drag you down

418
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:12,136
No problem! I am a Japanese
all I have to say is I don't know

419
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,404
Don't worry, I am a good person!

420
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,949
Ching, if you are not a bad person

421
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:23,612
he is a very nice person.
He loves to help people

422
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:26,513
His girlfriend won't...

423
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:30,053
His girlfriend won't fell lost

424
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:32,225
What are you talking to her about?

425
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,929
What I told, I don't have to tell you

426
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:39,603
Ling, we should help her

427
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,830
Your decision

428
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:49,002
Why don't I stay at your house
so she can rest here?

429
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:51,481
Don't talk nonsense

430
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,612
Miss, don't call the police

431
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:55,843
No! No!

432
00:34:55,953 --> 00:35:01,118
I am not a nasty person.
I won't call the police

433
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:07,225
I will help you to find your boyfriend,
don't worry!

434
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:12,693
Are you serious?
Don't regret it after I translate that for you

435
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:18,772
Only helpless people
can understand each other

436
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,442
Ling, thank you very much

437
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,010
You are welcome

438
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:27,983
When you are talking sweet,
you are really are a nice person

439
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:30,983
If... I have any other questions

440
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,079
I will call you, okay?

441
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,623
Good night

442
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,475
Please

443
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:03,553
This...

444
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:06,054
Like this

445
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:11,686
If anything happens, take this

446
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:17,598
Don't worry, if anything happens, you...

447
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:22,033
use that. OK?

448
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:25,739
Good night

449
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,073
Go to sleep!

450
00:37:00,578 --> 00:37:02,443
No one will bother you!

451
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,758
Ching, Good morning

452
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:02,369
Daijiro asked me to tell you that
he went to work

453
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:10,710
There is breakfast in the microwave.
The key is in the cup

454
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:14,745
There are a lot of police on the street,
be careful

455
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:18,151
Also, there is a fat white man

456
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,985
He is nasty, you have to be careful!

457
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,225
You want me to translate that!

458
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:25,226
Is there any problem?

459
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,762
You are crazy!

460
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,161
Who are you talking to?

461
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,563
You weren't this good before

462
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,295
I was!

463
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:35,031
I had enough!

464
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,298
Ready, action!

465
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,803
Hey, it is time for you
to pay me back my money

466
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:43,573
If you have no money,
you can be a hooker

467
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,080
Give me two more days, okay?

468
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:47,844
There are three customers waiting

469
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,351
Let's go!

470
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,442
Cut, cut

471
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:53,785
Okay. One more time.
Stuntman, get ready

472
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:55,750
Okay!

473
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:00,052
You have to squeeze harder
during the real shoot, understand?

474
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:00,960
Okay!

475
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:03,659
Ready! Action!

476
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:07,766
Harder...

477
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:08,731
Harder...

478
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:13,205
Harder...

479
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:16,906
Harder...

480
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,162
I'm sorry

481
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,034
Sorry!

482
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,264
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

483
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,567
Director, are you okay?

484
00:39:58,155 --> 00:39:59,986
I was looking for you the whole night

485
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,354
Why did you look for me?

486
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:09,865
A girl from Mainland China
sneaked into my house

487
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,256
Where is she now?

488
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,767
In my house

489
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:17,103
I promised her that
I would help her to find her boyfriend

490
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,233
Does Ling know about it?

491
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:21,402
She translated for me

492
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,181
Is that girl pretty?

493
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:28,251
Very pretty

494
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,517
No wonder

495
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:33,287
I only hope Ling will get jealous

496
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,357
Did she?

497
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,426
I don't think so

498
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:40,764
This means that she doesn't love you anymore.
You see?

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,265
Have you anything
about her boyfriend?

500
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:51,374
Just a little bit

501
00:40:57,715 --> 00:40:58,704
Hey

502
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,346
Daijiro, how come you are here?

503
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:04,854
How come you are here?

504
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:11,154
He is nice to take me home,
it's none of you business anyway

505
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:12,024
Hey!

506
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,221
What?

507
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,593
What?

508
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,907
No way?!

509
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:26,442
He can't stand it

510
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:28,204
Are you scared of blood?

511
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:29,939
What did you say?

512
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,978
Stop... Stop...

513
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,319
Are you okay?

514
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,759
Stop...

515
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,603
You too... Sop!

516
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:00,173
You crazy!

517
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:01,403
- Are you okay?
- I am fine

518
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:03,207
Bastard, I'm in pain

519
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,378
You lucky little fool

520
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:17,287
I am really sorry

521
00:42:17,394 --> 00:42:20,955
Okay, no problem,
don't let me see you next time

522
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:46,319
We can talk by using this phone

523
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:51,124
I am going to make a call, wait

524
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:02,864
Hello?

525
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:07,070
I am Daijiro

526
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:11,303
I am very busy... Wait

527
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,896
I was born a loser

528
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:42,938
The sad part is that Ling was my first lover

529
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:58,322
She made me forget all my weaknesses,
like I have a monkey face, I'm too short

530
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:05,192
I was always the shortest in the class

531
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:08,967
My first love was pretty smooth

532
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,472
It made me feel that I was normal

533
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:17,505
But you are nice

534
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:22,578
It's only the words to soothe someone
who is ugly

535
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:27,381
Comparing to me,
you still know where your lover is

536
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:30,390
But I don't know mine

537
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:35,226
You take the risk to come all the way here

538
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:38,298
Just to find him

539
00:44:39,736 --> 00:44:42,967
He must be very handsome

540
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,143
Not because he is handsome. But,
we spent a lot of special moments together

541
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,271
and he is my first lover

542
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:54,213
You mean sleeping with him?

543
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:59,313
Why do you ask her this kind of question?

544
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:03,216
Sorry! I am too straight-forward

545
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:07,329
I am very serious about this matter

546
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:13,937
You haven't answered me yet.
Is he handsome?

547
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,865
To me, he is the most handsome man
in the world

548
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,044
Is he tall and big?

549
00:45:23,714 --> 00:45:26,808
To me, he is like a giant

550
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,325
Of course it's better to be
tall and handsome

551
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,194
He said that too

552
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:44,125
I also treated Ling well

553
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:46,165
That is her lost

554
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:53,434
I wasn't very short when I was little

555
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:59,845
But my dad said that
I would not be very tall when I grew up

556
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,084
How did he know?

557
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:08,251
My dad said

558
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:13,859
When I knew how to walk,
I always climbed on a chair

559
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:17,866
That is fate

560
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:22,333
Luckily I am 6 inches taller than you

561
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:27,102
What is wrong with you?! Even is you are
6 inches longer you are still he sex toy

562
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:30,809
What do you mean?

563
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:34,907
When I find my boyfriend then
I don't have to bother you anymore

564
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,614
I understand how you feel

565
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:44,160
You can rely on me

566
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,887
I wish that Ling will change he mind
and be with you

567
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:53,235
Thanks!

568
00:46:54,538 --> 00:46:56,529
I have to sleep now

569
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,407
You should get some sleep too,
doesn't she have things to do tomorrow?

570
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:03,237
Yes

571
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:09,450
Hello

572
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,387
Mom!

573
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:16,559
How are you?

574
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,322
Are you feeling okay?

575
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,697
Okay

576
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:27,904
I am so busy recently

577
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:32,606
Don't worry

578
00:47:34,611 --> 00:47:36,010
Where is Ling?

579
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:48,383
Mom.. Take care of yourself.
Stay away from too much diet

580
00:47:51,061 --> 00:47:56,465
When my movie comes out,
I will send you a copy

581
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:04,001
Daijiro, remember this

582
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:08,737
In your mom's heart,
you are taller than Mt. Fuji

583
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,646
Mom, don't say it that way

584
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,021
Take good care of your health

585
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,556
Okay... Get some rest

586
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:28,028
Good night!

587
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:29,827
Good night!

588
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,215
My mom

589
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:53,620
I know

590
00:48:57,994 --> 00:49:02,294
I love my mom

591
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:13,369
But I left my mom for a person
who doesn't love me

592
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:22,718
I don't know what you are talking about.
But I understand

593
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:34,864
Maybe I don't need a translator.
I only need you to listen to me

594
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:37,766
I thought I would love Hong Kong

595
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:41,434
But if you don't have a person to rely on

596
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:46,034
It's very lonely here even though
this is the most beautiful city

597
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:51,007
This is the first time
to look at you so close

598
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:54,283
You are prettier than Ling

599
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:57,851
You take me in and help me
to find my boyfriend

600
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:01,382
I really want to thank you

601
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:04,187
I hope that Ling will come back to you

602
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:07,195
You feature is so nice

603
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:13,860
Your lips are thin and wet

604
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:19,169
My lips are always dry

605
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:23,838
You are not handsome, but you are nice

606
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:27,074
The beauty of your heart

607
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,352
It is an eternal beauty

608
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:35,254
How come you boyfriend left you behind?

609
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:44,929
You've got a great figure
and bigger breasts than Ling's

610
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,665
No, I can't think that way

611
00:50:50,473 --> 00:50:52,873
It's too ugly

612
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:56,104
I was crying earlier, but now...

613
00:50:56,513 --> 00:51:00,574
From your eye, I can tell
that you got hurt really deep

614
00:51:00,884 --> 00:51:02,476
Get some sleep!

615
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,783
When you wake up
it will be like a new beginning

616
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:14,594
No, I can't do this

617
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:17,633
I can't

618
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:20,532
I will sleep here

619
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:23,069
Good night

620
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:42,847
Daijiro, Daijiro

621
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:45,746
time for breakfast

622
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:04,303
Thanks

623
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:10,412
let's eat

624
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,353
He is the person I am looking for

625
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:25,154
Right! We are going to look for
your boyfriend today

626
00:53:25,295 --> 00:53:26,990
He is my boyfriend

627
00:53:28,064 --> 00:53:32,091
So you like that type of man

628
00:53:33,103 --> 00:53:36,766
I am better than him

629
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:40,640
Nothing

630
00:53:43,413 --> 00:53:44,846
Let's eat breakfast

631
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:07,501
Kenichi, ask him if he knows
the man in the picture

632
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:15,934
Okay!
Everyone knows him around here

633
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:18,606
He doesn't always come here!

634
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:19,739
Really?

635
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,083
I think he went to Thailand
to have a good time

636
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:26,178
Yes! Go look for him at
the Golden Flower Night Club

637
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:29,224
Golden Flower Night Club,
where is it?

638
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:32,954
You don't know where it is?
It's two blocks down the street

639
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,928
Leave your telephone number here

640
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:37,431
when he comes back,
I will tell him to call you

641
00:54:37,534 --> 00:54:39,502
Great, thank you

642
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:53,406
Can you two handle it?
Don't you need help?

643
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,909
We can handle it

644
00:54:56,853 --> 00:54:59,253
Are you injured badly?

645
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:01,414
It is only a scratch

646
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:06,657
why don't you worry
about your boyfriend

647
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:18,133
Could you tell Ching that she is pretty today

648
00:55:21,344 --> 00:55:23,209
I reject that

649
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:27,682
You have a low standard for the word, pretty

650
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:31,811
If my standard is low,

651
00:55:32,322 --> 00:55:34,950
then you are ugly

652
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:43,663
Why do you use her to make me mad?

653
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:51,172
Take a deep breath and listen carefully

654
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:54,168
She is prettier than you

655
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,517
Miss, please,
show me your ID card please

656
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:47,053
What?

657
00:56:47,163 --> 00:56:48,653
ID card

658
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:50,154
What?

659
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:51,597
Japanese?

660
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:53,424
Passport please

661
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:57,731
(?????)

662
00:57:01,177 --> 00:57:05,807
Hey, what are you two doing?

663
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,311
Flirting!

664
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:10,409
Come here!

665
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:13,920
Stop it!

666
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:25,763
Go! Go!

667
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:34,207
Where are you going? Hooker,
where are you going?

668
00:57:34,544 --> 00:57:36,205
Hooker

669
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:40,613
Are you mad?

670
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:42,884
Does it hurt?

671
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,921
But I had to do that

672
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:53,657
If not you would have been taken
to the police station

673
00:57:56,532 --> 00:58:00,491
I might have hurt you on your head

674
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:04,164
But I used my hands trying you protect you

675
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:06,572
I hurt badly too

676
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:08,902
I was forced to do that

677
00:58:15,051 --> 00:58:19,010
This way please

678
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:24,922
Excuse me, do you speak Mandarin?

679
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:27,821
I am not mad at you for hitting me

680
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,822
I just don't want to sneak around

681
00:58:38,908 --> 00:58:44,107
You will find your boyfriend in two days,
aren't you happy?

682
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:57,090
Okay, if he is not in Hong Kong
or is already married and has kids

683
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:09,227
You can still stay at my house

684
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:22,148
Tell her that...

685
00:59:23,252 --> 00:59:30,090
I really like her

686
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:42,097
Where the hell did you go?

687
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:44,305
Leaving me like that?

688
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:48,942
Let's start

689
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:51,343
Japanese speaking class

690
00:59:54,684 --> 00:59:56,652
Lesson one

691
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:00,413
Self introduction

692
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,921
I am a Japanese

693
01:00:06,696 --> 01:00:09,529
No! You are a Chinese

694
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:14,397
No, I am a Japanese, Japanese,
I am a Japanese

695
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:15,832
I am a Japanese

696
01:00:15,938 --> 01:00:16,927
Chinese!

697
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,700
Chinese

698
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:24,702
When you want to know
what time it is

699
01:00:25,314 --> 01:00:28,215
What time is it?

700
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:31,813
Eight O'clock sharp

701
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:34,551
It is five minutes to eight

702
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:37,684
Five minutes

703
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:38,890
Minus five minutes

704
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:42,862
When you want to go to the bathroom...

705
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:45,628
Bathroom

706
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:48,260
When you want to go to the bathroom...

707
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:49,463
Where is the bathroom?

708
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,443
Ba-th-roo-m

709
01:00:56,913 --> 01:00:57,971
Where is the bathroom?

710
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:00,444
Not bad

711
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:02,844
Can you get me some toilet paper?

712
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:05,386
Can you get me a camera?

713
01:01:05,488 --> 01:01:06,477
Toilet paper...

714
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:10,080
Hello

715
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:12,156
Why don't you call me?

716
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:16,097
I thought you might not like it

717
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:19,600
How do you know if you don't call me?

718
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:21,431
What are you doing?

719
01:01:21,537 --> 01:01:25,405
I am teaching Ching Japanese

720
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:29,138
Isn't she looking for her boyfriend?

721
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:30,779
We've been there today

722
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:37,784
You said that she is very pretty, right?

723
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:42,217
Right! It is very subjective

724
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:46,455
others may not think that way

725
01:01:49,532 --> 01:01:54,799
Daijiro, do you still like me?

726
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:02,942
You know why I came to Hong Kong

727
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,346
Could I get to see Ching?

728
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:08,439
Of course

729
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:12,382
Let me teach her Japanese then!

730
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:17,686
okay... I will call you again

731
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:19,852
Bye!

732
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,635
Is she prettier than me?

733
01:02:28,104 --> 01:02:29,162
Yes!

734
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:56,482
Daijiro, no problem?

735
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:06,867
No problem

736
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:11,202
We ran out of tissue paper,
I will go buy some more tomorrow

737
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:14,467
Get some sleep! Everything is fine!

738
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:45,340
Hello... Ling

739
01:04:45,911 --> 01:04:47,310
Where are you right now?

740
01:04:47,546 --> 01:04:50,640
East Point Mall

741
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:55,143
I am free

742
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:57,182
You should get some rest then

743
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,119
Why don't you ask me to come out
and have a cup of coffee?

744
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:06,161
I am afraid that you would not like it

745
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:50,568
Sorry to keep you waiting

746
01:05:53,011 --> 01:05:53,909
Please

747
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:59,110
Haven't seen you for a long time

748
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:00,650
Yes

749
01:06:02,454 --> 01:06:04,820
That girl...

750
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:05,912
Ching

751
01:06:06,024 --> 01:06:10,654
Right... How is Ching?

752
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:13,924
Let's talk about body first...

753
01:06:14,032 --> 01:06:16,967
She is not really great

754
01:06:17,202 --> 01:06:21,935
She dresses quite conservatively

755
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:27,668
but her skin is very smooth

756
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:36,754
She's got a pair of big eyes
that make you want to help her

757
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,427
Do I get to meet her?

758
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:50,959
Of course

759
01:06:57,843 --> 01:07:00,038
This way

760
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:21,623
This is for you

761
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:23,656
What?

762
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:30,473
You have to go see your boyfriend

763
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:35,539
I don't want people to know that
you came here illegally

764
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:40,842
If you dress a little better,
the cops will not suspect you

765
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:45,485
Maybe your boyfriend will be
glad to see you dressed well

766
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:52,720
Try it!

767
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:53,991
Go change your clothes

768
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:09,006
You treat a girl
who has a boyfriend so good

769
01:08:09,114 --> 01:08:10,706
So you have grown up

770
01:08:12,017 --> 01:08:16,454
or it's that you didn't treat me
well enough before

771
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:20,053
Because I didn't treat you well,
I ended up here!

772
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,730
Ling, can you translate it for me?

773
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:36,131
Okay

774
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:42,806
Daijiro, I don't know how to thank you
for everything you have done for me

775
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:48,914
At the beginning, I knew you liked me

776
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:52,012
And didn't mind that I came illegally

777
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:56,926
Later, you knew I came for my boyfriend.
You still treated me so good

778
01:08:59,531 --> 01:09:01,556
Can I ask you a question?

779
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:11,569
Do you love me?

780
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:28,154
Daijiro, do you know that,
I never loved you

781
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:46,907
I know what you mean...

782
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,812
I am not doing these things
to make you love me

783
01:09:53,818 --> 01:09:57,652
I am just happy helping people

784
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:07,398
I don't mind whether you like me or not

785
01:10:12,537 --> 01:10:15,529
Yes, I like you

786
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:19,110
But I can't love you.
Because I love Ling

787
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:38,355
Ling, you don't have to translate
what I am going to say

788
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:43,393
Daijiro is a good person

789
01:10:44,402 --> 01:10:47,235
He is worth for a girl to admire

790
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:54,871
She told me that you are nice

791
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:59,006
Lots of girls will like you

792
01:11:02,654 --> 01:11:04,588
Of course!

793
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,327
Let's go to eat something!

794
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,997
I can't stand it!

795
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:33,200
You want to seduce me?

796
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:13,073
If you don't want me to touch you,
you can push me away

797
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:26,995
Shit!

798
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:46,550
Excuse me

799
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:49,944
My girlfriend is sick!

800
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:54,819
She is coughing and very pale

801
01:13:55,193 --> 01:13:57,559
Is she okay?

802
01:13:57,662 --> 01:13:59,687
Don't worry. Just caught flu

803
01:14:00,632 --> 01:14:01,860
Thank you!

804
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:05,396
Thank you!

805
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:08,465
Thank you!

806
01:14:13,645 --> 01:14:15,408
Take the medicine

807
01:14:20,385 --> 01:14:22,250
Wait

808
01:14:46,044 --> 01:14:47,511
It's time for medicine

809
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:49,235
Excuse me

810
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:54,717
Take the medicine

811
01:14:58,456 --> 01:15:00,515
I know it is bitter

812
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:09,866
I tasted it already

813
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:12,435
It is very bitter

814
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:21,207
We will wait until you get well

815
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:25,415
then we will go look for
you boyfriend, okay?

816
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:16,489
This place is quieter than
the cemetery

817
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:19,764
Go get some pretty girls
and do some interesting things

818
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:21,964
You can't afford it

819
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:26,165
Stop talking nonsense.
It is very dangerous to find girls from China

820
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:28,802
I found one recently.
She was very good

821
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:30,608
Her figure was just like Madonna

822
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:34,378
When I was trying to bring her here,
I discovered that her dad was a commander

823
01:16:34,485 --> 01:16:37,010
If her dad had found out, I'd be dead

824
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:47,489
Excuse me

825
01:16:49,133 --> 01:16:50,225
What is it?

826
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:53,465
I want to find Ming

827
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:57,802
Ming? Everybody knows him

828
01:16:58,142 --> 01:16:59,336
Follow me

829
01:17:01,145 --> 01:17:02,442
Wait

830
01:17:04,015 --> 01:17:05,004
Where are you going to?

831
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:07,016
Ming, someone is looking for you

832
01:17:11,322 --> 01:17:12,482
Who?

833
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:21,763
Don't take my wig?!

834
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:24,300
If the customer touches you,
what should you say?

835
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:26,727
Don't touch

836
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:28,162
Yuen

837
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:36,241
Yuen!

838
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:40,082
Ching... It's you

839
01:17:40,751 --> 01:17:42,309
Finally get to see you

840
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,654
I am lucky

841
01:17:44,856 --> 01:17:47,086
How come there was no news from you?

842
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:50,954
You didn't keep what you promised me

843
01:17:51,662 --> 01:17:53,653
What have I promised you?

844
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:56,525
Take me to Hong Kong and marry me

845
01:17:57,568 --> 01:18:02,562
After I left you, I came to Hong Kong

846
01:18:03,808 --> 01:18:08,142
I was going to keep my promise
I made to you

847
01:18:08,246 --> 01:18:12,376
I couldn't believe that when I woke up one day,
I discovered something on my tongue

848
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,414
I had headache and I puked

849
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:18,285
I went to see a doctor

850
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:20,753
He told me that I had cancer

851
01:18:36,207 --> 01:18:40,871
I went to the hospital myself.
And received all the treatments

852
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:45,308
After 49 days, I got well

853
01:18:48,085 --> 01:18:52,419
I didn't want you to worry about me,
so I didn't call you

854
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:56,789
I wanted to face this myself

855
01:18:57,161 --> 01:19:00,824
So we could share the beautiful future

856
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:10,833
Who brought you here?

857
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:13,137
I sneaked into Hong Kong

858
01:19:13,244 --> 01:19:19,649
What? It is very dangerous

859
01:19:20,117 --> 01:19:24,144
After I came to Hong Kong,
the police were everywhere

860
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:26,780
Luckily I met a very nice Japanese man

861
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:31,521
He took me in and helped me to find you

862
01:19:31,963 --> 01:19:33,396
He is outside

863
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:35,988
A Japanese man helped you?

864
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:40,433
That's great, let me see him

865
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:48,435
Where is he?

866
01:21:28,212 --> 01:21:30,146
You have a nice view

867
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:34,850
Put the cushion here

868
01:21:39,657 --> 01:21:45,960
My picture, is cute.
I am cuter than Jackie Chan

869
01:21:48,332 --> 01:21:50,391
Cheer up

870
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:51,730
Yes

871
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:54,268
Do you want me to stay with you?

872
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:57,731
I don't want anything right now

873
01:22:01,445 --> 01:22:03,208
Let's make love!

874
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:10,110
Do you really love me?

875
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:26,993
Ling!

876
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:35,972
She loves you more than I love you!

877
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,069
What?

878
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:42,213
My Chinese is not good

879
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:45,380
sometimes I make mistakes

880
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:15,909
Coming

881
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:19,789
Good Night

882
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:23,483
I am Ching's boyfriend

883
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:27,097
It's you, come in

884
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:37,733
You think you can just leave some money
and forget about everything?

885
01:23:38,576 --> 01:23:43,775
What you did was like leaving a cat
in the wild mountain

886
01:23:44,248 --> 01:23:47,046
Like abandoning a baby
on other people's footstep

887
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:50,211
You are not quite responsible

888
01:23:50,821 --> 01:23:53,187
I have cancer

889
01:23:56,193 --> 01:23:59,629
I teach the girls English
in the night club everyday

890
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:03,928
I just want to save some money for her

891
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:08,430
But you came to leave her to me

892
01:24:09,073 --> 01:24:14,136
We can only live in the low class apartment

893
01:24:14,445 --> 01:24:18,973
If you do this, it is like
pushing her down into an abyss

894
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:25,186
Besides, the amount you put down
is not enough

895
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,424
I know I will be dead soon

896
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,424
She likes Hong Kong so much.
She must want to stay here

897
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:39,500
So I want to buy her an ID card

898
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:44,136
I need some money

899
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:47,404
$20,000

900
01:24:47,845 --> 01:24:48,743
$20,000?!

901
01:24:48,979 --> 01:24:50,071
Yes!

902
01:24:55,219 --> 01:24:56,208
Thanks!

903
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,287
No problem!

904
01:24:57,388 --> 01:24:58,047
Thanks!

905
01:24:58,155 --> 01:24:59,179
You are welcome

906
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,655
Thanks!

907
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:20,236
It hurts, $20,000

908
01:25:21,245 --> 01:25:24,612
But for Ching, I have to do it

909
01:25:27,451 --> 01:25:30,818
$20,000 is gone just like this.
It really hurts

910
01:25:31,422 --> 01:25:33,754
Here is $2,000...

911
01:25:38,262 --> 01:25:39,251
Coming

912
01:25:42,366 --> 01:25:46,996
Are you Ching's boyfriend?

913
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:51,571
Boyfriend? You can say that!

914
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:54,042
This again

915
01:25:56,246 --> 01:25:58,373
Has Ching stayed here before?

916
01:26:00,017 --> 01:26:01,279
Yes

917
01:26:01,652 --> 01:26:04,177
Has she slept on this bed before?

918
01:26:05,422 --> 01:26:06,684
Yes

919
01:26:07,224 --> 01:26:09,522
Has she used the bathroom before?

920
01:26:10,227 --> 01:26:11,455
Yes

921
01:26:12,896 --> 01:26:18,129
Let me tell you, I am her boyfriend.
You are with her now. I want to return her

922
01:26:19,003 --> 01:26:20,903
No...

923
01:26:21,005 --> 01:26:24,463
No... If you don't have sex so often,
you wouldn't be this tall?!

924
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:27,809
Let me tell you, I want break up fees

925
01:26:27,911 --> 01:26:29,105
$100,000

926
01:26:31,882 --> 01:26:35,682
Boyfriend back! Back!

927
01:26:35,919 --> 01:26:37,147
Back?!

928
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:44,384
I'll be back!

929
01:26:44,895 --> 01:26:47,955
Didn't I give you money already?
$20,000!

930
01:26:48,866 --> 01:26:52,700
It's none of you business. I change
my outlook and I want $100,000 more

931
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,235
Let Ching talk to him

932
01:26:56,106 --> 01:26:57,767
Daijiro

933
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:02,437
Ching are you okay?

934
01:27:02,546 --> 01:27:05,014
I will handle this

935
01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:06,874
No problem

936
01:27:08,085 --> 01:27:13,990
This is my name card,
when you have the money then call me

937
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:31,037
Ouch!

938
01:27:32,076 --> 01:27:35,477
Kenichi, where were you?
I was looking for you

939
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:37,206
I was looking for you, too

940
01:27:37,314 --> 01:27:38,212
Why?

941
01:27:38,315 --> 01:27:39,942
You say first

942
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:42,914
I need money

943
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,849
Do you want to make money?

944
01:27:44,955 --> 01:27:46,115
What money?

945
01:27:46,223 --> 01:27:49,283
The one you hurt before

946
01:27:49,393 --> 01:27:51,520
The shorty?

947
01:27:51,628 --> 01:27:55,655
He and the director will give $100,000
for anyone who can jump over a ten feet gap

948
01:27:55,766 --> 01:27:57,393
I will do it

949
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:59,435
But it is 6 levels high

950
01:28:04,842 --> 01:28:08,334
I think it's dangerous.
Even if you quit now

951
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:10,811
no one is going to laugh at you

952
01:28:10,914 --> 01:28:13,747
I will think of another way

953
01:28:15,919 --> 01:28:19,286
It is not all about money now..

954
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:25,625
If I jump over it
I will be very confident

955
01:28:31,135 --> 01:28:35,663
Do you remember when Jackie Chan
jumped down from the bell tower?

956
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:40,238
It touched me so much

957
01:28:41,712 --> 01:28:45,580
I went home and cried for a whole night

958
01:28:47,784 --> 01:28:54,690
I thought that he was awesome!
Don't you agree?

959
01:28:55,225 --> 01:29:00,891
You've got guts. But you don't have to
compete with Jackie Chan

960
01:29:02,065 --> 01:29:06,502
No, I am challenging myself

961
01:29:10,007 --> 01:29:17,379
I can make it. But... if I mess up

962
01:29:18,782 --> 01:29:20,545
there is no take 2

963
01:29:23,554 --> 01:29:27,012
Kenichi, leave me alone

964
01:29:28,592 --> 01:29:31,652
We can start 15 minutes later

965
01:29:42,906 --> 01:29:46,034
Director, he is ready

966
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,747
Ready

967
01:29:51,848 --> 01:29:53,577
Cam 1 ready

968
01:29:54,351 --> 01:29:55,784
Cam 2 ready

969
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,619
Cam 3 ready

970
01:29:59,456 --> 01:30:06,726
Daijiro, remember, in your mother's heart,
you are taller than Mt. Fuji

971
01:30:15,205 --> 01:30:17,765
Rolling

972
01:30:19,076 --> 01:30:20,065
Speeding

973
01:30:22,879 --> 01:30:24,039
Action!

974
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,232
Cut!

975
01:31:04,354 --> 01:31:08,256
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

976
01:31:08,358 --> 01:31:09,985
I am fine!

977
01:31:11,561 --> 01:31:14,860
You've got guts! From now on
you are the #1 stuntman

978
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:17,229
Thank you

979
01:31:19,269 --> 01:31:21,760
You are great

980
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:25,034
I did it! I did it!

981
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:26,473
You did it

982
01:32:03,146 --> 01:32:05,205
Bald head, release Ching

983
01:32:08,118 --> 01:32:12,851
This is not enough! Where is the interest?
I will let her go if you pay up

984
01:32:13,156 --> 01:32:14,521
What the hell did you say?

985
01:32:14,624 --> 01:32:17,889
Just give me $100,000 more
then I will let her go

986
01:32:22,699 --> 01:32:26,567
Do you know who I am?

987
01:32:26,737 --> 01:32:28,728
I am a Japanese gangster

988
01:32:29,506 --> 01:32:33,203
You too?! $8,000 will do then

989
01:32:33,543 --> 01:32:34,737
Damn you!

990
01:32:35,812 --> 01:32:37,780
You do act like it

991
01:32:38,448 --> 01:32:42,748
I remember you.
You are the one who acts in TV series

992
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,846
Okay, okay

993
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:35,066
Little fool, it's quick, but you can't hurt me

994
01:33:41,778 --> 01:33:43,871
So dirty

995
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,228
Police! Open the door

996
01:34:06,069 --> 01:34:07,696
Police!

997
01:34:18,915 --> 01:34:19,904
You are late

998
01:34:20,016 --> 01:34:21,176
Is that so?

999
01:34:21,284 --> 01:34:23,582
Are you taking drugs, or are you fighting?

1000
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:25,314
No, just having a party

1001
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:48,469
Shut up, I will hit you

1002
01:34:58,989 --> 01:35:02,254
Good friend, I am warning you

1003
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:05,226
Don't let me catch you
doing something wrong

1004
01:35:06,963 --> 01:35:10,023
Sir, we have arrested
an illegal immigrant outside

1005
01:35:10,133 --> 01:35:12,863
Sir, she is my wife

1006
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:15,696
Shut up, bring all to the police station

1007
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:33,817
Ching...

1008
01:35:34,257 --> 01:35:35,485
Daijiro...

1009
01:35:35,592 --> 01:35:38,857
Ching, how come you are here?

1010
01:35:38,962 --> 01:35:40,088
Daijiro

1011
01:35:40,196 --> 01:35:43,757
Ching... Why don't you come over here?
Let her come over here

1012
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:47,359
Daijiro. Listen,

1013
01:35:48,772 --> 01:35:58,443
thanks for everything
you have done for me

1014
01:35:59,015 --> 01:36:00,539
Understand?

1015
01:36:02,218 --> 01:36:05,187
I really...

1016
01:36:06,856 --> 01:36:10,622
like you

1017
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:15,157
Understand

1018
01:36:15,699 --> 01:36:22,195
That day when you left me,
I understood

1019
01:36:22,806 --> 01:36:30,008
Ching, I... I don't like you

1020
01:36:31,014 --> 01:36:35,474
I love you!

1021
01:36:38,355 --> 01:36:39,720
I will see you again

1022
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:41,050
What?

1023
01:36:41,191 --> 01:36:42,658
I will see you again

1024
01:36:43,026 --> 01:36:44,254
What?

1025
01:36:45,295 --> 01:36:49,994
I will see you again

1026
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:55,766
I will see you again...

1027
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:13,214
You can go now

1028
01:37:53,563 --> 01:37:57,522
Miss, let me drive you home!
