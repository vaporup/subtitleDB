1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,664
Hey, your heart!

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,389
I'll give you this...

3
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,959
Help yourself!

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,500
H-Hot, hot, hot!

5
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,443
Mother fucker!

6
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,659
I'll show you the world beyond death...

7
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,271
What's wrong?

8
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,974
We should hurry!

9
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,646
What's going on?

10
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,782
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,642
I'll tell you something...

12
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,618
I hate to turn my back.

13
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,087
We don't have time for this.

14
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,050
That man is dangerous...

15
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,722
Who the hell is he?

16
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:10,886
You know him, right?

17
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,123
He's...

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,967
Cut the crap already!

19
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,361
I don't know him at all!

20
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,102
Who the hell is he?

21
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,536
And who are you?

22
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,739
What does this have to do with me?

23
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:27,311
Because...

24
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,438
Say it!

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,550
It is your...

26
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,457
...destiny.

27
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,719
What?

28
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,124
You two are...

29
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,397
...destined to fight each other.

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,199
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,067
I've never even met him before.

32
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,639
You have...

33
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,211
What?

34
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,960
The Resurrection...

35
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,625
Stay back.

36
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,428
We'll talk later.

37
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,522
It's time.

38
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,917
You said something
about Resurrection...

39
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,388
What were you talking about?

40
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,160
The power of returning the
dead soul back to the body.

41
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,196
It can be used only in
the Forest of Resurrection.

42
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,935
Now what?

43
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,008
The Forest of Resurrection...

44
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,642
Is where we are.

45
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,378
I don't understand.

46
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,379
It's him...

47
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,182
...he is resurrecting the dead...

48
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,188
...with the Power.

49
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,297
What are you talking about?

50
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,968
What Resurrection?

51
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,037
I was able to kill them.

52
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,501
That's because...

53
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,901
Who's that?

54
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,212
Is this one dead too?

55
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,786
No, that girl's alive.

56
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,368
Hey, what are you?

57
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:33,738
Hey!

58
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:54,956
Please, no killing!

59
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,154
Because...

60
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,297
I thought you were going to lose.

61
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,097
You know what?

62
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,866
I never lose.

63
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:43,850
Hot, hot!

64
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,186
What the hell?

65
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,308
Stop.

66
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,314
Huh?

67
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,749
They're around here...

68
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,683
What?

69
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,480
I can smell...

70
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,550
Smell?

71
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,948
I can smell like a dog...

72
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,756
Like a top dog breeder.

73
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,724
Like a dog breeder?

74
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,694
I smell...

75
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,373
Look.

76
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,737
An escapee.

77
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,674
We have your death warrant!

78
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,382
Go!

79
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,678
Die!

80
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,636
What?

81
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,441
Dammit...

82
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,274
T-This way!

83
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,140
No, this way...

84
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,482
Wait, this way!

85
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,456
Bitch!

86
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,693
W-Wait a minute!

87
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,399
You're not a monster...

88
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,535
You are not a monster...

89
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,733
Let me talk, bitch!

90
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,672
Speak.

91
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,975
You're not a monster yet, right?

92
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,973
Neither are you, right?

93
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,315
W-Wait a minute!

94
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,683
Don't misunderstand me!

95
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,048
I was just taken here...

96
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:06,387
Bitch!

97
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,622
It seems like...

98
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,661
...we are the only survivors...

99
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,529
...Baby.

100
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,075
What's going on?

101
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,799
I don't know...

102
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,903
But we need to get
out of here, that's for sure.

103
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,581
Hey, you want to come with me?

104
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,344
Why would I?

105
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,814
I know this forest very well.

106
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,585
I'd be a big help.

107
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,055
That's a good point.

108
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:42,589
However...

109
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,824
One wrong move...

110
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,231
...and you're dead.

111
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,661
I know that.

112
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:54,798
You...

113
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,025
You've changed.

114
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,266
Get up.

115
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,770
Hey...

116
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,604
You really don't remember anything?

117
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,579
What the hell are you talking about?

118
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,108
About me...

119
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,912
Don't you remember?

120
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,954
I've never seen you before.

121
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,947
Why...

122
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,855
Why did you help me then?

123
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,592
I told you.

124
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,595
I didn't mean to help.

125
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,694
You came after me...

126
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,591
...and you saved me.

127
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,969
You said
something about my destiny...

128
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,270
What is going on?

129
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,133
I will tell you.

130
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,470
It's you...

131
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,116
You're still alive.

132
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,242
Impressive.

133
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,547
So, you caused all of this.

134
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,189
I knew you could
survive no matter what.

135
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,959
I don't know you at all.

136
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,758
What do you want?

137
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,125
It's fine that you don't know
me, because your soul does...

138
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,228
You're making things complicated.

139
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,697
What are you up to?

140
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,035
It's time.

141
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,602
Give me the girl and come with me.

142
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,966
Don't be stupid.

143
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,279
Hey, hey, what are
you two talking about?

144
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,840
I don't like this at all.

145
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,650
This guy doesn't remember anything?

146
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,750
Really?

147
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,781
Leave us alone.

148
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,858
I can't do that.

149
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,287
I've waited...

150
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,927
Are you going to tell
me what you're up to?

151
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,195
He wants me dead.

152
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:07,901
What?

153
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,841
I'll grant you power.

154
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,406
Why don't you come with me?

155
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,537
I'll take care of her later.

156
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,063
Let's talk now.

157
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,236
What's going on?

158
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,308
The girl's blood gives me power.

159
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,482
This is the Forest of Resurrection.

160
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,050
A Gate...

161
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,658
A portal to the other side...

162
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,256
Where the dead become zombies...

163
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,595
That was a joke.

164
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,837
That was nothing
compared to the real power.

165
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,171
A great power is hidden in this forest.

166
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,447
The darkness on the other side...

167
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,855
You need two keys
to open the gate there...

168
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,963
One is a human sacrifice.

169
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,857
And the other key is...

170
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,299
...the one with blood of Resurrection.

171
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,432
I found them...

172
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,437
Five hundred years ago.

173
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,808
You're totally insane.

174
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,044
Just shut up and come with me.

175
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,415
I'll show you...

176
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,846
...the power of darkness.

177
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,818
You know what?

178
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,417
I hate being told what to do.

179
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:18,971
It's no use.

180
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,795
You can't kill me.

181
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,602
So just shut up and
listen to what I have to say.

182
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,335
I don't want to listen.

183
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,379
Because you interrupted me...

184
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,710
...I had to wait five hundred
years for her to reincarnate.

185
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,184
It's been a long time.

186
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,484
But it's okay.

187
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,484
I forgive you.

188
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,868
I've waited for her to
reincarnate and mature.

189
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,509
I've been waiting for today.

190
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,983
The power of the Forest of
Resurrection and her matured blood...

191
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,515
...will open the gate to the other side.

192
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,829
I finally found you, but you were in jail.

193
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,861
I never expected you to be in jail.

194
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,296
And what's more...

195
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,196
You were serving a life term as a serious
criminal who committed disturbing crimes.

196
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,735
Why...

197
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,468
Did you make me come here?

198
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,210
I like you better as a criminal now.

199
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,178
You used to be an awful man...

200
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:42,949
You believed in this stupid idea of
justice, and you really made me suffer.

201
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,885
In the end, you did
something really stupid.

202
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,511
But you've changed quite a bit.

203
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,385
That's why I brought you here.

204
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,920
I'll forgive what you've done in the past.

205
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,324
Don't let me down this time.

206
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,431
Why don't you get lost?

207
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,960
You now have the
heart of a serious criminal.

208
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,074
How many people
have you killed so far?

209
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,370
Forty three people as of today...

210
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,736
That's my little brother.

211
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:42,808
Brother?

212
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,244
Do you feel that?

213
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,452
The power of this forest...

214
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,783
People are born...

215
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,057
...live...

216
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,224
...and die.

217
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,427
The darkness after death...

218
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,369
...is what's real...

219
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,378
I'm going to open that door.

220
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,208
Come with me.

221
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,923
Follow your instincts.

222
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,789
What your heart really wants...

223
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,930
...is darkness.

224
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,445
I'd rather die than live with you.

225
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,619
Then die.

226
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,930
As I planned...

227
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,204
Get the girl.

228
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,252
I'd rather die than let you touch me.

229
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,058
I'd rather die!

230
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,092
Still a bitch...

231
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,469
That man could never save you.

232
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,173
Not the last time.

233
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,175
And not this time.

234
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,382
You've finished playing your role.

235
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,955
It looks like you'll never grow up.

236
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,558
I've waited...

237
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,287
The Forest of Resurrection...

238
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,331
I've returned here after so many years...

239
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,033
...so open the gate in
exchange for her blood.

240
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,507
And grant me power...

241
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,681
Grant me the power!

242
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,012
Why?

243
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,676
How come nothing is happening?

244
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,189
Why is nothing happening?

245
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,944
My blood of Resurrection...

246
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,787
...only works once.

247
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,292
I've already used it.

248
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,761
Can you wait until I reincarnate...

249
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,767
...again?

250
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,506
You...

251
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,374
I'll kill you!

252
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,389
You wanted me to kill you
in a moment of anger, right?

253
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,728
However, you can't fool me.

254
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,497
I won't let you interfere with my plan.

255
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,963
Your blood is not good enough.

256
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,539
Your blood cannot open the gate.

257
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,838
Your blood is not enough!

258
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,313
You know why?

259
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,713
Figured it out yet?

260
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,254
Do you know why
I brought that man here?

261
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,686
That's right...

262
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,166
He was able to
resurrect with your blood.

263
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,228
That man's
resurrected blood is the true key.

264
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,620
I wanted to see that
expression on your face.

265
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,857
That face...

266
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,763
Hey.

267
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,073
You talk too much.

268
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:18,910
Here he comes...

269
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,909
...the last key.

270
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,654
It took me a while to remember.

271
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,730
I'm the one you want, right?

272
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,941
Don't touch my girl, fucking asshole!

273
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,919
You want to do it now?

274
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,351
Or...

275
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,052
Do you want to play?

276
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:58,981
Wait for me...

277
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,018
Don't worry.

278
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,317
I never lose.

279
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,725
Stay there.

280
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,697
Wait here.

281
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,897
This is between him and me.

282
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,674
One of us will return.

283
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:12,148
He's different now.

284
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,145
You might lose this time.

285
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,251
Maybe...

286
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,093
We'll see what happens...

287
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,539
You have to work
for what you really want.

288
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,576
Right?

289
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,252
Freeze...

290
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,760
Freeze...

291
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,694
I said, freeze!

292
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,567
Leave the car.

293
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,102
What was that?

294
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,677
What did you say,
what did you say, you runt?

295
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,715
I said, we're taking your car!

296
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,012
We are looking for escapees!

297
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,949
Out of my way!

298
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:23,981
So you are a Fighter.

299
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,421
I can tell.

300
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,821
Give me the car, that's all I'm saying!

301
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,793
Shut up, you asshole!

302
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,222
I'm sick of this place.

303
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:36,990
I'm really sorry.

304
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,569
You short-ass bitch!

305
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,877
Come on, get in the car!

306
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,323
T-That hurt!

307
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:16,974
Hey, let's go!

308
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,464
That was your partner!

309
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:13,096
That was not my fault!

310
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,694
Hey!

311
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:11,499
I've found you!

312
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,739
Prisoner number KSC2-303!

313
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,271
Give me my right hand back!

314
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,299
Hey, I'd have two left hands!

315
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,209
You can't hit me with your slow bullets!

316
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,588
My reflexes are...

317
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,690
...five hundred times
faster than Mike Tyson's!

318
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:04,192
Come on!

319
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:08,498
Oops!

320
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,138
Just like last time...

321
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:47,235
No matter how much power
you've gained, you can't beat me.

322
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,682
The darkside has chosen me.

323
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,546
I won't let you stand in my way.

324
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,140
I told you...

325
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,914
I never lose.

326
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,046
Listen...

327
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,015
What?

328
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:12,713
You came back...

329
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:18,794
...because of the forest and my blood.

330
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,131
If you leave this forest...

331
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:28,501
You might die.

332
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,304
Maybe...

333
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,638
But that's fine...

334
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:39,946
We'll see what happens.

335
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,616
I hate to be locked up in one place.

336
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,703
I should have been on your side.

337
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:02,653
There's nothing left
to destroy in this world.

338
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,563
Hurry up and take
me to the other side...

339
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:11,898
...brother.
