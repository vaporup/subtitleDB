1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,437
There are 666 portals that
connect this world to the other side.

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,603
These are concealed
from all human beings.

3
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,704
But there are some
who notice their existence.

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,113
And some are willing to open the door
and try to gain the power of darkness...

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,982
Somewhere in Japan exists
the 444th portal, known as...

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,554
The Forest of Resurrection.

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,089
It was a long time ago when the
evil soul uncovered its existence...

8
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,896
This way.

9
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,037
You better be right.

10
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,508
It's okay.

11
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,838
Just trust me.

12
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,259
Where are they?

13
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,066
Don't worry, they're coming.

14
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,839
I'm not worried.

15
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,874
I just don't trust you.

16
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,604
Do as you please then.

17
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,572
It's quite a big deal for a pick-up, isn't it?

18
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,130
Where's the other car?

19
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,980
We gotta wait for him.

20
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,516
Then we'll leave.

21
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,020
Are you serious?

22
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,053
It's not safe here.

23
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,091
It doesn't matter.

24
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,692
We have specific orders from him.

25
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:13,788
Look, the roads
could be blocked by now.

26
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,791
We gotta go!

27
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,131
What about roadblocks?

28
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,568
That's not our concern.

29
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,171
Hey, you...

30
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,471
Shut up, what the hell
are we doing here anyway?

31
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,305
No, you shut up.

32
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,236
An order is an order, stop whining.

33
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,477
To hell with those orders!

34
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,785
Do you know what we
had to go through for this?

35
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,390
Besides, this place
gives me the creeps.

36
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,852
Don't bother.

37
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,889
These assholes can't do
anything but follow orders.

38
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,266
What?

39
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,037
On your way to a party?

40
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,263
Or are you trying to
promote hoodlums?

41
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,169
You...

42
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,708
Better watch your mouth.

43
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,070
After all this running around...

44
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,212
...all we get is a
useless bunch of punks.

45
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,643
Count me out.

46
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,649
I see.

47
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,320
So, shall I give you some time to rest?

48
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,990
Like forever?

49
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,352
Stop!

50
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,959
We were also ordered
to keep this guy alive.

51
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,360
Shut up, come on, come on, come on!

52
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,969
I don't understand
why this one is so special.

53
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,364
But you have to
follow orders, too, right?

54
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,769
Don't be so nosy.

55
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,378
Wait a minute!

56
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,478
Calm down, all right?

57
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,415
You'd better be quiet, too.

58
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,274
Don't be so tense.

59
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,320
Fighting wouldn't do
any good here, right?

60
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,320
That goes for you, too.

61
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,154
We'll let you get out of here
when he comes, so be patient.

62
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,522
You know what?

63
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,989
I really hate waiting.

64
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,126
Stop it for now, it's not a good time.

65
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,706
That's right...

66
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,370
There's still...

67
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,375
After he gets here...

68
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,720
We'd better get out of here quick.

69
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,614
No matter how many times
we come here, I hate this place.

70
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,553
It's ominous.

71
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,465
A forest to the southwest
is an ominous feng shui sign.

72
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,401
Oh, really?

73
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,361
Meeting with you
guys is ominous enough.

74
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,767
I told you to shut up.

75
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,001
Don't start again!

76
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,034
Hey!

77
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,309
Bring the girl.

78
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,706
Hey, what's with this girl?

79
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,478
Who knows?

80
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,253
The order was to kidnap
her and bring her here with us.

81
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,251
One stupid girl and one asshole...

82
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,827
What the hell is he
planning to do with those two?

83
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,625
I don't have the slightest
idea what he is thinking!

84
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,066
Hey, come on.

85
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,099
He must have some plan.

86
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,364
Hey, wait.

87
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm taking no part in kidnapping.

88
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,434
What?

89
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,874
What did you say?

90
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,307
Five men on one girl,
you must be proud of yourself.

91
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,051
Hey, let her go and take off your toupee.

92
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,817
Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,424
Do you know who you're talking to?

94
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,629
Perhaps you're misunderstanding
the situation, hmm?

95
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,993
A crook like you could be spending the
rest of your life in jail if we weren't here.

96
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,532
So just shut your smart ass mouth up!

97
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,831
Here's the thing, I'm a feminist.

98
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,037
What're you gonna do about it?

99
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,548
Hey you, let her go now.

100
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,081
Watch it.

101
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,747
I'm telling you,
you should just let her go now.

102
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,658
Hey, are you crazy or what?

103
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,794
Don't make me tell you again.

104
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,068
Let her go right now,
or you'll pay for it later.

105
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,505
So what are you going
to do now, tough guy?

106
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,258
Where did they go?

107
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,099
It's scary here.

108
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,770
I'll kill that guy.

109
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,038
No, you shouldn't do that.

110
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,644
If you do, he'll become
a monster like them.

111
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,218
I don't get it...

112
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,013
You know what?

113
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,586
Then I can kill the bastard twice.

114
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,216
That's nonsense.

115
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,219
This is not good, let's get out of here.

116
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,923
Don't be stupid,
we can't let them get away!

117
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,834
We have bigger problems, don't we?

118
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,598
Look, this is your fault, isn't it?

119
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,434
It's not just that, think about it.

120
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,907
Thinking isn't going to do a bit of good.

121
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,210
They were not dead...

122
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,806
This can't be happening.

123
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,851
We'd better catch
them before he gets here.

124
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,927
Yeah...

125
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,989
You're right.

126
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,902
Why did you do that?

127
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,438
You didn't have to kill that man.

128
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,871
What's your problem?

129
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,009
If you did something like that,
you're no different from those men.

130
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,510
They're bastards, I'm not.

131
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,952
I'm sorry...

132
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,493
Thanks for helping me.

133
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,297
I didn't mean to help you.

134
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,397
They just piss me off.

135
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,531
So, what are we gonna do?

136
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,878
Didn't you have a plan?

137
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,250
Plans always change.

138
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,919
What are you talking about?

139
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,385
They're going to kill us!

140
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,731
But they were...

141
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,203
...definitely dead.

142
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:13,776
Hey.

143
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,621
So, why were you in jail?

144
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,928
Shut up, let's go.

145
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,146
Something's not right with this forest.

146
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,219
Like what?

147
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,021
People are everywhere...

148
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,719
...but you can't hear a thing.

149
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,929
Nobody's here.

150
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,201
Yes, they are.

151
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,144
What makes you think that?

152
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,985
I've had a strong sixth
sense ever since I was little.

153
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,976
Hey.

154
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:57,946
Hey...

155
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,780
Wait.

156
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,486
What's wrong with you?

157
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,123
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

158
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,666
Stay back.

159
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,136
This man...

160
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,401
What are you doing?

161
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,804
Hey, stop!

162
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,513
Don't do that!

163
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,215
Hey, wait!

164
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,280
Let that man rest in peace!

165
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,251
I don't believe this...

166
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,453
You're crazy.

167
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,270
Let's go.

168
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,068
We'll take their car.

169
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,567
Stop it!

170
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,438
Let's just go.

171
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,349
They must still be around here.

172
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,357
Something's wrong here.

173
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:41,932
That again?

174
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,500
I can feel it!

175
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,135
Those guys back there...

176
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,403
There is something here!

177
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,109
Hey...

178
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,579
What?

179
00:26:58,883 --> 00:26:59,679
They were...

180
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,309
...definitely dead...

181
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,452
...but they came back to life.

182
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,853
So what?

183
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,287
The dead can come back to life here.

184
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,327
So, what are you saying?

185
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,459
We've...

186
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,025
...been here over and over...

187
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,399
And...

188
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,565
The ones we killed...

189
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,600
We buried them!

190
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,640
They are supposed
to be buried right here!

191
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,115
Where the fuck are they now?

192
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,425
Where are they?

193
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,246
I didn't mean to...

194
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,481
I just...

195
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,452
Come!

196
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,654
Let go of me!

197
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,418
The game is over.

198
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,956
What are those monsters?

199
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,123
I thought they were your playmates.

200
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,856
So, do you want me to kill you?

201
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,426
Then you can be my next playmate!

202
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,433
Don't kill this one!

203
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,758
You have orders!

204
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:59,069
Hey, you've got the wrong man.

205
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,310
I don't care.

206
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,073
Just let the guy go.

207
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,539
That's why you're
nothing more than a punk.

208
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,354
Wow.

209
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,127
This is getting complicated.

210
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,122
Hey, she's been taken away.

211
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,030
Huh?

212
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,433
What are you talking about?

213
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,336
That runt shot my arm and took the girl.

214
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,370
Jesus, the both of you!

215
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,309
You're both crazy!

216
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,013
Are you turning back now?

217
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,380
I'll play with you later.

218
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:47,881
So, just wait here.

219
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,827
You just let him go?

220
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,769
I'm disappointed in you.

221
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,869
Don't you get it?

222
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,003
It'll be easier if we let
that guy find the girl for us.

223
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,070
Huh?

224
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,480
We'll get them both
after they're together.

225
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,812
Now I see!

226
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,222
You're using your brain!

227
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,592
Keep both of them alive...

228
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,057
Those were his orders exactly.

229
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,297
Oh, too bad.

230
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,733
It doesn't matter anymore.

231
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,246
He's going to die anyway.

232
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,578
I'll be in charge from now on.

233
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,082
What?

234
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:53,350
It's all been planned,
he's just coming here to die.

235
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,583
Don't fool with me!

236
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,494
What was that?

237
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,421
It'd be a pain in the ass
if you became a monster...

238
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,352
...so die slowly.

239
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,020
Are you okay?

240
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,095
Yeah...

241
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,091
But this place is fucked up.

242
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,337
Nothing can stop me...

243
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,806
Not even those monsters...

244
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,036
Don't worry.

245
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,155
Come on, run faster!

246
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,261
Bastards...

247
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,834
Are you okay?

248
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,136
It hurts...

249
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,540
Hey...

250
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,135
Your hand!

251
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,880
They took it...

252
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,784
Those bastards!

253
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:29,944
Damn it!

254
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,249
We'll make them pay for this.

255
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,187
Shouldn't we report back?

256
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,258
No...

257
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,991
We'll search for them...

258
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,885
...and destroy them!

259
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,725
But...

260
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,389
We don't know where they are.

261
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,157
I know what they're thinking.

262
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,870
They must have taken the mountain
paths instead of going down the highway.

263
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,141
I was trained at FBI
headquarters in Langley.

264
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,372
I'm an expert at profiling.

265
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,640
An expert?

266
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,776
So, Expert, where in the mountains?

267
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,517
Don't worry.

268
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,778
I'll track them down.

269
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,383
I grew up at Yellowstone
National Park in Canada.

270
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,955
A natural born hunter!

271
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,119
A hunter?

272
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,124
Which way?

273
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:16,665
No!

274
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:17,791
Shut the fuck up!

275
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,362
What's wrong with this place?

276
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,699
He'll come after us.

277
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,363
Let me go!

278
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,600
This is so insane.

279
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,715
You...

280
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,075
You did all this?

281
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,417
It's all your fault!

282
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:37,985
Stop...

283
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,120
You're crazy...

284
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:41,919
Hey.

285
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:47,787
No!

286
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,858
What do you want?

287
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,066
You don't have to kill this one.

288
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,205
Shut up, don't preach at me.

289
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,210
You can't hurt people for no reason.

290
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,741
In the world these days, a lot
of people are better off dead.

291
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,677
That's not for you to judge.

292
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,618
What are you, a preacher?

293
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,620
Okay, fine.

294
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:17,557
Let's go.

295
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,696
Look, no more killing, okay?

296
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,641
We've been waiting.

297
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,509
Since you three are here...

298
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,250
...it'll all be over soon, right?

299
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,694
M-My gun...

300
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,805
Hey, who the hell are you?

301
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,902
How did you get here?

302
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,870
I was kidnapped...

303
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,417
What?

304
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,552
I can't remember.

305
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:55,787
Huh?

306
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,488
I can't remember
anything about what happened...

307
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,797
...before I got here.

308
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,896
What the hell are you talking about?

309
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,095
How about you?

310
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,303
Why were you in prison?

311
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,237
I was...

312
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,678
What?

313
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,576
You don't remember either?

314
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,513
I forget things easily.

315
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,447
So, you too...

316
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,506
When did you get here?

317
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,740
Just now.

318
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,880
What the hell was with those
two idiots and all the monsters?

319
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,087
What are you up to?

320
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,022
Something bad.

321
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,294
Where are the others?

322
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,967
They're all dead except us.

323
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,235
I see.

324
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,302
And why are you alive?

325
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,434
Got a problem?

326
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,104
Yeah, you.

327
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,000
A scumbag like you should be dead.

328
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,147
Well, well, well,
who are these scary people?

329
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,284
What's going on?

330
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,125
You're dead.

331
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,507
No, let's get away from here.

332
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,507
That was pretty good, boys and girls.

333
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,452
But not good enough.

334
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:04,805
Hey, baby.

335
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,957
You...

336
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,497
What are you?

337
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,997
If you want to kill me...

338
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,874
...you'll need to bring an army.

339
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,300
Bastard!

340
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,477
I'll give you power...

341
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,087
...in death!

342
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:11,469
It's him!

343
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,283
No, we have to go!

344
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,984
No, he is...

345
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,319
Please, let's go!

346
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,188
Hurry!

347
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:07,794
Hurts?

348
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,755
Human life is only an instant.

349
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,759
Your body will eventually rot.

350
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,501
Do you want to be dead?

351
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,781
Or eternal life?

352
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,961
Eternal...

353
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,373
Any trouble?

354
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,245
Yes, a little accident.

355
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,784
Are you okay, officer?

356
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,889
Don't call me officer.

357
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,968
Did you do it again?

358
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,066
You better behave yourself.

359
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,645
Or, you'll be joining
those idiots on the mountain...

360
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,172
...officer.

361
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,449
You want to fight me?

362
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,353
The master of all martial arts?

363
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:45,250
The Fighter?

364
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,789
Okay, Fighter.

365
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:48,988
Fighter?

366
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,991
We don't have time for this crap.

367
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,991
Those criminal bastards!

368
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,956
Let's kill them all!

369
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,833
Right, Fighter.
