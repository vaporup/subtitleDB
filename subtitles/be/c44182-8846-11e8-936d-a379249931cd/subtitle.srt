1
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,033
In 1945 the United States dropped
the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,228
In 1964 America
became involved in the Vietnam War.

3
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,917
In 1976 America launched
the first space shuttle.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,959
And brought it back
to Earth successfully.

5
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,397
In 1983 Britain went to war with
Argentina over the Falkland Islands,

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,314
unleashing the horror
of missile warfare.

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,833
However, none of these has anything
to do with the story that follows.

8
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,318
Executive Producer: Cho Yan-yuk

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,357
Produced by: Sammo Hung Kam-po

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,631
Line Producers: Chen Chi-wai,
Wong Pin-yiu

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,239
Assistant Producers: Cho Ken-nan,
Cheung Chi-leng

12
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,759
Director: Sammo Hung Kam-po

13
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,751
Hey!

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,679
- Give me a hand.
- Morning, Brother.

15
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,278
I cook breakfast
every Wednesday morning.

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,237
But it'll be your job from tomorrow.

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,154
So you better find out
what they like. Know what I mean?

18
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,677
- What about drinks?
- They all like Pepsi Cola! Here.

19
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,515
- Good morning.
- Morning.

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,838
Who wants to challenge me?

21
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,234
- We all will.
- Yeah! Let's see how good you are.

22
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,950
- Yeah.
- Sure.

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,074
Watch it!

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,474
You're soaking me!

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,189
Watch what you say
in front of those guys, understand?

26
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,679
I see what you mean now.

27
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,751
- Did you hear the door?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,512
Open the door, then!

29
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,350
Hi, Barbara.
Nice to see you. Come in.

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,112
- Fellows, look who's here.
- Barbara, how are you?

31
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,078
Breakfast? Aren't you ready yet?

32
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,879
- Ready for what?
- Going to Pattaya!

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,679
When I phoned I told you,
we're leaving one day earlier.

34
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,673
- Phone call?
- Sure, Herbert took the call.

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,429
What? I didn't want you to go.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,557
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I want you to stay with me today.

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,389
If you can get ready in five minutes,
maybe we can still make it.

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,759
Wait for me!

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,629
Barbara. See you soon?

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,234
Easy.

41
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,029
Hello, I'm your guide on this tour
and my name is Larry!

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,156
Nice to meet you.

43
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,276
Thank you for joining our tour.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,476
Now we're going to
Pattaya beach resort.

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,358
We'll be arriving there
in about two hours.

46
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,553
Oh, no!
Two hours before we get there?!

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,630
So we'll have to put up
with his gibberish for two hours.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,869
He's very boring!

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,552
We can play games with you!

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,513
Do you want to play hide-and-seek
on this bus?

51
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,828
Juveniles.

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,595
Don't forget your bags!
We get off here.

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,390
Here we are. This way!

54
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,636
- It's gorgeous!
- Let's go swimming!

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,675
Yeah!

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,348
- Can you swim?
- Over there, come on.

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,159
- Swimming? Let's follow them!
- Let's go.

58
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,513
I'll put some cream on you.

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,513
- Fast Buck.
- Hi!

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,033
You can do it.

61
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,959
Come on!

62
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,517
- Do they think I'm your girlfriend?
- I guess so.

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,989
Let me confess how I feel about you.

64
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,038
Rawhide told me -
love's such a special emotion.

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,156
Love is the ultimate feeling.

66
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,434
Fast Buck...

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,279
I've never loved you.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,833
And I never will.

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,716
This is how I feel about you.

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,879
Last time I wanted you...

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,119
to come with me
to save Muscles's life.

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,673
That was why
I said I admired you a lot.

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,757
I am sorry for...

74
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,712
giving you the wrong hint.

75
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,548
I shouldn't have said
those things to you.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,670
I hope you can forgive me for this.

77
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,592
Don't take it too hard.

78
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,750
We can still be friends.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,916
Fast Buck?

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,756
How do girls rate men
who dig a tunnel to chat them up?

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,152
We've made it! We're there,
Come on, hurry!

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,515
Are you sure
we're going the right way?

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,434
Of course! I can even feel
their body heat through the sand!

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,638
If it wasn't for you, I would've
had them in my arms already. Quiet!

85
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,234
I'll keep quiet. Sorry!

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,156
I'll give all of you
a taste of how I feel.

87
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,751
It's an earthquake.

88
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,914
- It's an earthquake!
- Why did it collapse?

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,274
Sorry!

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,831
What are you doing?

91
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,918
You fat louse,
you always ruin everything!

92
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,954
Hi! Having a good time,
you big spenders?

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,153
We ain't big spenders.

94
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,716
I told the girls
you're high rollers!

95
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,789
Why?

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,237
Those girls want to know about you.
I told them you're rich businessmen.

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,108
- Yeah, you're right.
- Well, we better be loaded.

98
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,113
- What are you talking about?
- We must be rich to pay the bill!

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,590
Shut up, you stupid boy.
Sandy, put a sock in his mouth.

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,478
- Hi.
- Please sit down.

101
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,391
We scored.

102
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,795
What do you mean?

103
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,433
The Dow-Jones rose and there's
a new share issue, so we scored.

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,273
- Did you make any money?
- No, we've got no shares.

105
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,476
- Order food!
- Right, order some.

106
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,109
You get some, we've eaten already.
But the food here's no good.

107
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
You might have had enough,
but we haven't.

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,753
Order anything you like -
the seafood's really good here.

109
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,634
So that guy falls down.

110
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,354
It's really funny.

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,000
- Miss, we...
- Tell us more jokes, come on.

112
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,513
Are you sure?

113
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,477
- I really like yourjokes.
- Come on.

114
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,913
OK, I'll continue.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,230
Roundhead,
I want a word with you first.

116
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,754
Let me grope her when she laughs.

117
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,718
Try this, a boy and his girlfriend
are in the park one evening,

118
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,597
the boy looks very sad.

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,592
The girl says "why so sad?
Let me make you happy."

120
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,477
He replies "how?"

121
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,917
She whispers "with one hand
I can make you extremely happy."

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,389
He thinks a while and says "no".

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,708
So the girl says

124
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,191
"maybe with both hands I can
make you forget your troubles."

125
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,397
So the boy thinks again
and says "better not."

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,119
So she says,
"I'm sure I can make you happy

127
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,953
"with both hands
and my tongue together."

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,755
He can't say no to that
and she goes like...

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,838
- You're hurting me.
- So what!

130
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,876
- Your turn now.
- I can't tell jokes!

131
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,916
You don't get off that easily.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,753
Come on,
it's your turn to tell jokes.

133
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,116
- I want you to tell us a joke, now!
- OK, I'll try.

134
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,397
There's a girl called Joan of Arc
disguises herself and goes to war.

135
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,515
That's it.

136
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,158
It's not funny at all.

137
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,194
- Jokes are supposed to be funny.
- I don't know any!

138
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,840
Come on, tell us a joke,
or I'll break your legs.

139
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,631
He's crying, he can't tell jokes.
Let me tell you a joke.

140
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,190
Let's hear it, but remember,
it must be short and funny.

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,319
This dumb guy goes on his first date
and forgets his pants.

142
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,231
I knew you were going to do that.

143
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,759
- Right, pay up, we're going.
- Let's go to the disco.

144
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,389
No way! We know your game,
you've been groping us all night.

145
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,675
Dancing with you? Forget it.

146
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,230
She's right. Thanks
for the lobster, and the jokes.

147
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,874
- We better go.
- Yeah, while we're still friends.

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,839
Don't leave just yet!

149
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,629
- Who's gonna pay the bill?
- It's not my fault they left!

150
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,837
- It is your fault! I'll beat you up.
- It's your fault.

151
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,832
- Stop!
- Come back here! You little...

152
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,909
Sir!

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,754
- Did you find the soothsayer?
- Yes, sir. We'll meet you at 6 a.m.

154
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,795
Good!

155
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,713
- Your bill, sir.
- He'll pay.

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,437
- That guy over there.
- Thank you.

157
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,956
This is it.
You'll have to go in yourself.

158
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,758
Who's gonna be my interpreter?

159
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,957
He speaks your language
better than you.

160
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,873
- So be careful with what you say.
- Rubbish!

161
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,672
- Good luck.
- You wait here for me!

162
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
- That depends.
- Depends on what?

163
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,991
It'll depend on what happens.

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,550
If he puts a curse on you,
you'll be bleeding non-stop.

165
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,517
And my boat will be gone.

166
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,798
Sir, your magic's great
and I wish to learn.

167
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,189
- I...
- Cut it out. Cash first.

168
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,198
It's foreign currency,
but it's just as good.

169
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,999
All money is good, only men are bad.

170
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,753
But there is good or bad magic.

171
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,073
- Which one would you like to learn?
- What's the difference?

172
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,435
Good magic helps folks.
Bad magic's the opposite.

173
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,149
- I'll learn bad magic, then.
- Good. A wise choice.

174
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,878
I'm fresh out of good magic.

175
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,520
Tell me,
why do you wanna learn magic?

176
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,358
I'd say you would use it
to pick up women.

177
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,351
Right, and their money, too!

178
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,158
At least you're honest.

179
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,396
I can tell just by looking at you.

180
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,638
- But how do you know that?
- This is what they say -

181
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,996
he who is blind is cunning,
he who is deaf is evil.

182
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,752
I don't fit in either of them.

183
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,753
I haven't finished,
he who is skinny is pretentious,

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,798
he who has long chin is randy.

185
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,316
So I'd say you are
a two-timing lecher.

186
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,749
OK.

187
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,193
Shirt off.

188
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,033
Compose your thoughts,
cover your waist,

189
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,998
keep your eyes to the front
and hold your breath.

190
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,832
What? Stop breathing?

191
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,676
Woman, get ready.

192
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,836
Get up, it's over.

193
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,035
- That was quick.
- It's not like the old days now.

194
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,631
Now, think of any woman
that you desire,

195
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,235
then stick the pin in the doll,
say "two hearts in one,"

196
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,390
and she'll give herself to you.

197
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,312
Are you sure? Will it work?

198
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,278
You can try it now. Woman!

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,235
Two hearts in one,
two hearts in one...

200
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,354
- Who were you thinking of?
- You, of course.

201
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,919
What? Are you gay?

202
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,756
No way - I wanna see if it works!

203
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,592
You mean you don't trust me?

204
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,636
Not at first, but I do now!

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,756
I did it!

206
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,878
- What are they talking about?
- Can you hear?

207
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,198
Are you sure it works?

208
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,191
Will it work on any woman?

209
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,352
I'm not betting on it.
You better not mess it up.

210
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,477
And I know how to
chat up women better than you.

211
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,519
I agree - it could be a disaster.
Bad magic, is it foolproof?

212
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,034
Shut up or I'll kill you!

213
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,755
Forget about him,
just tell us how this works.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,832
I use the pin, say the words
and the woman's mine.

215
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,629
- They're gonna try magic on us.
- We'd better not go in there.

216
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,188
I don't think
they know anything about magic.

217
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,679
Let's teach them a lesson.

218
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,035
We'll try their magic.

219
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,315
- It might work.
- Then you might score.

220
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,753
You might!

221
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,636
Here come the girls. Open the door!

222
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,472
Welcome to our humble lodgings.
Please come in.

223
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,312
What a welcome,
this must be some kind of a trap.

224
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,872
What have you in mind -
marijuana, cocaine or brandy?

225
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,837
Of course not!

226
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,390
- How do you know that?
- Keep your mouth shut.

227
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,311
How do you like this little dolly?

228
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,116
- It's gorgeous!
- Can I have a look?

229
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,270
Let me see! She's beautiful.

230
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,237
- She looks like you!
- Really?

231
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,514
Yeah, she does.

232
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,349
Is there anything special about it?

233
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,955
It is special -
look, there's another one here!

234
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,273
He's staring at you.

235
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,674
Come on,
we'll show you some good stuff.

236
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,955
- Come on.
- Look, it's over there.

237
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,554
I love you. Two hearts in one.

238
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,639
The one in red.

239
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,437
Honey... Darling...

240
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,673
One more time.

241
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,951
Macho man...

242
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,473
Are you crazy?

243
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,751
- Hold it. Have you ever been dumped?
- I haven't even been in love before.

244
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,389
Now, you're in trouble,
falling in love with me.

245
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,754
I love you.

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,274
Sandy, don't be so selfish!

247
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,797
Don't you dare insult him!

248
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,314
Stop! Don't hurt him,
or I'll dump you!

249
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,118
Please don't!

250
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,831
Why am I holding you?!

251
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,350
- Great.
- You were all over him.

252
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,556
- What was that?
- Why didn't you stop me?

253
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,039
Let me try.

254
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,475
Friends don't count
when there's broads.

255
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,790
- Selfish creep.
- You want them all?

256
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,313
- You bet.
- What about me?

257
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,911
He's got all of them!

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,468
Take it easy. One by one.

259
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,993
Come on in.

260
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,073
Lucky bastard.

261
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,596
- Did you hear that?
- It works!

262
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,390
Well, anyone else know bad magic?

263
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,039
What about you?

264
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,633
- No, I don't know.
- No?

265
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,713
- It's your friend's.
- It's your friend's.

266
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,833
- It's your friend's.
- It's your friend's.

267
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,557
- It's your friend's.
- It's your friend's.

268
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,710
Let's take a look.

269
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,559
I'm sorry, I won't do it again -
I promise!

270
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
I won't do it again.
I swear I'll behave.

271
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,111
Are we still going for lunch?

272
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,069
Yes?

273
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,513
Superintendent!

274
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,073
Fast Buck!

275
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,189
Fast Buck?

276
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,709
I got a call
from Superintendent Cho.

277
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,839
An informer has some valuable
information for the department.

278
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,593
- Will you give me some backup?
- No way.

279
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,312
Fast Buck, look at me.

280
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,989
What, you wanna tell me
you see only me in your eyes?

281
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,355
I don't. It's not that at all.

282
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,989
I wanna see how a brave man like you
became such a coward.

283
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,752
I'm not a coward.

284
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,355
I just don't want to be
deceived or used again.

285
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,431
Right. When I needed some help
you were the one I turned to.

286
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,436
I'm very disappointed.

287
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,153
But I know...

288
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,069
even if I get killed,
I'll die with no regrets.

289
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,559
I'll tell you something, it's
one thing to help your true love,

290
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,719
but to help someone in return
for her love is another thing.

291
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,593
Understand?

292
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,552
"Understand?"

293
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,115
Ready?

294
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,878
Let me.

295
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,919
He's over there! Hurry!

296
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,316
Where did you send the letter?

297
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,277
To Hong Kong.

298
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,157
Where in Hong Kong?

299
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,356
Let's take him to hospital first.

300
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,275
Too late, he's dead.

301
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,516
At least you managed to kill him,

302
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,795
though he was
picked up by that boat.

303
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,472
No need. My men will fix it.

304
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,630
I want you to kill a man
in Hong Kong.

305
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,757
His name's Lau,
here's some background.

306
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,752
And collect a registered letter
from this address.

307
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,913
We found the receipt for the letter
in the bastard's room.

308
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,470
It may contain evidence
of our operation.

309
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,115
We're killers, we're not postmen.

310
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,398
All right, make sure you kill
whoever the letter was sent to.

311
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,674
That will make sure
the letter is useless.

312
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,271
Girls, who are you looking for?

313
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,551
Sorry, I don't understand.

314
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,319
You're not girls!

315
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,473
Hey, is this a kung fu lesson?

316
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,599
I'm a kung fu master,
maybe you'll recognise my style.

317
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,352
Let me teach you.

318
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,997
Fast Buck, are they broads?

319
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,798
I haven't found out.

320
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,679
Good job I know how to dance,
or I'd have fainted already.

321
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,273
Sorry, the dance is over.

322
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,153
- What's going on?
- We must get back to Hong Kong.

323
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,677
- Really?!
- Yes, and you better hurry!

324
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,558
- The others are having a massage.
- Just go get them!

325
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,032
When we're together,
don't you feel secure?

326
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,239
What's that?

327
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,398
OK, it's me that feels secure.

328
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,994
Cut out the nonsense
and start packing.

329
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,355
Be careful. Don't miss anything.

330
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,634
Yes, boss.

331
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,551
- Don't worry, boss.
- We can handle it, boss.

332
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,958
No fishing here - go away!

333
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,837
OK, we're just leaving!

334
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,518
Look out!

335
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,548
Freeze!

336
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,034
Police!

337
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,949
How many can you take
with six bullets?

338
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,348
Don't move!

339
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,112
Freeze! What about 18 bullets?

340
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,318
Do you have 18 men here?

341
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,756
See? Hit the jackpot
first time out together.

342
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,435
You bet. Smooth as silk.
No wonder they call you "Lucky".

343
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,592
You! Don't move!

344
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,039
Don't move!

345
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,235
Freeze!

346
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,590
Get over there! All on that side!

347
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,595
Get him!

348
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,913
Hold it! Don't move!

349
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,675
Come on, you'd have to be a klutz
to miss from this range.

350
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,076
At least we'll die together.
What do you say, officers?

351
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,834
Don't move!

352
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,079
What now?

353
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,435
Empty your guns
so they're no use to them.

354
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,910
- Do we have to use our fists?
- Do you know how to scrap?

355
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,710
- Yeah, but only two at a time.
- I'll beat that, I can handle three.

356
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,597
- What about the rest?
- Come on, prove you can take nine.

357
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,875
Get them!

358
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,513
Take him!

359
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,435
Freeze! Police! Don't move!

360
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,075
Don't shoot, it'll go up in flames.

361
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,479
Don't move, police!

362
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,389
- All right, book 'em!
- Yeah, come on.

363
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,116
You have the right to remain silent.

364
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,475
Anything you say
may be used in evidence.

365
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,120
Have you got anything to say?
Take them away.

366
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,553
Move it.

367
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,320
Flowers are cheap today,
cheaper than yesterday.

368
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,437
Who's there? Show your ID card.
Do you hear me?

369
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,839
May I ask...

370
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,118
No questions. Don't bother me.
You're paid, so buzz off!

371
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,554
I don't need
whatever you're selling!

372
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,312
Please open up, mister.

373
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,589
What a beautiful voice.
I wonder what she looks like?

374
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,476
I told you it would work,
it always does, right?

375
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,630
What is it? A message for me?

376
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,514
I know my rights.
You need a warrant.

377
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,198
Cool it, we have a warrant.
Here, take a look.

378
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,558
If you like, call HQ,
they'll explain.

379
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,791
We're from Special Branch,
Hong Kong police.

380
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,475
I'm Inspector Woo,
and my partner, Rick.

381
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,511
Sorry, must be sure. Can't tell cops
from robbers these days.

382
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,919
Do you live here alone?

383
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,595
No, I rent a room to an
opera colleague, Chi-chi Wang.

384
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,477
It's her we're looking for.

385
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,278
I don't know if she's up.

386
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,750
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong!

387
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,991
She's changing - if I didn't scream
she'd think I was peeping!

388
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,398
I think you peep at her everyday.

389
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,198
- You...
- What's up?

390
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,157
- Sorry.
- You creep!

391
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,959
- Are you Chi-chi Wang?
- Yes.

392
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,190
We want a word with her alone.

393
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,113
So take a walk,
or go and get a haircut.

394
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,318
Don't give me that crap!
We're like brother and sister.

395
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,628
We share our problems.

396
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,757
Miss Wang
may be involved in a murder.

397
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,195
- What?
- I will take a walk.

398
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,157
You can't leave now.

399
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,231
- What murder did you say?
- Melvin Ma was murdered in Pattaya.

400
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,032
- Melvin was murdered?
- That idiot!

401
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,398
I wouldn't speak ill of the dead.

402
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,756
I'm still a happy man,
doesn't matter if he's dead or alive.

403
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,398
- His death...
- Shut up!

404
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,233
Watch your manners.
Do you want me to co-operate?

405
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,719
If you want to be co-operative,
then keep your mouth shut!

406
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,390
I can't! What about my bad breath?
My mouth needs some ventilation.

407
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,028
Miss Wang, we'd like to know
if Mr. Ma wrote to you recently.

408
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,513
Yes, he usually sent
one or two letters a week.

409
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,636
But we were just friends.

410
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,599
Would you show us the letters?
They may hold a clue.

411
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,750
All right, I'll get them for you.

412
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,640
But if you want to
learn about writing love letters

413
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,676
a writing guide offers better value.

414
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,591
Ma was absolutely disgusting!

415
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,796
He described women as ashtrays,

416
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,998
"You're my ashtray,
I'm a cigarette perched on your rim."

417
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,038
"Be patient,
I'll soon drop into your arms."

418
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,838
Don't you think that's disgusting?

419
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,873
So you read her letters?

420
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,673
They're all here.

421
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,638
- Is this all of them?
- They're all I have.

422
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,672
I don't think it's arrived.

423
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,194
Miss Wang, apart from us,

424
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,034
there are some crooks also
interested in a letter from him.

425
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,189
Really?!

426
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,710
I told you that Ma was up to no good.
See? Now we're in trouble!

427
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,870
It's too dangerous to stay here.

428
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,838
So we think you should move out.

429
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
Move out? Where to?

430
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,515
Where?

431
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,036
We'll put you in a safe place.
Please go and pack some clothes.

432
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,636
That goes for you, too.

433
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,872
No. It's my home, I was born here.
I'm not moving out.

434
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,110
If you don't, you will die here.

435
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,475
What? Who'd wanna kill me?

436
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,233
They don't play games.
They're killers.

437
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,073
They're animals, then.
I can outsmart them.

438
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,869
- Man is a superior creature...
- Shut up and get ready.

439
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,234
It's for your own good.

440
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,073
Don't you worry, I can manage!

441
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,914
I've known how to take care of myself
ever since my childhood.

442
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,911
Johnny, haven't you packed?

443
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,753
The devil himself
couldn't scare me away!

444
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,719
You'll be safe to stay with me here,
I'll protect you.

445
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,633
I think we should leave.

446
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,871
No. I'll stay here,
to take your calls.

447
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,633
Barbara, can you two
go downstairs first?

448
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,438
All right, come on.

449
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,274
Look, don't try using force,
it won't work.

450
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,032
You could get hurt.

451
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,192
I'll show you how these crooks
work people over.

452
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,874
What, you mean guns or kung fu?

453
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,629
- Are you trying to castrate Cho?
- This is not castration.

454
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,554
He may become impotent,
or constipated, or maybe both.

455
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,598
Concentrate.
This doll's Superintendent Cho.

456
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,873
Checkmate.

457
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,359
Let's go over there.

458
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,672
How did it taste?

459
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,952
You can find out yourself.
Those moves don't count.

460
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,635
Are you kidding?
What game are you trying to play?

461
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,678
Listen, you need brains
to play chess.

462
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,320
If every move has to count,
flip coins, then.

463
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,597
- I've had enough!
- What's wrong?

464
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,636
Get out of the way!

465
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,913
Stop staring.
And stop playing with toys.

466
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,395
Hide it!

467
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,430
- It's a man.
- So what?

468
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,149
You little bugger.

469
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,475
- No!
- Come back here!

470
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,438
Please! Remember my foot,
it's still hurting.

471
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,080
- One more word... and I'll kill you!
- Come on.

472
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,355
- Who is it?
- OK, I'll get it.

473
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,671
Make it a woman!

474
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,875
Sorry, Miss. Are you all right?

475
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,276
- Is this...
- Yes! This is the right place.

476
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,079
You can even stay overnight -
no problem.

477
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,879
What's your name?
I'm Rome, short for Romeo.

478
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,157
- His real name is Rum...
- My real name...

479
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,516
You see? You see?

480
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,029
- A girl, look!
- You're all the same.

481
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,710
Barbara! We missed you!
Where have you been?

482
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,912
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, you're just stupid.

483
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,473
Can't you just shut up?

484
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,752
- Come on in.
- Please come in.

485
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,069
Trading in the old
for something new?

486
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,279
What?
I've never been his girlfriend.

487
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,193
Only you know if it's old or new.

488
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,910
If you want to break up then do it,
don't leave it up in the air.

489
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,479
All right, I won't let
other people use me again.

490
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,757
From now on it's me for myself.
Everyone else comes second.

491
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,554
I didn't realise, you're actors.
You sound really weird!

492
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,640
I mean, normal people
don't speak that way.

493
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,915
Well, unless you're theatre actors.

494
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,117
You don't expect me
to stay with these weirdos?

495
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,512
Don't worry, I once had to
spend a lot of time with them myself.

496
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,276
And their behaviours can make you
feel like you're a real woman.

497
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,920
So what are you trying to say?

498
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,468
Can't you keep quiet,
or I'll lock you up!

499
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,552
I'd prefer that
to losing my virginity!

500
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,949
What do you mean, Curly?

501
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,112
Don't call me names.
My name is John.

502
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,998
Why are you worrying about
your virginity?

503
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,435
I figured that from what she said,

504
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,956
your behaviours would make me
feel like a real woman.

505
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,678
Shouldn't I be worried, then?

506
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,752
Really? So you're looking
for trouble here.

507
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,195
Fast Buck, where are your manners?

508
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,793
That'll teach him.

509
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,509
You're all educated -
teach him some manners.

510
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,510
Why don't we take a walk
in the garden?

511
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,230
- Sorry, no.
- That sweet talk won't work!

512
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,790
You should know
how she feels about all of you.

513
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,108
Shut up!

514
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,919
You might stop me talking,
but not thinking.

515
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,113
Hold this.

516
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,793
I'll shut him up.

517
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,313
They'll both have to
stay here for a while.

518
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,830
And... and you?

519
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,193
I'm still on the case.

520
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,034
I thank all of you
on behalf of the police force.

521
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,953
- We don't expect that!
- What are friends for?

522
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,315
Just something to grease the palm.

523
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,791
Shut up or I'll shut you up, too.

524
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,589
Since you're staying
I'll show you upstairs.

525
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,955
My room's the cleanest room
in the house.

526
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,871
It's big enough for two.

527
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,192
You can stay in Kevin's room,
and he'll sleep in this living room.

528
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,555
What about me?
I can't be silent any more.

529
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,713
Don't worry, they'll find
a room for you somewhere.

530
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,952
I'm clean and healthy.
I'm particular about where I sleep.

531
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,156
I don't intend to catch the pox!

532
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,597
Weren't you gonna shut him up?
He's chattering like a monkey.

533
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,752
Did you concentrate
your thoughts on him?

534
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,876
- No.
- What were you thinking of?

535
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,437
- That girl.
- No wonder she can't speak.

536
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,230
All right, having listened to you,
I've reached a conclusion.

537
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,880
You gentlemen
are sheep in wolves' clothing.

538
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,793
Horny but chicken.
I think they won't hurt me.

539
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,997
- Miss Wang...
- It's all right. Don't worry.

540
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,197
I'll be OK. Go back to your job,
I promise I'll stay.

541
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,794
She's right, you'd better go.

542
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,917
As a guardian of the law,
your citizens need you.

543
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,399
I'll go to my room.

544
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,119
- I'll carry your case.
- Thanks.

545
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,633
You first.

546
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,795
I've got to go.
Anyone gonna see me out to the car?

547
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,358
- Thanks a lot.
- A pleasure.

548
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,075
Come on!

549
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,633
Here they come.

550
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,399
Come on.

551
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,079
One, two, three.

552
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,756
- You hit me!
- So what? You fat louse!

553
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,753
- One more step and I'll kill you!
- Come on, then!

554
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,877
- You're asking for it.
- You really hit me!

555
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,355
Stop!

556
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,560
Let go. I wanna kill the bastard.

557
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,914
- Come on!
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

558
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,150
- How dare you?!
- It wasn't me!

559
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,988
Let go...

560
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,516
- Can you stop him, please?!
- You're a dead man!

561
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,831
- Stop fighting, will you?
- Don't stop me!

562
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,990
- Please stop!
- Don't stop me.

563
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,911
- It wasn't your business!
- Let go!

564
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,958
- You two, stop fighting!
- Come on out!

565
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,315
- I'll kill you!
- Stop that! Stop that.

566
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,960
- Let me go!
- Please stop!

567
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,029
- Come on, you fat louse.
- I'm gonna kill you!

568
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,429
Stop fighting each other!

569
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,359
No way, I won't.

570
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,238
- Just put down your hands first.
- Sure.

571
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,513
- Stop fighting!
- Stop fighting!

572
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,109
- Serves you right, fatty!
- My hands are too hot.

573
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,993
Sorry.

574
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,550
It's none of your business!
Go to hell!

575
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,637
Why did you hit Sandy?

576
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,998
Stop! I'll kill you!

577
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,152
What's wrong?

578
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,198
- You all right?
- It's blood, but I'll be all right.

579
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,359
You're coughing blood!

580
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,519
It's nothing,
cos this is for defending you.

581
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,999
- Why did he hit you like that?
- I've no idea, but I'm going to die.

582
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,150
Before I die,
can you do one thing for me?

583
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,152
- Sure.
- I've never kissed a girl before.

584
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,832
Will you kiss me?

585
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,236
Please?! I'm going to die.

586
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,875
Coughing blood? That's my trick!
What will I do, then?!

587
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,669
I thought you forgot, so I did it.
I still haven't kissed her yet.

588
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,234
Stop fighting! I'm really scared.
Why are they not soft?

589
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,358
What was that?!

590
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,912
You crazy sex maniacs!

591
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,070
- What's going on?
- Miss Wang's found a rat.

592
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,435
She's trying to catch it in her room.

593
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,510
Don't just stand there - help her!
Chi-chi! I'm coming.

594
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,829
I'll catch it! I'll protect you!

595
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,948
Where...

596
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,831
Women?! They're hopeless.

597
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,352
More, more.

598
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,312
Watch it, dummy!

599
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,357
- There's a fire, help!
- There's a fire!

600
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,998
- It's a stick-up.
- Shut up.

601
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,071
- There's a fire.
- You all right?

602
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,113
I'm all right.

603
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,915
- How come you're all here?
- We had to think of you.

604
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,918
Don't waste time now.

605
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,310
- We've got to find a way out.
- We'll jump through the window.

606
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,119
No, it's too hard,
she'll hurt herself.

607
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,359
What should we do?
Do you have any other ideas?

608
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,194
All right, this is no time
for modesty - get undressed,

609
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,157
we'll make a rope and climb down.

610
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,589
Hurry up!

611
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,432
Why aren't you...?

612
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,270
It's silk. It won't be any good
for making a rope.

613
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,199
Really? Let me have a look.

614
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,513
Silk is highly flammable,
go and make your body and hair wet!

615
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,800
Just do it! Hurry up!

616
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,439
Hurry!

617
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,795
- We've made it.
- We've made it.

618
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,869
- Have you made the rope?
- Yeah, we have.

619
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,234
Quick!

620
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,432
- I've dropped the sheets!
- How could you be so careless?

621
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,556
This place is full of smoke now!

622
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,915
Go get a wet towel to seal the door.

623
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,355
- Come on, Fast Buck!
- Hurry up!

624
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,590
- Come on, hurry!
- Hurry!

625
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,875
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

626
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,951
There are no more towels left!

627
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,395
- Now what?
- Here, take this one.

628
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,518
- Roundhead's fainted!
- It was too much for him.

629
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,355
- Fast Buck, you're useless.
- Does it work?

630
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,590
The smoke is still pouring in.

631
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,479
What are we gonna do?

632
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,711
We might make it,
if can get out from this door.

633
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,870
- But I've got an idea.
- What is it?

634
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,678
But it can only save one person -

635
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,469
lie underwater in the bath tub
and use this straw to breathe.

636
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,073
Not you, you coward.

637
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,436
It's not for me.
We must save Miss Wang,

638
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,556
Go and do what Kevin just said.

639
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,996
We'll try and get out of here
to find some extinguishers.

640
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,512
- There's no time to hesitate. Quick!
- Right?

641
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,719
Go on, hurry.

642
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,837
Come on, lift Roundhead.

643
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,190
Miss Wang, why aren't you
in the tub yet? Hurry up!

644
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,111
Come on.

645
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,714
Let's go.

646
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,913
You first.

647
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,838
We've made it this time.

648
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,959
- What's that? Something's burning?
- Nothing's wrong. Go back inside.

649
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,993
Come on.

650
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,471
- Have you put out the fire?
- Not yet. It's still burning.

651
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,709
I meant...

652
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,835
Help yourselves, don't wait for me.

653
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,832
I should really thank you
for saving my life.

654
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,433
- What?
- Nothing.

655
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,919
Sit down, then.

656
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,388
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
- Of course!

657
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,799
That's fine.
I just wanted to make it clear.

658
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,359
Sit down.

659
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,672
What are you talking about?

660
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,797
Nothing. Just kidding around.
Tuck in.

661
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,871
- Tuck in, Miss Wang.
- Tuck in.

662
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,715
Don't worry, I just wanna
get rid of this chicken's bottom.

663
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,756
Miss, you're a great cook.

664
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,032
I agree.
She's also beautiful and tasty.

665
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,998
- What did you say?
- Say that again.

666
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,314
I said
"the price of houses is so low,

667
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,278
"we could save up enough
to buy a new apartment."

668
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,716
I meant to say
the chicken's tough, so I ate it all.

669
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,518
- All right?
- What?

670
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,352
- What did I say?
- Nonsense.

671
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,555
Guess it was.

672
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,190
I heard what you said,
I can't be tasty -

673
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,919
it's the wrong word,
but you could say my food's tasty.

674
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,276
I see.
You look so good I'd like to eat you.

675
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,555
Roundhead, you're rambling again.

676
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,753
OK, I'll get it right.

677
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,912
Last night, when we saw your body,
we loved it.

678
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,399
He's only kidding.

679
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,836
I'd like to take this opportunity
to welcome you to our house.

680
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,113
- Welcome!
- And there'll be no more fires.

681
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,351
Yeah, because we never use
the same trick twice!

682
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,959
I'll shut up and eat my food.

683
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,750
We're going to the rehearsal
after lunch.

684
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,592
Anyone want to join us?

685
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,114
But we wouldn't
know what to do on the stage.

686
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,309
Pity, there are lots of pretty girls.

687
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,198
It doesn't hurt to learn acting,
does it?

688
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,591
- Our jobs cost taxpayers millions.
- I don't think so.

689
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,033
Then you're wrong.

690
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,874
Your monthly salary, rent for
quarters, your gun and bullets -

691
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,791
they all cost money.

692
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,154
All right, carry on.

693
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,392
All this money is meant to
protect good citizens from crime,

694
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,790
but we're doing the reverse -
we're protecting criminals!

695
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,078
I'm fed up with those damn cops.
So-called police protection.

696
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,029
I've lost $40 million
because of them.

697
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,312
Good job I can trust you.

698
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,799
Have you sorted it out?

699
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,678
All sorted.
Every family, 20 grand a month.

700
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,873
I'm going out,
don't let the cops follow.

701
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,594
Let's go.

702
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,393
That's not Lau.

703
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,836
It must be. Let's take a look.

704
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,874
Turn back!

705
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,235
The motorbikes!

706
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,836
I'm no hero, I'm a cop.
One of us will get you.

707
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,470
Your orders were to protect Lau,

708
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,597
but he was killed
right in front of you.

709
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,116
We didn't see it, Chief.
He was already dead.

710
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,668
It was his fault,
he tried to shake us off.

711
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,593
Forget it, you're off the case.

712
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,399
You'll help Inspector Woo.

713
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,873
Don't forget,
your job is to prevent crime.

714
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,439
Understood, sir.

715
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,635
Amy will explain what's involved.

716
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,678
I must go to rehearsals.
She'll help you.

717
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,988
She's pretty.

718
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,150
Which group would you like to join?

719
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,028
Don't join the theatre group,
or you'll end up as my props!

720
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,829
Theatre group!

721
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,512
You'll regret it.

722
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:11,271
Fill in these forms, you'll get
your membership card next week.

723
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,710
- Amy, you're so helpful.
- OK, that's enough.

724
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,713
Thanks, Amy.

725
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,713
Sorry, Amy. I've sprained my wrist
so I can't write.

726
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,155
- Would you fill it in for me?
- Of course.

727
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,039
- Your name?
- Alain.

728
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,639
- Surname?
- It's Delon. Alain Delon.

729
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,750
Your parents name you that?

730
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,470
No, as soon as I was born
the nurses called me that.

731
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,118
Don't know why.

732
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,192
But my friends agree
the name fits me very well.

733
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,511
- Really. Your birth place?
- Canton.

734
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,353
Canton? How do you spell that?

735
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,035
You don't know how to spell Canton?
Let me show you.

736
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,628
OK.

737
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,510
Fill in the form yourself,
you stupid boy.

738
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,311
Name: Rawhide ID No: B2560136
Age: 28 and 96 months

739
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,672
Rawhide, your age is wrong.

740
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,593
- What's wrong with it?
- "28 and 96 months"?

741
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,114
- That's none of your business.
- Stop.

742
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,792
"Judo Room"

743
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,955
- Let's change our clothes.
- What clothes?

744
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,473
- Judo kits.
- So you know Judo?

745
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,754
- No.
- Forget it.

746
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,876
- Looks like fun.
- Count me out.

747
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,439
Come on!

748
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,877
Find a place and sit down.

749
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,192
In Judo, you defeat your opponents
by using your brain, not your fists.

750
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,510
Keeping the balance is the key.

751
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,955
I'll do a couple
of demonstrations today.

752
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,396
I need a partner, any volunteers?

753
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,559
Step over here.

754
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,389
Me?

755
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,869
You seem to be pretty tough.

756
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,554
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

757
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,954
You must be tired, sit down.

758
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,871
Not me. On your feet.

759
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,799
Very nice!

760
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,430
She's fantastic.

761
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,238
Who else wants a try?

762
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,992
Me!

763
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,352
How about the big fellow?

764
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,354
Me? No, I can't.

765
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,274
Let me demonstrate
what's called the deflection move.

766
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,555
Go on, Fast Buck, get a grope.

767
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,198
No, I really can't.

768
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,397
Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
Come on.

769
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,113
Come on.

770
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,710
- Please, don't force me.
- Come on.

771
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,271
Sorry, I'm not used
to having a girl on top.

772
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,395
Sorry.

773
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,993
Would anyone else like to try?

774
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,399
- Please, show me how to do it!
- Please, show me!

775
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,313
Kevin, having fun?

776
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,639
I was playing with my fingers,
not much fun here.

777
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,759
- Why is that?
- The actors haven't arrived yet.

778
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,159
Who plays the lead?

779
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,834
I'm the star, but my co-star,
who plays Juliet's brother

780
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,558
and his men are not here yet.

781
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,438
Wait no more.
Forget them, we'll do it.

782
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,790
You're the director, shall we begin?

783
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,038
They ought to replace you.
You, play Romeo?

784
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,111
- Why not?
- Why, yes, you fool?

785
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,431
- I know it's a crazy idea...
- What?

786
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,069
Sorry, that's the wrong word.
Not crazy, marvellous!

787
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:10,995
I want to inject new ideas
into this Shakespeare play.

788
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,833
Her beauty
needn't be matched by Romeo's.

789
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,879
So it would give hope
to a not-so-attractive audience.

790
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,154
Right!

791
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,391
Why don't you let us help you
make this masterpiece?

792
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,189
That would be great! You play
Juliet's brother and his men.

793
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,193
Just try to make it flow, so Romeo
can improve his acting skills.

794
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,396
What? So we're really props, then.

795
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,552
That doesn't matter, does it?
Let's start.

796
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,076
OK, we'll start from
where Romeo meets Juliet's brother.

797
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,634
Romeo, they are coming.

798
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,030
Romeo, so you do have
the courage to face reality.

799
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,953
Show me your... Show me your...

800
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,115
- Face!
- Your face.

801
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,350
There's love and honesty in my face.

802
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,512
Even if! had no courage
that would also show in my face.

803
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,515
Strike him! He's too... He's too...

804
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,068
- Arrogant.
- He's too arrogant!

805
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,757
You can't even read,
how can you be on stage?

806
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,319
That's not in the script.

807
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,868
Of course, it's not in the script.

808
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,190
I said it
because you're all hopeless.

809
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,317
They're illiterate,
how can we do this?

810
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,832
Why can't illiterates be actors?
Do you know all the words?

811
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,593
Not all of them, but most of them.

812
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,513
Do you know the word
for night soil and water?

813
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,115
You don't know?

814
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,633
Fertiliser.

815
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,030
Stuff your face with it.
There's a shorter word for it.

816
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,078
This is a very easy word,
and you don't know it.

817
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,509
I tell you, it doesn't even exist.

818
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,070
Forget it.
Let's get on with Romeo and Juliet.

819
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,755
Look, it's a rehearsal,
and we offered to fill in.

820
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,718
If we blow the lines,
just ignore them, right?

821
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,233
Good idea!

822
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,553
Let's continue, then.

823
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,990
- Where were we?
- Who's next?

824
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,994
He's too arrogant.

825
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,231
I beg you, brother,
please don't fight him.

826
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,470
If he's hurt,
I'll suffer as much as he.

827
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,793
Juliet, fear not!
For your love I'd gladly die.

828
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,868
- Romeo.
- Juliet.

829
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,351
Juliet,
I am the leader of the Capulets.

830
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,513
I cannot bear to see you
fall in love with a demon.

831
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,679
Look at me,
this face is so twisted with worry.

832
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,873
Romeo is not a demon, he's not!

833
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,837
He is the devil's brother!

834
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,195
Right! Kill him! Kill the swine!

835
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,193
I can't take it any more.

836
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,515
Juliet.

837
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,753
Romeo, you should be holding her!

838
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,559
If you don't wanna do that,
we can do it.

839
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,358
- Yeah!
- Are you gay?

840
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,510
Even gays don't
treat a girl like that.

841
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,239
Say it to him, not me!

842
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,632
- Sorry.
- You're sorry? Are you really?

843
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,874
What are you doing?

844
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,635
It's these glasses. I'll go home
to get my contact lenses.

845
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,598
You're Romeo,
not Zatoichi the blind swordsman!

846
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,079
- Right?
- Right.

847
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,030
If wasn't for art
I wouldn't be with you Philistines!

848
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,953
- Your coffee.
- Thanks.

849
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,313
- I've got a letter for Miss Wang.
- That's me.

850
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,198
- Miss Chi-chi Wang?
- That's right.

851
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,349
Sign here.

852
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,558
- Who's the letter for?
- Me, of course.

853
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,918
Didn't mean to be nosy.

854
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,509
- Why are you back?
- For my contact lenses.

855
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,353
No need to shout.
Who's the letter for?

856
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,992
- Shut up, or I'll kick you out.
- Really? Go on, kick me out!

857
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,111
It's two blank sheets of paper.

858
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,514
You didn't kick me out,
I'm still here.

859
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,828
Piss off!

860
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,037
It's blood, you bastard!
Maybe you can make me bleed,

861
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,032
but you can never
get me out of here with one kick.

862
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,714
When I was about to shoot,
someone came in.

863
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,637
Rick, are you all right?

864
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,873
- A suspicious postman just left.
- Really?

865
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,358
- Where is he?
- I couldn't find him.

866
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,073
Let's go upstairs first.

867
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,914
May I help you, sir?

868
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,274
Where is the toilet?

869
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,157
- To your right.
- Thank you.

870
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,715
Hello?

871
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,159
Anyone there?

872
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,998
You sure? He pointed a gun at you
in the toilet?

873
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,275
Yes, it was a real gun.

874
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,679
Did he do anything?

875
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,718
She could've been raped
and killed by him!

876
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,074
Let's take a look.

877
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,673
It's the ladies toilet.

878
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,877
- That's why we have to take a look.
- I get it.

879
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,753
What's your hurry?

880
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,232
That's him.

881
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,311
Careful, he might have a gun.

882
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,072
So you are not blind!
(Speaking Japanese)

883
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,355
- What did he say?
- It's Japanese.

884
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,552
Freeze!

885
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,313
Hurry, hurry...

886
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,679
We've got to save Roundhead, somehow.

887
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,270
- How?
- Distract the guy's attention.

888
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,839
That's right. Try it.

889
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,955
All right.

890
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,355
Hello there!
(Speaking Japanese)

891
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,237
I just tried. It didn't work.

892
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,591
He's out of bullets!

893
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,913
Hold it!

894
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,873
Police! Down, everyone!

895
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,835
I know you're out of ammo -
so give up.

896
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,878
Muscles is wounded.

897
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,110
- What do we do?
- Help him.

898
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,634
- I can't, they have guns.
- Don't worry.

899
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,559
Go on, get him!

900
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,958
No, I'll be OK!

901
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,599
I'm OK. It's only blood.

902
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,474
Painful?

903
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,678
It doesn't hurt at all.

904
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,830
Because my whole damn body is numb.

905
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,557
Wonderful! Great! Super!

906
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,632
- Who's the smart-ass that pushed me?
- I didn't.

907
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,075
You help Muscles.
We'll get the other guy.

908
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,798
We'll get the other guy.

909
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,915
Come on!

910
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,629
He's still alive.

911
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,632
- Fast Buck, forget the manners!
- Beat him up!

912
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,914
Get him!

913
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,037
Fast Buck, thanks a lot.

914
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,269
You're welcome.

915
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,519
Are you all right?

916
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,555
- It's OK.
- Are you all right?

917
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,710
Let me lock those guys up first.

918
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,954
Let me! I'll do it!
I can do it!

919
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,996
Move it!

920
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,108
- I don't believe it!
- I don't believe it!

921
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,078
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it.

922
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,110
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it.

923
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,996
- I don't believe this.
- I can't believe it.

924
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,231
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it!

925
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,909
