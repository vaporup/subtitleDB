1
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,790
Order them to approach the plane
with caution.

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,633
Yes, sir.
Approach the plane with caution.

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,393
We´re ready, sir.

4
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,595
Move in.

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,032
Everybody get down, now!

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,115
This is Commander Chan speaking.
Report status immediately.

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,511
They´ll never... give in...

8
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,353
Commander Chan, you betrayed
my trust. You attacked us.

9
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,190
Listen Kiang. We shall never give in
to hijackers or terrorists´ demands.

10
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,638
I´ve also alerted Taiwan about the
situation, so you can´t land there.

11
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,110
In that case, Commander,
watch your sergeant die.

12
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,709
All right, Commander, send
the tanker to fuel the plane now.

13
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,113
Don´t you understand?

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,552
There´s nowhere else to go,
so what´s the point?

15
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,752
And that´s all your doing.

16
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,754
This is hopeless!
Give yourselves up!

17
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,192
It´s too late for that. So you´d
better give in to our demands.

18
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,353
If you don´t have the fuel ready
in five minutes,

19
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,032
we´ll start shooting hostages.

20
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,315
You heard him, Officer.
Send the tanker now.

21
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,792
Prepare for takeoff.

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,715
Commander, order your men to back
off, except for the fuel attendant.

23
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,156
I´ve just connected the fuel line.
Nobody seems to be watching.

24
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,514
Proceed with caution.

25
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,035
Red One, what was that noise?

26
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,079
I´m unloading the fuel.
I´m moving toward the rear entrance.

27
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,354
Hey! Get back!

28
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,759
All right, start the plane!
Go on, damn it!

29
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,233
Arthur!

30
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,637
Joe! Are you all right?
Talk to me, man! Joe!

31
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,711
Joe.

32
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,832
Retreat, Red One! Get out of there!
Red One, retreat! Do you hear me?

33
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,875
Damn it!

34
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,391
It´s the control system.

35
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,434
- Where is it?
- At the back.

36
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,838
According to the report,

37
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,959
you went after the hijacker against
Commander Chan´s direct order.

38
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,798
Why, Officer?

39
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,111
General, those hijackers
are a bunch of terrorists.

40
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,510
It is my duty
to combat terrorism.

41
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,716
And to follow orders.

42
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,632
Yes, sir.

43
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,870
Although you saved those hostages,

44
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,191
you have violated
the army´s code of discipline.

45
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,397
You put the whole team at risk.

46
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,597
Therefore, I´ve decided
to have you transferred

47
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,797
to the Chinese Embassy
in Lavernia... immediately.

48
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,917
Wish I was that baby´s dad. Yeah.

49
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,871
- Well, well, Andrew Kwok.
- Long time no see, Arthur Dong.

50
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,116
You´re late again, as usual.

51
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,952
I couldn´t disappoint you.

52
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,076
You´re hopeless, you know that?

53
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,994
I´m glad you´re here,
in spite of the circumstances.

54
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,118
This dump might be
bearable with you here.

55
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,715
What are you talking about?
Lavernia´s a great place!

56
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,397
Is that your luggage?

57
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,473
Interpol agents?

58
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,878
Come on!

59
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,553
Hey, you!

60
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,278
Hey, why are these cops
making us wait for so long?

61
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,034
That´s typical of the Lavernians.

62
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,476
Don´t be surprised
if they´re not very accommodating,

63
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,352
especially to us Asians.

64
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,228
Well, since this is their country,
we´ve got to stay out of trouble,

65
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,914
otherwise there´ll be problems.

66
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,829
If you do get in a fix,
say something like...

67
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,079
I couldn´t help it
or it was unavoidable. That´ll help.

68
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,593
Well? Say something.

69
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,715
Listen.

70
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,673
Mishima...

71
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,676
- Ever seen him?
- Look, it´s your guy.

72
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,356
Great, he´s all over the news,
the Ambassador will be furious.

73
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,750
Now we´re in deep trouble.

74
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,112
Uh-oh, they´re here.

75
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,434
- Mr Ambassador, Mr Secretary.
- Are you Officer Dong?

76
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,194
- I´m to blame, sir.
- Blame?

77
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,433
Yes, sir. I should be held
responsible, since he´s new here.

78
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,828
The fault is mine.

79
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,992
Listen, no-one is blaming you
for anything.

80
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,756
In fact, you´ve both been invited
to the President´s banquet tomorrow.

81
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,753
- Hear that? We´ll probably get...
- Remember...

82
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,676
look smart and be on your best
behaviour. Is that clear?

83
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,955
Yes, sir!

84
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,237
Officer Dong, welcome to Lavernia.

85
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,113
I would like to thank...
the Lavernian government,

86
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,872
my mother and father...

87
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,597
Andrew, are you all right?
What´s the matter?

88
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,038
We caught the guy,
but nobody gave us credit for it.

89
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,668
It´s not the medal, but...

90
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,149
Does this go on all night?

91
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,318
- I propose a toast.
- Cheers!

92
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,076
Wait! A toast to what?

93
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,151
To our protest.

94
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,559
Let them look down on us, that´s
their loss. We´re still the best!

95
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,112
You know something else?

96
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,831
I even told my girlfriend
I´d be getting a medal tonight!

97
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,429
So get yourself a fake medal!

98
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,074
Looks like you need some company.

99
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,115
I´m Lone Sung. I own this bar,
and I know that look when I see it.

100
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,829
You´re homesick, right?

101
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,960
It isn´t easy for us Chinese
to build a life in a new country.

102
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,670
So I opened this bar, where
we can all drink our sadness away.

103
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,074
Yes, sir...

104
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,229
Nobody here calls me sir,
it´s just Uncle Lone, OK?

105
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,357
You know, young man...

106
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,555
I´m Arthur Dong, call me Arthur.

107
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,109
- Dong, let´s do it!
- Sure!

108
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,510
Come on guys, watch the show.

109
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,593
That was great!

110
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,156
I never thought
you danced that well, Andrew!

111
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,110
- You guys are fantastic!
- Not bad at all!

112
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,633
Tammy?

113
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,432
Let´s get out of here!

114
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,428
- But my wife´s badly hurt!
- I´m going alone, then!

115
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,592
- Tammy!
- Arthur!

116
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,796
Let´s get out of here.

117
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,315
- And go where?
- Anywhere!

118
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,357
You can´t desert your country!

119
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,718
Oh, my God, she´s dead!
How could you let this happen?

120
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,952
- Arthur...
- Tammy, the boat´s leaving!

121
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,472
- Come with us.
- I´m sorry, I just can´t.

122
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,639
It´s strange
that after all these years,

123
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,793
we´d end up feeling
like we were total strangers.

124
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,354
I guess I´m just a little nervous
about seeing you again.

125
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,759
I didn´t know what to say... although
it´s really good to see you again.

126
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,155
I like being near you,

127
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,237
so I was glad to hear
you were transferred here.

128
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,356
Who told you?

129
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,350
Andrew told you, didn´t he?

130
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,873
One second...

131
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,670
You never wrote to me.

132
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,795
Would you have replied?

133
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,636
Is that why
you´re still angry with me?

134
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,513
It´s a lot deeper than that.
You left me just when I...

135
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,238
There was a revolt, remember?
I had no choice but to run away.

136
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,398
So you think running away
solves everything?

137
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,038
I was afraid I might die there.

138
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,992
I would´ve protected you!

139
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,874
I got scared.
I was really scared then, OK?

140
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,876
You didn´t trust me then,
that´s why you left.

141
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,916
You didn´t care about me.

142
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,596
And now suddenly you show up
and think everything´s the same.

143
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,833
So, you don´t trust me any more?

144
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,754
Trust? You want to talk about trust?

145
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,513
Not only did you leave me,
but our country, too.

146
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,638
The country
where you were born and raised.

147
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,119
You left without a word, and now
you´re asking me if I trust you?

148
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,837
Now you´re living somewhere
much colder than Beijing.

149
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,959
It won´t be so cold
now that you´re here.

150
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,433
I don´t know.

151
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,830
It´s not the same any more.

152
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,389
You kids just love your heroes.
That´s from watching so many movies.

153
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,833
You´ve always been my hero, Uncle
Lone, we can always rely on you.

154
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,956
Tammy needs a room.

155
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,796
We´ve been friends since we were
kids and I was wondering...

156
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,235
could you let her stay here?

157
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,788
That´s if it wouldn´t be a problem.

158
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,070
Sure, why not?

159
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,394
Have this liver. You look pale.

160
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,352
Thank you, Uncle.

161
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,358
- What about me?
- Forget it!

162
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,271
You´re strong as an ox -

163
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,591
you could take on all the blondes
in Lavernia.

164
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,318
I´m such a hunk!

165
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,676
There you go again!
Stop bragging about yourself.

166
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,957
How do you put up with this airhead?

167
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,032
- So where have you been?
- Croatia.

168
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,635
She left Beijing in 1989,
during the revolution.

169
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,473
And went
to an even messier war there.

170
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,794
At least now she´s all right.
It´s never easy to grow up alone.

171
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,918
What matters is that we stay whole.

172
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,476
I´ve something you might like.
I´ll show you.

173
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,789
- Recognise it?
- Duckweed.

174
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,317
Although they have no roots,
they still manage to survive.

175
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,072
- They´re lovely.
- Great.

176
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,400
I have an extra room upstairs,
and I´m going to let you stay,

177
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,875
if you take care of these.

178
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,268
I will, Uncle.

179
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,472
Look out! Get down!

180
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,479
No!

181
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,953
Ambassador.

182
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,872
Officer, the Defence Minister called
earlier. Mishima wants to see you.

183
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,633
For what?

184
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,191
I´ve no idea, but he said
it´s important you see him.

185
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,875
- Should I go, sir?
- That´s your decision.

186
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,950
In that case, since I´ve nothing
to be afraid of, I´ll go see him.

187
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,396
- Yes, miss?
- I´m looking for Officer Dong.

188
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,636
- Your name?
- Tammy Chan.

189
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,193
Please wait here.

190
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,558
Sorry, miss, but he isn´t here yet.

191
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,392
I´ll just wait here.

192
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,678
Sorry miss,
but this is an embassy compound.

193
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,836
You´ll have to wait outside.

194
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,273
OK, thanks.

195
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,116
Hey, there´s a lady
waiting outside for you.

196
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,318
Come on Arthur, let´s play again.

197
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,238
Ready? One, two, three!

198
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,552
Gosh, you won again!

199
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,356
That´s because
you let me win on purpose!

200
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,438
Will you always
be this nice to me?

201
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,996
My daddy is always nice to my mummy.

202
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,078
I never saw my parents.

203
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,791
That´s all right, you have lots
of friends at the training centre.

204
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,520
As soldiers,
we´ll protect our country.

205
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,592
Are you going to protect me too,
Arthur?

206
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,432
Of course I will.

207
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,910
Chong said something about swords:

208
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,950
"There are three kinds of swords -
for commoners, nobles and kings."

209
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,711
You think I´m nothing
but a heartless killer.

210
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,031
Well, you´re wrong,
for I bear the King´s sword,

211
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,989
and I was sent by God to cleanse
this world of sin and corruption.

212
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,233
A true king´s sword
is never used to hurt or kill,

213
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,797
and a true king should rule
with kindness and love.

214
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,070
Confucius´ teachings
have made you softhearted, Officer.

215
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,630
Let´s just say
my conscience doesn´t bother me.

216
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,268
You think I enjoy what I do?

217
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,199
That I don´t suffer
every time someone dies?

218
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,509
Well, you´re wrong.

219
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,559
You can´t imagine the pain I feel
whenever I kill others.

220
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,669
But I was chosen to bear the cross
of the sins of the world.

221
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,997
That is my destiny.

222
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,516
Take Hitler. He was also
lonely and misunderstood.

223
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,069
Every great hero goes through this.

224
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,629
I suggest you see a psychiatrist.

225
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,071
You´re no hero.
You´re just an insane egomaniac.

226
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,792
I can sense your disillusionment.

227
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,236
Join me and we can serve
our divine purpose together.

228
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,276
Is that why you wanted to see me?

229
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,268
I´m sorry, you got it wrong,
I´m not interested.

230
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,438
Officer Dong.

231
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,034
What I´m offering may be your last
chance of walking into the light.

232
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,554
I´ve always been living
in the light.

233
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,194
Good morning, Arthur.
Here, I made you a coffee.

234
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,836
- You´re nice today.
- I´m always nice.

235
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,719
- How is it?
- Tastes great.

236
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,916
Yeah, it´s from Croatia.

237
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,917
- Tammy bought it.
- Meaning?

238
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,997
Are you still angry with her?

239
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,237
The Ambassador
will be late for his meeting.

240
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,470
Wait! What about your coffee?

241
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,234
What? Arthur, wait!

242
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,196
Hey, Arthur, I hear
your girlfriend was here yesterday.

243
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,753
Tammy Chan, right?

244
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,598
Andrew told us everything.

245
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,753
Right, Andrew?

246
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,512
Arthur, listen.

247
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,878
Our country´s revolution started
because of a misunderstanding

248
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,993
between our government
and our own people.

249
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,795
Yet you stayed in China
and gave her a chance.

250
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,759
Why don´t you give
the same chance to Miss Chan?

251
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,712
Thank you, Secretary Wong.

252
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,789
- Good morning, Ambassador.
- Good morning. Let´s go.

253
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,673
Cover the Ambassador!

254
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,233
Secretary Wong!

255
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,672
I´ll take care of him!

256
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,913
Over here, hurry!

257
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,436
The Holy War has just begun!
Hail to the new Messiah!

258
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,033
And that one.

259
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,072
You´d better go inside.

260
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,833
Wait! Tammy, where are you going?

261
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,190
I need to see Arthur.

262
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,152
What? You´re staying right here.

263
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,389
But I...

264
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,597
Come here. You´ll be attacked
by the Lavernians!

265
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,032
They can´t tell Chinese and Japanese
apart. That´s why I´ve closed up.

266
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,749
Don´t worry, I´ve seen
worse things, I´ll be fine.

267
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,030
I´ll be back later! Bye!

268
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,950
Don´t hurt me, please!
I´m not Japanese, I´m Chinese!

269
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,070
Listen to me, I´m Chinese!
I´m innocent! Please don´t hurt me!

270
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,594
Don´t! Please, don´t!
Let me go! Please, I´m innocent!

271
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,798
I´ve been looking for you all day.

272
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,440
It´s all right, I´m here now.

273
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,753
Sir?

274
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,640
Do it for the boat people.

275
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,795
I don´t feel good about this.
What if something goes wrong?

276
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,392
Well, we have to do the right thing.

277
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,709
Gentlemen, the Holy War to save
our master is about to begin.

278
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,795
Hey, has it occurred to you

279
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,754
that they might just have
surrendered Mishima´s double to us?

280
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,272
Can someone say something?
The silence is driving me nuts.

281
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,311
I wasn´t talking to you, so shut up!

282
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,833
You crazy bastard!

283
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,313
Cool it, OK?

284
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,869
Well, it´s the truth, he is crazy.

285
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,112
If you´re getting nervous,
spit it out.

286
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,349
Sure!

287
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,952
Andrew, cut it out!

288
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,917
Go ahead - feel sorry
for a guy who kills for fun!

289
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,274
Oh, shit!

290
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,154
I don´t feel good about this, guys.

291
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,513
Stay calm.

292
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,235
It´s all right. Just drive slowly.

293
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,153
Everything´s going to be all right.

294
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,876
- My God!
- Reverse!

295
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,512
Are they rescuing
or killing the bastard?!

296
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,754
Move it!

297
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,594
- We´re dead!
- No!

298
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,995
Straight ahead! Gimme that!

299
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,353
Chaaaarge!

300
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,957
I haven´t had
so much fun in ages!

301
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,238
- Enough! We have to get going!
- Yes, sir!

302
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,834
- It´s an ambush!
- Get him.

303
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,759
Take cover!

304
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,193
Move!

305
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,352
Enemy at 12 o´clock!

306
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,713
Forward!

307
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,316
There´s too many of them!

308
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,753
Get back!

309
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,997
Listen to me! I am your messiah,
I´ve come to usher in a new era.

310
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,875
Hail to Mishima! Hail to
the Messiah, master of the new era!

311
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,919
- Hail to the new era!
- Hail, hail!

312
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,998
Hang on, my children!

313
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,113
For I will take away
the sins of the world.

314
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,913
Move it!

315
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,756
Come with me!
We can still save this world!

316
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,393
Let us die together! Father,
we are coming! Our time is coming!

317
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,073
Tony!

318
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,439
Arthur!

319
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,512
Andrew!

320
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,398
- Andrew, no!
- He´s already dead!

321
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,039
Andrew!

322
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,789
Sato, come in, please.

323
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,236
Sato, are you there?
Please, respond!

324
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,878
He´s dead, you motherfucker!
And so are all your men!

325
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,957
Recognise my voice, Arthur?
This is Uncle Lone speaking.

326
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,152
I´m the commander
of Red Sun in Europe.

327
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,278
Right now, we´re inside
the Chinese Embassy.

328
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,994
We´ve taken your ambassador hostage.

329
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,709
Bring our master here
within two hours

330
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,838
or we´ll start executing
every hostage here!

331
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,396
Talk to him, Tammy!

332
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,272
Arthur, don´t listen to him,
it´s a trap!

333
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,833
Goddamit!

334
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,798
Thank you, dear. You just gave him
another reason to come over here.

335
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,953
You poor girl. You always get
yourself into the wrong places.

336
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,828
And now you must pay
for my kindness.

337
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,913
Master.

338
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,351
Let him go, Arthur.

339
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,636
Release all the hostages first.

340
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,155
You´re in no position to bargain.

341
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,715
I´m ready for the worst.

342
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,599
We´re ready to die for our master.

343
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,273
Long live the Messiah!

344
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,353
You are brave. Tammy looks at you
as some kind of hero.

345
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,156
You´re tough enough to come here
alone to save all these hostages.

346
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,119
You know that their lives
depend entirely on you.

347
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,719
Tammy, you were right about him.

348
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,593
Arthur!

349
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,156
Why don´t you join us?

350
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,073
It´s pointless to serve
their worthless cause.

351
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,832
We can turn this into a new world -
a better world.

352
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,516
I´ve no interest in serving your
cause. You´re a bunch of madmen.

353
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,876
Be careful of what you say.

354
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,753
Arthur!

355
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,076
Let him go or I´ll shoot!

356
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,518
- Shoot me instead.
- Sit down.

357
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,758
I represent the Chinese people,
and she´s Chinese.

358
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,431
If you intend to shoot her,
you must shoot me first.

359
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,432
This for someone
who deserted China!

360
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,795
Did you know that?

361
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,793
She´s still Chinese.

362
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,555
Tasta! Just get it over with!

363
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,748
Uncle Lone, don´t listen to him.
I still believe you´re on our side.

364
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,355
I´ll count to three,
and you´ll let him go.

365
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,557
One... two... three!

366
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,278
Let him go, Arthur.

367
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,357
Go on, shoot.
He´s not afraid to die.

368
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,753
Arthur. Arthur!

369
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,072
One...

370
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,992
- Arthur!
- Two...

371
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,554
All right!

372
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,718
I´m free!

373
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,270
Long live the new Messiah! Hail!

374
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,829
Hail! Hail! Hail!

375
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,677
- Tasta.
- Yes, sir.

376
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,711
Well done.

377
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,914
Since I am the new Messiah,

378
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,430
it´s my duty to send the unworthy
to their deaths.

379
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,071
I already gave you a chance,
but you refused to be saved.

380
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,913
Now it´s time to say goodbye to this
world and those you tried to save.

381
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,519
Arthur!

382
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,159
Arthur!

383
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,719
Arthur!

384
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,391
Hang in there, buddy!

385
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,748
Someone get me out of this thing.

386
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,519
Let him go,
I said let him go, you bastard!

387
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,715
Let him go!

388
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,149
Tammy, it´s all right!
Look, it´s me!

389
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,196
I´m here! It´s all right!

390
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:21,593
- Let´s get out of here.
- I have to stay. Join the others.

391
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,233
It´s the police.

392
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,154
Please don´t. Don´t shoot us!

393
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,790
Don´t... don´t...

394
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,593
Great, help´s here!

395
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,758
Hey, over here, guys!

396
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,832
We got rid of the terrorists!
Come on!

397
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,510
Come on down, it´s all right!

398
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,433
Get down!

399
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,993
What´s going on?

400
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,475
They won´t let us
leave the compound.

401
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,996
- Where´s Arthur?
- He´s still inside.

402
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,398
No, Miss Chan, come back here!

403
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,638
Tammy! Tammy!

404
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,399
Arthur?

405
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,149
Arthur!

406
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,635
Tammy!

407
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,717
Arthur... Tammy.

408
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,476
Look, Tammy,
I've got your hero's trousers again!

409
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,036
Come on, Arthur!
Catch me if you can.

410
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,550
- You can´t catch me!
- Give it back, Andrew.

411
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,116
Hey, wait for me.
Arthur, don't leave me!
