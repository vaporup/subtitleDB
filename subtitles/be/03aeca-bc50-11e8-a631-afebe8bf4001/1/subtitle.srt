1
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,188
Frank you betrayer

2
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:57,597
I'll be back for you, Kishudo

3
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,112
Now, you're the only ones left with me

4
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,884
Frank will soon reveal everything

5
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,580
about you to Kishudo

6
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,120
Through the years I have trained
over 30 assassins

7
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,493
They are experts in martial arts
and Japanese "Ninjutsu"

8
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:56,898
Excluding those who died & those
who betrayed us

9
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,464
These assassins are scattered
all over the worid

10
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:02,035
It's crucial that I know their whereabouts

11
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,403
before Kishudo does

12
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:07,609
or else...

13
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,710
So you want to kill them all?

14
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,274
I'll kill whoever betrays me

15
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,082
We've a secret contact

16
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,710
For all our assassins

17
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,783
He's Snooker
He'd been sent to Northeastern China

18
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,888
Yet we lost him in the past decades

19
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,087
Snooker knows everything
about each of you

20
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:30,396
Yet, where is he now?

21
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:34,470
To fetch him, you must find his woman

22
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:37,069
They fell in love and born him a daughter

23
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,469
Thus he fled, for this is against our rules

24
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,178
Let us go, please

25
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:45,880
Can not

26
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,419
Then shall never

27
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,227
fall in love with another

28
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,824
but us - The Eight Hundred Dragons

29
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,834
I wonder if all of you think this way

30
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,270
I, Choker

31
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,503
I, Chimer

32
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,108
I, Teddy

33
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:19,778
I, Huntress

34
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,208
Swear that we'll never betray the group

35
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,280
and you, Master

36
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,752
Or else, May we be slain in the worse
possible way?

37
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:48,239
How many times have I told you, Pearl?

38
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,640
That you shouldn't be eavesdropping on us

39
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,507
What's the matter? I'll be one of you
eventually

40
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:53,607
Shut-up

41
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:54,908
Yes, Master

42
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:57,944
Master

43
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:01,651
Don't panic

44
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,158
I indulged in the magic of disguise

45
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,459
when I was young

46
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,891
Now I ended up

47
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:18,095
with a distorted face

48
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,973
Chimer

49
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:25,573
Yes, Master

50
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:29,573
Don't commit the same mistake as I did

51
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,712
Take it easy,
you still have a long way to go

52
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,886
Pearl

53
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,522
I swear I will kill Frank

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,937
Frank, your death will come soon

55
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:05,282
We are closing up, sir

56
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,720
Don't panic, I don't need any help here
any more, go

57
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:19,463
It's been a long time since we last met
May, where's Snooker?

58
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:21,865
I've long lost touch with him

59
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,194
Well, how about that letter in your hand?

60
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:30,973
Red Square, Moscow, USSR

61
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,984
Yes, yes

62
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,793
Photo, 10 Roubles a piece

63
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,140
May I take a photo with him?

64
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,507
Sure, of course

65
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:02,533
Queenie, somebody wants a photo

66
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:07,409
Ready?

67
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,718
Look at this! We've made such a fortune

68
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:15,989
in such a short time

69
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:19,261
I've told you

70
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,929
Rubles? Change for Rubles?

71
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,729
No, no we can't

72
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,860
Hey you nuts? That's U.S. dollars

73
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,125
Yeah, Yeah

74
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:31,768
Oh! I see

75
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,002
You sure it's alright?

76
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,004
Of course

77
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,209
What are you two doing?
That's illegal...

78
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,515
My goodness, the police! Run

79
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:46,549
Uncle, come on, hurry up

80
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,278
Hurry up

81
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:53,090
Yes, hurry, hurry

82
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:58,428
Get on the train, go

83
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:00,531
Go! I'll be alright, go

84
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:07,600
Hey, here

85
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,172
You two hurry up, I'll take care of uncle

86
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,542
Damn it, you just can't fight with age

87
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,708
You go...

88
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,475
So you take care

89
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:16,774
Come on, hurry up

90
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:19,549
Hey, hey...

91
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,170
Yao, here, come on

92
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:42,935
Come on

93
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,858
Queenie, what takes Yao so long?

94
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,224
Would the snow block the way?

95
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,793
No way, hold this, now wait and see

96
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:10,834
Yao

97
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:11,496
It's freezing out there

98
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:13,472
how about a heart warming hug?

99
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:15,874
Stop it right there, pal

100
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,476
He's looking at you, kid

101
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,016
Queen, go get your dad's favorite

102
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,176
outfit for Yao

103
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,449
Sure, sure

104
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:31,823
Yao's gift for me?

105
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,387
Yao

106
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,290
Shhh... Keep this our secret

107
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:40,897
Put the clothes on

108
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,498
You'll take it, alright?

109
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,451
Wow... Smells Good!

110
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:07,929
Not bad. Very becoming

111
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,596
I was wearing the same outfit
the first time I met your mother

112
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,766
Let's have some turkey first, shall we?

113
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,296
Let's make a wish before we start

114
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:21,003
Close your eyes, don't peep

115
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,148
I wish that we'll never be apart

116
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:33,683
Attack!

117
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,221
Keep the outfit. Take it as a Xmas gift

118
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:39,823
Thanks, Uncle

119
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,623
Do you blame me for not getting you
any Xmas present?

120
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:46,726
Haven't you given me your heart already?

121
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,170
You mean it?

122
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:51,703
What are you doing?

123
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,234
How about me?

124
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:56,535
So you're in too?

125
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:58,977
Your so bad...

126
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,243
Bye

127
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:03,846
Hello...

128
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,580
It's been such a long time
do you still remember me?

129
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:11,991
The Master of the Dead?

130
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:16,932
You thought you could escape from me
by hiding in Russia?

131
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,268
Hello, hello

132
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:55,462
Master?

133
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:56,997
No

134
00:11:58,641 --> 00:11:59,232
Who are you?

135
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,433
I'm one of the Kishudo's people

136
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:02,434
Hector?

137
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,307
Record of all the assassins trained
by the Eight Hundred Dragons

138
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,003
What record?

139
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:07,844
Maybe you'll remember this

140
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:12,912
How did you get this?

141
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:14,420
From her dead body

142
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,227
You'll better be cooperative
or I'll send you to meet her

143
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,560
Did I ever say no? Let's go

144
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,965
Hurry, where's the record

145
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:29,936
Don't you dare to play games with me

146
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,670
No, I'm not.

147
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,736
It's just over there.

148
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,074
Get up, bring me there.

149
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:38,904
Bastard!

150
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,673
I'll kill you if I don't see it tonight

151
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,494
So you're from the Master of Dead?

152
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,627
I come to send you to hell

153
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,149
Where's the Cello?

154
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,620
May, look at this

155
00:13:58,894 --> 00:13:59,622
It's from Yao

156
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,657
For me

157
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:03,662
Yao gave this to you?

158
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,159
Come out?

159
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,245
What?

160
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,842
You smart-ass

161
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,489
Snooker

162
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:46,126
Spare my family please, Master

163
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:47,826
Take my life, if you want to

164
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:51,269
Bring Kishudo's Hector up the train to me

165
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:52,597
Yes

166
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,240
I want you to bring one more person up
the train

167
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:57,770
Who do you want, Master

168
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,776
A friend of your daughter, Yao

169
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:05,946
Something wrong?

170
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:06,779
You're so quiet today

171
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,712
So unlike you

172
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,083
Dad & I are leaving for Japan

173
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,322
We might not return thereafter

174
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,585
You'll be thrilled

175
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:14,693
Imagine all the shopping you can do

176
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:16,321
Is that it? That's all

177
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:17,288
What else do you want?

178
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:21,160
Japan? You're sure you have to go?
but why?

179
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:23,434
The pollce is after dad

180
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,200
Quite bad this time

181
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,298
We may never be together again anymore

182
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:29,411
Can you help me with one thing?

183
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,744
We'll act as of we've leaving for Leningrad

184
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:34,776
You & Yao will cover us in boarding

185
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,114
The train

186
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,714
We'll jump off the train half way

187
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,448
We'd definitely help you, friends, right

188
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:43,487
I'll miss you

189
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:56,629
We should have come together

190
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:58,204
They might not be able to go pass
the police

191
00:16:58,908 --> 00:16:59,772
Don't worry.

192
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:00,999
They'll make it here

193
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,402
Let's get in first

194
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:13,355
* Train from Moscow to Leningrad

195
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:15,880
is about to leave *

196
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,090
Shall we get the tickets first?

197
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,117
Good idea

198
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:20,017
Hold me

199
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:23,588
What?

200
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:25,693
I've seen that man before in the subway

201
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:27,630
Who's he?

202
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:29,401
I saw him kill someone

203
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:30,705
Wait here for me

204
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,699
I'll fetch them out there

205
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,757
And where's Yao?

206
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:56,724
I don't know

207
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,592
No time for hide and seek now
board the train first

208
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:01,494
No, we have to wait for Yao

209
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,301
Don't create trouble

210
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,234
Get on the train

211
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,007
Come on, hurry up

212
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,472
Uncle, Yao may still be waiting

213
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:13,848
out there

214
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:14,808
We'll fetch him

215
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:28,263
Yao, hurry up

216
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,588
Come on, hurry up

217
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:36,264
This is yours

218
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,501
While here's yours, and this, yours

219
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:44,679
Why, are we sitting separate seats?

220
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:46,405
Yao and I each at one end of the train

221
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,976
While you & Queenie stay in the middle

222
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,909
Sitting together will only invite suspicion

223
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,209
Anyway, you can move to his car

224
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,476
after we left the train

225
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,802
So you are the Manchurian?

226
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:14,800
Yes

227
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,851
Hector, where to go?

228
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,121
Remember I told you this during training

229
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,488
That I'll personally kill

230
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:32,316
whoever betrays me?

231
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,920
Well, let's see

232
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:00,713
It's for you

233
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,998
You made this last night?

234
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,762
I promised you this
for your next trip didn't I?

235
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,568
But, I'd stolen the materials from you

236
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,510
and threw them away

237
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:28,614
May, you don't have to be so nice to me

238
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:30,609
I don't deserve that

239
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:34,983
Queenie, you're the only family I have
besides Yao

240
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,263
But... You know the reason
why I wanted you here?

241
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,661
Because someone wants to kill Yao

242
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:47,932
No, they can't do that

243
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:50,870
This is the record you want

244
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:54,266
Yao has already boarded the train

245
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,538
He is in the first car

246
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,107
Both Yao & May are orphans

247
00:20:59,782 --> 00:21:01,215
I brought them up since they were kids

248
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:07,253
Good job, very clear and to the point

249
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:09,787
Oh, my pleasure

250
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,356
Actually, when you didn't punish me
despite what I had done

251
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:16,386
I'll do what you said

252
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,866
By the way

253
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,066
What's the point of bringing Yao to you?

254
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:25,429
I saw him once in the red square
he's get the right potential

255
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,103
I can train him to be the top assassin

256
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,303
of The Eight Hundred Dragon

257
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:31,343
But... this is a secret

258
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,378
that's supposed to be kept by me alone

259
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,467
Dad, something I must talk with you

260
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,467
Yao doesn't love me at all

261
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:01,765
He loves May

262
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:05,577
I was just a secret admirer...

263
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:12,444
Dad, Dad!

264
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,084
Daddy!!!

265
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:31,668
Queenie, Queenie!!!

266
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:32,799
How are you doing? Queenie!!

267
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:36,407
Yao! Yao!

268
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,245
Uncle, why are you here?

269
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:44,516
Uncle, are you ok?

270
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:47,988
Uncle! Uncle!

271
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:52,724
I came to pick you up

272
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:58,698
Why pick me, I don't even know you

273
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,136
Come on, come on...

274
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:14,673
Go to sleep

275
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,378
Run? How can you run away from me?

276
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,118
Yao! Yao!

277
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,593
Do you know the murdered?

278
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:32,600
No, I don't know

279
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:36,237
Can you recognize that murderer?

280
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:36,870
No

281
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,606
Is your name May Yip?

282
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:40,970
Yes, May Yip

283
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:42,937
Do you know a person called Yao?

284
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:44,871
No

285
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:50,150
Well, but we are informed that

286
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,146
your friends were being hurt after

287
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:59,389
as such, you were trying to assist them
to flee the USSR

288
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:00,887
Is that right?

289
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,753
No that's not true

290
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,567
No! No!

291
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:40,663
Who are you?

292
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:41,926
Take all these stupid pins away

293
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,235
I'm your saviour

294
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,434
Poor thing, your are sick

295
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,037
Bull shit!

296
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:48,508
I've never been sick in my life

297
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:50,743
Big deal

298
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,410
Who do you think you are?

299
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:55,510
I'm... Well... I don't recall

300
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:56,748
Don't play smart ass with me.
Tell me if you know who I am

301
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,349
Of course I do.
You have problem remembering

302
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:01,252
You've a problem with your past memory

303
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,152
You've lost them

304
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,849
Look at all this clogged blood from you

305
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:06,985
You mean that's my blood

306
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:08,625
That's the only way to cure you

307
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:11,091
You devil!

308
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Stop pinching into my head & my chest

309
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,327
Who the hell are you? Speak!

310
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:15,731
I'm not telling you

311
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,803
Speak! Who am I?

312
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:20,941
You're a Vietnamese refugee
illegal immigrant

313
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:22,305
I'm a refugee?

314
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:23,809
No, I don't believe you

315
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:25,779
Tell me the truth, who am I?

316
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:27,507
Go to sleep, my friend

317
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:35,789
Eight Hundred Dragon secret base

318
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,731
Good day, my friend

319
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,625
Wow, you always cook desserts
in the morning?

320
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,263
That's ink, pal

321
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:51,300
That can last my life?
Who's working so hard?

322
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:53,197
Your another savior

323
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:56,840
Come help me

324
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:57,367
Sure

325
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:01,781
Just the right thing for barbecue

326
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:02,677
Over my dead body

327
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:04,548
Take it easy, kid

328
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,287
Don't you have better things to do, Pearl

329
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,649
You still haven't told me about who I am

330
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:11,155
Your mother is a whore

331
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:12,992
And your father is just another
Vietnamese soldier

332
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:14,926
You still have six brothers & sisters

333
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,260
My mom is a whore

334
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,164
And my dad is a nameless soldier

335
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:24,570
and six brothers & sisters?

336
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:29,501
If my mom's a whore then isn't my dad
a pervert?

337
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,412
That means I'm the son of a bitch.
Damn it

338
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:34,238
Hello

339
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,210
What? Watch me well

340
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:37,913
Starting tomorrow, you'll have to work
like this

341
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,116
Why should I listen to you?

342
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,113
You think you're god

343
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:41,448
Look at you

344
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,990
You've the most obnoxious face
I've ever seen

345
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,359
You've an obsolete style of clothing
and the height of a dwarf

346
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:48,218
For a while I thought you're Frankenstein

347
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:51,526
I'm telling you. I'm leaving-for Vietnam

348
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,830
Be my guest

349
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:54,659
Sure enough

350
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:57,494
Watch out, pal

351
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:08,948
My goodness,
who the hell are these characters

352
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,054
Damn old fool. Why are you locking
one of my feet?

353
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:19,587
Because my feet is locked to the other end
of the lock

354
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:20,628
Alright then, but I'd rather be locked

355
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:21,253
with Pearl

356
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,393
Thanks a lot! But I prefer freedom

357
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:24,190
to being "imprisoned"

358
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,558
That's right! I'm imprisoned here

359
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:27,198
You'd be glad, you're in the biggest jail
on Earth

360
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:28,432
I'm not staying. I'm leaving for Vietnam

361
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:31,132
Hey, wrong direction, Vietnam should be
over there on the other side

362
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,064
I have to go home

363
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:33,807
My mom is a whore. Dad's a pervert

364
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:35,701
I even got six brothers & sisters
what a bastard I am

365
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:37,068
I gotta go back to Vietnam

366
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:38,744
My mom is a whore. Dad's a pervert

367
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,604
I even got six brothers & sisters
what a bastard I am

368
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,114
My mom is a whore. Dad's a pervert

369
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:44,044
I even got six brothers & sisters
what a bastard I am

370
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:45,719
I gotta go back to Vietnam

371
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:48,812
I gotta go back to Vietnam

372
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,519
Watch out for traps

373
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:51,820
I have six brothers & sisters

374
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,991
Dad's a bastard and mom's a pervert

375
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:56,091
I'm going to Vietnam, my dad's a bastard

376
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,331
Mom's a pervert & I've got 6 brothers
and sisters

377
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,962
I gotta go back to Vietnam

378
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:01,233
Watch out, my friend

379
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:03,501
My dad's a bitch & I've got 6 brothers

380
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:05,398
Damn it, this thing is wired

381
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:11,204
What happen?

382
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,041
The fence is electrified

383
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:14,974
How big is it?

384
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:16,612
It covers the whole forest

385
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:19,110
Has any fool been caught before?

386
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:20,451
No, you're the first fool

387
00:28:23,124 --> 00:28:23,886
Hey, what's happening to me?

388
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:25,693
The old fool is pulling you at your back

389
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:27,287
Watch out for traps

390
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:28,555
So I'm dead meat

391
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,797
Watch out!

392
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,132
Oh, my goodness, help

393
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:38,801
What are you searching for?

394
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:40,841
My mom, damn it

395
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,633
Over there, then go

396
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:43,468
What do you mean?

397
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:44,640
Didn't you say you want your mom?

398
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,841
You old bastard, you'd better let me go
right away

399
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,115
You young "bastard"
I guess you'd better stay

400
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:51,375
He's the boss, pal

401
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:54,846
Birdie, don't go

402
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:59,250
Come on, don't play hide & seek with me

403
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:01,827
Silly girl, playing with a bird all night

404
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,358
See? Where to go, Birdie?

405
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:08,634
And the old fool's been strolling all night

406
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,296
A funny girl & an old fool...

407
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,237
Everything is so unreal here

408
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:15,801
Where exactly am I?

409
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,008
Could I be dead already?

410
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,312
What do you want, old fool?

411
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:26,178
What's going on?

412
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,554
Let me down

413
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:51,574
Damn you, why are you tying me up here

414
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:53,609
To sleep

415
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,106
What? This is called "murder"

416
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:57,175
Don't you understand?

417
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,913
No. This is good for your health

418
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:00,045
Good for my health,
the biggest bull shit I've ever heard

419
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:02,023
Where do you folks sleep?

420
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:03,219
Don't you have proper beds?

421
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:04,248
No, we don't

422
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:07,050
How about the one I slept on last night?

423
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:07,728
Burned to ashes

424
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:08,988
Idiots

425
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:11,964
And now what?

426
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:12,724
See whether you'll respond

427
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:13,730
Of course I will, I'm still alive

428
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:18,996
Your're all crazy!!
Just why are you staring at me, kid?

429
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,635
See how long you can withstand, pal

430
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:30,741
My waist is going to break

431
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:36,949
Of all my students

432
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:38,147
You're the one with the worst sleeping manner

433
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,588
Sleeping manner

434
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:40,556
I salivate, so what!

435
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:43,125
Smells good

436
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:48,159
Gee, you use your feet for cooking

437
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,263
I've to, or we'll have nothing for dinner

438
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:52,463
I wasn't even allowed to think about
dinner when I first arrived

439
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:54,736
Of course, I can tell from your height
that you were deprived

440
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,039
Your skeleton should be around 5'7"

441
00:30:57,712 --> 00:30:59,043
However, you're now only 4'11. 5'

442
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,281
That old man is bad

443
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,776
If he uses two hands to walk

444
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,417
It means that he moves like crocodiles

445
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:09,150
If you can't interchange the function
of your limbs

446
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,953
It's better not to use them at all

447
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:12,085
Bull shit

448
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:13,051
Come on, eat

449
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:14,026
Sure

450
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:16,496
It's delicious

451
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:20,392
It stinks

452
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:30,440
Run, pal

453
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:33,636
Don't you want to unreel it first?

454
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:35,210
Potatoes only?

455
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,116
Stop complaining! This one is already
hard to get

456
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,646
Don't be mean. I'm sure you can get
something else

457
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:40,847
Bird's meat would be great

458
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:43,024
Don't even think about it.

459
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,021
Hey, I just said "bird",
I didn't say "Birdie" did I?

460
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,692
How come you like Birdie more than me

461
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:51,191
Of course, so stop talking or I'll stop stealing
food for you

462
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,467
I'll fart after I eat potato

463
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:56,027
May be you won't come, try and see

464
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,400
I'll fell better if both of us fart

465
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:05,179
You're terrible

466
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:07,976
Didn't you fart?

467
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,283
No, I didn't

468
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,216
and you didn't either

469
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,913
That means... Who did it?

470
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:16,148
Who else? I did

471
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:16,889
Shit!

472
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,819
Let him go, I stole the potatoes

473
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:38,540
What did I do wrong again?

474
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:39,509
You eat without being permitted

475
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,379
Let me down. I formally challenge you
for a duel

476
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,411
Shut up

477
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:44,310
Come on, a duel

478
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:47,348
Think before you say, you want a duel

479
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:49,313
You coward!

480
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:50,319
I know you'll chicken out

481
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,783
Not bad yelling so much,
after all these hours of hanging up side down

482
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:54,420
Go and fetch the old bastard

483
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,827
Old bastard! I'm going to kill you!

484
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:03,167
How would you like to fight, old fool?

485
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:05,130
Take this

486
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:08,542
With this? You're dead meat

487
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:10,141
Come on

488
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,004
Watch out, old fool, don't blink!

489
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,249
Are you dancing or exercising?

490
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:24,052
I'm not eating tonight

491
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:24,884
If I can't beat you

492
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:25,850
Pearl

493
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:31,395
Ok, I'll eat a little

494
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,996
Before we fight

495
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:34,900
What sort of food is this?

496
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:36,265
Shut up

497
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:38,902
Pick a color! Red or white

498
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,839
Red of course, that's my lucky color

499
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:42,670
Whatever color you pick

500
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:44,775
You are fated to lose tonight

501
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:54,446
Come on...

502
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:33,959
Not bad, at least you look like
a civilized african

503
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:36,661
What's so funny about that?

504
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:38,387
Remember you say you'd not eat

505
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,032
if you couldn't beat me

506
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:41,561
I mean what I said

507
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:44,169
But my body doesn't agree

508
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:49,573
Yeah, crocodile walk, yeah

509
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:02,690
How dare you come in

510
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:03,713
while I'm bathing

511
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,954
Would you stop staring?

512
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:08,854
You don't have to check me out

513
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,052
I'm just a normal guy

514
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:13,166
Don't be hysterical.
I do this to old Master all the time

515
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:14,626
Big deal. How do I know?

516
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:15,863
If he's male or female?

517
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:19,002
Come on, have some, he won't notice

518
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:21,939
No, I have to keep my word

519
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,234
Tough

520
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:25,743
If you want to find out about yourself,

521
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,475
If you want to leave

522
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:29,447
Then you must learn from me

523
00:35:29,717 --> 00:35:30,479
If I learn from you?

524
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,919
Wow... Seen everything!!! Not bad

525
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:41,456
What are we rushing for?

526
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:42,691
Food, there'll be nothing left
if we don't rush

527
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,026
What's he doing now?

528
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:45,390
Frying walnuts

529
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:47,163
He uses his hands to fry walnuts?

530
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:48,458
Have one

531
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:50,460
It's hot

532
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:01,381
There must be some tricks here

533
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,382
Either in his hands or in the pan

534
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:05,649
Why don't you find out yourself

535
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:09,980
Try

536
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,349
Whatever you say

537
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:17,158
Put some effort into it.

538
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,264
Didn't I tell you? You just didn't listen

539
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:23,433
The trick must be in his hands

540
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:25,498
Of course not, I'd have known
if there is any

541
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:26,665
Don't fool me

542
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:29,033
So this is our dinner tonight?

543
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,002
That is if you fry them well

544
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:38,247
Big deal, watch me

545
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,313
Do I look that stupid?

546
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:46,591
You've to learn to see with your heart

547
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,019
Instead of your eyes

548
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:52,164
And be able to face any enemy regardless
of where you are

549
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:55,164
Listen with the heart, see with the heart

550
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:59,834
Detect the enemy, beat the enemy

551
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:02,638
Listen with the heart, see with the heart

552
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:07,013
Detect the enemy, beat the enemy

553
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:10,043
Concentrate! Or else how can you
possibly win?

554
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:11,242
I must win

555
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:13,452
I must win

556
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:16,484
* My morale is being boosted *

557
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:19,850
* My blood is burning from within *

558
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:24,024
* I must break through darkness

559
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,963
and start my eternal fight against tyranny *

560
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,200
* That I will try my best

561
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,902
to uphold the righteousness *

562
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:36,603
* I'll do whatever I can

563
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:39,511
to make my dream care true *

564
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:43,377
* A free man *

565
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:46,479
* To be a free man *

566
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,148
* A free man *

567
00:37:51,192 --> 00:37:57,153
* To be a free man *

568
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:06,704
The pain proves that I'm still human

569
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:10,368
What are you doing?

570
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:12,637
Good thing! I'm cooking the bird

571
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,676
I've saved half for you

572
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,417
How dare you! You cook Birdie

573
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,519
Of course I won't

574
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,517
God knows I didn't

575
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,419
Pearl

576
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,256
Birdie!

577
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,729
Pearl, listen, I didn't cook your Birdie

578
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,057
Don't go there, electric fence's over there

579
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:34,432
Birdie

580
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:39,396
Watch out,

581
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:48,381
Birdie

582
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,348
Silly girl, why are you crying?

583
00:38:54,856 --> 00:38:55,686
Birdie died?

584
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:00,717
Guess what's this?

585
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:03,293
Birdie

586
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:07,966
No, it's not. Birdie is not Indian

587
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,302
What? Wrong color?

588
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:11,964
Well it's not quite white or gray

589
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:14,268
Go back down, leave me alone

590
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:24,409
Look, Birdie knows you miss him too

591
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:25,650
Hello, Birdie

592
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:27,215
Hello, Birdie

593
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:29,414
- Please hold for me.
- Okay.

594
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:36,088
Why did you let Birdie go?

595
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:39,497
He's not Birdie, Birdie's here

596
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:43,165
He's like us too. Searching for freedom

597
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:45,628
Where are you going?

598
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,573
A Place where both Birdie & I
always wanted to go

599
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,739
I'll release you too once I know how

600
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:05,758
Dead Master is training somebody

601
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,585
to go against me and kill

602
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:09,696
Have you heard anything about this iately?

603
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:11,863
I've long lost touch with him

604
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,264
I don't know

605
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,462
If he really has that man

606
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:18,137
Then the dead Master will soon be strong

607
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:21,167
We have to stop this

608
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:24,110
You mean you want to kill him

609
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:29,408
If I don't kill him

610
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,051
He will kill me in return

611
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,788
He will never let me go

612
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,218
Don't forget. You've not alone

613
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:42,095
I betrayed him as well

614
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:50,170
I've shut off the electric fence
and wear this clothes

615
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,931
I'll cover you.
Old fool won't even notice it

616
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:57,242
Aren't you two going to sleep?

617
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,674
- Go...
- How about you?

618
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,205
I'll be fine, go

619
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:03,179
Shut up, go to sleep

620
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:08,318
- Pearl, hurry up.
- Go. Pal... go!

621
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:09,380
And remember

622
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,488
When you find your way out,

623
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,786
you have to return to set me free
- I promise I will! - Don't forget!

624
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:17,786
Off I go! Take care

625
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:31,169
How could you do this to me?

626
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:34,498
Don't blame me, clear?

627
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:46,747
You send for help? I know how to
send for help too!

628
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:52,191
Master!

629
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:54,458
Not bad, old fool, you've got quite some help

630
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,702
What happen to you, Pearl?

631
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:13,937
I purposely come back for you

632
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:18,107
Pearl, listen to me,

633
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:20,378
Beside Birdie

634
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:21,652
You've also got a family here

635
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:23,889
That's me, your pal

636
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:25,485
Didn't you always call me pal?

637
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:28,994
Pearl... Listen to me!!

638
00:43:29,396 --> 00:43:30,761
Beside Birdie, you've still got...

639
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:34,830
Pearl!, Pearl!

640
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,977
Master are you alright?

641
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:44,939
I was injured

642
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:46,869
Listen, you must bring Yao away

643
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:48,741
I'll catch up with you later

644
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:11,094
Who are you?

645
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:15,402
The Dead Master
Who exactly are you?

646
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:31,518
You don't have to know me

647
00:44:31,826 --> 00:44:32,918
You just come with me

648
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,144
Who are you? Where's Pearl
and the Master?

649
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:31,181
The organization wants them dead

650
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:32,114
They won't live long anyway

651
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,344
Eight Hundred Dragon never killed
an innocent

652
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:36,017
What bull shit organization

653
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:21,992
How could you be so cruel?

654
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:22,764
To kill people even if it's an old lady

655
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:24,966
The enemy is an enemy. It doesn't matter
if it's a he or a she

656
00:46:38,152 --> 00:46:39,346
You have to learn to be more obedient

657
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:41,678
For the sake of the old Master and
The Eight Hundred Dragon?

658
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:43,351
You have to obey the organization

659
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:46,788
I only want to know who I am

660
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:49,856
You've become a assassin of the Eight
Hundred Dragon

661
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:51,227
The secret of who you are

662
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:53,691
will become your best drive

663
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,196
With immediate effect, you are one of us

664
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:37,868
You're called Freeman

665
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:42,802
Your first target is to kill

666
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,399
Hong Kong person, Lee Fung
