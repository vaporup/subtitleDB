1
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:02,481
Yao?

2
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,023
Last night outside a hotel in Tsimshatsui

3
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:10,495
Mr. Lee Fung

4
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,624
was attack by a man

5
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,528
His driver & a bodyguard
were also killed in the incident

6
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,272
The case is now with the homicide squad

7
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,835
Police also urge any citizen

8
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,934
who witness the incident to report

9
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,675
to police

10
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,910
- Who are you?
- Order delivery.

11
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,318
- Who are you?
- Teddy Wong

12
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:29,054
Your still trying to run!!

13
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,191
Why are you looking at my upper part?

14
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,359
Why are you looking at
my lower part first?

15
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,833
You two, stop looking at each other

16
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,805
- Look at me instead.
- Who's he?

17
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,744
He's your assistant Teddy Wong

18
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:42,977
Normally I won't assist those

19
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:44,680
Who can't beat me in 5 seconds

20
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:47,549
Well then, how long did he take?

21
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:48,716
I forget but I think he passed the exam

22
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:54,856
- Why are you staring at me?
- Well you staring at me first

23
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,929
Staring at you for I want to see clearly
what kind of fool are you

24
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,890
I'm staring at you for I'm wondering...

25
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:01,730
If I can tear your skin off this time

26
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,829
Come on, I Have been standing there
for a century

27
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:05,369
you guys are still staring at each other?

28
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,237
Shut up, you're only supposed to be
an assistant

29
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:09,073
My dear lady, I'm just reminding you

30
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,647
The Organization is very satisfied
with your work.

31
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,880
Your next target is the godfather

32
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,114
of the largest gang in Japan

33
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:23,220
Kishudo

34
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:26,921
Come check his details out

35
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:28,317
Ok

36
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,096
Mr. Kishudo

37
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:44,737
Where is Frank?

38
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:45,735
Mr. Kishudo

39
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:47,877
Who are you?

40
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,976
I'm police officer Sunny.
I am here to protect you

41
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,019
Protect me? It's not an easy job

42
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:55,452
That's my responsibility.

43
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:56,788
I'll do my best

44
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:58,253
They are my subordinates

45
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,150
Very well then, watch out for strangers
at the front door

46
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:01,785
Miss Huntress

47
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,301
Sir, your cigarette...

48
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,004
Be careful of the ashes. There is an
ashtray over there

49
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:20,605
Please use it

50
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,980
Ash tray, Boss

51
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:39,226
Mr. Kishudo

52
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:05,083
Protect Miss Huntress

53
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:41,994
Wait, I'll do it!

54
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:57,568
Mr. Kishudo! Mr. Kishudo! Mr. Kishudo!!

55
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:34,505
Yao!

56
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,185
Do you know that person?

57
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,358
- Is this the one?
- No

58
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,428
This?

59
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,859
No

60
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,272
- This?
- Yes

61
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:08,203
Miss Yip, we want a face

62
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:08,972
not a mask

63
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:12,285
Well, but that's what I can see

64
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:15,284
I can't possibly see through the mask

65
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:16,583
Then who's Yao?

66
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,686
Why did you keep calling his name

67
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,157
Because his physique reminding me of
an old friend

68
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,023
Then where is he now?

69
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,094
- Gone.
- Gone?

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,092
Please cooperate with us

71
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:30,296
We know everything about you

72
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:31,663
You're a Manchurian.
You used to live in the USSR

73
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:32,927
You fled to USA a year ago

74
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:34,901
Yet, what make you come to HK?

75
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,605
You can get the answer

76
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:37,610
in your file, sir

77
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,243
I come to teach dancing

78
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:41,510
You've seen his face

79
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:43,508
He'll definitely come back

80
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:45,607
I don't think he'll kill an innocent woman

81
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:49,387
Miss Yip could you put your confidence

82
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:50,585
into a stanger?

83
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,324
What did she say?

84
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,362
She didn't utter a word

85
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,730
You know how each of us invested in HK

86
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:05,731
If we don't finance your government

87
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,002
for another cross harbour tunnel

88
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,265
You probably have to swim across the
harbour everyday

89
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,539
We're responsible to protect Mr. Kishudo
3 hours ago

90
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:17,813
Now you're responsible

91
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:19,150
to arrest the murderer

92
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:21,686
- I understand...
- I'm sorry

93
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,704
If we have any further evidence

94
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:26,789
We'll keep you informed

95
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,956
Miss Yip, I've heard that you know,
the murderer

96
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,392
- No.
- Thats good then

97
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,528
because if you saw him,

98
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:38,838
he will definitely come after your life

99
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,363
He won't let you go

100
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,205
A good citizen

101
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,767
should always cooperate with the police

102
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,740
All I saw was a washed face

103
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,402
Everyday I live like a mad woman

104
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:16,965
I wore this sweater with Yao's close up
printed on the front

105
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,209
I went searching for him. They all thought
I'd lost my mind

106
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:21,341
But I simply couldn't think of

107
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,605
any other way besides this

108
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:26,650
They arrested me 4-5 times

109
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,554
They locked me up and kept asking

110
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,147
But I never gave up

111
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,822
I knew that he would not desert me

112
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,196
Unless he died

113
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,598
I lived like this for an year

114
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:50,799
He's not dead. I feel, we've been
getting closer

115
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,540
The man I saw today, could that be him?

116
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,774
But the Yao I knew would never kill

117
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,096
- It's you.
- Yes, me. Miss Yip

118
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:55,338
You come to kill me?

119
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,306
I'm sorry, If you didn't see me and
identify me,

120
00:11:58,812 --> 00:11:59,744
I wouldn't have to kill you.

121
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,408
Are you Yao?

122
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:04,639
No, my name is Freeman

123
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,511
Always wearing a mask & killing

124
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,751
And you think free?

125
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,785
I don't know, anyway

126
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:12,951
You'll be my first woman to kill

127
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,526
May I have a better look at you?

128
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,891
I want to know you're not Yao

129
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,394
Alright, look carefully

130
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,906
I'm May Yip

131
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:37,409
You've never seen me before?

132
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:38,373
Yes I have

133
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:39,814
Outside hotel

134
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,354
Do you remember me, then?

135
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,083
I remember you always

136
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:45,622
I have to kill you then

137
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,297
Yao

138
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:46,511
Why do you always shoot from the back

139
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:47,983
Alright, I'll do it again in the front

140
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:50,515
I'll destroy this place

141
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:22,246
Tell me,
will you return to take me away with you

142
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:23,782
Isn't he taking you to the hospital now?

143
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:25,115
How about the last time?

144
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,856
So there was the last time

145
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:29,088
I told you you've met this woman before

146
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:30,963
Do you love me?

147
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:32,596
I'm sure he does

148
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:34,623
Yet he'll be in deep trouble if you're
not dead

149
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,023
Can you promise me one thing?

150
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,265
I'll promise whatever you say

151
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:42,434
Don't speak, you're bleeding

152
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:43,838
Close your eyes

153
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:45,303
Drive faster!

154
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,842
I'm driving very fast

155
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,646
I hate it when a gun is pointing at my head

156
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,774
Then don't pretend to be a hero.
Heroes can be assholes too.

157
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,281
Why didn't you kill the girl

158
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,253
Cause she looks good

159
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,020
I guess that's just natural

160
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,494
At that time, I indirectly killed an
innocent girl

161
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:03,825
I don't want another one

162
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:06,894
Then tell me

163
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:09,598
Are you falling for her?

164
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:11,626
I don't know, don't keep asking me

165
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:12,262
Are you falling for her?

166
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:13,601
I don't care whether you like her

167
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:14,901
She can identify you

168
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:16,603
You have to kill her, forget it

169
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,279
Mr. Frank will go to pay respect
to Kishudo this Wednesday

170
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:24,915
This will be your only chance

171
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:55,908
Mr. Frank

172
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:59,746
Hold my gun and wait out there

173
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:03,579
Both the dead and I want some peace

174
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:12,391
Here is my gun

175
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,142
Unmarried, you shouldn't have to be a nun

176
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,784
Sir, please donate some money

177
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,086
for renovating the church

178
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,553
Ok, for the beauty of your Angelic face

179
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,354
Keep it

180
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:53,530
Close the gate

181
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:29,233
Down!!

182
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,872
So you're that old fool's new student

183
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,100
You are the one to come for me

184
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,805
I came to avenge for Pearl

185
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:39,404
You were just lucky that time

186
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,008
You won't be so lucky today

187
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,346
Lets see who's lucky this time

188
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:49,980
Those who see me

189
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:51,045
I will kill them!

190
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:53,883
Those who see me

191
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,185
never want to kill me

192
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,045
Next time you go to a church,

193
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,253
Wear more clothes

194
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,256
You worried that I might catch a cold, dear?

195
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:02,890
I'm afraid God might like you too much!

196
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,189
What?

197
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,367
If I want you to hold me,

198
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,165
Will you always hold me like this?

199
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:15,967
Yes, of course I will

200
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,904
You have everything now

201
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:20,501
Quickly, send me to the hospital

202
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:22,474
I don't want to die here

203
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:24,981
Hurry up

204
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:39,789
Bow, second bow, third bow

205
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:44,199
Thanks from the family

206
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,184
Madam, there's something I've to tell you

207
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:10,062
Don't say anything.
You can tell me instead

208
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,962
Frank's my husband, leave this to me

209
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,374
Sunny, please this way

210
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:44,988
Sorry, but this is my duty

211
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,632
Yes, we are Triads

212
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:53,700
But Kishudo treated me very well

213
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:57,639
Even I didn't love my husband anymore

214
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,868
he was still my husband

215
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:06,449
If you need to search, please go ahead

216
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:07,545
Thanks for your cooperation

217
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:13,556
Although we didn't get along fine

218
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:15,825
I won't let anybody fool around

219
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,328
with your coffin

220
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:32,967
Search me instead if you insist

221
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,713
I am not a good woman anyway

222
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,441
I'm Frank's Wife, your not afraid?

223
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:08,043
Me? Of course not

224
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:14,517
You'll find I'm a lot of trouble

225
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,153
Oh? You bite or you fight?

226
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,392
Well you just won't find me easy

227
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,531
I don't think so! At least you're easy now

228
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:41,698
Though I didn't love Frank

229
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:45,974
he still was my husband

230
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:49,346
So please try your best

231
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,413
to arrest the murderer

232
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:56,318
Don't worry, that's my responsibility

233
00:24:57,022 --> 00:25:00,583
I don't want a murderer, I want a dead murderer!

234
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,460
I will only arrest the murderer alive

235
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:14,670
But, to bring in a dead murderer,

236
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,970
I won't be able to do it

237
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:21,708
I know you can do it,

238
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
because

239
00:25:23,182 --> 00:25:27,050
what we did earlier has been recorded

240
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:30,951
Why did you do this?

241
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,154
Well I've told you

242
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,129
I'm not a good woman

243
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:46,995
but I'm not ungrateful

244
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,666
Just that I have no other choice

245
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,374
Just that I have no other choice

246
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,268
I have no other choice

247
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:21,906
May I borrow your shampoo?

248
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:23,642
Sure

249
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,371
Cold? You look very pale

250
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,036
Yes, it's only 1 degree out there

251
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:31,540
- You switched on the cold water
- Yes, I know

252
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:35,382
- Oh, nothing. I thought the shower
was out of order. - Thanks

253
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:40,425
You handed me the conditioner

254
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:43,786
Wounded by bullet?

255
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,954
No, it's just an old wound

256
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:54,633
You didn't kill her

257
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:56,270
- I will kill her.
- Yes

258
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:14,549
You gonna save her? Kill me first!

259
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,526
I don't care what you say
I'm having fun here

260
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,695
Frollicking? Okay I won't interfere

261
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:22,960
Kill that woman

262
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,667
- Don't move!!!
- Yao

263
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:32,841
If anything happens to her

264
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:33,469
I'll kill you

265
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,370
Kill me then

266
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:39,513
Go

267
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:43,517
- It's mine turn now?
- Go to hell

268
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,047
Because of this sweater

269
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:11,208
I've been arrested a number of times

270
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,110
For being a hooker?

271
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:15,516
For disturbing social peace

272
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:17,947
I wore this day & night

273
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,252
Running around searching you

274
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:27,821
Also these Rubles are yours

275
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,590
Some extra left after you bought me
the Xmas present

276
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:33,704
You've been hanging on to this money
and the sweater?

277
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,203
Why did you get marry again?

278
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,808
Again, I wasn't even married to you

279
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:41,276
So you're not my wife
of course not

280
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,342
I don't get it, what a silly girl you are

281
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,480
What did you think they are doing

282
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,181
Throwing the garbage into the sea

283
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:54,392
You stupid, they are denying this wish

284
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:55,355
To a place

285
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,928
Wonder if they can get as far as USSR

286
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,264
Yeah, that reminds me of my childhood

287
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,926
I used to send my wishes to my mother

288
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:04,966
Stop bluffing. You are orphans

289
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,535
We grow up together in Russia

290
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:10,669
We don't know who were our parents

291
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:12,610
I almost forgot

292
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,037
You know everything about me

293
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:25,853
Here's a wish for you

294
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,617
You made this with the Rubles

295
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:34,061
Guess if I put some money in

296
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:35,929
you probably know better than I do

297
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,530
It's great I mean the atmosphere

298
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:11,430
I mean the food

299
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:37,885
Goodness the lighting makes me dizzy

300
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:39,060
After all that I'm glad

301
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,094
We are finally back together again

302
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:49,832
Hmm, it's strange

303
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,137
I feel I've been here before

304
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,278
- You remember?
- Remember what?

305
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:04,618
Start to count down from 30,29,28

306
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:08,524
29,28,27,26

307
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,285
People say it's best to make a wish
at midnight

308
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:11,187
Sure close your eyes

309
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,061
Alright

310
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,168
I wish that we'll never apart

311
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,800
19,18,17...

312
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,216
I wish I can always be with Yao

313
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:41,800
Merry Xmas!!!!

314
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,194
I sincerely wish that your silent night

315
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:54,168
can be a peaceful one

316
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:04,082
Why did you come out here?

317
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:05,943
I want to make a wish

318
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:07,574
A wish? What did you wish for?

319
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:10,680
I wish that we will never part

320
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:13,556
Lie. You've been eavesdropping on me

321
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:30,799
Stop, no, stop playing

322
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,434
May, if you never found me,

323
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:33,234
what would you do?

324
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,913
I'll continue looking for you

325
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:38,978
Till I'm old with white hair,
I'll still look for you

326
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:41,800
So, you'll be old and ugly

327
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
Even if you find me, I won't recognize you!

328
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:47,387
How did you think we'll spend our

329
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,459
Xmas Eve together when we grow old

330
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,323
Just like the old couple we met just now?

331
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,096
I think you like me very much

332
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:56,923
No, you'd like me more, Come on

333
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,471
This is a Hong Kong policeman

334
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,209
Have you ever seen him before?

335
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:17,913
Why are you crying?

336
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:21,715
It's you, your dripping saliva

337
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,294
You are wishing that we'll never apart

338
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,464
I'm wishing that we'll live happily
ever after

339
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:38,566
Oh, there's someone

340
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:54,854
Hardly ever in my life
I'd be nice to anybody

341
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:58,088
But I'll break it once for you. Car's is
over there. Go

342
00:33:59,097 --> 00:33:59,722
Thanks

343
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,730
Yao, there's a lot of weapons

344
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,528
- Hurry up
- Bye

345
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:12,406
May, I don't know where I should go

346
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:14,573
Tell me dear, do you want to come
with me

347
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,377
Even in death, I'll follow you.
Let's go

348
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,357
It's so dangerous for you to be with me

349
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:29,252
They are only after me

350
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:30,086
You better run for your life

351
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:33,390
I'm not leaving you

352
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:48,044
Hong Kong police, my name is Sunny

353
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:51,839
This guy has committed
serious criminal offence

354
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,345
We come to arrest him ok

355
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,869
This is Sunny from the Hong Kong police

356
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:20,774
Come, this guy committed serious offence

357
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:21,911
Please cooperate

358
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:25,813
We'll force our way in

359
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:36,960
What?

360
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:04,948
First unit get ready.

361
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:08,115
Fire

362
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:13,425
Don't cross the border

363
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:15,598
Stop! Before we fire

364
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:18,965
- How about now?
- Sit tight

365
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:56,036
Jump over here

366
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,900
- May! Jump!
- How about you?

367
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:01,108
Don't worry about me! Hurry up and jump!

368
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:08,678
Take care!

369
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:18,460
Yao!

370
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,750
Damn it, the car is gonna blow!
Jump on!! Quick!!

371
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:04,833
- That woman!
- Bring her out!

372
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,745
Go bring that woman back!

373
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:17,417
Why are you so cruel?

374
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:20,955
That's my way of handling problems

375
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,619
I believe in justice

376
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:24,920
Not power

377
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:26,894
Do you love me than?

378
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:28,028
I don't think this is the right time for
this topic

379
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,423
Fine, we'll cut the crap, just get her in car

380
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:36,833
Bring her to the car!!

381
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:45,341
Where is Yao?

382
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,808
You'll see him soon

383
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:53,857
Master, I've brought May here.

384
00:38:57,226 --> 00:39:03,000
You are the one Yao falls for?

385
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:19,710
Master, aren't we supposed to
get rid of her?

386
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:25,012
You are the one I should get rid of
betrayer!!

387
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,030
Don't panic. I won't kill you

388
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:45,673
For that I've to wait for Yao

389
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:52,710
Why did you bring me here?

390
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:54,999
This is where you came out!

391
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,800
If you want to rescue May
from the dead Master

392
00:39:57,622 --> 00:39:58,754
You simply have to go right back

393
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:03,753
Put this robe on

394
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,639
Yip, Let's see who's the Lucky one this time

395
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:23,008
It's either Yao or me

396
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:47,154
It's you!

397
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:50,017
I said that I'll personally kill

398
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,658
Any of my students

399
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:54,422
Well, my student kill me today

400
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:05,208
- Yao!
- May!!

401
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:14,076
Yao! Yao! So you have finally recovered
your memory!

402
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:15,410
Dont' say anymore

403
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,848
I don't want to know about the past

404
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:19,247
All I care now is that I am finally free

405
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:21,252
and deep in my heart I only wish

406
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,822
For one thing

407
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,094
I want you to come with me

408
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:28,162
Would you?
