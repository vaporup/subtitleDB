1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,487
We have seen a star in the east.

2
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,910
It told us
the Son of God is born.

3
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:58,779
Nativity Play/Sermon/Dinner

4
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:01,782
The Lord Jesus
was laid in a manger...

5
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,536
...to bring salvation
to the souls of those...

6
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,748
...with no place of their own.

7
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,209
Nothing is harder
than to have no place...

8
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:16,297
...but many are those
without one.

9
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:17,757
Tell me about it!

10
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:21,218
In their solitude,
they long for someone who will say:

11
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,678
"I want you to be here."

12
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,305
Not me, thanks.

13
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:25,598
Be quiet!

14
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:31,353
Jesus was born to offer those alone
a place in which to be alive!

15
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,567
"Joy to the world,
the food has come."

16
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:39,320
Gin! It's "the Lord has come"!

17
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,697
You don't know much, do you?

18
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:44,408
More than some faggot.

19
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:47,828
I am a mistake made by God.

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,664
In my heart, I am a woman.

21
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,708
Women can have children.

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,670
What if a miracle like
the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...

23
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:59,507
...was to happen to a homo?

24
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,180
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I'm eating for two.

25
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,123
Serves you right!

26
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,335
Miyuki!

27
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,547
Time to eat!

28
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,635
Miyuki!

29
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,222
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.

30
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,557
I am a woman.

31
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,601
And it's a waste
to spill food like that.

32
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,313
Don't just gobble your bread.

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,152
Eat it with love for the people
who made and brought it here.

34
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:05,531
I hate that Bible-thumping.
You're just like Akiko.

35
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:07,199
Who's Akiko?

36
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:09,952
My old lady.

37
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,911
Well!

38
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:12,997
Don't call your mother that.

39
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,416
Eat shit, you old fart.

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,918
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

41
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:19,920
That hurts! You old...

42
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:22,131
..."bag lady."

43
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:27,344
You peep pretty loud for a chick
that can't even find its own worms.

44
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,848
Should a burden on society
like you be talking?

45
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:35,019
You're a burden on us.
What does that make you?

46
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,773
The kettle the pot's calling black!

47
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:41,984
You mouthy brat!

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,363
Can't you at least get along
at Christmas?

49
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:49,992
Oh, yes...
Miyuki, I got you a present.

50
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,663
They're gone!

51
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,042
A whole set of
"World Literature for Children."

52
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,628
Why would I need that?!

53
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:02,546
Hana looked hard for those!

54
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:06,759
Even a homeless teenage runaway
needs a Christmas present!

55
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,262
I choose not to go home.

56
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:13,891
Six months on the street
means you don't have a home.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,811
I can go home
any time I want to.

58
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,564
It's the ones who say that
who never do.

59
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,817
Speak for yourself,
you old geezer!

60
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,153
What are you doing
to Dostoevsky?!

61
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,533
I won't take that,
today of all days!

62
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:34,995
Not even my father
ever hit me!

63
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:38,833
So I'll do it for him!

64
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,172
Grow up, will you?!

65
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,675
Don't hurt yourselves.

66
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,094
Show more respect, kid!

67
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,846
I'm not a kid!

68
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,515
With little tits like these?

69
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,767
You filthy old pervert!
That's harassment!

70
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,936
Will you two stop!

71
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:02,940
Huh?

72
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,919
It's been...

73
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,463
...abandoned.

74
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,174
There, there, there.

75
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,304
Care for this child.

76
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:37,475
What a world!

77
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:38,893
Oh, man!

78
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,481
Oh, my! You're a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.

79
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,274
"John Doe."

80
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:47,610
She's a girl, I said!
He's so rude!

81
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:53,991
How old was I when I started
living like this? Thirty-something?

82
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:59,955
I still thought
that I was better off...

83
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,625
...than a child with no home.

84
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,678
There, there, now! We'll take you
somewhere warm.

85
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,600
The cop shop's that way!

86
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:23,938
This is a Christmas present
from God!

87
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,774
She's our baby!

88
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:27,942
Huh?

89
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:42,623

98
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:19,994
Sorry!

99
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,330
What do you mean,
take her with us?

100
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:26,083
I'm just doing God's will.

101
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,252
Her parents might come back.

102
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:32,006
What parent would leave
a child out in this cold?!

103
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,884
That's a devil, not a parent!

104
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:41,182
Kiyoko wanted us
to find her.

105
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:42,475
"Kiyoko"?

106
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,186
"Kiyoko"? Why "Kiyoko"?!

107
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:49,523
From kiyo, "pure",
on this purest of nights.

108
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,025
How tacky!

109
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,360
Kiyoko's a fine name!

110
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,863
Did you have
a girlfriend named that?

111
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,364
Idiot!

112
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,536
Look, we can't just name her!
She's not a puppy or a kitten!

113
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:04,205
So I'm taking her home.

114
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,706
To a cardboard box?

115
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,541
There's no room!

116
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,880
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!

117
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,593
A haiku:

118
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:24,475
"A little baby / powdery snow
on its cheeks / on this holy night."

119
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,562
Directed by
Satoshi Kon

120
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,159
Peek-a-boo!

121
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,414
Oh, dear! Tell me what's wrong!

122
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,165
Shut up!

123
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,003
Hey!

124
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:57,800
I know, I know, he's not your mommy.
He's just a homeless homo.

125
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,678
Don't say that
in front of her!

126
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:04,557
A baby crying around here
will sound weird!

127
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,018
We're going to take you
to the police soon, okay?

128
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,563
You're not going anywhere,
are you?

129
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,399
Idiot! We're taking
her to the police!

130
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,693
Don't shout
or she'll never shut up!

131
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,280
Why won't you stop crying?
Are you hungry?

132
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:20,364
There, there!

133
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,992
Maybe she's sick.

134
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:40,384
Tomorrow...
I promise I'll take her then.

135
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:46,057
Christmas should be
the happiest day of the year.

136
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:49,643
If we take her in now, it'll always be
the worst day of her life!

137
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,438
Maybe...

138
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,066
...she needs a diaper.

139
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,660
Hana, boil some water.

140
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,496
I'll make some milk.

141
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,040
Hey! Whose side are you on?!

142
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:15,669
Go buy some water!
My angel isn't drinking from the tap!

143
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,671
Why me?

144
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:23,677
Where does a bum get off telling me
"Them that works eats"?

145
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:30,434
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.

146
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:36,816
So "no man is an island"
after all, huh?

147
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:43,072
You're buying water?!

148
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,950
A Christmas miracle.

149
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,577
What a haul!

150
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,378
Watch where you're going, brat!

151
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,380
You watch where you're going!

152
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:05,511
I was married once.

153
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,304
With a child?

154
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:11,392
No, don't tell me!
I don't want to hear this!

155
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,230
You never forget
for one second.

156
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:20,818
A child's the only thing
you hold dearer than life itself.

157
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,612
A boy?

158
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,322
No.

159
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:31,162
Bullshit!

160
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:33,330
Come on! Give it back!

161
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:37,918
Hey, you're the girl
who hangs out with Gin.

162
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:39,754
Get out of here, will you?

163
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,465
We don't want Gin after us.

164
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,425
Why not?

165
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:48,012
You're the light of his life,
that's why not!

166
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:53,684
There's not much light
in a cardboard box.

167
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,145
Let me have this book.

168
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:00,691
How old?

169
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:03,110
Twenty-one, I think.

170
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,698
Five or six years older
than Miyuki, I guess.

171
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,700
That old?

172
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,286
If she was alive.

173
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:18,501
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant,
and we got married.

174
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,003
I was in heaven.

175
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:25,216
You could have poked me in the eye
and I'd have just smiled at you.

176
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:31,305
But my daughter got sick,
and the medical bills were huge.

177
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:36,143
I was something of
a bicycle racer then.

178
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,398
I needed money.
There was this race...

179
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:41,816
You threw it?

180
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:48,114
A punk I knew
had this scheme.

181
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,161
They found out, I got kicked out
of racing, and my girl died.

182
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,581
I just didn't feel
like working anymore.

183
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,918
And then my wife
followed my daughter.

184
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,169
Oh, no!

185
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:06,048
That's how you get to be
a man like me.

186
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,760
I didn't want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!

187
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,139
It's freezing!

188
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,018
You're used to this.

189
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:19,395
Kind of.

190
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:22,273
I'll give her the milk.

191
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,109
Dreams do come true.

192
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:30,030
I always dreamed of being
the mother of a little girl.

193
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:32,450
A nice, warm house,
a pretty daughter.

194
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,286
Even if my husband
was no good...

195
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:38,456
...I would accept dire poverty
as long as I had my child.

196
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,666
Feed the poor kid!

197
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,548
You're so pretty.

198
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,094
The prettiest little girl
in the world.

199
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,621
What do you want?!

200
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,414
They're gone.

201
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,836
Santa Claus, maybe?

202
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,173
"Uncle Bag" and the baby
are gone.

203
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,134
What's that faggot
thinking about?!

204
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,431
Man, he's got big feet!

205
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:39,934
You can't have feet fixed.

206
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,869
Are you taking her back?

207
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,706
There's probably an APB
out on her.

208
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,625
And for you.

209
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,543
I doubt it.

210
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:09,880
An arrest warrant, maybe.

211
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,385
Her parents are probably
sorry about this now.

212
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,929
So let's take her to the police.

213
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,892
A baby's always
better off with its real mother.

214
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,894
Not necessarily.

215
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:28,357
Sometimes a
foster mother's better.

216
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,901
- What?!
- Don't be stupid.

217
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,905
I never knew
my real mother.

218
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:41,537
But I'll bet if she saw me now,
she'd flip.

219
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:45,750
How can someone homeless
raise a child?

220
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,419
I know, I know!

221
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:53,174
I don't want her shunted
from one foster home to another...

222
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,634
...without even one memory...

223
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:58,054
...of ever having been loved.

224
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:01,766
You don't have to be a foundling
to feel that.

225
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,435
They must have had reasons.

226
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,438
Nothing should make you
abandon a child!

227
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:14,028
That means you've taken love
and tossed it away, like trash.

228
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,449
Yeah, but what can we
do about it?

229
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:20,576
Find her mother.

230
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,831
And ask why she abandoned
her baby.

231
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,668
If she can make me understand...

232
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:33,172
...I'll forgive her,
and my mother too.

233
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,092
Find her?

234
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,927
How?

235
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:43,974
We'll have to pay again.

236
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:47,645
This is an expensive year-end!

237
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:50,106
What if we find another baby?

238
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,817
They don't toss them out in twos.

239
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,830
Another key!

240
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,000
Look at these panties.
You'd catch cold in them!

241
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:13,212
Are they the ones?

242
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,759
Are these your folks?

243
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,095
Look, business cards.

244
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:32,022
A hostess club
won't be open at this hour!

245
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,859
We've got some walking to do.

246
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,278
You've gotta be kidding!

247
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,533
He was eating for two!

248
00:17:55,755 --> 00:18:01,385
But why pack like you're off on a trip
and then abandon a baby?

249
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,181
Maybe it was one last trip
they were taking.

250
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:06,515
A family suicide?!

251
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:09,477
Then what do we do?

252
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:12,104
We can't search the next world!

253
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:13,773
Shh!

254
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:22,948
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

255
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:27,703
Trains will be delayed due
to heavy snowfall.

256
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:29,955
It's so hot in here!

257
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,874
What a stink!

258
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,419
Have you bathed lately?

259
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,005
No. Or washed my clothes.

260
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,882
How embarrassing!

261
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,811
Oh, dear! There, there.

262
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:55,314
Did she piss herself?
That's why it stinks!

263
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,191
It's you that stinks!

264
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:58,401
Quiet!

265
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,444
Shut that kid up!

266
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,419
Watch it!

267
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:18,003
Hey!

268
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:28,597
Miyuki!

269
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,433
What's she up to?

270
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,442
We wasted our train fares!

271
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,361
It was me who paid them.

272
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:47,450
I'm sorry!
There's no more milk.

273
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,035
Go ahead, blame it all on me.

274
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:53,414
Oh, cheer up!
Let's sing a song.

275
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,295
What's that?

276
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:01,046
The Sound of Music,
of course.

277
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:02,256
Never heard of it.

278
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:13,851
That's going to make you
even hungrier.

279
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,695
I'm starving!

280
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,323
I told you!

281
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:30,326
Look after my little angel.

282
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,204
Go on without me.

283
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:37,833
Just say you'll never forget
the queer you once knew.

284
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,669
Look.
A cemetery.

285
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,755
I'm not dead yet!

286
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,479
Now I'm alive again!

287
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:04,443
But there's nothing for a baby
in these offerings to the dead!

288
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,612
We'll get by!

289
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,698
Yeah, sure! "We'll get by!"

290
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:13,077
People keep on saying that
till they end up living like us!

291
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:19,083
And while we keep on saying it,
the kid'll end up under a stone here.

292
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,960
"Kiyoko"! She has a name!

293
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:25,965
Yeah, whatever. And she's cute.
She's so pretty.

294
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:28,968
But listen to me. I'm serious.

295
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,720
You listening?

296
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,391
If you really care
about that kid...

297
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,644
...you'll find her someone
to take care of her.

298
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:41,230
I speak from experience.

299
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,607
That's what her parents said, I bet.

300
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:47,403
What do you mean?
I wouldn't abandon a kid.

301
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:49,947
Don't be stupid!

302
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:53,075
No. Your family
abandoned you!

303
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:57,079
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...

304
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:00,207
...while some dumb faggot
pisses on me?

305
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:04,336
What are we doing here?
Tell me.

306
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:06,380
Wracking our brains!

307
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:09,842
We're scavenging offerings
left in a cemetery.

308
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,803
And why? Because
we're homeless.

309
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:15,973
- Stop it!
- No! I'm not going to stop.

310
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:19,101
We are three
good-for-nothing bums...

311
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,687
...who can't even
look after ourselves.

312
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:24,023
Shut up! I'm thinking!

313
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:26,150
I won't shut up.

314
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,530
You can't get milk from an old queer's
tits, no matter how hard you think.

315
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:36,118
Come on, Hana! You know
we can't do this.

316
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,953
Speak for yourself!

317
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,332
This way the whole family
will be dead.

318
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:52,009
Oh, my!

319
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:55,679
You're so lucky, Kiyoko!

320
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:58,015
God must really love you!

321
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,476
Then why was she...

322
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:02,019
...dumped?

323
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,522
Left!

324
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:08,692
- That's a dead end!
- It's right!

325
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:13,489
- Tails.
- Heads.

326
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,584
What's this guy doing
parking like that?

327
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,879
Doesn't he know what
a "public thoroughfare" is?

328
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:51,026
How did that happen?

329
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:57,158
Bad luck. The car got stuck,
and I forgot the parking brake.

330
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,535
Then someone shouted,
"Dorothy, wait!"...

331
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,537
...and then I heard, "Whoops!"...

332
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,666
...and the damn car
rolled on top of me.

333
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:12,923
I don't bring my men with me
when I'm visiting the old man's grave.

334
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:17,219
I owe you. Call me
if you're ever in trouble.

335
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,638
Oh, no, we never have
any trouble.

336
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,891
You're from Kinshicho?

337
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:24,727
We were just going there.

338
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:27,188
I know it's rude to ask...

339
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,398
If it's rude, then don't ask.

340
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:31,067
Come on.

341
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:35,237
Would you know
this establishment?

342
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:36,781
Club Swirl: "Midori"

343
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,658
Know it?

344
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:44,663
Its owner's marrying
my daughter today.

345
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:50,753
He's one of my men,
but he's too cocky.

346
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:53,297
I was against it.

347
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:55,633
But your daughter chose him.

348
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:59,637
The daughter I brought up,
married to a man like that...

349
00:25:01,222 --> 00:25:02,348
Know what I mean?

350
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:07,561
But if your daughter's
happy with him...

351
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:09,605
...isn't that the main thing?

352
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:10,773
You're right!

353
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:17,988
I went to the old man's grave
so I wouldn't cry at the wedding.

354
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,990
Watch the road!

355
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,206
Good evening, sir!

356
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,168
Make yourselves at home.

357
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:45,891
Daddy, you're late!

358
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,979
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.

359
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:53,107
I owe them my life.

360
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:54,775
My daughter, Kiyoko.

361
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:56,193
Oh. Hello.

362
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:09,623
What have you gotten us into?!

363
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,084
Just shut up and eat!

364
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:18,466
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.

365
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:31,145
Don't you think Kiyoko
has amazing luck?

366
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:34,690
Yeah.

367
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,359
Maybe she does.

368
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,532
Oh, yeah. Her name's Sachiko.

369
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:45,367
Not "Midori"?

370
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:47,078
Just at the club.

371
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:50,039
She's Sachiko, "happy child,"
though she didn't look it.

372
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:55,211
But some plastic surgery
turned her into a good little earner.

373
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:59,548
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.

374
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:01,717
Do you know where she is?

375
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:05,137
I doubt you'll wring
any money out of her.

376
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:08,641
No, I have something
to give her.

377
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:15,940
I'm sorry
I spilled your food.

378
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:19,568
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.

379
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:23,572
She said her husband
was in debt.

380
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,825
What's wrong with you?

381
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,243
That bastard.

382
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,620
Do you know him?

383
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:32,081
Then she borrowed
more money from us...

384
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:35,376
...and ended up screwed both ways.

385
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,628
You know where she is?

386
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:39,171
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

387
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,007
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

388
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,927
...l'd still be with
my wife and kid!

389
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:47,680
But aren't they both dead?

390
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,015
I'll kill the bastard!

391
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:53,185
You'll get killed!

392
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:21,422
Mitsuo! Mitsuo!

393
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:23,883
It was that maid!

394
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,926
Are you okay?!

395
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,345
She's got a gun!

396
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:31,057
Hey, what?!

397
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:37,897
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

398
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:39,982
Hey!

399
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,715
Thank you very much.

400
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,927
She's got a gun, you know!

401
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:11,555
- Our lives are already wasted!
- Hana!

402
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:17,937
There!

403
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:47,842
Yes! One of your cabs picked up
a young woman with a baby.

404
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:50,928
Number 12-25. Send it to...

405
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,015
...the Tokyo Tower.
My name is

406
00:29:57,435 --> 00:30:00,146
Hey! Wait a minute.

407
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:09,155
We're homeless bums,
not action-movie heroes.

408
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:11,615
What we need now
is the police.

409
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:17,580
If you like the police so much,
get them to adopt you!

410
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:20,458
Those children are like family!

411
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:22,626
I thought I could
depend on you!

412
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,338
Don't talk like you were
my damn wife.

413
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:30,176
I'm not going anywhere.

414
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:31,510
Gin!

415
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:34,096
We've done all we could.

416
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:35,431
You're giving up?

417
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:39,268
There's nothing we can do.

418
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,480
You are really
the lowest of the low!

419
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:45,775
The best thing you'll ever do
is die in the gutter!

420
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:49,612
Oh, poor you! You'll be dead
and no one'll care!

421
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,698
All you ever do is
cause people trouble!

422
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:55,451
Dead or alive, you're living trash!

423
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,329
The king of trash!

424
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,879
Okay, so I'm trash.
But you're ugly.

425
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:26,357
- Yes?
- I want to get rid of some trash.

426
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:34,115
I don't think I'd fit.

427
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:39,870
Yeah, that's what I am,
living trash!

428
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:45,709
Who cares if you die
in the gutter?

429
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:50,548
You're dead all the same.

430
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,697
You okay?

431
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:17,825
Hang in there, Gramps.

432
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:23,622
- May I make one last request?
- What?

433
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,626
Give me a drink of that.

434
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:20,971
You're not selling me
into slavery!

435
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,101
Somebody, help!

436
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:43,452
I always wanted to die drunk,
in a nice old house.

437
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,664
Now I'm halfway there.

438
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:49,041
Fate works in strange ways.

439
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,837
L've lived a long time...

440
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:56,590
...but I'm just trash,
as worthless dead as alive.

441
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,051
Don't talk like that!

442
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:04,056
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

443
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:07,059
Looking at you now...

444
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:10,563
...may I make a last request?

445
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:14,150
Get rid of this for me.

446
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:20,072
Some people will be hurt
if it's known who I am.

447
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:23,909
Okay. I understand.
No one will ever know.

448
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:42,136
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?

449
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,096
Request?

450
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,521
And now, goodbye.

451
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:08,913
That's it!

452
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,876
Thanks, Gramps!

453
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:22,468
Time for the New Year's clean-up!

454
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,686
Big breasts... Cool!

455
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,743
Husband?

456
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:03,968
Father

457
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:05,803
Police.

458
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,805
Your dad's a cop?!

459
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,515
My father was a policeman!

460
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:11,392
Father, policeman?

461
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:19,400
Except I'm the one
he's going to be arresting.

462
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:35,374
Hold it.

463
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:41,005
Hi! How've you been?

464
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,426
Now? Just cleaning up.

465
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,887
Hey, wake up!

466
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,138
Come on!

467
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,643
No! Not that!

468
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:57,563
Time to die, old man!

469
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,900
Kiyo's coming? I'm there!

470
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,736
The girls are drinking near here.

471
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:05,488
Yeah?

472
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:08,908
All cleaned up.

473
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:14,497
Give it back!

474
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,000
Give me that back!

475
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,215
Her foreigner husband looked like
he was in a real bad mood.

476
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:26,175
Did he hit her?

477
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:29,678
No, she was being real nice
for a girl so young.

478
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:33,099
My wife could learn something!

479
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,520
His foreign assailant fled, taking
a young woman and a baby hostage.

480
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:42,566
With the groom in serious condition,
police speculate this may be a war...

481
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,111
...between crime syndicates.

482
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:48,406
Hey, this is serious!

483
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:50,616
I'm not kidding around, either!

484
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,166
My mom's religious.

485
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,460
She chants all the time.

486
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:08,509
Me.

487
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:14,682
Isn't she cute?

488
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:18,394
I found her. Those spots
on her back look like wings.

489
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,187
So I called her "Angel."

490
00:38:21,939 --> 00:38:24,108
But she's gone.

491
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,404
Father.

492
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:40,958
I stabbed my father.

493
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,711
I can never go back.

494
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:12,990
The baby? A gift from God.

495
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:14,033
Yes.

496
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,578
Give me a break!

497
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,663
L've got a family at home!

498
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,249
Those children are my family!

499
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,544
They went in there.

500
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:27,088
Hey! The fare!

501
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:28,547
I'll be right back.

502
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,092
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

503
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:34,345
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

504
00:39:34,512 --> 00:39:36,180
Where are you?

505
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:46,273
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

506
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,501
How could you do this to me?!

507
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:08,462
It's your own fault!

508
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:12,383
You never listen
to anything I say!

509
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,593
Use the scarf I made you...

510
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:16,554
...to mop up the blood!

511
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,097
What have you done
with Angel?!

512
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:21,016
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?

513
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:23,060
She's right here.

514
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,770
Our angel.

515
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:28,816
I'm hungry.

516
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,484
Make me some food.

517
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:32,570
Why?

518
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:35,489
What are you doing in my house?

519
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:39,827
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I'll get dinner.

520
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:55,009
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

521
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,348
Uncle Bag?!

522
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:08,773
Oh, I've missed you,
my little angel!

523
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:16,280
I wish I was her mother,
but I'm just another homo.

524
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:18,407
Miyuki...

525
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:21,744
...I'm so glad you're safe.

526
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:31,921
Where's the geezer?

527
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,424
He could be dead
for all I care!

528
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:40,554
I'm dying.

529
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:52,775
Maybe he went home.

530
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:54,193
Who cares?

531
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,862
All he thinks about
is himself.

532
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,035
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you're
in love with him, aren't you?

533
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:07,123
Don't be silly! I like my men
to be more "manly."

534
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:12,753
The kind of man I like is
slender, middle-aged, tanned...

535
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,382
...with a divine square-back haircut
and a lower-town accent...

536
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,593
...who says, "Ah, what the hell"...

537
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,972
...when I don't quite have
the cab fare.

538
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:28,686
So, what now, Miss Hana?

539
00:42:28,853 --> 00:42:33,065
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.

540
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:35,443
It's hard to say.

541
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:43,951
I'm glad.

542
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:48,080
He just died there?

543
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,665
He was homeless.

544
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,292
I might be next.

545
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:52,626
Just do your job.

546
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:54,837
Gin!

547
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:59,967
Gin! Gin!

548
00:43:00,634 --> 00:43:02,178
Take it easy.

549
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:03,304
Gin!

550
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:05,014
Calm down!

551
00:43:13,522 --> 00:43:17,234
Where is that man of mine?!

552
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,948
Kiyo...

553
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:28,621
If only tonight...

554
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,251
...I wanted to see you
before I died.

555
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:39,465
Kiyoko!

556
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:58,859
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?

557
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,863
- An ambulance.
- Well! Aren't you rude!

558
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:08,369
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can't sleep out on the street!

559
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:12,665
The geezer's not here,
we're freezing, sleepy, hungry.

560
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:14,375
This sucks!

561
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:17,670
I guess there's no choice.

562
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:25,970
I never thought
I'd be here again.

563
00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:36,564
I'm sorry. We're closed for
a private party tonight

564
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,025
Hana?!

565
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:44,447
I know I have no right
to come strolling in now...

566
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:48,492
...but there's no one else
I can call on, "Mother"!

567
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:54,707
Hana!

568
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,709
Mother!

569
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,252
Hana!

570
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:06,927
Geezer?!

571
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:12,099
What happened, Gin?!

572
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:17,063
Some kids beat me up.

573
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:20,983
I guess I'm just not
an action hero.

574
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:27,990
He said he knew you.

575
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:31,410
But he said he was homeless,
you know.

576
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:33,829
So am I.

577
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:37,666
What? But why?!

578
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,212
Since Ken died I'm like a canary...

579
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:43,672
...that's forgotten its song.

580
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,384
You sing all the time!

581
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,136
Isn't she cute?!

582
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:50,888
I wish I could have one!

583
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:59,772
So Ken died, did he?

584
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,234
AIDS?

585
00:46:03,943 --> 00:46:06,153
He slipped on the soap.

586
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,282
Well, death is always
a hair's breadth away.

587
00:46:10,825 --> 00:46:14,912
But if you were in trouble,
why didn't you come back?

588
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:21,085
We certainly had fun here,
didn't we?

589
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:25,339
In this old bar

590
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:29,135
I've had so much to drink

591
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,138
My old memories

592
00:46:32,763 --> 00:46:37,101
All start to blur

593
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:39,770
My lover

594
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:43,232
Has left me

595
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:49,697
People call me notorious

596
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:51,699
Aw, you're ugly!

597
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:54,618
Good for nothing

598
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:55,619
Get off!

599
00:46:55,786 --> 00:46:58,497
Good for nothing

600
00:46:59,498 --> 00:47:03,169
What a terrible thing to say

601
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,796
Eat shit, you old fart!

602
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:11,510
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

603
00:47:18,517 --> 00:47:21,687
I couldn't come back
after I'd done that.

604
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:25,983
A little bit of money
took care of that.

605
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,944
I'm just happy you're all right.

606
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:34,825
Stop it! You scare me
when you start crying.

607
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:40,748
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?

608
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:42,166
Well...

609
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:49,090
Where is your mother, anyway?

610
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:51,258
Abandoned?!

611
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:54,845
Yes! L've been abandoned!

612
00:47:57,348 --> 00:48:00,017
Them's the breaks, I guess.

613
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:03,938
I could see me in her.

614
00:48:04,188 --> 00:48:08,401
Born on the street,
and back there again.

615
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:14,532
That's why I want to find her
a home full of love!

616
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:19,120
All I ever wanted was love!

617
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:27,128
Ow!

618
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:35,636
What the hell?!

619
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,766
The geezer's come out.

620
00:48:40,975 --> 00:48:42,309
Where are my clothes?!

621
00:48:52,153 --> 00:48:53,988
Way to go, Gin!

622
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:57,992
Come back any time.

623
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:01,537
Thank you, Mother.

624
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:11,130
My mother's white breath / as she
watches me set out / on a long journey.

625
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:29,291
Oh, man!

626
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:33,212
An empty building's always nice,
but look who got here first.

627
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:40,302
L'd just love to fill up
on some meat!

628
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:42,763
Don't you dare!

629
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:46,934
Just kidding!

630
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:55,109
The snow's let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?

631
00:50:55,276 --> 00:50:56,277
Okay.

632
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,654
Get me some sake.

633
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,990
Just one.

634
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:21,302
- No!
- I wish.

635
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:39,820
"Honey, I'm home."

636
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:03,761
You stayed in there?
You'd think you were homeless!

637
00:52:08,224 --> 00:52:11,560
Actually, we're looking for
these people.

638
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:15,314
Sachiko Nishizawa.

639
00:52:15,773 --> 00:52:17,024
Do you know her?

640
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:21,237
She never paid me back for her
Neighborhood Association dues.

641
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,739
Are you a relative?

642
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:28,452
No! We're acquaintances
of a relative.

643
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:31,038
Her husband was no better.

644
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:35,668
Gambling day and night,
and mean when he drank.

645
00:52:37,711 --> 00:52:40,840
Living on his wife's earnings
and borrowed money.

646
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:42,800
Where are they now?

647
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,595
I wouldn't know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.

648
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:50,599
They left
about three months ago.

649
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:58,065
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.

650
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:02,027
They were a nice couple
at first...

651
00:53:02,236 --> 00:53:06,157
...but it wasn't long before
they started fighting.

652
00:53:06,323 --> 00:53:08,325
That's poverty for you.

653
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:12,788
All that debt didn't stop him
from lording it over her.

654
00:53:12,955 --> 00:53:16,542
Even the most dedicated wife
has her limits.

655
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:19,712
You'd see bruises sometimes.

656
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,672
The poor woman.

657
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,383
Not on her, on him!

658
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,760
Oh, dear!

659
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:33,225
But his mother would always take
his side against her.

660
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,104
His parents built them this house.

661
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:39,190
Where do they live?

662
00:53:39,356 --> 00:53:41,609
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.

663
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:46,072
Her mother-in-law
was always complaining...

664
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,407
...that she never did
any housework.

665
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,826
But her son was perfect,
of course.

666
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,662
Of course!
That's why I told her...

667
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:57,917
...she'd never see a grandchild
with his wife working in a club.

668
00:53:58,459 --> 00:54:01,253
But she did get pregnant.

669
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:03,714
Well, a man and a woman...

670
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:05,466
They can always find time...

671
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,760
...to do what they must!

672
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:11,430
Shinkocho 1-2-25
Maison Happiness Apt. 203

673
00:54:12,723 --> 00:54:15,059
What if they ran out
from this new place too?

674
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:17,645
What a horrible man!

675
00:54:17,895 --> 00:54:23,109
Poor Sachiko! Working to pay off
her husband's gambling debts!

676
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:24,527
Right!

677
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,323
But I never thought of
abandoning the kid!

678
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:31,867
- Huh?
- Nothing.

679
00:54:32,034 --> 00:54:36,122
That's no reason
to just dump the kid!

680
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,957
L've said that all along.

681
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:45,506
Miyuki: Angel has
come home. Dad.

682
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,930
Doesn't it ever get tired
of snowing?

683
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:57,351
Thank you.

684
00:55:06,944 --> 00:55:10,364
I wonder how we look
to them.

685
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:13,200
Like a bum, a homo,
a runaway and a foundling.

686
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:17,163
Kiyoko is God's messenger.
We're her servants.

687
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:20,708
Unpaid servants.

688
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,128
Paying for a father's sins.

689
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:27,506
Yeah, if her father had been
any good at all...

690
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:30,051
...we wouldn't be going
through all this.

691
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,849
Even a good-for-nothing father
never forgets a child.

692
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,436
I'm going out.

693
00:55:44,899 --> 00:55:47,568
What's the matter with her?

694
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:51,238
A child never forgets
its parents.

695
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,913
I never stop wanting...

696
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:02,708
...to see my daughter, just once.

697
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:04,960
So she's alive?

698
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:06,504
Yeah.

699
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,838
And your wife?

700
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:11,342
I'm sure she's remarried...

701
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,220
...and living happily.

702
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:20,309
"Hello.

703
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:22,478
It's me, Miyuki."

704
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:25,189
Why did you split up?

705
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:27,525
- Drinking and gambling.
- What?!

706
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:30,111
Just like...

707
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:33,489
I'm a louse.

708
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:39,745
But I've always wanted to do
something for her as a father...

709
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:41,497
...even just a little.

710
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:46,001
When I was gambling
this would have been nothing.

711
00:56:46,419 --> 00:56:49,922
Now I've had to sweat blood
just to save 30,000 yen.

712
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:52,258
That's great, Gin!

713
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,260
We can stuff ourselves!

714
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:55,970
Stuff you!

715
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,022
Ishida speaking.

716
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:18,951
Miyuki? Is that you?

717
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,455
Are you all right?

718
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:29,920
I'm sorry!

719
00:57:30,087 --> 00:57:31,714
I'm sorry!

720
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,133
I'm sorry!

721
00:57:36,343 --> 00:57:38,846
Excuse me,
but if you wouldn't mind...

722
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:40,639
"Get out", you mean?

723
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:44,518
Other customers
might like to sit down.

724
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:46,187
There's hardly anyone here!

725
00:57:46,353 --> 00:57:47,980
You guys stink!

726
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,318
What are you?
Homeless or something?

727
00:57:52,943 --> 00:57:56,989
Does trash have kids too?
Just like real people?

728
00:57:57,698 --> 00:57:59,825
Who are you looking at?

729
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:03,329
Hold it, you!

730
00:58:04,205 --> 00:58:05,706
Sir! No!

731
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:07,875
Hold it, I said, you low-life!

732
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:21,389
It's New Year's Sale time
at The Food Store!

733
00:58:21,722 --> 00:58:28,104
Come to The Food Store
for all your special New Year's needs!

734
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,940
See in the New Year
with your family!

735
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,900
Call an ambulance, quick.

736
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:35,027
Right!

737
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,952
I knew it! Kiyoko really is
the messenger of God!

738
00:58:45,579 --> 00:58:45,913
Hey!

739
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:47,415
Miss Hana!

740
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:48,999
Hey!

741
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,209
Hana!

742
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,311
Following a recent
gangland shooting incident...

743
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:15,067
...police are seeking a fugitive
thought to be Latin American.

744
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:18,404
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...

745
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:22,408
...in protecting the leader
of his syndicate...

746
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,955
...will be questioned after he recovers
from his wounds.

747
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,418
Isn't she cute!
When was she born?

748
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:35,588
Not long ago, I guess.

749
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,506
So the mother...

750
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,258
I'm not.

751
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,594
What's her name?

752
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:42,178
Kiyoko.

753
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:46,265
That's my name too.
What a coincidence.

754
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:51,270
Your friend is very weak.

755
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:54,356
Make sure he gets rest
and proper nutrition.

756
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:55,775
Doctor!

757
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,111
Believe it or not,
we're homeless.

758
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:01,489
I'm just a doctor.

759
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:08,454
Rest and nutrition don't fit
with our lifestyle, you realize.

760
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:15,503
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.

761
01:00:15,669 --> 01:00:18,964
All anyone can do is their best.

762
01:00:21,342 --> 01:00:23,135
Take care.

763
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,809
The bill for today is 29,830 yen.

764
01:00:30,017 --> 01:00:34,188
Bring your health-insurance card
and you'll get a refund.

765
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:37,817
I'm sorry, Gin!

766
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:42,154
Stop crying! You'll get
the bills all wet.

767
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:44,865
That's 30,000 yen.

768
01:01:01,132 --> 01:01:02,425
Kiyoko?!

769
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:08,514
Dad?

770
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,539
So you took up nursing.

771
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:37,042
I see.

772
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,297
I'm glad you're well.

773
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:46,886
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
How's your mother?

774
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:48,304
Fine.

775
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,390
Yeah? That's good.

776
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:53,726
What are you doing now?

777
01:01:53,893 --> 01:02:00,149
I'm in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.

778
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:05,905
You must hate me.

779
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,452
I was never any kind
of a father to you.

780
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:17,750
But that 30,000 yen was money
I'd saved up for you.

781
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:20,753
You may not believe it.

782
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:27,426
I always wanted to see you.

783
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,848
When I was little,
Mom and I searched for you.

784
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,768
We even checked
unidentified corpses.

785
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:41,107
After you disappeared,
Mom ran the store herself.

786
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:43,317
The store?

787
01:02:43,484 --> 01:02:47,655
It was hard for a woman to run
a bicycle shop alone.

788
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:51,659
That's not quite the same as
a bicycle racer.

789
01:02:51,909 --> 01:02:58,040
The man you owed money to was shot
and wounded the other day, you know.

790
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,625
He lived?!

791
01:03:00,668 --> 01:03:02,711
That's a relief.

792
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:04,839
I thought you'd say that.

793
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:12,638
I ran up the debts, not him.

794
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:18,811
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.

795
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,148
I'm getting married.

796
01:03:24,024 --> 01:03:25,735
Oh? That's good.

797
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,153
To him.

798
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:31,741
Great! But isn't he
about my age?

799
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:36,162
He's been married.
His daughter got sick and died...

800
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:38,998
...and his wife followed her.

801
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,005
That man makes me so mad!

802
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:47,798
Aren't you moved?

803
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:51,510
Here's the address
and phone number.

804
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,595
Yours?

805
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,181
The old house is gone.

806
01:03:55,347 --> 01:03:57,725
Even if you can't now,
call me sometime.

807
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:01,270
Kiyoko!

808
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:07,401
L've had about
all I can stand!

809
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:08,360
Miss Hana?

810
01:04:08,569 --> 01:04:11,238
Telling us you were a racer!

811
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:14,241
I was always at the track.

812
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:15,743
Yeah, betting!

813
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:20,206
And your debts snowballed
so you couldn't face your family...

814
01:04:20,372 --> 01:04:22,249
...and you ran and hid
in a cardboard box!

815
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,126
Yes, damn it!

816
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,754
That's what your father is!

817
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:30,883
He can't bet, he's spineless,
his feet stink and he can't drink!

818
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:34,929
He kills off his wife and daughter
to buy sympathy!

819
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:37,932
He said you had
an incurable disease!

820
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:43,270
With a father like that,
you have my sympathy!

821
01:04:43,604 --> 01:04:46,565
Is this how you repay me?!

822
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:48,651
Repay you?!

823
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,736
Am I hearing right?

824
01:04:50,945 --> 01:04:53,072
If we're talking about debt,
I'm waiting for my change!

825
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,741
Debt's a concept
you don't even understand!

826
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,412
You understand how to troll
through garbage cans!

827
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,456
And how to get in debt
and how to make babies.

828
01:05:02,623 --> 01:05:06,168
Though you're not too good
at raising them, are you?

829
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,255
And your debts
you shove off on your wife.

830
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:12,800
Always running away,
never doing anything right!

831
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:15,678
Running away's
the only racing you ever did!

832
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,931
Miyuki! We're leaving!

833
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:22,935
Miss Hana?

834
01:05:28,482 --> 01:05:30,484
I guess he's better.

835
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:34,864
Should you have said that
in front of her?

836
01:05:37,658 --> 01:05:40,953
If she's his daughter,
she'll forgive him.

837
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,126
Being able to speak freely...

838
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:50,129
...is the lifeblood of love.

839
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:52,673
Maybe I'm naive.

840
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,887
So you're in love with him?

841
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:01,515
Don't be silly.
I'm the Weeping Red Devil.

842
01:06:01,682 --> 01:06:02,349
What?

843
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:05,728
It's a story I love.

844
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:11,233
There was a red devil who
wanted to be friends with people.

845
01:06:12,193 --> 01:06:16,906
But since he was a devil,
no one would go near him.

846
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:20,743
So his friend the blue devil
made a plan.

847
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:27,374
He'd wreak havoc among the people,
and the red devil would save them.

848
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:36,175
When you try to achieve something,
someone's bound to get hurt.

849
01:06:37,218 --> 01:06:39,553
You always have to
sacrifice something.

850
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:42,515
The plan worked.

851
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:47,603
But the blue devil had to go away
so they'd never know it was a trick.

852
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,024
It's a sad story.

853
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:56,404
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?

854
01:06:57,405 --> 01:07:00,741
It's best for everyone
when they're with their family.

855
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:02,910
Soon we'll find Kiyoko's mother.

856
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:07,415
And then what?
You don't have a real family!

857
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:20,761
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery

858
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:25,558
Numbers have been drawn for the
annual New Year's Jumbo Lottery.

859
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,520
Top prize in the 200-million-yen
lottery is a very rare number.

860
01:07:30,271 --> 01:07:34,400
Group 11, number 111, 111...

861
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,319
...is worth 50 million yen.

862
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,280
A different group pays 100,000 yen.

863
01:07:40,406 --> 01:07:43,743
To repeat,
the winning prize number is...

864
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:47,246
This just in.

865
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:51,292
Police have released a sketch
of an infant taken...

866
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:55,254
...from a hospital in
Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward.

867
01:07:57,631 --> 01:08:02,595
We've come all the way here,
but we don't have her address!

868
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:05,306
The geezer's got it!
Let's go back.

869
01:08:05,473 --> 01:08:07,808
Where are you going?

870
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:13,606
- The police!
- What? You hated that idea!

871
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,484
I was just ego-tripping.

872
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:20,446
Now I want to apologize
to her parents.

873
01:08:20,654 --> 01:08:24,950
They might not be able to sleep
waiting for news about her.

874
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:28,788
That's what we said
from the very start!

875
01:08:28,996 --> 01:08:33,125
They might even be
about to commit suicide!

876
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,796
L've done something
that can't be taken back!

877
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,465
I'll throw myself in this river.

878
01:08:39,673 --> 01:08:43,803
I'll step neatly out of my shoes, stand
on the handrail, and be at peace.

879
01:08:44,011 --> 01:08:47,014
But then I'll see
a baby's face on the water.

880
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:51,894
No! While I see this child's face,
I cannot die!

881
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,813
Hey, you!

882
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:55,231
No!

883
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,692
You're too young for this!

884
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,986
Please! Let me die!

885
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:10,162
You!

886
01:09:10,955 --> 01:09:12,164
Sachiko Nishizawa.

887
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,671
What were you thinking of?!

888
01:09:18,879 --> 01:09:20,881
Is that an apology?

889
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:25,177
If we hadn't found this child,
she would've frozen to death!

890
01:09:25,386 --> 01:09:26,679
It wasn't me!

891
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:30,057
My husband took her away
when I wasn't there!

892
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:34,019
L've looked and looked!

893
01:09:41,235 --> 01:09:42,403
Is that true?

894
01:09:45,573 --> 01:09:50,745
All I've suffered
on account of that man!

895
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:04,925
"Hi, Mom!"

896
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,562
God really loves this child,
you know.

897
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:20,066
I want you to give her
lots of love too.

898
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,402
Do right by her,
or you'll pay for it.

899
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:25,404
I'm so sorry!

900
01:10:25,613 --> 01:10:26,822
I'm sorry!

901
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,459
Mrs. Nishizawa!

902
01:11:25,005 --> 01:11:26,132
What are you doing in here?!

903
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,634
Get out of here! Get out!

904
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,178
Wait! I'm no thief.

905
01:11:31,345 --> 01:11:33,681
You're lying! Get out!

906
01:11:33,848 --> 01:11:34,974
Where's the baby?!

907
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:41,689
Did an old queer and a girl
come to give it back?

908
01:11:41,856 --> 01:11:43,399
What are you talking about?!

909
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,693
You abandoned a baby!

910
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,989
I can prove it.

911
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:52,533
Are you a cop?

912
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:57,329
Huh? I'm just a bum
who was passing by.

913
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:00,499
Are you right in the head?

914
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,835
I'm damn near crazy
from all this!

915
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:08,340
Why is the baby you abandoned
on the news as being "taken away"?

916
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:11,010
They'll call us kidnappers!

917
01:12:11,552 --> 01:12:15,639
It wasn't me.
That's not my kid.

918
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:19,185
What?

919
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:23,272
There, there! Don't cry!

920
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,523
Take care.

921
01:12:25,232 --> 01:12:26,859
Raise her right.

922
01:12:27,026 --> 01:12:29,111
See you again someday.

923
01:12:30,738 --> 01:12:33,365
Never leave her again.

924
01:12:56,263 --> 01:13:03,771
On the year's last day / when all of a
life's accounts / have been settled up.

925
01:13:13,948 --> 01:13:18,744
Sachiko stole that baby
out of the hospital.

926
01:13:18,953 --> 01:13:23,165
She stole a baby
and then abandoned it?!

927
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,251
That's a person's life!

928
01:13:25,418 --> 01:13:28,003
She lied to me about it!

929
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,424
And now it's gone
way out of control.

930
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:36,262
I don't want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!

931
01:13:36,429 --> 01:13:37,847
What?!

932
01:13:38,973 --> 01:13:41,767
Don't act like
you're not part of this!

933
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:45,104
You don't want to get involved?
You're her husband!

934
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:49,650
That's all over!
I'm getting my life back together.

935
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,609
Look!

936
01:13:50,818 --> 01:13:54,613
I won 100,000 yen in the lottery.
My luck's turned!

937
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:04,123
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.

938
01:14:04,498 --> 01:14:06,625
No. They threw him away.

939
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,878
I'm no loser!

940
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:15,968
These were in your wife's bag.

941
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:21,640
Any idea where
she might have gone?

942
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:25,144
She said she was going
to be with her baby.

943
01:14:25,686 --> 01:14:28,481
She was going to kill herself!

944
01:14:30,357 --> 01:14:31,984
There's no time to waste!

945
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:35,696
No! She was just going
to go look for the kid.

946
01:14:35,863 --> 01:14:38,324
She's desperate.
That only means one thing!

947
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:41,494
But where do I look?!

948
01:14:57,676 --> 01:14:58,677
Hana!

949
01:14:58,886 --> 01:15:00,179
Miyuki!

950
01:15:01,889 --> 01:15:03,182
Kiyoko!

951
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,024
God must be busy
at this time of year.

952
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:14,527
Better once a year than never.

953
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,153
Geezer?

954
01:15:25,746 --> 01:15:29,708
You're too late. You just missed
a very moving finale.

955
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:31,836
What's the matter?

956
01:15:35,589 --> 01:15:36,590
"Kiyoko"!

957
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:40,970
"Stomach"?

958
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,390
"Mother"!

959
01:15:44,598 --> 01:15:46,100
Now that's settled...

960
01:15:46,267 --> 01:15:47,977
...what the hell do you mean?!

961
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:52,314
Fake! The mother!
Sachiko's a fake!

962
01:15:54,525 --> 01:15:55,568
Pardon?

963
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:03,743
Why won't you drink?

964
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:08,956
A baby has to drink
from its mother's breast.

965
01:16:09,582 --> 01:16:13,669
We'll never be close
if you don't!

966
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:21,802
Sorry. Wrong people.

967
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,307
She can't be far!

968
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:28,684
But where do we look?

969
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:31,479
We can't just give her up now!

970
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,951
That's Kiyoko!

971
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:54,752
Should you be running?

972
01:16:54,919 --> 01:16:57,505
If I don't run now, when will I?

973
01:16:57,922 --> 01:16:58,798
This way!

974
01:17:13,104 --> 01:17:17,024
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!

975
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:18,943
Who said "family suicide"?

976
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,569
You did!

977
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,660
- Which way?
- Left.

978
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:29,870
- Okay, right!
- Why?

979
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:31,622
You're a lousy gambler!

980
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:33,874
You got that right.

981
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,918
Somebody help!

982
01:17:49,557 --> 01:17:50,808
Hey!

983
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:52,184
Wait!

984
01:17:52,393 --> 01:17:54,019
Thief! Thief!

985
01:17:54,228 --> 01:17:54,854
What's wrong?

986
01:17:55,062 --> 01:17:58,607
A woman just stole my truck!

987
01:17:59,316 --> 01:18:00,568
Hey! Thief!

988
01:18:00,735 --> 01:18:02,862
Yes! That woman!

989
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:06,157
She's a baby thief!

990
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,966
Be quiet, will you?
Please! Be a good baby!

991
01:18:32,349 --> 01:18:34,602
Stop! Give Kiyoko back!

992
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,858
Give me a break!

993
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:43,069
I'm forever in your debt!

994
01:18:48,282 --> 01:18:49,283
Gin!

995
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:53,120
That woman's crazy!

996
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,497
Get closer!

997
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,456
I can't!

998
01:18:55,623 --> 01:18:57,917
You have to, for Kiyoko!

999
01:18:58,125 --> 01:18:59,919
- Who's Kiyoko?!
- Step on it like a man!

1000
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:01,253
Okay!

1001
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:08,719
Please! Be quiet!

1002
01:19:12,431 --> 01:19:13,974
- Gin!
- Geezer?!

1003
01:19:17,603 --> 01:19:18,270
Geezer!

1004
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:21,941
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!

1005
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,692
Pass her!

1006
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:24,652
We'll die!

1007
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:25,569
Step on it!

1008
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:27,405
Okay!

1009
01:19:29,156 --> 01:19:30,825
Stop crying!

1010
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,787
Don't be afraid.
I'll never leave you again.

1011
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:36,372
You want to die?!

1012
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:47,508
Gin!

1013
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:00,896
Gin!

1014
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:04,483
There!

1015
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,778
- Are you okay?!
- Where's Kiyoko?

1016
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:09,530
- Faster!
- Okay!

1017
01:20:29,216 --> 01:20:29,717
Which way?

1018
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,724
We're at the scene...

1019
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:23,396
...where a truck has crashed
into a building in Shinagawa.

1020
01:21:23,604 --> 01:21:27,858
Now a woman holding a baby
has appeared on the roof.

1021
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:33,072
Witnesses say the woman
is connected with the incident...

1022
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,533
...as she was driving the truck.

1023
01:21:41,789 --> 01:21:44,583
Now there's someone else
on the roof!

1024
01:21:49,296 --> 01:21:50,172
Stay away!

1025
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:52,508
No!

1026
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,809
Tell me why you took
that baby.

1027
01:22:01,976 --> 01:22:02,685
I didn't!

1028
01:22:02,977 --> 01:22:05,396
This baby is mine!

1029
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:09,108
You're lying! Its real parents
are worried sick about it!

1030
01:22:09,316 --> 01:22:10,443
That's not true!

1031
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:14,572
You of all people should know
what it's like to lose a child!

1032
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:31,338
She's dead. My baby died
before she was even born!

1033
01:22:38,763 --> 01:22:42,516
All the other babies
looked so healthy there in the ward.

1034
01:22:42,683 --> 01:22:45,186
I wanted to die.

1035
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:47,938
But then this baby
smiled at me.

1036
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:50,149
I decided she was mine.

1037
01:22:50,357 --> 01:22:54,445
I thought as long as I had her,
everything would be fine.

1038
01:22:54,612 --> 01:22:58,282
My husband would mend his ways,
and we'd be a real family.

1039
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:00,242
That's bullshit!

1040
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:05,873
Build a family by ruining a baby's life?
If you're going to die, do it alone!

1041
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,878
A life is a life. It's only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.

1042
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,469
Give her back, okay?

1043
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:27,728
I want to be reborn.

1044
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:30,815
Sachiko!

1045
01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:35,069
Sachiko, don't die!
Come back to me!

1046
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:39,073
I was wrong!
Please, don't kill yourself!

1047
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:42,076
We'll start again!
We'll be reborn!

1048
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,036
Sachiko!

1049
01:23:44,245 --> 01:23:47,039
I'll go first and wait for you.

1050
01:23:51,419 --> 01:23:52,545
Sachiko!

1051
01:23:55,005 --> 01:23:56,257
Please! Let me die!

1052
01:23:56,424 --> 01:23:59,510
Kiyoko wants to see
her mom and dad!

1053
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:06,934
I want to go home.

1054
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:12,565
I'm sorry!

1055
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:21,157
Take her...

1056
01:24:21,782 --> 01:24:24,410
...to her mother and father.

1057
01:24:33,878 --> 01:24:34,628
Oh, no.

1058
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:36,964
Hana!

1059
01:24:38,632 --> 01:24:39,800
I'm okay!

1060
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:41,802
I'm still alive!

1061
01:25:22,426 --> 01:25:26,430
Inspector, I don't know
how to thank you.

1062
01:25:26,597 --> 01:25:30,267
We're not the ones
you should thank.

1063
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:37,441
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.

1064
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:39,860
- In my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah.

1065
01:25:40,027 --> 01:25:43,280
That was some New Year's!

1066
01:25:44,115 --> 01:25:45,866
It's "No Smoking" here.

1067
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:49,161
Lighten up! I'm a hero!

1068
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:51,497
You mean "we"!

1069
01:25:54,959 --> 01:26:00,256
I guess we won't have to listen to
Kiyoko's damn crying anymore.

1070
01:26:00,423 --> 01:26:02,633
She's not "Kiyoko" anymore.

1071
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,136
I'm not pleased.

1072
01:26:06,053 --> 01:26:07,847
What can we do?

1073
01:26:08,055 --> 01:26:09,682
Not that.

1074
01:26:10,224 --> 01:26:12,393
This is a men's ward!

1075
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:16,814
Perhaps we're intruding.

1076
01:26:16,981 --> 01:26:19,191
No, it's just...

1077
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:22,153
...I'm told they're homeless.

1078
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:23,529
Who cares?

1079
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:26,615
We'd like them to be
her godfathers.

1080
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:29,410
Come in.

1081
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:31,620
Excuse us.

1082
01:26:32,413 --> 01:26:35,833
The baby's parents
would like to thank you

1083
01:26:41,505 --> 01:26:42,882
Dad...
