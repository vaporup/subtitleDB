1
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:37,561
"My hands do not
have strength and power."

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,238
"My heart embraces peace and calm."

3
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:53,037
"Resigning myself to adversity.
Seeing richness out of void."

4
00:00:53,349 --> 00:01:00,653
"Violence be turned to peace.
There are always guiding fate."

5
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:08,461
"Dynamic or still. Divide or multiple."

6
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:16,203
"Follow fate to go in and out of
mortal world. Merciless is mercy."

7
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:24,001
"Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy."

8
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:31,544
"Dynamic or Still. Divide or multiple."

9
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:39,259
"Follow fate to go in and out of
mortal world. Merciless is mercy."

10
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:47,435
"Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy."

11
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,526
Tianbao, now that you're a monk...

12
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,821
you've to obey the regulations.
You mustn't kill or eat meat.

13
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,726
Master, I have never eaten any meat.

14
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,899
You're born to be a monk.

15
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:22,570
It's just that we were too poor
to afford any meat.

16
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:24,501
I wanna try its taste, too.

17
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,140
Master.

18
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:29,243
This is Tianbao.

19
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:31,306
He's your senior, Junbao.

20
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,573
Shaolin Temple has very strict rules.

21
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,546
He'll teach you everything.
You must obey your senior.

22
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,845
Junbao, teach him to recite
the Book of Buddha.

23
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,179
Which part?

24
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:42,049
I thought you knew only one part.

25
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,890
Tianbao, my junior.

26
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:48,024
I'm taller and older than you.

27
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:49,628
Why do l have to call you "senior"?

28
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:52,699
I dunno. Master says this is a rule.

29
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:57,362
l'll call you senior
only in front of others.

30
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:59,973
They didn't hear us.
It's like there's no one around.

31
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,237
Do you want to be a senior or not?

32
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,070
Of course!

33
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,769
There's no one now. Call me senior.

34
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,408
- Senior!
- Good boy!

35
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,641
- Let's do our homework.
- Let's play first.

36
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,416
The Hands!

37
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,484
"Dance of the Phoenix!"

38
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,024
"Behold, the Golden Rooster!"

39
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,828
Tianbao my junior, come here!

40
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:31,537
Why do you call me junior
in front of them?

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,004
They won't hear!
It's just the two of us here.

42
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:35,737
You're right.

43
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:37,975
"The Wild Goose Glides along the Beach!"

44
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:40,214
"The Leopard Leaps over the Cliff!"

45
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,974
If I'm given a chance
to practice kung-fu...

46
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,650
I'll be better than them.

47
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,854
Well, this I'll have to
consult the Master.

48
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,414
"The Octagon Transforms Itself!"

49
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,917
Why do you hit me?

50
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:53,788
Why are you messing around here
instead of doing your homework?

51
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:56,157
I am your senior.
I can hit you anytime I like.

52
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,533
Why hit me?

53
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,063
Are you okay, Tianbao?

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,200
You mustn't try learn kung-fu secretly!

55
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:04,264
Let's go! The Master is angry!

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,500
We'll tell our Master. Let's go.

57
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,700
No big deal!

58
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,741
My Master is the senior of yours.

59
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,325
Master, this will keep you
from the sunshine.

60
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:27,025
Everything has a life,
including the plants.

61
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,630
We mustn't hurt the life of nature
for our own profits.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,399
This'd be too selfish.

63
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,467
Understand?

64
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,694
Yes, Master!

65
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:39,329
We won't care if you would be
burnt by the sun.

66
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,105
Master, l want to practice kung-fu.

67
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:45,941
What for?

68
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,243
- To have a healthy body.
- To avoid being bullied.

69
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,407
Think twice.

70
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,648
I'm serious.

71
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,486
You should use your kung-fu
to help others.

72
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,449
Remember that.

73
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,921
Yes, Master!

74
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:04,556
Try this!

75
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,634
Who's that? I'll teach you a good lesson.

76
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,163
Come, join my hands.

77
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,365
Let me cover him up!

78
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,131
- Go to hell!
- Stop!

79
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,034
I know who you are.

80
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:18,277
How do you know that I'm Junbao?

81
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:19,775
You've just told me!

82
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:25,086
It's all your fault!

83
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:26,485
You idiot!

84
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,351
He said he knew!
How did l know that he's lying?

85
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,992
You believed him?
See what you've dragged me into.

86
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:36,855
I'm starving!

87
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,761
Me, too!

88
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,225
- This is really too much!?
- Master!

89
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,803
I told you to practice kung-fu
to help others. You used it to fight!

90
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,802
You've shamed me!

91
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,000
Beating my senior's student!

92
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,801
- Master...
- Shut up!

93
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,239
I'll teach you a good lesson!

94
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:54,075
Master is too lenient with you
by making you kneel for just 3 hours.

95
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,781
Go confess yourself.

96
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,279
Master, have you any red-bean bun?

97
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:58,748
Plain bun will be good enough.

98
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,945
After this, we'll still
have to clean up Luo Han Hall.

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,859
It's all your fault!

100
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:07,892
I told you to be on guard,
yet you went to eat.

101
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,755
Now we're being penalized
by having to clean up Luo Han Hall.

102
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:15,028
You'll be punished one day
for burning the rat.

103
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,271
"The Fairy Sign!"

104
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,733
"The Dragon Shows its Might!"

105
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,437
How did you attack with a pole?

106
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:26,578
How did you play your move?

107
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,174
It's very simple!

108
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,948
"The Fairy Sign!"

109
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,120
"The Dragon Shows its Might!"

110
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:37,055
"The lnvincible Move!"

111
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:38,322
This is called...

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,356
"Knocking on your Head!"

113
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,119
Tianbao, you're playing tricks
with me again!

114
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,490
You're too slow!

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,389
Watch out for your head!

116
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,140
Junbao, wake up!

117
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,833
Tianbao, you gave in to me.

118
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,012
Master always says
to help others with kung-fu.

119
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,648
Everybody practices kung-fu here.
Who should we help?

120
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:06,650
We help ourselves. I want to be
Number One of Shaolin Temple.

121
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,785
You're too naive.

122
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,016
When can I achieve this status?

123
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,488
Beat the 18 Bronze Men
and the Wooden Warriors.

124
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,563
Get off! You mustn't let others see this!

125
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,738
No one will see me!

126
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:26,302
I don't care.

127
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,567
Get off and sit on the ground.

128
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,301
You're bullying me again!

129
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,809
I told you. You're too slow.

130
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,779
I'll go inform on you.

131
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,350
What? You think you can
get away with this?

132
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:54,993
Each punch of Shaolin Fists
must be forceful!

133
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,767
Each move is a surprise for the enemy.

134
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,404
It has to be swift as a wind.

135
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,370
These are the basics of the Fists.

136
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:05,508
You must be every steadfast.

137
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,131
What happened?

138
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:28,860
Easy! The door collapsed
just like that a few days ago!

139
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:32,500
I've told you that it's the termites.

140
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,605
Be careful! Don't eat them!

141
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,345
To achieve the highest level,
your body must be hard as steel.

142
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:04,799
- The bed's collapsed, too.
- Easy...

143
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:08,539
Go to sleep.
We've to practice Iron Palms tomorrow.

144
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:19,980
Junbao, watch my sword.

145
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,355
You're short of practice.
Your arm isn't strong enough.

146
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:29,828
Strike first to forestall the opponent.

147
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,337
Let's practice!

148
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:42,341
What's this? Everything is broken!

149
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:43,938
Now the cloths are like that, too.

150
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,475
The monks at Luo Han Hall
will laugh at us.

151
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,009
We'll tell them that
we've over-washed them.

152
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:49,377
Senior, ours are okay.

153
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:50,745
Of course! I've saved
the best for ourselves.

154
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,110
Master, we're off to do
our morning homework.

155
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,545
What happened to them?

156
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,283
I dunno. Maybe it's the rats.

157
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:01,322
How rampant are the rats
and termites these days!

158
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:02,923
Go do something about them.

159
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:09,430
Where do we find termites and rats?

160
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:10,899
We can tell him that
the sparrows have eaten them up!

161
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,268
Wow! What kung-fu is that?

162
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:16,239
Thank you... It's nothing!

163
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,638
Senior, you're the best among all of us!

164
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,314
I'm sure that you'll win
the martial arts contest.

165
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:21,948
Thanks. I think the same of you.

166
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:23,275
Rice is coming.

167
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:29,485
Watch my stance.

168
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:32,284
- Boy!
- You eat first.

169
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,355
Why did you throw the rice at me?

170
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,061
You saw how I slipped.

171
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,423
I did that, so what? Go tell your Master.

172
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,362
My Master is the jury of the contest.

173
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,696
I'll make sure that you won't
be promoted into the Da Mor Hall.

174
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:45,132
Let me go!

175
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,473
I swear that I'll beat that son of a gun.

176
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,739
Twelve, thirteen...

177
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,241
I've just smashed that.

178
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,438
Junbao, the examination for promotion
into the Da Mor Hall will be held soon.

179
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,707
Do you think you'll make it?

180
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,882
Relax. It's all up to chance.

181
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:01,655
No way! I will be Number One.

182
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,289
That's why I practiced so hard...

183
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,024
How many bricks have you smashed?

184
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,123
Seventeen.

185
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:08,622
Eighteen.

186
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:11,258
How could you do this?

187
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,693
I couldn't!

188
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,734
Your moves are different.

189
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:31,979
"The Buddhist Palms!"

190
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,584
The key lies in the way you breathe.

191
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,053
Today, we're going to choose from
among you the best four students,

192
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:45,723
to be promoted into Da Mor Hall...

193
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,992
to further study
the best martial arts technique.

194
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,105
Remember, the purpose of
kung-fu practice is to help people.

195
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:56,741
The contestants must restrain themselves.

196
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:01,575
The first round: Tianbao vs. Xinbao.

197
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,841
That son of a gun
is going to meet his fate.

198
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:07,948
Please!

199
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,082
Start!

200
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,204
Try my stance.

201
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:36,106
Xinbao, you'll lose.

202
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,353
Surrender!

203
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:48,660
You cheated!

204
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,693
Stop...

205
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,462
How dare you hit me!

206
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,235
Please forgive me!

207
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:04,004
You're simply not fit to practice kung-fu
because of your ferocious intent.

208
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,837
You're expelled.

209
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:09,348
Please, don't.
It's Xinbao who played tricks first.

210
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,143
Are you implying that I'm being unfair?

211
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:12,317
I dare not say so.

212
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,252
Are you blind? Didn't you see that?

213
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:15,887
This is an insult to your masters.

214
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,751
- He didn't mean it!
- Go away!

215
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:24,226
I'm going to destroy
your martial arts skill.

216
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,896
Please, don't!

217
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:27,193
Stay away from this!

218
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,635
"The Buddhist Palms!"

219
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,976
How come you know "The Buddhist Palms!"?

220
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,183
I told you that you're blind!
I learned it from you.

221
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:44,383
Tianbao!

222
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:45,917
He didn't mean to peep.

223
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,782
Catch them!

224
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:50,384
- Deploy the Luo Han Pole Formation.
- Yes!

225
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,743
We're all brothers. Let's talk.

226
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:13,803
Say something.

227
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,779
"Buddha has Sign! Surrender,
all ye Devils!"

228
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:43,734
Tianbao, break the formation
by using the pole, too.

229
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,277
I'll break them up!

230
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,327
You'll never escape this.

231
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,534
- lt's slippery!
- Yeah!

232
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,634
Got it!

233
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:19,533
Junbao, move!

234
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,075
- Watch out!
- Deploy the formation!

235
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,810
It's very slippery!
We can't form our line.

236
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:35,287
"The lnvincible Move!"

237
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:42,060
We're all brothers!
Stop trampling on each other! Stop!

238
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,194
Don't run!

239
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:58,303
Don't let them run away!

240
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,254
- Master!
- Run, quick!

241
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:11,557
Jueyuan!

242
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,051
You're defended for your students!

243
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,163
What are you going to tell
the Chief Reverend?

244
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,008
You're spoilt them so much!

245
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,633
Everyone can see that the son of a gun
tried trick me first.

246
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:30,902
Yet I was the villain!

247
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:32,908
What did I do?

248
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,346
- They even tried to kill us!
- Wonder how's Master doing.

249
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,974
You use Luo Han Pole Formation?

250
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:41,018
There's no justice in the world.

251
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,992
Master, we were wrong.

252
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,186
Fate has it that we have to part.

253
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,331
I can't be your Master anymore.

254
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,828
Join the outside world and learn from it.

255
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,967
The roots of trouble
are also the roots of Buddhism.

256
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:04,735
Junbao, you're a kind man.
I don't worry for you!

257
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,414
Tianbao, you have a
competitive personality.

258
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:11,682
This book is for
the practice of your "Qi".

259
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,615
It doesn't concern with
any martial arts skill.

260
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:15,389
When you're restless and emotional...

261
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,581
it'll bring you peace.

262
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,592
Practice it often.

263
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:24,623
Remember, try keep a peaceful mind.

264
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,298
You don't have to study Buddhism
only in Shaolin Temple Go!

265
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,903
Yes, Master!

266
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,458
Ladies and gentleman,
hope you enjoy the show!

267
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,053
Which school do you think is that?

268
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,127
They're just street entertainers!

269
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:58,226
Why do they shave
only half of their hair?

270
00:18:58,533 --> 00:18:59,864
They stink! They must have
come from Cedan!

271
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,427
I'm starving.

272
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,136
Me, too. Let's go beg for alms.

273
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:07,639
No one pays attention to us!

274
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,570
Are they all that poor?

275
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,209
No. We're just being useless!

276
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,376
I bet that girl over there
won't turn us down!

277
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:15,181
If she has money, she won't have
to perform on the street.

278
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:18,316
You son of a...

279
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,920
May all of you benefactors
have a long and prosperous life!

280
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,178
No wonder we had bad luck today!

281
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:24,220
lt's all you stinking monks!

282
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,689
Happy birthday, benefactors!

283
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:28,556
Wish us good luck in gambling!

284
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,091
Cut the crap!

285
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,561
There's no need to be rude!

286
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,098
- Excuse me!
- It's alright!

287
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,233
Reverend, do you know
someone called Murong Bei?

288
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:42,732
Sorry to bother you!

289
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,881
She's looking for someone;
we're looking for food!

290
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:48,308
We need a job, too.

291
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,711
To earn money.

292
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:51,883
I've realized that
Shaolin Temple is the best.

293
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:54,481
Pay your protection money!

294
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:55,747
I've paid my due!

295
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:57,447
Not to me!

296
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:00,159
Pay or die, you can choose
for yourself! Beat him!

297
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:03,228
I really have no money!
Please, stop! Help!

298
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,021
I have to eat, too!

299
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,227
I'll report to the officer!

300
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:11,200
Really? The Governor is my cousin. Go!

301
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,705
Lady!

302
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,739
Fuck off!

303
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:16,706
Wanna have a drink with me?

304
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:18,976
Wanna go?

305
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,139
Are you too shy to say yes?

306
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,210
Take this money, quick!

307
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,486
It's the villain's!

308
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,449
Thank you, Miss!

309
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,683
Where's my money?

310
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,793
- It's must be her!
- You may leave first!

311
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:34,927
Beat her!

312
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:46,901
Shit!

313
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,041
Bingo!

314
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,735
- Is this a street performance?
- No! They're fighting!

315
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:53,911
Don't you think you can get away.

316
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,078
They've out-numbered her. lt's unfair.

317
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,342
- Shall we help her?
- Of course!

318
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,189
Don't hit her! Hit me!

319
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,422
My pleasure!

320
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:07,489
You hit me first!

321
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,788
Miss, are you alright?

322
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:16,868
Are you alright?

323
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:21,501
I'm okay!

324
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:22,770
The 15th move.

325
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:24,469
The 16th move.

326
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:26,006
17th.

327
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:27,608
18th.

328
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:29,841
20th...

329
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,348
The 35th move...

330
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:33,213
The 36th move...

331
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:36,116
The 36th move... Have you finished?

332
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:38,656
One last move! I created it myself!

333
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:44,963
Could you...

334
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,894
You can never learn
that skill I taught you.

335
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:55,939
Master Liu, who has done this to you?

336
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:57,907
Run, quick! The troops are coming.

337
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,213
Arrest those two monks!

338
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,404
- After them!
- Yes!

339
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,317
It stinks!

340
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:06,552
They're over there! After them!

341
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,091
Guess who I am!

342
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,854
Where are those two damned monks?

343
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:17,260
I look like a Cedan native.

344
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:18,363
So do you.

345
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:19,794
What are you playing?

346
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:21,334
It's a game devised by us.

347
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:22,628
Teach me!

348
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,099
If you win, you'll be senior.
If you lose, you'll be junior.

349
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,671
But he's senior every time.

350
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:28,935
You're just being slow.

351
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,341
You must be cheating!

352
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,140
If you play with me,
I'll be your godmother!

353
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:33,311
Godmother?

354
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,144
Get away!

355
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:38,617
Master Liu will offer
his respect to Buddha! Move!

356
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:02,034
How prevailing!

357
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,809
If he's a Buddhist, why is he so cruel?

358
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,069
He's like a snake inside.

359
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:06,909
He's Liu Jin, the Royal Eunuch!

360
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:08,582
He's killed less people than usual today!

361
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:11,044
I wish I could be as prevailed as he.

362
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,748
Go be a eunuch then.

363
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:14,848
Why not?

364
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:22,463
"Fu Shao Restaurant"

365
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,690
Eighth Master, you're being early today.

366
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,389
I'll prepare some nice dishes for you.

367
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,033
You may order for me.

368
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:27,999
Thank you.

369
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:29,726
Mister, there's a dark mist
on your forehead...

370
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:33,340
Piss off! Keep on eating...

371
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:39,909
Lady, there's a dark mist
on your forehead...

372
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:42,978
Are you looking for someone? May not be
a good thing even if you can find him.

373
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,175
- Would you like to buy a charm?
- Con man!

374
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,278
No big deal for not buying!

375
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,551
The most famous dish here
is roast pigeon!

376
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:52,348
Miss, do they have vegetarian food?

377
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:53,853
Plain rice is fine.

378
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:56,223
Junbao, one has to adapt himself
to strange environments.

379
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,328
Remember what Master told you?

380
00:23:57,532 --> 00:24:00,126
Discover the spirit of Buddhism
in the secular world.

381
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:01,925
Let's try it with this bean curd.

382
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:23,581
"Love starts from the gaze."

383
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,827
Have more bean curd, or you'll have none.

384
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,353
Thank you.

385
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:34,997
Here's your meat.

386
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,731
Miss Liu, welcome.

387
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,967
- We have reserved this table for you.
- My dear.

388
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,646
What wish did Master make?

389
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,914
- Mind your own business.
- Yes!

390
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:54,379
- My dear, please.
- You first!

391
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,419
What do you want to eat, dear?

392
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:01,093
- Anything!
- Whatever you say.

393
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:04,757
Murong Bei! So it's really you.

394
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,802
Qiushue? What are you here for?

395
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,928
Shut up!

396
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,063
All this way for your husband!
How touching!

397
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:17,370
Regrettably, his name is no longer
Murong, but Liu, after my family.

398
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:21,309
He would have starved to death
if I had not saved him.

399
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,941
Men have no shame!

400
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:30,383
They'll stay beside you
if you keep them warm and happy.

401
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:32,921
Don't you see that?

402
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,157
Qiushue! Go home!

403
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:39,122
This guy has no heart!

404
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:43,861
For me, Murong Bei is
no longer a man, but a dog.

405
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:46,164
I used to play this guitar every night.

406
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,802
I would never agree to sell it
for the money I needed.

407
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:55,245
Now everything has changed. Take it back.

408
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:57,607
Trash!

409
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,911
I think you need it move.

410
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,788
Do you know who I am?

411
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:25,479
She's Liu Jin's sister.

412
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,977
Restrain yourself.

413
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:54,373
That's enough. I won't stand it anymore.

414
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,100
Dear, are you alright?

415
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,574
Dog!

416
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:35,478
Have you had enough?

417
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,481
I'm finished with you. Go away!

418
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:42,017
What are you staring at? Piss off!

419
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,990
Let me help you.

420
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:50,195
Miss, you're bleeding.

421
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,296
Excuse me...

422
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,402
Let's change the position.

423
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:57,826
Make way!

424
00:27:58,606 --> 00:27:59,903
Stand still!

425
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,400
Shit!

426
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:05,805
Shameless!

427
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:09,946
Don't be afraid! I'm here...

428
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,810
Who are fighting inside?
Don't move, everybody!

429
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:15,614
The troops are here! Stop fighting!

430
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:17,715
Why are the troops always after us?

431
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,190
Don't let those two Cedanians get away.

432
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,622
Yes!

433
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:24,355
Follow me.

434
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,391
What's wrong? The troops are coming.

435
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:27,827
There! After them!

436
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:31,060
Go to hell!

437
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:34,906
It's heavy!

438
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,599
It's a woman. Of course it's heavy!

439
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:39,168
Buddha, forgive me for being lustful.

440
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,779
Lower your voice!

441
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:44,445
Over here, quick!

442
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,049
Where are those two guys?

443
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:58,787
Back to the restaurant?

444
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,331
Why are we back again?

445
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:02,433
This is a branch.

446
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:04,901
Really! This restaurant
is known across the country.

447
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,733
You two sleep on the floor.

448
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:08,374
I'll look after her.

449
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:12,836
I feel more at ease with being a monk.

450
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,842
Junbao, we mustn't rely on others
Iike that guy Murong Bei.

451
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:19,918
Sure. We'll work for the restaurant.

452
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:21,844
They'll let us stay here
just for the night.

453
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,053
They can't let us stay forever.

454
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,758
I promise I'll become
an official one day.

455
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:29,558
Well, it doesn't matter to me
what you are as long as you're honest.

456
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:32,232
Go along with your late!

457
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,489
Let's go to sleep.

458
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:42,972
My fate?

459
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:54,387
I promise I'll be rich one day!

460
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:06,025
Liu Jin would never have imagined
that his bribe money...

461
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,567
would be stolen from him.

462
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:09,929
What shall we do with the money?

463
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:11,900
We should give it back
to those who owned it.

464
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,573
Give it to the poor.

465
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:16,166
Right... He collected
this tax money from the people.

466
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:19,277
So long as he lives,
we'll keep stealing from him.

467
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:22,880
These people are rebels!

468
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,948
Let's not get into trouble and leave.

469
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,919
I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

470
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:28,383
Alright... go to sleep.

471
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,752
Another masked-thief!

472
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,656
How dare you steal from Master Liu!

473
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:35,786
So what!

474
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:37,658
They threw a piece of gold
into my room last night.

475
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:41,162
They're worth 300 teals of gold each...

476
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:43,028
Mind your own business.

477
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,663
- Delicious!
- Yeah!

478
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:47,331
- Roasted human flesh bun!
- Roasted human flesh bun!

479
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:52,409
Gentleman,
I am a newcomer to this place...

480
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:55,538
What're you performing?
Hitting your chest with an iron hammer?

481
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,850
No. It's human sandbag.

482
00:30:58,185 --> 00:30:59,015
What's that?

483
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,882
One cent for a punch.

484
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:03,952
- What do I gain from that?
- Right!

485
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,991
If I yell in pain,
I'll pay you three cents.

486
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:09,194
What if you throw up blood?

487
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,296
I'll pay you six cents.

488
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:12,659
What if I kill you?

489
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:14,300
If I'm dead...

490
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:17,093
you have had my life!

491
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:22,970
lt's worth at least fifty cents.

492
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,241
Right! Worth fifty punches.

493
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:26,535
You'll die from that!

494
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:30,183
Die...

495
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:33,343
Enough, boss?

496
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:35,913
- More.
- Go on.

497
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,325
I'll kill you.

498
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:44,826
46, 47, 48...

499
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:49,594
Does it hurt?

500
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,600
I was just pretending
in order to hook him.

501
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:53,572
Boss, he's falling apart!

502
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,775
Quick, get up.

503
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,307
Get up and beat him.

504
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:00,713
Where're my servants?

505
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,675
I'll pay you to beat them to death.

506
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,518
How effortless it is to earn these!

507
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,654
It's not good enough.
I wanna make big money.

508
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:12,758
I just wanna have a good meal.

509
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:15,454
I wanna buy a house and be the boss.

510
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:16,518
How many more punches
do you have to take?

511
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:22,300
Give me the money.

512
00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:24,300
Why?

513
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:27,668
For tax! Fifty cents
for your personal profit tax.

514
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,900
Another fifty
for using the government land.

515
00:32:29,977 --> 00:32:31,740
Another fifty for entertainment tax.

516
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,506
Total a hundred and fifty.

517
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:36,482
- I am not going to pay.
- This is tax evasion.

518
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:39,380
Arrest them.

519
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:41,914
Sir, we are just common people...

520
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:44,622
we'll never dare argue with you.

521
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:48,387
Please accept these money. Sir.

522
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:52,498
You're smart.

523
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,464
Sir, we are new here.

524
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:57,302
We don't know nothing but fight.

525
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:58,994
We want to work for you, Sir.

526
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,797
You surely know how to please me.
Beat him!

527
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:05,168
Thank you, Sir.

528
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,813
He deserves it.

529
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:10,175
My pleasure, Sir.

530
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,110
Well, you're real smart.

531
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:16,447
The Royal Eunuch, Master Liu,
is recruiting newcomers...

532
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:18,522
Alright, follow me.

533
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,894
Thank you, Sir. Junbao, let's go.

534
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:25,821
You're really going?

535
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:30,565
I'm not coming.

536
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,964
I'll come look for you
when I become a high official.

537
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:39,437
Tianbao. Take care!

538
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,984
I wish you every good.

539
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:50,253
This is bad for your health.

540
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:54,760
This is bad for your health.

541
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:59,594
Little Melon, there's something
which you simply can't forget.

542
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,502
You wouldn't understand.

543
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:10,141
Where's Tianbao?

544
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:13,436
Look at me! You still
want the company of men?

545
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:14,978
I didn't say I like him.

546
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,850
Very telling! Drink up!

547
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,285
This is wine, not tea.

548
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:23,084
No one drinks like this.

549
00:34:23,457 --> 00:34:24,947
Don't drink anymore.

550
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,553
Give it back to me!

551
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:28,157
It's broken. No more wine.

552
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:30,958
Kid, one should enjoy one's life.

553
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:33,428
You're okay.

554
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,396
Mind your own business.

555
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:38,931
Stop drinking,

556
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,273
- will you?
- None of your business.

557
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:44,132
Again?

558
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,345
He'll stop when he's tired.

559
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,213
I can't stand it anymore.

560
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:49,979
I have wine here.

561
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:51,779
I don't know which side I'd be on.

562
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:54,254
- What do you want?
- lt's my own life!

563
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,618
I'll do what I like.

564
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:58,252
Go on...

565
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:01,093
Break them all so that there won't be
any wine left. Let me help you.

566
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,625
Will you calm down?

567
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,826
Zhang Junbao, will you let go of me?

568
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,675
Stop!

569
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:19,136
You...

570
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:21,611
Calm down!

571
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:23,982
The past only makes up one's experience.

572
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:25,708
It mustn't become one's burden.

573
00:35:26,053 --> 00:35:26,849
If you go on like this,

574
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,751
you'll only have yourself to hurt.

575
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,742
Why are you always
playing with that ball?

576
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,044
I'm trying to understand the "Tao".
Everything is round in Taoism.

577
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:58,683
The sun is round, so is the moon.

578
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:01,548
One has to be a little smooth
and round, too.

579
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:05,219
Who's the boss here?

580
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,187
Show his face!

581
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,495
Sirs, you're early.
We haven't started business yet.

582
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:12,589
Do they come for tax again?

583
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,028
Come in and have some dim-sum.

584
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:15,728
Cut the crap. Pay your tax.

585
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:17,628
We did a few days ago.

586
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:20,169
You ate a few days ago, didn't you?

587
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,940
Master Liu is expanding his armament.

588
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:24,904
You've to pay a military uniform tax
and entry tax, a good-living tax...

589
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:27,806
This restaurant has to pay taxes
worth 500 taels of gold.

590
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,482
It's worse than robbery?

591
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,184
You aren't involved in
anti-government activities, are you?

592
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:33,446
Even the government has to be reasonable.

593
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,709
Bullshit.

594
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,682
Be patient!

595
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,829
Whoever has a sword in his hand
can raise his voice.

596
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,064
Eat this!

597
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:50,068
Persevere!

598
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,261
If you don't eat this,
I'll arrest everyone here!

599
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,405
Does he look stupid?

600
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:03,383
No! We mustn't bring troubles
to our brothers.

601
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:06,345
It's alright if you don't have any money.

602
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,518
But you must koutow to me for 30 times,

603
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:11,349
I'll consider granting you an exemption.

604
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,254
Koutow, quick!

605
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:17,221
Kneel!

606
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:18,756
Kneel!

607
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:20,099
You're tough!

608
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:23,701
If you don't kneels, it'll mean that
you're an anti-government rebel.

609
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:25,527
I'll execute you.

610
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,437
This is too much. Go to hell!

611
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:32,512
Koutow!

612
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:36,247
You rebels! I'll kill all of you.

613
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:39,610
You go to hell!

614
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:44,384
Shut the door. Don't let anyone go!

615
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,256
What sins we've committed!

616
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:57,060
You go get rid of these corpses.

617
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,770
Get him! We'll be dead
if we let go of him.

618
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:11,638
It's not right! How come you're
running backwards?

619
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,377
We're both vegetarians
and therefore of the same species.

620
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,979
Do me a favor.

621
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:24,488
Shit! It's almost the barracks!
Please, run!

622
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,522
If we don't get him, it'll mean disaster.

623
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:29,519
What happened, Sir?

624
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,124
The gang at the restaurant are rebels.

625
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,389
I'll report to Master Liu.

626
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,333
- Stop him!
- Yes!

627
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:41,638
I've killed him for you.

628
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:47,510
Junbao, the ones at the restaurant
aren't good people.

629
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,012
You mustn't go around with them.

630
00:39:49,216 --> 00:39:50,547
I think they're pretty nice people.

631
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,018
Now I'm a soldier and you're a criminal.
We'll become enemies.

632
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:54,217
No!

633
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,648
How is your life in the barracks?

634
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:02,357
I have always been the bully.

635
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:03,693
How are you?

636
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:06,229
Me? I think I like my old days better.

637
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:07,664
We were so carefree.

638
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:10,496
I'd be extremely happy
if I had a sweet bun.

639
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,762
Junbao, don't think of the past anymore.

640
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,407
Look at what's lying in front of you.

641
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:19,473
It's reality.
I'll fulfill my wish one day.

642
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:28,883
How do I ride this horse?

643
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,187
It's simple.

644
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,887
It's too fast.

645
00:40:34,428 --> 00:40:36,623
I am the Lord of my own destiny!

646
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,858
The purpose of today's contest
is to choose...

647
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,790
the person with the best
martial arts skill to be the general.

648
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:13,465
Let's start.

649
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,449
Master, it's too easy for me.

650
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,312
So, whoever isn't convinced
can come up and challenge me.

651
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:39,720
Master, my name is Dong Tianbao.
May I learn from you?

652
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:42,819
My pleasure.

653
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:55,966
Yes!

654
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:12,381
Very vicious!

655
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:13,884
I'll warn him.

656
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:28,830
Master!

657
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,037
Disband!

658
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:44,386
You're trespassed your rank.
You're not worth being a soldier.

659
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,589
You've shamed me.

660
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:50,988
Don't you know that in the army,
you mustn't offend the majority?

661
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,856
Luckily the Master is being very kind...

662
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,925
Master...

663
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:58,536
I was being too impatient.

664
00:42:58,805 --> 00:42:59,965
I don't want to be just a soldier.

665
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,539
Give me one more chance
and I'll perform for you.

666
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:06,609
Then I'll wait to see your performance.

667
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,018
Qiushue, you can be a bar-tender here...

668
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:18,816
Good idea! As long as
there's wine for me, I'll be happy.

669
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:22,217
Junbao can be a waiter.

670
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:23,224
Yeah!

671
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,027
Will you wash the toilet?

672
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:25,960
No problem.

673
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,565
Will you wash my underclothes?

674
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:28,665
Okay...

675
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:30,802
Stinking monk! You're so lazy!
You don't wash your underpants?

676
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:34,437
What are you laughing at?

677
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:37,671
Tianbao.

678
00:43:37,877 --> 00:43:38,935
What bring you back, Tianbao?

679
00:43:39,112 --> 00:43:40,636
Quick, let's go.

680
00:43:41,248 --> 00:43:42,738
They've found out everything...

681
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:44,710
the money you stole
from the Master and the killings.

682
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:47,249
Master Liu is leading
the troops to arrest you.

683
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:49,120
Let's go, then.

684
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:50,721
You go first. I'll destroy the evidence.

685
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:52,516
- Be careful!
- Quick!

686
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:03,432
- Go inside and arrest them!
- Yes!

687
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,232
Boss!

688
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,296
Did you kill my tax officer?

689
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,872
You impotent oppressor! I'll kill you.

690
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,111
Boss, rest in peace!

691
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:23,146
Bless us in heaven!

692
00:44:23,456 --> 00:44:25,822
We must revenge for Boss.

693
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:29,460
I'll go to the barracks single-handedly
and kill the Master!

694
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:32,027
Do you have a plan?
How can you be so impatient?

695
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:33,629
Last time he didn't plan,
yet he killed them all.

696
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:36,859
We can't fight the whole army!

697
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:40,840
You must know the other
anti-government gangs.

698
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:43,141
Why didn't you contact
and join forces with them?

699
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,736
I'll head the attack.

700
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:47,309
Good! I'll be the internal connection.

701
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:49,411
Most of the army will cross the river
for a practice 2 days later.

702
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:51,106
This is the best chance
to assassinate Master Liu.

703
00:44:51,351 --> 00:44:54,013
You should try contact
the other comrades...

704
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:54,914
All right!

705
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:57,146
We'll co-ordinate with each other
and destroy them.

706
00:44:57,357 --> 00:44:59,154
- Great!
- Let's prepare for the strike.

707
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:02,087
- Yes!
- Tianbao! Take care!

708
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:21,977
That way!

709
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:33,184
Who is it?

710
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,158
It's me. Just bad a leak.

711
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,825
- I wanna pee. Together?
- Okay?

712
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:48,435
I'm nervous. Makes me wanna pee, too.

713
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:52,201
Be serious.

714
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:55,375
- Where's the Master?
- Resting inside.

715
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:56,979
There are only a few guards.
We must not waste the chance.

716
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:58,081
Right!

717
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:23,973
- Why is it like this?
- Where's Tianbao?

718
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:26,502
Kill them!

719
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,542
Attack!

720
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:50,098
Strike! Come on, kill them!

721
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,103
Strike!

722
00:46:52,272 --> 00:46:54,536
I've killed five of them, Blacksmith.

723
00:46:58,478 --> 00:47:00,070
What a tragic fate I have!

724
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:01,779
Keep your life.

725
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:04,114
To live is to die, to die is to live.

726
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:01,433
Tianbao, did you betray us?

727
00:48:14,954 --> 00:48:16,114
I wanna earn more than my life's worth.

728
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:38,034
Brother blacksmith...

729
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:40,910
Who'd betrayed us?

730
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:42,512
Brother blacksmith, hang on...

731
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:51,288
Who'd betrayed us?

732
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:02,057
Who'd betrayed us?

733
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,081
Tianbao?

734
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:02,689
Let's go.

735
00:50:08,668 --> 00:50:09,726
Qiushue!

736
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:11,465
Junbao, run!

737
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:35,350
I've overestimated their strength!

738
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:38,530
But your clever set-up...

739
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:40,857
did save me a lot of troubles.

740
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:44,259
I'm remain loyal to you, Master.

741
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:45,968
If you can betray your best friends...

742
00:50:46,172 --> 00:50:48,834
you can also betray me in the future.

743
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:50,803
Master, my career depends on you.

744
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:52,602
Will I destroy my own career?

745
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,346
Tianbao, I should have promoted you
to General last time.

746
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,849
But you were only a soldier.

747
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:03,022
Your promotion would cause jealousy
among your fellow soldiers.

748
00:51:03,423 --> 00:51:06,950
But from now on,
you'll be the Royal Lieutenant.

749
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:08,351
Thank you, Master.

750
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:14,565
The one who escaped
has great martial arts skill.

751
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,596
I'll need the best persons.

752
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,804
Recruit him if you can.

753
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,404
Let's all work for his Majesty.

754
00:51:20,473 --> 00:51:22,304
Destroy him if you can't.

755
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,884
- Get up. Let me carry you.
- Stop pretending.

756
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:34,246
You traitor!

757
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:35,953
You dragged them to death.

758
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:39,291
Go to your good brother
for wealth and poor!

759
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:41,289
My poor brothers, how you have died!

760
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:44,261
I'll kill you.

761
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,154
Don't...

762
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:48,860
He doesn't feel any better than you.

763
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:51,126
He was betrayed by the one
he trusted most.

764
00:51:51,337 --> 00:51:52,929
We mustn't blame him.

765
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:55,163
It's all your fault!

766
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:57,300
Let's go back!

767
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,275
Junbao!

768
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:03,338
I'll go save them by myself.

769
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:33,476
I know you'll be mad at me.

770
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,670
But I just wanted to save you.

771
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,541
Those rebels would have met
their fate sooner or later.

772
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,317
The most important thing is,

773
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:43,113
we'll be together ever after.

774
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:12,140
I thought you're a ruthless person.

775
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:15,682
I've never realized that
you can't even give up a woman.

776
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:18,689
Master... I was being too impulsive.
I beg your forgiveness.

777
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,024
I'll kill you.

778
00:53:21,394 --> 00:53:23,658
You're betrayed us. You should die, too.

779
00:53:24,864 --> 00:53:27,025
How can you keep a rebel in you barrack?

780
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:28,957
Are you a lieutenant?

781
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:40,275
I'm successful because
I don't need a woman.

782
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:41,937
Master doesn't like woman.

783
00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:43,809
I mustn't destroy my career
for a woman either.

784
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:48,078
But I didn't ask you to kill her.

785
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:49,781
Thank you, Master.

786
00:54:18,517 --> 00:54:20,815
Junbao, the door of great wealth
has been opened for you.

787
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:23,316
It's awaiting your entry.

788
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:25,389
I don't want it. Release her.

789
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:27,320
Have you forgotten that
we've been together for twenty years?

790
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:29,857
We shared everything among ourselves.

791
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:30,960
Master Liu has agreed to promote us.

792
00:54:31,197 --> 00:54:32,687
We've got lots of opportunities.

793
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:36,128
Let's build our career on these
and be a great man.

794
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:38,200
I don't know you anymore.

795
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:41,064
I don't know anyone
who betrays his friends for wealth.

796
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:44,707
Just look at the fate of those rebels!

797
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:47,001
They died because I trusted you.

798
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,009
I'm responsible for their lives.
Release her.

799
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:53,017
Whoever stops me must die!

800
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:54,513
- Strike!
- Yes.

801
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:14,732
I'll ask you one more.

802
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,401
Will you join me?

803
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:18,297
I'm all by myself. I'm useless to you.

804
00:56:38,224 --> 00:56:39,691
Junbao, don't press me.

805
00:56:40,493 --> 00:56:41,983
You pressed me into this.

806
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:43,927
Junbao, your kung-fu is inferior to mine.

807
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:45,953
For all of them innocent victims.
I'll have to fight you.

808
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:48,926
I've killed Little Melon, too.
I am not surprised to hear that.

809
00:57:56,368 --> 00:57:58,666
Junbao, I'll strike.

810
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:08,342
I wanna teach you. One more stance.
Strike fist to forestall the enemy.

811
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:26,826
"One-Thousand-Catties Pendant"!

812
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:44,140
Junbao!

813
00:59:07,473 --> 00:59:09,498
Put it on his wound.
This is very effective.

814
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:12,442
Persevere. It won't hurt.

815
00:59:15,915 --> 00:59:17,542
Why doesn't he feel anything?

816
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:21,011
How come?

817
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:29,687
He's no feeling at all.

818
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:33,626
Is it painful?

819
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:35,231
Very painful.

820
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,759
Hang on!

821
00:59:39,004 --> 00:59:40,904
What do you think?

822
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:42,968
He's had the hardest blow of his life.

823
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:45,142
He was betrayed by someone
he most trusted...

824
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,776
and so many people were killed
because of that.

825
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:49,207
This accounts for his abnormal behavior.

826
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:50,947
Will he be able to recover?

827
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:52,879
Maybe in a couple of days.

828
00:59:53,352 --> 00:59:54,580
You knew that I'd mistrusted Tianbao!

829
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:56,684
You're a Sacred Man.

830
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:58,648
You shake your head and sign.

831
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,289
Admirable...

832
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,826
I don't think he can recover
in two or three year's time.

833
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:05,525
Admirable!

834
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,103
- I didn't betray you.
- Junbao...

835
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,340
I didn't betray you. I didn't.

836
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:24,209
It's alright! It's just a dream.

837
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:28,946
No, it's true. It's all true.

838
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:34,317
They were all sitting here.

839
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:35,925
The Boss, the blacksmith...

840
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:37,527
Drink some wine to calm down yourself.
Come on.

841
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,228
To calm myself?

842
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:50,173
I know I killed you.

843
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:54,275
But I can't control myself.

844
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:59,278
Sorry...

845
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:05,991
Will this work?

846
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:07,618
No harm in trying.

847
01:01:09,528 --> 01:01:11,792
Make him talk.

848
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:14,423
Junbao.

849
01:01:16,168 --> 01:01:17,965
- Sacred Man.
- Sacred Man?

850
01:01:18,937 --> 01:01:20,029
The Sacred Man is dead.

851
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:26,070
- This will do you good.
- Yeah, it is.

852
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:27,606
I don't want any good, you take it.

853
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:31,977
Hey, don't go...

854
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:39,450
There's no need to cry like this.

855
01:01:39,858 --> 01:01:41,917
No, he punctured my crying nerve point.

856
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:44,051
You've been punctured too.

857
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:48,600
It's your laughing nerve point.

858
01:02:12,257 --> 01:02:13,485
You're a pile of shit.

859
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,521
He Kun, how did you train your troops?

860
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:18,486
Shitty coach, shitty soldiers!

861
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,855
You don't have to insult me.

862
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:24,933
The way you coach them...
they'll rebel against you someday.

863
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:28,072
Only the best will survive.

864
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:30,506
Including yourself.

865
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:33,475
Dong Tianbao,
although you control the military...

866
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:36,771
you mustn't forget,
I'm the one who gave you your break.

867
01:02:37,015 --> 01:02:38,141
The military law has no room
for gratefulness.

868
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,916
He Kun, we have no friendship.

869
01:02:40,986 --> 01:02:43,750
I think we should stop.
I'll go see Master Liu.

870
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:55,532
Those who disobey must die.

871
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:57,535
Go on practice.

872
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:04,606
Junbao.

873
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:06,574
Where's he?

874
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:08,337
Strange.

875
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:11,142
Junbao.

876
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:18,349
Stay cool.

877
01:03:18,724 --> 01:03:20,919
Why? You look awful.

878
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:22,821
Watch out for your wounds!

879
01:03:23,796 --> 01:03:25,229
I'm okay!

880
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,088
You should all stay cool.

881
01:03:34,573 --> 01:03:35,972
Come out.

882
01:03:38,243 --> 01:03:39,608
It hurts...

883
01:03:39,978 --> 01:03:41,309
This is a good sign of recovery.

884
01:03:42,047 --> 01:03:42,945
Master!

885
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:46,007
Master, I'm afraid...

886
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:48,118
I don't want to practice kung-fu,
I don't want to fight.

887
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,083
I am just a little hungry.

888
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:55,218
Master, you've lost weight
and grown taller!

889
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,354
More wrinkles,
but still smart and handsome.

890
01:03:58,831 --> 01:03:59,923
Junbao...

891
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,430
That's only a log, not your Master.

892
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:04,329
Don't hit me...

893
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,600
Don't kick me.

894
01:04:12,778 --> 01:04:14,678
- Don't kick me.
- Please.

895
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,180
Are you alright?

896
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:25,989
Yes!

897
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:29,517
- Does this look okay?
- Alright.

898
01:04:30,696 --> 01:04:32,323
It's alright,
he simply needs a good rest.

899
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:43,268
Go to sleep...

900
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:47,939
This sheet is too small.

901
01:04:48,313 --> 01:04:49,211
Is this okay?

902
01:04:49,414 --> 01:04:51,211
If I don't make it this time.

903
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:52,577
I'll slap myself ten times.

904
01:04:55,954 --> 01:04:58,684
Rest well and you'll recover.

905
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:09,031
Gosh! I deserve it...

906
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:13,972
12345678...

907
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:16,140
You helped me build my confidence once!
I'll help you do the same.

908
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,369
Ten times more.

909
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:33,290
We mustn't let down the Lieutenant.

910
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:35,050
- He has high hopes on us.
- Yes.

911
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:36,553
Whoever doesn't practice hard enough...

912
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:39,030
will be persecuted by military law.

913
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:42,192
- Listen, soldiers.
- Yes.

914
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:47,332
To practice kung-fu,
you must have a body hard as steel.

915
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:02,119
Keep on practicing, don't ever stop.

916
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:08,815
Zhang Junbao, you've caused
the deaths of so many people...

917
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:10,493
you deserve to die, too.

918
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,923
I'll take your life.

919
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,924
- Take my life.
- He does this almost every morning.

920
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:18,861
Don't you understand?

921
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,706
You do? I don't understand what you said.

922
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,203
I do.

923
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:29,403
He's like this at noon, too.

924
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:32,016
The third time happens in the evening.

925
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:34,819
Three time a day.

926
01:06:35,053 --> 01:06:37,954
Let's call him
"Sanfeng" (Thrice crazy) instead.

927
01:06:43,428 --> 01:06:44,986
Junbao, time to eat.

928
01:06:45,197 --> 01:06:46,789
You haven't eaten for three days now.

929
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:50,098
You eat your rice,
you don't smell them, Sanfeng.

930
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:11,116
Eat!

931
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,928
Punctual as a clock, Sanfeng!

932
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:29,702
Master, these are the rebels I arrested.

933
01:07:29,908 --> 01:07:31,239
And the tax I collected.

934
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,671
You've done my job.

935
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:39,109
I'm just learning from you, Master.

936
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:41,615
I simply want you to enjoy your office.

937
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:45,414
There're rebellions
all across the country...

938
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:47,525
Except my province.

939
01:07:47,993 --> 01:07:49,927
Tax returns are high, too.

940
01:07:50,228 --> 01:07:53,720
His Highness has asked me
to report to the Royal Court.

941
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:57,024
We'll be loyal to you, Master...

942
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:59,328
to return the kindness
you bestowed on us.

943
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:01,904
The other officials
should learn from you.

944
01:08:02,274 --> 01:08:05,334
Why don't you join me to the Capital?

945
01:08:06,912 --> 01:08:07,901
Thank you, Master.

946
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,842
But before that I don't want
to hear anymore rebellions...

947
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,349
nor any discontents of the Court.

948
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:17,215
Yes, Master.

949
01:08:22,694 --> 01:08:26,130
We wish you the best of luck, Lieutenant.

950
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:43,437
Junbao, the water is dirty.

951
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:44,706
Drink this.

952
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:46,740
Thank you.

953
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,076
Your hands are dirty, wash them.

954
01:08:50,522 --> 01:08:51,420
They're clean now.

955
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,421
Junbao, I've told you that they're dirty.

956
01:08:54,493 --> 01:08:55,926
Me dirty? Okay, I'll wash myself.

957
01:08:56,128 --> 01:08:57,925
No, Junbao...

958
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,119
Let me wash.

959
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:04,026
The sun and the air will help you.

960
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:07,030
I'll stand over here.
The sun will burn me.

961
01:09:08,173 --> 01:09:09,071
No.

962
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,436
Nature has its own life.

963
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:18,905
This tree has withered,
but a new life has just begun.

964
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:20,414
You can be that.

965
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:22,613
Brother...

966
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:23,981
What's the matter?

967
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:25,019
Sister-in-law has just given birth.

968
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:26,383
- Go home now.
- Really?

969
01:09:26,591 --> 01:09:27,888
Quick...

970
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,091
What shall we call the baby?

971
01:09:31,062 --> 01:09:32,654
The firewood are surely heavy.

972
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:34,421
Your child's waiting for you.

973
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,792
Put down the firewood, you're greedy.

974
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,770
Right... Quick!

975
01:09:42,007 --> 01:09:43,065
Wait!

976
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,902
Lower your burden,
run towards the new life.

977
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:47,772
I wish he could be home quickly.

978
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:52,179
Lower your burden,
run towards the new life.

979
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:59,287
Lower your burden,
run towards the new life.

980
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:09,362
This is the book of the "Qi",
not a bible of martial arts.

981
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:13,468
When you're confused,
it can bring you peace.

982
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,602
This book of the "Qi" is so mild,
it doesn't want to kill the enemy,

983
01:10:20,946 --> 01:10:22,208
but teach you how to make
the best use of the chance.

984
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:24,412
Stick together.

985
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:27,879
Don't use force. The force will break it.

986
01:10:28,753 --> 01:10:30,345
But if I don't use force,
how to break it?

987
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:32,216
Not to use trick.

988
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,752
Trick will end it.

989
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,557
Keep the air to match the universe.

990
01:10:38,163 --> 01:10:40,097
No desire, no lust.

991
01:10:41,499 --> 01:10:43,899
What other moves have you devised?

992
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:49,535
No root, no dust, all natural.
That's called Tai Chi.

993
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:53,834
Tai Chi?

994
01:10:57,115 --> 01:10:58,742
I am alright.

995
01:10:59,317 --> 01:11:01,808
It's just that I still feel
a certain responsibility.

996
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:03,349
The past forms parts of your experience.

997
01:11:03,688 --> 01:11:05,622
It shouldn't become your burden.

998
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,319
Junbao, eat.

999
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:11,757
You've just recovered. You must eat more.

1000
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:12,854
Sanfeng.

1001
01:11:17,269 --> 01:11:21,000
Sanfeng (Triple richness)?
Zhang Sanfeng? Sounds good.

1002
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,306
Yes...

1003
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:28,402
Forget the past, Junbao!

1004
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:35,876
Why doesn't he sleep in a lying position?

1005
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:38,279
He can't sleep.
That's why he doesn't lie down.

1006
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,889
Cut the crap.

1007
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,484
He's put a piece of iron down under.

1008
01:11:43,628 --> 01:11:47,029
Let your breath precipitate.

1009
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:55,703
Keep your centre of gravity and
use other's force to strike your force.

1010
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:02,480
A swirling ball can spin away
other objects that hit on it.

1011
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:03,943
But the ball stands on itself
steady and firm.

1012
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:05,442
I didn't eat because of you.

1013
01:12:08,753 --> 01:12:09,879
Shit.

1014
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:12,752
There are always movements
even in stillness.

1015
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:19,457
He seems to have understood something.

1016
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:30,367
No matter how hard I strike the ball,
it'll spring back by the water.

1017
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:31,967
The stronger you are,
the stronger the opponent.

1018
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,171
I can't even defeat water!

1019
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:35,879
How are you, Junbao?

1020
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,378
Have you gone crazy again?

1021
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:40,113
I know what is natural now.

1022
01:12:40,285 --> 01:12:42,378
Everything is found in the nature.

1023
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,690
Who is he?

1024
01:13:00,205 --> 01:13:07,270
"My hands do not have
strength and power."

1025
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:14,676
"My heart embraces peace and calm."

1026
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:22,293
"Resigning myself to adversity.
Seeing richness out of void."

1027
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:30,097
"Violence be turned to peace.
There are always guiding fate."

1028
01:13:30,769 --> 01:13:37,971
"Dynamic or still. Divide or multiple."

1029
01:13:38,343 --> 01:13:45,772
"Follow fate to go in and out
of mortal world. Merciless is mercy."

1030
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:53,321
"Dynamic or still. Divide or multiple."

1031
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:16,205
"Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy."

1032
01:14:16,681 --> 01:14:23,917
"Follow fate to go in and out
of mortal world. Merciless is mercy"

1033
01:14:24,322 --> 01:14:31,387
"Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy."

1034
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,428
What is the matter?

1035
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:39,661
My dear.

1036
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:41,133
Kneel!

1037
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,670
Where's Zhang Junbao? Any accomplice?

1038
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:48,068
Who? Which Zhang Junbao?

1039
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:49,405
Kill his wife!

1040
01:14:50,014 --> 01:14:51,879
- Mom...
- If kill her, he doesn't confess.

1041
01:14:52,217 --> 01:14:53,707
- Dad...
- No...

1042
01:14:54,018 --> 01:14:55,144
Don't kill my daughter.

1043
01:14:55,353 --> 01:14:56,877
- Kill!
- Sweetheart!

1044
01:14:57,322 --> 01:15:00,314
You killer! Damn you.

1045
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:02,056
- You killer!
- You are cheap!

1046
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:06,262
Whoever defends for Zhang Junbao
is an enemy of mine.

1047
01:15:06,664 --> 01:15:08,393
The end will be like this.

1048
01:15:12,337 --> 01:15:13,861
Reverend Ling!

1049
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:15,403
What happened?

1050
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:17,274
Dong Tianbao is getting
more and more powerful.

1051
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:18,965
He's even more ruthless than Master Liu.

1052
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:21,711
He's killed the whole family
of the food-store owner.

1053
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,074
He said he's going to kill more people...

1054
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:26,978
if we didn't inform on your whereabout.

1055
01:15:27,852 --> 01:15:29,649
Take care of yourself. We'll go first.

1056
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:32,122
You, too.

1057
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:35,620
Taoism teaches us to avoid disaster
and behave ourselves. Let's go.

1058
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:38,522
Taoism also teaches us to forget oneself
and save other people's lives.

1059
01:15:38,696 --> 01:15:40,721
You should know
the importance of nothingness.

1060
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:43,829
If you've a heart, it doesn't matter
if you must practice none thingess.

1061
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:46,997
To avoid more deaths...

1062
01:15:48,139 --> 01:15:50,573
I must stop him.

1063
01:15:51,109 --> 01:15:53,077
If ever something happens to you.

1064
01:15:54,145 --> 01:15:56,340
It's all predestined!

1065
01:15:56,548 --> 01:15:57,845
I will go with you.

1066
01:15:58,349 --> 01:16:00,180
Reverend, you'd better stay.

1067
01:16:00,885 --> 01:16:02,443
I know I'll only bring you trouble.

1068
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:06,550
These charms usually don't work.

1069
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:08,416
I hope they'll work this time.

1070
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:12,492
I've studied Taoism all my life.
But you realize its truth all in a blink.

1071
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:15,961
You'll be the Master of Masters.

1072
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:17,498
I'd better retire.

1073
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:23,432
Congratulations. Please.

1074
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:27,771
You'll have a long life
and enjoy great wealth.

1075
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:38,515
May God bless you!

1076
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:54,262
You rebels, how dare you come here?

1077
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:56,003
To meet your fate?

1078
01:16:57,442 --> 01:16:59,205
This is the end of your life.

1079
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,071
You can't escape anymore.

1080
01:17:02,146 --> 01:17:03,113
Kill him.

1081
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:17,723
God is benevolent!

1082
01:17:19,464 --> 01:17:21,125
Why fight with swords and weapon?

1083
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:22,919
Don't kill me.

1084
01:19:23,354 --> 01:19:25,822
I just want a favor.

1085
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:26,982
Get up.

1086
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:06,358
- Don't get mad.
- Be careful of Master Liu.

1087
01:20:06,564 --> 01:20:07,861
Step back.

1088
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:12,631
Step back.

1089
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:29,008
Junbao, you've become smarter
by taking Master Liu as a hostage.

1090
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,619
I've been a smart man all my life.

1091
01:20:30,822 --> 01:20:33,086
I'll never employ such tricks.

1092
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,315
What do you want?

1093
01:20:34,392 --> 01:20:35,586
I wanna tell you.

1094
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:38,487
You've chosen a way of no return.

1095
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:44,331
You've always been inferior to me,

1096
01:20:44,535 --> 01:20:46,662
in terms of conspiracies
and martial arts.

1097
01:20:47,038 --> 01:20:48,096
I've even exploited you once.
You're no equivalent to me.

1098
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,405
Tell him to kneel.

1099
01:20:51,242 --> 01:20:52,402
Kneel...

1100
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:54,775
Kneel!

1101
01:20:58,382 --> 01:20:59,713
You're kneeling to me now...

1102
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:01,417
How will you defeat me?

1103
01:21:02,553 --> 01:21:05,317
Junbao, didn't you like to help people?

1104
01:21:05,857 --> 01:21:07,119
I earned my power
by paying a lot of efforts.

1105
01:21:07,391 --> 01:21:08,449
I won't give it up.

1106
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:09,990
Do me a favor.

1107
01:21:10,194 --> 01:21:11,684
Release Master Liu.

1108
01:21:12,029 --> 01:21:13,621
Fame and wealth are only temporary.

1109
01:21:14,098 --> 01:21:16,362
I'm acting for Heaven.

1110
01:21:17,668 --> 01:21:19,135
I'm my own God.

1111
01:23:04,775 --> 01:23:06,072
What school of boxing is this?

1112
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,370
Nature is the origin of everything.

1113
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:12,339
Tai Chi!

1114
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:57,422
Junbao, I'll never allow myself
to be defeated by you.

1115
01:23:57,662 --> 01:24:01,223
You're obsessed with lust and desires.
How can you win?

1116
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:05,829
"One-Thousand-Catties Pendant!"

1117
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:37,691
You can't balance yourself,
how can you attack?

1118
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:54,744
Go down!

1119
01:25:01,525 --> 01:25:02,856
Use other's force to strike one's force.

1120
01:25:21,846 --> 01:25:24,644
Kill him!

1121
01:25:24,849 --> 01:25:27,181
No one move!

1122
01:25:27,585 --> 01:25:29,212
I'll kill whoever moves.

1123
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:32,214
Attack! Why don't you attack him?

1124
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:34,448
- Don't you move, too!
- I don't move...

1125
01:25:34,925 --> 01:25:35,823
You!

1126
01:25:36,026 --> 01:25:37,823
Master Liu ordered me not to move,
it's not my wish.

1127
01:25:37,895 --> 01:25:40,363
Dong Tianbao,
if only I lose a single hair...

1128
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,023
I'll chop your head.

1129
01:25:48,506 --> 01:25:50,565
- Master Liu...
- He killed the Master.

1130
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:56,606
- What should we do...
- Master Liu...

1131
01:25:57,815 --> 01:25:59,976
Master Liu has died. Now I'm the leader.

1132
01:26:00,217 --> 01:26:01,878
- Attack!
- Go...

1133
01:26:02,086 --> 01:26:03,018
He's killed Master Liu.

1134
01:26:03,087 --> 01:26:05,248
He'll kill you all sooner or later.
Will you still help him?

1135
01:26:06,423 --> 01:26:07,822
Don't move!

1136
01:26:08,425 --> 01:26:09,824
Step back.

1137
01:26:14,865 --> 01:26:17,333
Everyone has deserted you now.
No one's going to help you.

1138
01:26:40,224 --> 01:26:42,055
Help me, are you going to against me?

1139
01:26:42,593 --> 01:26:44,288
You deserve it.

1140
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,729
You don't ever treat us as human beings.

1141
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:47,991
You took us as buddies
when you were a soldier.

1142
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:49,723
But you put on air
once you were promoted.

1143
01:26:49,967 --> 01:26:58,534
Kill him...

1144
01:27:16,794 --> 01:27:24,997
Kill him...

1145
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:35,105
Please forgive me before l die.

1146
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:36,705
I've wronged you!

1147
01:27:37,448 --> 01:27:41,214
Junbao, think of the times
we spent together...

1148
01:27:42,353 --> 01:27:44,014
Will you forgive me?

1149
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:46,781
You always defended me
when we were small.

1150
01:27:49,827 --> 01:27:51,454
Don't trust him.

1151
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:57,433
Go to hell.

1152
01:28:08,545 --> 01:28:16,816
Okay...

1153
01:28:34,605 --> 01:28:36,596
If he dies, what about me?

1154
01:28:45,983 --> 01:28:47,041
Let's part here.

1155
01:29:05,102 --> 01:29:06,330
Where're you going?

1156
01:29:07,471 --> 01:29:09,496
I'm bringing Tianbao's ashes
to the Master.

1157
01:29:10,874 --> 01:29:12,637
Shall we see each other again?

1158
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,103
Our fate will tell.

1159
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:20,949
Farewell, Zhang Sanfeng.
