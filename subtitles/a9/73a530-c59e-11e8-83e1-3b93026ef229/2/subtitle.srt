1
00:00:01,097 --> 00:00:04,589
Bring back my clothes and handbag.

2
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:27,690
Why?

3
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,117
Clothes.

4
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:40,559
Clothes? Yes, yes, ok.
Come here.

5
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:15,731
Aaah! Look over there!

6
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:39,455
- Whoa!
- What the hell do you want?

7
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:43,090
I am gonna tell
you right now! Yeah?

8
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,724
First! Put on some clothes!

9
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,941
Hey, fucker. What are you
looking at me for? Come on up here!

10
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,740
Nothing's happening here.
Just go. Just leave. Please!

11
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,941
If you don't back away in 1 minute!
I'm gonna push him off!

12
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:07,685
Push? Push?

13
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:10,789
- This is hilarious!
- Which broadcasting company did you come from, you fuckers?

14
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,359
Just take it easy.

15
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:21,299
That's why I said to leave here.
We'll be down soon.

16
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:28,774
- Hey, bastard! You still don't have your pants on?
- I'm wearing them.

17
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,946
What are you bastards doing?

18
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:41,456
- Don't move fuckers!
- Everybody's going to die, fuckers!

19
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,659
Help me!

20
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:47,323
Help me!

21
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:56,035
Help me!

22
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:00,169
Help me!

23
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:07,075
This bastard is the one with
the bull's testicles?

24
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,117
Yes.

25
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,674
What kind of fool is
this character?

26
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,313
It says in his chart that
he's a student but!

27
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,553
38 hours ago he came in with
an erection and he's still got it!

28
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,457
isn’t that dangerous?

29
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:23,329
If it doesn't go down by tomorrow
we'll have to cut it out.

30
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,435
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,308
It’s ok.

32
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,812
You hurt there twice now.

33
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:54,056
I've got to go now. Take care.

34
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,119
Yes.

35
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,879
When did you meet him?

36
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:17,681
Not too long ago.

37
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:19,278
Tell me about him.

38
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,289
He's the best looking hottie on campus.

39
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:22,790
What's a hottie?

40
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:27,796
Oh, you know it's all right.
He's very kind to me.

41
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:30,356
Strange guy.

42
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:31,897
What?

43
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:34,664
Why would such a handsome guy
be interested in a girl like you?

44
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:36,261
What's so special about you.

45
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,705
I'm very popular in school.

46
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,572
That's crap!

47
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:44,340
Can't you see that I'm a hottie too?

48
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:48,817
B.S. Does a hottie have
tiny breasts like you?

49
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,876
I can't even recognize where they are!

50
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,717
- Let's see!
- No.

51
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:54,518
Let's see.

52
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,821
Mom, show me yours first!

53
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,368
No! Let me see if you're
a hottie or not-let's see yours.

54
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,243
No! Look at that! Look at that bitch!
That bitch has a hickie. She always
has a souvenir from her nights out.

55
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:28,409
She really embarrasses me.

56
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:31,078
What is a hickie?

57
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:33,452
It’s a love bite.
A bruise on your neck you bitch!

58
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,219
How do you get that?
A mosquito bite?

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,091
Hello? If a mosquito bites you
do you put on a bandage?

60
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:44,360
This bitch is so stupid.

61
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,595
Aah! Next week is your birthday!

62
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,660
Right!
Do you want anything?

63
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,000
Why?
You gonna buy me something?

64
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:52,098
Well~ We'll see how you
act in the next few days.

65
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,243
Let's eat some Ramen.

66
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:06,920
- Did you check out that ring?
How much is it?
- How much do you think it is?

67
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:08,883
How much?

68
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,391
More than a 1000 bucks.

69
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
Hey, fucker! What kind of
a ring costs more than a grand.

70
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,988
Not even a championship belt
would cost that much! Fuck!

71
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,692
How can I get a 1000 bucks
in one week.

72
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,783
Older hey, take off your pants!

73
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,686
Take your shirt off!

74
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:59,631
5, 6, 7, 8. Look ahead!
Look at your hands! Hands!

75
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,643
Don't move your legs!

76
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,109
Back straight!
Keep your backs straight!

77
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:12,150
Stand up bitch, or I'm gonna
whack you on your head!

78
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:16,116
How can we win
a championship like this?

79
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,126
The competition is
in less than a week.

80
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:24,064
Don't you guys think!
Don't you have brains?

81
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,338
Are you sure?

82
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,001
What?

83
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,909
Don't you use birth control pill?

84
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:43,475
See! Those bitches are all alike!

85
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:48,513
How can you tell if the baby is yours?

86
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:49,955
Did you check?

87
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:55,657
Just give her a couple of hundred bucks
and tell her to get rid of it. Okay?

88
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:34,803
Can't you just do it?

89
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:39,240
No. You'll have to come back
tomorrow with your guardian.

90
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,850
- What's up?
- Do you have time tomorrow?

91
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,475
Why?

92
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,281
I've made an appointment.

93
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,821
Appointment?

94
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,585
Why?

95
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:07,294
What is this?

96
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:10,133
You need money to do that, uh?

97
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,567
Why? You want me to go with you?

98
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:17,870
Today is my birthday.

99
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:22,113
You and me have birthdays.

100
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:25,621
But this baby will never have one.
It’s just waiting to die.

101
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:28,282
When did I ask for money from you?

102
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,850
Why do you have to
make me so pathetic?

103
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:43,829
What's this?
Change it.

104
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:47,307
Look at this one more time.
Look at the finish on this.

105
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,037
No, no, Miss!

106
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,479
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

107
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:34,717
Dear Eunhyo
Happy birthday to you.

108
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:08,746
Surprise!

109
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,427
Yeah, I bought an expensive stuff for her.

110
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:30,907
But next thing I know she popped me and then
she's giving me a nasty look.

111
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,206
Where the hell is it?
jeez...

112
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:35,716
Yeah, so I pulled it out.

113
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:41,155
I gave it to her and thought
she would be happy! Fuck!

114
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:47,822
But she slapped me and
fuck I fell down so hard. Fuck!

115
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,565
Excuse me...

116
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,427
Is that possible?

117
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,807
Listen Eunsik.

118
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:05,973
What do you mean she popped you?

119
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:12,148
Is that some new language?

120
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,086
Do you know what
you're talking about?

121
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,255
I don't know.

122
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,358
You don't know
then it's not important.

123
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:31,035
- Hello.
- Eunsik.

124
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:34,569
Eunhyo?

125
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:36,612
What are you doing today?

126
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,410
A date?

127
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,648
Are you her guardian?

128
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,646
Yes.

129
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:25,316
You're not kids!
Why aren't you more responsible.

130
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,156
Sex is not a game to play with.

131
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,630
You should think about the consequences!
Your enjoyment can ruin a woman's life!

132
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,258
Do you understand what I'm saying?

133
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,060
Yes...

134
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:43,670
Lee Eunhyo.

135
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:44,804
Yes.

136
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,813
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

137
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,698
Lie down.

138
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,808
What are you doing?
Hurry up and lie down.

139
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,009
- Are you ok?
- Move aside.

140
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:07,980
What are you doing?

141
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:19,831
We're almost there, easy, easy!

142
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,497
Do you want something to drink?

143
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,878
Relax. I'll be back soon.

144
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,012
Where are you going?

145
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:37,575
I'll be right back.

146
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:40,421
Eunsik.

147
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,851
Don't tell Sangok.

148
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,367
Please, I really need to
refund this ring.

149
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:55,733
Sorry, I can't help.

150
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:59,672
I paid you $1000,
just give me back $950.

151
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:00,731
Sorry, sir. We can't do that.

152
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,678
I will give up $50.
Please I just need to get the money back.

153
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:40,439
Are you awake?
Just a minute.

154
00:18:59,034 --> 00:18:59,898
Here you are.

155
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,898
- It’s painful!
- Ok. I know.

156
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:07,602
Don't move!
Just stay still.

157
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,675
My mother said abortions are
just as difficult as giving births.

158
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:20,513
You have to keep your body warm
for at least 15 days

159
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,820
afterwards otherwise it hurts
even more when you're old.

160
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,901
This hand.

161
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,210
What are you crying for?

162
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:53,281
Do you want me to show
you my exercise routine?

163
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:59,892
Hup! The basis of these
exercises is patience and gut.

164
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,162
Say it! Gut!

165
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:15,669
Are you kidding?
Say it! Louder! Gut!

166
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:18,971
Gut!

167
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:12,721
One! Two! Longer One, two,
three, four! One, two, three, four!

168
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,029
Five, six, seven, eight.

169
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:19,465
One, two... Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

170
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:20,160
Yahoo!

171
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:24,103
What's that? Keep your legs straight!
Look at your feet!

172
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,509
Hey!

173
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:43,786
You little shit, what time is it now?
What are you thinking?

174
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:45,553
You don't remember that
tomorrow is the big competition?

175
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,219
Have you finished goofing around?

176
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,364
I'm sorry. Don't worry about me.
Let's practice!

177

One, two, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

178
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,602
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Aaugh, What's the matter?

179
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:07,047
We are invited to the national
championships to perform tomorrow.

180
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:09,879
- It’s going to be broadcast on TV.
- Really?

181
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:10,611
Hello, where were you?

182
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,779

00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:48,054
1, 2, 3...

185
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,784
Oh, no, no!

186
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:53,385
Not this bastard again!
What's up with him?

187
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:56,829
What's all this about?

188
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,490
What are you doing here?

189
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,263
What did you hit me for?
Didn't you say Taehak had no stamina?

190
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:03,167
Stop talking shit, you bitch.

191
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:05,502
What the fuck! It’s annoying.
I can't keep doing this!

192
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:08,042
Fuck!? How dare you could
say such a word to me?

193
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,772
What are you hitting me for?
What are you hitting me for?

194
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:44,045
Enjoy a great performance of the
National University Aerobic athletes!

195
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:23,344
- Hold on.
- Why are you so late?

196
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:25,886
Songguk is really pissed!

197
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:26,943
You're dead!

198
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,683
Hurry up and get changed.
We're in trouble.

199
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:31,453
- Hold on.
- You have to hit in the center.

200
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:33,619
Hold here! It’s ok.

201
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:38,060
Hey~

202
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:40,824
How are you?

203
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:44,338
We're gonna lose
because of you!

204
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:26,003
Waaaa! Ok!

205
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,873
We'll now take
a ten minute intermission!

206
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:34,939
Until then the Sunjong University
Concentration Power Team will entertain us!

207
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:38,577
Our team's first performance!

208
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,849
Yippie! Yea!

209
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,895
Hup!

210
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:24,795
Hup!

211
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,371

212
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:31,859
Oh! Look at that!

00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,898
Oh, damn!

214
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,502

Excellent! Fantastic!

217
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:03,121
Thank you, thank you!

218
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,895
That's great! Terrific!

219
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:15,037
I knew you guys could do it!

220
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,737
It’s ok it won't make any damage.

221
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,176
What's going on!
After eating it'll be ok.

222
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,578
- Songguk, Songguk.

223
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:23,117
- Songguk, Songguk.

224
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:26,278
Perfect! Everything was perfect!

225
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:30,123
- Songguk, Yoomi
- The next competition is for Solo Female Routines.

226
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,159
Competitors be prepared.

227
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:39,326
Lee Eunhyo! Eunhyo!

228
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:41,995
Where is that bitch?
Where is she?

229
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,970
That brainless bitch!

230
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:48,172
Lee Eunhyo. Lee Eunhyo.

231
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:51,038
What time is it!

232
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:17,499
Next is Lee Eunhyo,
a junior from Sunjong University.

233
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,294
Go for it, Eunhyo!

234
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:04,945
I'm losing my voice.

235
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:08,877
Where's Eunhyo?

236
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,510
Eunhyo? In the restroom.

237
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:13,213
- Restroom?
- Yes.

238
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:17,219
Why is he panting for?

239
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:20,022
Eunhyo, where are you?

240
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:27,294
Eunhyo, what's wrong?

241
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,877
I'm bleeding.

242
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:40,477
Eunhyo.

243
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:45,008
Eunhyo! Eunhyo! Eunhyo!
Eunhyo wake up! Wake up!

244
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:54,859
Eunhyo wake up! Wake up!

245
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:59,924
Where should we go?
Where! Where! Where?

246
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:22,555
Eunhyo! Hang on.
We are almost there!

247
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:31,189
You can't come in here.
You must wait.

248
00:34:57,592 --> 00:34:58,820
Mother!

249
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:13,463
Bitch, you can't do this!
How can you do this to me you bitch?

250
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:22,313
Why don't you die you bitch!
How could you do this to me?

251
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:25,819
How can you do this to me
after how I raised you?

252
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:32,520
Bitch! I didn't raise you like this!
Is that all you are? Huh?

253
00:35:32,593 --> 00:35:34,652
Why?
What are you doing?

254
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:38,927
How could you after I raised you so well!

255
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,194
What are you doing?
Please calm down!

256
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:46,605
What! Did you do this?
Did you to this to my daughter?

257
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,078
My Eunhyo! What are you
going to do? My Eunhyo!

258
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:54,742
You bastard! You did this to my Eunhyo!
You bastard!

259
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:59,185
No! Stop it!
Mother! Mother! Mother...

260
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:02,620
- Congratulations! Yea!
- Thank you.

261
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:12,357
Eunsik!

262
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,298
Why are you still wearing you uniform?

263
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:15,893
- Our performance finished long ago.
- Sit down.

264
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,232
It’s just a joke!

265
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:25,239
No! Don't!
Stop him! Stop!

266
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,985
Leave me! Leave me alone!
You motherfucker!

267
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:35,445
What's with all the language?
Sit down and chill out.

268
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:38,151
Fuck you!

269
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,716
Fuck you!

270
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:42,627
Have you been drinking?

271
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:47,500
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Love is not a fucking joke!

272
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,071
Your one time enjoyment!
Fuck!

273
00:36:54,108 --> 00:37:01,071
It hurts the woman and now that woman'll have
to spend the rest of her life with that pain.

274
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,179
Fuck you!
You've learned only shit!

275
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:08,017
You don't know what love is!
Fuck you!

276
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:12,519
What can of crap is going on here!

277
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,691
Take out your hand and go in.

278
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:46,947
Hit me anywhere you want.

279
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:49,687
Hup!

280
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:54,120
One, two.

281
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,832
Hit me on three!

282
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:02,694
Wha!

283
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:07,007
One, two, three!

284
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:20,616
Now this is how it should be!
Come on, Eunsik.

285
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:28,588
Hit me anywhere!
Anywhere.

286
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:30,597
Really? I can hit anywhere?

287
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:35,066
My body is like a stone!
A stone!

288
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:50,107
Who put a real balk in here?

289
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,157
I'm so fucking embarrassed!
Shit!

290
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,255
Hey...

291
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:07,355
Maybe the exterminator is spraying again.

292
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:08,224
Exterminator?

293
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,094
Yeah, it's a monthly thing.

294
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:12,655
I see.

295
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:20,841
Eunsik!

296
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,404
Yes?

297
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:29,210
Have you changed your mind?

298
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:32,816
Changed what?

299
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,923
You said you love me?

300
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,459
When did I say that?

301
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,688
If not! Never mind.

302
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,482
What shit's going on!

303
00:42:37,118 --> 00:42:38,585
Fire!
