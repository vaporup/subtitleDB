1
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,480
Good morning, Doctor.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,560
Good morning, Charles.
You're looking splendid.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,000
I feel splendid.

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,000
Every day, and in every way,
you're feeling..

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Better and better.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,480
- Indeed.
- Well, won't you sit here?

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
Wouldn't you like me to..

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Not unless you want to.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,280
No. I'll be quite comfortable here.
Thank you.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,120
Doctor, I'm surprised.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
Oh, of course. You quit.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,480
Three months ago.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
You know, there was a time
when your forgetfulness...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,080
would have made me feel
very rejected.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,960
- Not now, hmm?
- Well, a little rejected, perhaps.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,920
- Did you do it intentionally?
- Why should I do that?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Well...

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm a patient you consider
to be completely rehabilitated...

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,440
on your recommendation soon to appear
before the sanity board...

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,640
your reputation on the line.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
A little test, perhaps, hmm?

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,040
Not very long ago,
an obvious trick like that...

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,200
would have sent you
into a towering rage.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
And poor old Clouseau
would have silently...

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,440
and passively submitted
to another massacre.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
It's a miracle you were somehow able
to keep putting him back together again.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,800
Poor old Clouseau.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,640
There was a time
when I couldn't even speak his name.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,040
And there was also a time
when you would joyfully have killed him.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Yes.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,840
I was a sick man, wasn't l?

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,120
We've come a long way, haven't we?

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,200
And you're not even a little bit
bothered when you think of Clouseau?

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Not even a little bit.

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,680
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
Well, I could be lying.

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,640
You are a good psychiatrist,
but I may be a better liar.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
For your sake, I hope you're not.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,800
Sooner or later,
you'd run into Clouseau...

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,080
and then back here for life.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,840
No more chance
of another hearing.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Coming here day after day, watching you
chain smoke yourself into an early grave...

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,520
and knowing that on certain mornings,
you'll be particularly morose and testy...

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,240
because you've had another fight
with your wife...

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Iike this morning.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,760
- How do you know that?
- It's the only time you doodle.

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,720
I keep forgetting you used to be
chief inspector of the Surete.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
And will be again.

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,840
But Clouseau
is chief inspector now.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,320
Till the better man comes along.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,320
Well, in that case...

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,240
I think lnspector Clouseau had better
start looking to his laurels.

53
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,920
What? You mean...

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,280
The board meets at 2:00
this afternoon.

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,040
This afternoon?

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,760
If everything goes as I expect it to,
you'll be out of here this afternoon.

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,920
- Thank you.
- See you at 2:00.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Clouseau!

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
Now, now, Doctor.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Some people would consider
your methods most unorthodox.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,160
I was just making sure that you're not
a better liar than I am a psychiatrist.

62
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
2:00.

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,640
Come along. Good.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
How.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,280
Help!

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Grab hold of this.
Pull. Pull on this.

67
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Help!

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Out, in.

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,920
- Don't look, Fiona!
- Out, out.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,600
And now the kiss of life.

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,640
Pervert!

73
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Dirty old men!

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
Please, there is no need
to thank me.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,040
- Thank you?
- For saving your life.

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,760
Someone...

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,640
I was hit on the head.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,040
Yes, you have received a bump
upon the head.

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,480
- "Beump"?
- What?

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,960
- You said "beump."
- Yes, I know that.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,960
It is a large bump.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,640
You could receive a concussion
from such a bump.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
- Allow me to assist you.
- No!

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm all right. I'm fine.

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Never better.
Just a little shaky.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Probably the shock of...

87
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,280
I mean, the surprise
of seeing you here again today.

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,120
Well, I received a report...

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
from the sanity commission...

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,200
that they were going
to review your case today...

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,760
so I thought a few words from me
on your behalf...

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,040
Oh, God...
I mean, how generous of you, but...

93
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, I'm not without influence,
you know.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes, I know that.

95
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,800
Yes, I have become
a rather important official...

96
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,720
in the department.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,320
I've heard you are the new
chief inspector.

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,760
Yes.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes, we made quite a few changes
since you went crazy.

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
For the better, I'm sure.

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,240
By the way, Sergeant Chevalier
sends you his kind regards.

102
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh, Sergeant Chevalier.

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,760
Good old Sergeant Chevalier.
How is he, anyway?

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, you know, there are leaders
and there are followers...

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,960
and I'm afraid Sergeant Chevalier
will always be a follower, no?

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, yes.

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,200
And you, my friend Clouseau...
a leader, huh?

108
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,120
Always a leader?
Onwards and upwards to the top, hmm?

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,120
- It is my karma.
- What?

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,440
- My destiny.
- Oh, yes.

111
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes, a few more years
on the force...

112
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
and I might even be persuaded
to run for the public office.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
You can count on my vote.

114
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,040
And you, my friend,
can count on me...

115
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,200
to do everything in my power
to get you out of this place.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, yes. I know how you feel.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,040
My hat. Well...

118
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Are you all right,
former Chief lnspector?

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,560
Yes!

120
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.

121
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
See?

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,960
One moment,
and I will have you extracted.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm fine. I am perfect.

124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,120
Every day, and in every way...

125
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm getting better and better.

126
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,440
Somewhere over the rainbow

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm afraid that this
is just not your day, my friend.

128
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,360
But it is my day.

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
It is, my friend.

130
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,400
After three long terrible years...

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,320
it is at last my day.

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,960
I will not permit...
repeat... not permit anything...

133
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
repeat...
anything to spoil it.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Now, I will walk you to the gate...

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,200
and I will kiss you good-bye...

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,040
and you will drive off
in your new car...

137
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,160
which should rightfully be mine...

138
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,080
and then I will have my interview
with the sanity commission.

139
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
And they will set me free,
and then...

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,680
I will kill you.

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,480
- Kill you!
- Francois!

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,000
Start the car!

143
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
Kill!

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
I'll kill him!

145
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I want to kill him!

146
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
I've got to kill him.

147
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
Oh, allow me.

148
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,000
Cato?

149
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Forty winks.

150
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,320
It's the phone.

151
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
The phone is ringing.

152
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,400
Relax. I'll get it.

153
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,400
This is Chief lnspector Clouseau's
residence.

154
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,160
This is Chief lnspector Clouseau...

155
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
speaking on the phone.

156
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,600
What? Oh, put him on.

157
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Good evening, Commissioner.

158
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
How are you? How is Madame
and all the little commissioners?

159
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
I see.

160
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Well, you can rest assured...

161
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,120
that I shall take every precaution
that is necessary.

162
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,960
Thank you, Commissioner,
and good evening.

163
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,160
I have just received word
that former Chief lnspector Dreyfus...

164
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,680
has escaped from the insane asylum.

165
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
For some reason,
the deputy commissioner...

166
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
thinks that he might try
to kill me.

167
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,960
Obviously, the poor man is crazier
than anyone gives him credit for.

168
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,520
Nevertheless, I am ordered
to take every precaution.

169
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,680
See that the back and front doors
are locked...

170
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,520
while I slip into
my new hunchback disguise.

171
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,720
Both doors are locked now.

172
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,640
Who are you?

173
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,760
What have you done
with lnspector Clouseau?

174
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

175
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,480
Fooled you, didn't l?

176
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,600
Oh, Chief lnspector,
that is fantastic.

177
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,760
If you think this is fantastic...

178
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,080
wait till you see the full effect
with the hump.

179
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,080
The bells!

180
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
They deafen me!

181
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
Chief lnspector Clouseau?

182
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,760
Yes, this is
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

183
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,480
Who is speaking?

184
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,400
My name is Duval.

185
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,120
Claude Duval.

186
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,480
I have the honor to be chairman...

187
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,560
of the Jacques Clouseau
presentation committee.

188
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,280
The presentation committee?
For me?

189
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,080
For what purpose, may I ask?

190
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
For what purpose, you ask.

191
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,120
How modest of you.

192
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
The purpose, monsieur,
is to honor...

193
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
one of the city's most dedicated...

194
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,800
brave and selfless public servants.

195
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,640
You are most generous, monsieur.
Most.

196
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,960
Yes, I must admit I have often wondered,
considering my years on the force...

197
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,280
and my numerous accomplishments, why
recognition was not forthcoming earlier.

198
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,640
Absolutely right.

199
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,360
Nine years faithful service
at the Surete...

200
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
and not as much as a single decoration
in all that time.

201
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Yes, that is quite correct.

202
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,960
However,
as you are no doubt aware...

203
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,680
I have recently received
an important promotion.

204
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,000
Really?

205
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,440
I have replaced the lunatic Dreyfus
as chief inspector.

206
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,560
I know, and I'm sure Paris sleeps
the more safely because of the change.

207
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,960
You're very most kind.

208
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,480
But I can assure you when it comes
to matters of keeping the peace...

209
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,920
I'm always on my toes.

210
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
Chief lnspector.

211
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
One moment, please.

212
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,800
Can't you see
that I'm on the phone?

213
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,320
Oh, yes, Commissioner.

214
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,040
Fortunately, there was sufficient air
still left in my hump...

215
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,400
to keep me afloat
until the rescue.

216
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,520
Yes. Well, thank you very much,
Commissioner. Good-bye.

217
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,720
That was the commissioner.
He was most concerned.

218
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Well, you have been
very, very lucky, you know.

219
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,120
Yes, I know. Poor Cato
will be in the hospital for weeks.

220
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,520
Do you know what kind
of a bomb it was?

221
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,480
The exploding kind.

222
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,960
Mark my words, Francois.
Sinister forces are at work.

223
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,280
And this mad bomber
must be apprehended at all costs.

224
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,000
Make sure you issue
an all-points bulletin immediately.

225
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,440
- Yes, sir.
- What about my clothes?

226
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
Oh, Sergeant Chauvin
is rounding some up for you.

227
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,360
While you're waiting,
perhaps you'll sign the order...

228
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,280
to transport Jean Tournier
to prison.

229
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,080
Tournier the bank robber?
I shall be happy to sign that order.

230
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,320
Ah, it's life for you
this time, Tournier.

231
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,960
At last, we are rid of you.

232
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,000
I have to go to the toilet.

233
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,040
All right.

234
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,960
Thank you.

235
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,280
All right, Tournier.
That's long enough.

236
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,400
Now this is my plan.

237
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
Step number one:

238
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,120
I will recruit the world's greatest
criminal minds. Step number two:

239
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,720
I will build an organization
so sinister, so powerful...

240
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,920
by comparison, the Cosa Nostra
will seem like the Vienna Boys Choir.

241
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,200
- Here is the list.
- But half of these men are in prison.

242
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,040
- We'll get them out.
- Impossible.

243
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,720
I'll bet you 20 million francs
it isn't.

244
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
- Where would I get 20 million francs?
- I thought you'd ask that.

245
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,760
Step number three: Next Thursday
at precisely 2:00 p.m...

246
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,760
you and six men will enter the main
branch of the Paris credit bank.

247
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,280
This afternoon, at approximately
five minutes to 5:00...

248
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,200
three men dressed in building
maintenance uniforms...

249
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,800
entered and robbed
the Paris credit bank.

250
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,280
The leader has been identified
as Jean Tournier.

251
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,120
How much did they get?

252
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
Millions. Here's the report.

253
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,600
All right. That will be all,
Francois. Thank you.

254
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,440
Twenty million francs.

255
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,240
And now, the next step.

256
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,200
Hugo Fassbender and his daughter
have been kidnapped.

257
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,760
- Professor Fassbender?
- Yes. Paris has a theory.

258
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
They're sending over their top man...
a Chief lnspector Clouseau.

259
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,720
He just sent this telegram. "Arrived
Gatwick Airport, B.R. 121, 12:38 p.m."

260
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,960
Yes? Who are you?

261
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,840
- Jarvis, sir.
- And what is it you do?

262
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,800
- I am the butler.
- Ah, the butler. Yes, yes.

263
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Can you tell me where you were
on the night of the kidnapping?

264
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,400
- Asleep in my room, sir.
- Asleep in your room.

265
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,600
- Can you prove that?
- No.

266
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,720
Make a note of that,
Sergeant Yard.

267
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,120
Tell the staff to assemble
in the drawing room.

268
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,360
I will interview them
in a few moments.

269
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,280
Yes, sir.

270
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,160
- What was your name again?
- Jarvis.

271
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,160
Jarvis, that's right. Perhaps you'll be
kind enough to show me around the house.

272
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,080
Very good, sir.

273
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,800
I suggest we start
with the upstairs.

274
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,400
- This is the upstairs, sir.
- Yes, I know that.

275
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,600
This is a door.

276
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,680
Yes, that is a door.

277
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,760
- Yes, I know that.
- It's not locked, sir.

278
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,280
Obviously.

279
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,360
Stay where you are.
I prefer to handle this alone.

280
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Is there anybody hiding there
in the dark?

281
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,160
Nothing like a good warm-up
when you're on a case, you know?

282
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,080
Tell me, which switch did you use
to turn on the lights?

283
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,000
The light switch, sir.

284
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
Strange. It didn't work for me.

285
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,240
Yes.

286
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,920
Unless I miss my guess,
this would be the gymnasium room.

287
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,880
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. It is a good room.

288
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
Yes.

289
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,320
This reminds me of my younger days
at the Surete police academy.

290
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,360
The parallel bars... my speciality.

291
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,400
I was something of an athlete,
you know. Yes, yes.

292
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,800
I was known as the Pavlova
of the parallels.

293
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,240
Oh, yes.

294
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes, it's all coming back now.

295
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes, I remember it...

296
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,800
Well, that felt good!

297
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
Well, now. I expect you're all wondering
why I asked you here.

298
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,640
It's obvious that the knight
that wore that suit...

299
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,040
did not last very long.

300
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,800
Yes, yes. I know.

301
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,720
Now.

302
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,960
Yes. As I was saying...

303
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,880
You were saying you supposed
we were all wondering why you called us.

304
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Look. There is no need for you to speak
unless I ask you a question.

305
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,160
- What is your name?
- I'm Shork, the gardener.

306
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,640
- And what is it you do?
- I'm the gardener.

307
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,600
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

308
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,640
- I did.
- Don't be funny with me, monsieur.

309
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,920
This is a very serious matter...

310
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,280
and everyone in this room
is under the suspicions.

311
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,040
- "Reum"?
- What? What was that?

312
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,200
- You said, "Reum."
- Yes, I know that.

313
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,840
And there is a very good chance
that someone in this room...

314
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,200
knows more about the murder
than he is telling.

315
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,120
- Murder?
- What was that you said?

316
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,040
- I said murder.
- What murder?

317
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,360
Well, I don't know.
You said murder.

318
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,320
I said murder?
You said murder!

319
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,080
No, I said murder
because you said murder!

320
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,240
- I said murder?
- You said someone in this room...

321
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,960
knows more about the murder
than he's telling.

322
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,880
Now listen...

323
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,040
- What was your name?
- Shork.

324
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,560
- The cook.
- Gardener.

325
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,160
Now we are getting somewhere.

326
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,920
You...

327
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,880
Oh, dear!

328
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,400
Are you all right,
Mr. Stutterstutt?

329
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,680
- Who is this man?
- He's Mr. Stutterstutt.

330
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,080
I see, and what is your job,
Mr. Stuckerstuff?

331
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
He's the beekeeper.

332
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.

333
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,120
What's that? What is he saying to you?
What? What was that?

334
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,280
He says he's got a bit of a cold,
and he's lost his voice.

335
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,320
Lost his voice. A beekeeper
who has lost his voice...

336
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,400
a cook who thinks he's a gardener...

337
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,800
and a witness to a murder.

338
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,120
Oh, yes. It is obvious
to my trained eye...

339
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,920
that there is much more
going on here...

340
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,840
than meets the ear.

341
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,200
Before you are dismissed,
Mr. Stiffsticker...

342
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,600
I suggest you count your bees.

343
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,280
You may find that one of them
is missing.

344
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,880
You ruined that piano!

345
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,800
What is the price of one piano...

346
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,040
compared to the terrible crime
that has been committed here?

347
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,280
But that's a priceless Steinway!

348
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,280
Not anymore. What is your name?

349
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,240
Mrs. Leverlilly.

350
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,480
Mrs. Loveliver.
I would take a shrewd guess...

351
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,640
that you are the housekeeper,
right?

352
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,360
I have been with Professor Fassbender
for 30 years.

353
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,360
That would account
for your exaggerated hysteria...

354
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,240
over a simple blemish
on the furniture.

355
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
Blemish!

356
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,120
Whatever has happened to the piano
can easily be repaired.

357
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,040
What has happened
to Professor Fassbender...

358
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,880
and his daughter
is another matter.

359
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,160
And it is my job to bring the guilty
party, or parties, to their justice.

360
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Now, then, what do we know?

361
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,600
One: That Professor Fassbender...

362
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,840
and his daughter
have been kidnapped.

363
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,480
Two: Someone has kidnapped them.

364
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,760
Three: My hand is on fire.

365
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
Drummond, what's going on?

366
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,840
Good afternoon, sir.

367
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,520
Inspector Clouseau
has been interrogating the staff.

368
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,720
Inspector Clouseau,
Superintendent Quinlan.

369
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, lnspector.

370
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,000
Superintendent.

371
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Why don't you just tell Potters
that he's incompetent...

372
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,120
and request that he be taken off
the case?

373
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,200
Because we've got enough trouble
with France...

374
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,240
without suggesting that
their greatest detective is a fool.

375
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,080
Steady.

376
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,960
Where is he now?

377
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,000
He is shadowing
the Fassbender farm.

378
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,320
Hello, sailor.

379
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,760
- Yes?
- Who are you?

380
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,680
Chuck. Who are you?

381
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,160
What's that?

382
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,400
I am Chief lnspector Jacques Clouseau
of the Surete.

383
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,160
- How exciting.
- I think I will just take a look around.

384
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,080
Yes. Well, you'll have to make use
of the bar first or take a table.

385
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,480
- The show starts in a few minutes.
- In that case, I will take the table.

386
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,600
Right. Follow me, Jock.

387
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,760
- Jacques.
- Jack?

388
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,920
Ladies and gentlemen, once again...

389
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,400
it is my profound pleasure
to introduce...

390
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,160
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis!

391
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,680
What's a queen

392
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
Without a castle

393
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
You're right

394
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,360
No queen at all

395
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,680
And you'd be right again to say

396
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,400
The winter's day

397
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Is cold

398
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,000
Till you

399
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,920
Come

400
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,440
Until you love me

401
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I always will be wanting

402
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,960
This need I need

403
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Can come from only

404
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,800
You

405
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,920
Until you love me

406
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,760
I'll live a life of longing

407
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,040
For that's the next best thing

408
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,040
I can do

409
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,080
No way of knowing

410
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,520
Which way you're heart is going

411
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,080
To go

412
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,200
I don't think you know

413
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,920
Take as long as it takes

414
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,160
Your love

415
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,080
To grow

416
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,000
Until you love me

417
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,920
Not one dream can come true

418
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,080
In all my dreams

419
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,800
There is a place

420
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,640
For you

421
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,880
And so I'll keep those dreams

422
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,240
Until

423
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,440
You love me

424
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,680
Too

425
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,600
Why is it that this afternoon
you are Jarvis, the Fassbender butler...

426
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
and tonight, you are...

427
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,120
- Inspector, before you get all...
- Madame or monsieur, I must warn you.

428
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,520
You had better watch your step.

429
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,560
- Something wrong, Ainsley?
- Of course not, Bruno.

430
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,960
No, the inspector was just warning me
that I had to watch my step.

431
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,720
You see, back in France,
he's known as king of the tango.

432
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,000
- Tango?
- Oh, I'd love to.

433
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,960
- The kidnappers are here.
- Kidnappers?

434
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,960
Okay. Let's go.

435
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,680
You want to call Paris now?

436
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,200
Look at it this way.
It can't possibly get any worse.

437
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,320
Professor Fassbender!

438
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,080
What an honor to have you
and your charming daughter as my guests.

439
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
- Who the devil are you?
- Ah, yes. Who the devil, indeed.

440
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,040
Come. Sit down.
Let us just say for the moment...

441
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,840
that I'm your host and that I will do
everything in my power...

442
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,440
to make your stay here at Mondschien
Castle as pleasant as possible.

443
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,400
Providing, of course...

444
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,720
that you reciprocate by giving me
something that I very much want.

445
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,400
And that would be?

446
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,280
I am fascinated by your work
on time-space relationships...

447
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,840
particularly the vortices
of electromagnetic aberrations.

448
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,800
I see.

449
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,040
And do you work
for a particular government...

450
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,520
or do you expect to sell
my discovery to the highest bidder?

451
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,120
Neither, Professor.
Nothing so mundane.

452
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,560
You and l... we're going
to join forces, Professor.

453
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,360
We're going to build the Doomsday
Machine and conquer the world.

454
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,200
- Have a sweet.
- You're mad.

455
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,400
Mad? On the contrary...

456
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,080
every day, in every way...

457
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,440
I've been getting better
and better.

458
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,360
Mad? Was Hannibal mad?

459
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,400
Or Alexander? Surely Napoleon
was the maddest of them all. Mad?

460
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,400
We shall see, Professor.

461
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,960
- I shall tell you nothing.
- I think you will.

462
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,880
I'll die first.

463
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,320
Show Miss Fassbender
to the schoolroom.

464
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,640
Daddy?

465
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,560
What are you going to do?

466
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,640
Something so very, very painful,
so hideous...

467
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,280
your father will have no choice
but to cooperate.

468
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,080
All right.
I'll tell you anything.

469
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,720
The Wolverines certainly have to put
some points on the scoreboard.

470
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,640
I'm sure that Green
will come out throwing.

471
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,000
He's got to get that ball
down deep into Navy territory.

472
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,280
Green now on third down.
Looks to the left, throws it...

473
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,240
All right, team! Let's go!

474
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,640
Throw's complete to Rhodes!
He's inside the 15! He's to the 20!

475
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,640
The clock is running down.
Can the Wolverines do it?

476
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,200
- What happened?
- Where's the game?

477
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,680
- Who is that?
- Hello there.

478
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,200
- He's on every station.
- Well, call the F.C.C.

479
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,520
Hold it! He's saying something.

480
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,920
Mr. President, everybody, calm down.

481
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,440
Calm down, hell!
This is an emergen...

482
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,680
An emergency.
Did Michigan score?

483
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,560
Please, let's hear
what the fellow has to say.

484
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,920
It is little enough to ask...

485
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,520
the life of one man...

486
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,920
against a holocaust...

487
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,080
that could destroy the globe.

488
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,480
What the hell's he talking about?

489
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,120
Quiet.

490
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,360
That's why I say again...

491
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,120
give me Clouseau.

492
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,120
- And we can all sleep secure in bed.
- What's a Clouseau?

493
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,040
And so, next week...

494
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,880
I shall give the world a demonstration
of the awesome power I hold.

495
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,360
On Saturday, October 9th...

496
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,200
at precisely 3:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time...

497
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,760
the United Nations building...

498
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,840
Will vanish
from the face of the earth.

499
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,720
And the gun goes off.
The game is over.

500
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Call the F.B.I., the C.I.A.
and the Pentagon.

501
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,840
Find out who won the game!

502
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,320
That's a photograph taken
by an American news photographer...

503
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,240
while the broadcast
was in progress.

504
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Paris has identified him
as one Charles Dreyfus...

505
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,520
former chief inspector
of the Surete.

506
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,560
- You're joking.
- And more recently an inmate...

507
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,200
at the state facility
for the criminally insane.

508
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,120
Until he escaped.
Here's a text of his speech.

509
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,640
He obviously controls equipment...

510
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,560
sophisticated enough
to pirate the satellite.

511
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,080
"Give me Clouseau, and we can all
sleep secure in our beds."

512
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,000
Thought that might interest you.

513
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,440
That's one crazy chief inspector talking
about another crazy chief inspector.

514
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,360
What does he mean anyway?
"Give me Clouseau."

515
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,760
Listen to this. "Little enough
to ask the life of one man...

516
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,240
against a holocaust
that could destroy the globe."

517
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,160
You missed the best bit. Look.

518
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,680
He also threatens
to make the U.N. building disappear.

519
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,640
- Operation Looking Glass?
- Fassbender.

520
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,680
Give me Lovell. Home Office.

521
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,600
- Where's Clouseau?
- I've no idea.

522
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,920
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
once again...

523
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,640
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis.

524
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,600
Monsieur Jarvis?

525
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,600
- Sir, the coroner's report.
- Ah, yes.

526
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,000
It's amazing. Even after
he had been stabbed twice...

527
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,000
he was still able
to break the kidnapper's neck.

528
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,920
- Ah, pity.
- Yes, he had a lovely voice.

529
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,240
I meant pity that the kidnapper's dead.
We might have got something from him.

530
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,600
- I did get something out of him.
- What?

531
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,520
What's that?

532
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,040
- A clue.
- Clue?

533
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,480
- What?
- You said a clue.

534
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,280
Yes. A brochure clue...

535
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,080
advertising the Oktoberfest
in Munich.

536
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,720
It begins the day after tomorrow.

537
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,960
And you think the dead man was planning
to go there, perhaps to meet someone?

538
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,280
Yes. Perhaps to meet...

539
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,440
the lunatic Dreyfus.

540
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,920
At one time,
partners in the war against crime...

541
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,840
now archenemies.

542
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,600
- You'll need help.
- I prefer to do this alone.

543
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,400
Yes, but if Dreyfus is what we suspect,
he probably has an army behind him.

544
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,680
Of course it won't be easy,
but nothing worthwhile ever is.

545
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,680
That is why I have always failed
where others have succeeded.

546
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,840
For me, the greater the odds,
the greater the challenge.

547
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,760
And, as always,
I accept the challenge.

548
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,360
Well, I am off to Munich.

549
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,120
Most ingenious.
The old closet ploy.

550
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,440
I really must congratulate you.
If there's one thing I do enjoy...

551
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,760
it's a good closet ploy.

552
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,160
Well, until we meet again
and the case is solved.

553
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,520
The case is solved.

554
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,320
Four minutes.

555
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,120
We're gonna look like a bunch
of Dipsy Doodles if this is a hoax.

556
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,040
Well...

557
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,640
we would look very foolish
if we didn't take every precaution...

558
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,480
and it turned out
not to be a hoax.

559
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,480
Dr. Fassbender and Operation Looking
Glass are certainly no hoax.

560
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,480
God. A weapon like that
in the hands of a crazy Frenchman.

561
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,880
You are certain?
You can do it?

562
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,040
- Theoretically, yes.
- For your daughter's sake, I hope so.

563
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,960
Ah, the dreams I had.

564
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,720
All the terrible things I was going
to do to that sweet child if you failed.

565
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,120
- Look, I've done everything you asked.
- Not yet.

566
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
When the U.N. building vanishes...

567
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,560
then you will have done everything
I asked.

568
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,120
What do you suppose
they will call the crater?

569
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,240
The Dreyfus Ditch!

570
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,960
- There should be no crater.
- No crater?

571
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,360
But I want a crater.
I want wreckage, twisted metal.

572
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,600
Something the world
will not forget.

573
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,920
- They will not forget today.
- They won't? Wonderful.

574
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,880
I have to tinkle again.
Don't do anything till I get back.

575
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
Too late. The countdown started.

576
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,840
One minute.

577
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,320
Thirty seconds.

578
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,480
Seven, six...

579
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,560
five, four...

580
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,720
three, two, one!

581
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,200
Ignition!

582
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,640
Today...

583
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,560
the U.N. building.

584
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,000
Tomorrow, who knows?

585
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,400
I think by now that the nations
of the world are aware of the...

586
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,800
the awesome power which I control...

587
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,840
a power so great...

588
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,600
if I choose,
I could wipe out an entire city.

589
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,840
After all,
what is the life of a man...

590
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,040
compared to the destruction
of a whole city?

591
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,840
I give you seven days.

592
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,000
Seven days.

593
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,760
Okay.

594
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,040
Well done.

595
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,600
So, now we wait.

596
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,040
All this to get one cop?

597
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,000
But we have some of the finest
hit men here in Europe.

598
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,000
- In this very room.
- Why don't we take care of it ourselves?

599
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,880
- Because you wouldn't stand a chance.
- Come on.

600
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,160
- You don't know Clouseau.
- He can't be that good.

601
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,520
Good? He's not good.

602
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,960
He's terrible.
He's the worst.

603
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,360
There is not any man like him
anywhere in the world.

604
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,640
Compared to Clouseau,
this Doomsday Machine...

605
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,000
is just a water pistol.

606
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,280
That's why it will take
all the great nations...

607
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,360
with all of their
trained assassins...

608
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,360
and all of their
sophisticated murder weapons...

609
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,680
to eliminate Clouseau.

610
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,960
Taxi, please.

611
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,480
This gentleman...

612
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,320
- What are you doing?
- That's my case.

613
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,360
Lucky for you, I am in a hurry.
Otherwise you would have been arrested.

614
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,560
And when it comes to the matter
of eliminating Clouseau...

615
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,360
nobody wants to have anybody else
get the credit for it.

616
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,840
It's a matter of national pride.

617
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,280
I think we all agree, Mr. President,
that we simply cannot afford...

618
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,800
to allow any other country
to get hold of Fassbender's machine.

619
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,840
Crazy or not, anyone who has gone
to the lengths that Dreyfus has...

620
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,040
in order to eliminate one man...

621
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,120
it's reasonable to assume...

622
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,560
that Dreyfus will smile
very kindly...

623
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,560
on the one who eliminates
lnspector Clouseau.

624
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,760
I think that's pretty far-fetched.

625
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,040
Mr. President,
if I told you one week ago...

626
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,240
that the U.N. building
would disappear...

627
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,320
and that a certified lunatic
would blackmail the entire...

628
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,560
You made your point.
What do we do?

629
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,880
Well, Mr. President,
Clouseau is in Munich.

630
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,200
I ordered one of our top people
to Munich yesterday.

631
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,600
- Yesterday?
- Well, just in case.

632
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,080
He's just reported in.
Clouseau has gone to the Oktoberfest.

633
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,120
I wonder if we have enough time
before the others act.

634
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,120
Germany's already acted,
and bungled it.

635
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,480
According to the latest
code transmission...

636
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,080
twelve countries have got
their top assassins in Munich...

637
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,720
and they're all converging
on the Oktoberfest.

638
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,800
My God, it will be
like a shooting gallery.

639
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,120
Try one of my pretzels.
They're good.

640
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,520
What are you doing
to this poor, motherless child?

641
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,000
You great big bully.

642
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,240
There, there, little boy.

643
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,200
Sir.

644
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,040
- I better call the President.
- You know what time it is?

645
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,000
He wants me to call.

646
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,440
Put me in, Coach.

647
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,120
What's the score?

648
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,200
Yes!

649
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,880
It's okay. How many?

650
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,520
Twenty-six, Mr. President.

651
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,840
Holy cow. No wonder Dreyfus
wants that Clouseau killed.

652
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,000
He's a one-man army.
Who's left?

653
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,880
Just the Russian
and the Egyptian.

654
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,080
My key, please.

655
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,400
127, please.

656
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,360
Good evening,
lnspector Clouseau.

657
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,840
I couldn't sleep, and I just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

658
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,360
I hope you don't mind.

659
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,280
You Frenchmen are so romantic.

660
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
Thank heaven

661
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,200
For little girls

662
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,480
Swine maid.

663
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,040
Oh, forgive me, darling.
I've just washed my hands.

664
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,680
They must have been freezing.

665
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,920
Freezing? Yes.

666
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,640
Something wrong?

667
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,040
Wrong? Oh, no.

668
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,720
What could be wrong?

669
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,920
Then come back to bed.

670
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,880
Yes, of course.

671
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,000
Into the bed, you know.

672
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,360
And take off
those so-silly pajamas.

673
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,000
You may rest assured you will never
see these so-silly pajamas again.

674
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,040
That I can assure you.

675
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,120
Darling?

676
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,800
Yes, I won't be a moment...

677
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,240
darling.

678
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,720
Hurry, darling.

679
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,520
I'm just going to take a bath.

680
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,760
A bath?

681
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,680
Excuse me.

682
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,560
Yes.

683
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,960
Hello, this is
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

684
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,320
There is a beautiful woman in my bed
and a dead man in my bath.

685
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,760
If you're going to take a bath,
I want to take one with you.

686
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,480
Darling, it's freezing out here.
Let me in.

687
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,200
Madame...

688
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,400
I arrest you for the murder
of the man in this bathtub.

689
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,520
What?

690
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,360
And I must warn you that anything
you say will be taken down...

691
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,480
and used in evidence against me...

692
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,040
you.

693
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,760
Who is he?

694
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,160
I don't know.
He looks familiar.

695
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,480
- He looks like you.
- Looks like me?

696
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,120
Tournier, the bank robber.

697
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,960
What is he doing in your bathtub
dressed up like you?

698
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,240
It is a question
I could very easily ask you.

699
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,600
But he has been shot...

700
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,760
and I do not carry a gun.

701
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,480
Obviously not, no.

702
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,720
I am Olga Berriossiva.

703
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,960
Until one hour ago,
I was a loyal Russian agent...

704
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,120
under direct order
from the presidium to kill you.

705
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,600
To kill me?

706
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,960
I was considered
a perfect liquidator...

707
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,480
because no man had ever been able
to involve me emotionally...

708
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,400
until tonight.

709
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,480
Do you think that you
could fall in love...

710
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,600
with an ex-Russian agent?

711
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,280
Well, of course...

712
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,920
everything is possible, yes.

713
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,040
- But you are not the same.
- Huh?

714
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,240
Oh, well, of course...

715
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,520
dead men in bathtubs
have been known...

716
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,080
to make quite a difference,
you know.

717
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,120
Anyway, this is the man who can
lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus...

718
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,360
who it is my sworn duty
to apprehend.

719
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,440
I, too, had a sworn duty,
but I have forsaken it...

720
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,520
become traitor,
given up everything for you.

721
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,280
With me...

722
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,520
it is the duty that comes first.

723
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,040
Oh, make an exception
just this once.

724
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,360
I wish that I could.

725
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,400
You can. I guarantee it.

726
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,080
No, you see, l...

727
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,720
- Look!
- What?

728
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,320
That tattoo. When I arrested Tournier,
he did not have that tattoo.

729
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,440
- It looks like the Mondschien crest.
- Mondschien?

730
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,760
- Mm-hmm.
- What is that?

731
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,360
An infamous family who ruled Bavaria
in the 15th century.

732
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,200
I read somewhere
that the Mondschien Castle...

733
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,120
had recently been sold.

734
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
You read somewhere that...

735
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,600
they had sold the castle?

736
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,120
Fancy them selling the castle,
just like that.

737
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,760
The castle!

738
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,240
Yes. Dreyfus.

739
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,080
He is in the castle.

740
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,120
Farewell. I am off
to Mondschien Castle.

741
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,160
Must be getting a cavity.

742
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,680
When can my daughter and I leave?

743
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,720
When Clouseau is no more,
perhaps.

744
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,080
I have done
everything you asked.

745
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,880
You've done everything I've asked
so far...

746
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,200
but I have not asked everything.

747
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,040
What you mean is that you have
no intention of letting us go.

748
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,120
You plan to continue
your reign of terror...

749
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,200
whether Clouseau is eliminated
or not.

750
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,400
I must admit the thought
had occurred to me.

751
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,040
- You are mad.
- And you are redundant, Professor.

752
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,960
Redundant and fallacious.
Madness does not preclude achievement.

753
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,680
You cannot operate the machine
without me.

754
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,680
Not yet,
but when you have taught me.

755
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,760
And if I refuse to teach you?

756
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,320
Then I would have to take the matter up
with your charming daughter.

757
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,080
- What kind of a man are you?
- A madman.

758
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,080
- You said so yourself.
- Boss!

759
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,400
It's true.

760
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,800
- When?
- This morning, in his hotel room.

761
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,960
He's dead!

762
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,960
He's dead
in his hotel bedroom!

763
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,880
Hurray! I'm free!

764
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,240
Oh, I'm so happy, Professor.

765
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,680
I'm so...

766
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,040
Good day.

767
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,600
My name is Professor Guy Gabroir...

768
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,640
medieval castle authority
from Marseilles.

769
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,480
Tell me, do you have a room?

770
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,080
I do not know
what a "reum" is.

771
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,880
Ah! A room!

772
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,160
That is what I have
been saying, you idiot.

773
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,600
Room.

774
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,880
Does your dog bite?

775
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,480
Nice doggy.

776
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,040
I thought you said
your dog did not bite.

777
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,520
That is not my dog.

778
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,560
Anything I can get you, boss?

779
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,560
I can't stand it any longer.
Get me a dentist!

780
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,720
Dr. Shurtz lives here...

781
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,120
but he has gone fishing.

782
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,760
I don't know.
I will tell him.

783
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,880
Did I hear you say
a doctor lives here?

784
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,680
He's a doctor and a dentist.

785
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,960
He made mein teeth for me.

786
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,880
They want him up at the castle.

787
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,640
Up at the castle?
Where can I find him?

788
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,240
Dr. Shurtz has gone fishing.

789
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,240
- He probably won't be back until...
- Show me his zimmer.

790
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,560
- Hmm?
- His room!

791
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,560
Hello!

792
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,360
It's Dr. Shurtz
from the village, you know.

793
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,800
Oh, excuse me, sir.

794
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,080
- Dr. Shurtz is here.
- Where?

795
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,360
Ah, here, Doctor.
Please hurry.

796
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,280
I am in agony.

797
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,040
All will be well soon.

798
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,040
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.

799
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,680
The burn.
I can set it later.

800
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,520
- Please hurry.
- First of all, I will need...

801
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,560
some hot water and towels.

802
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,440
Get some hot water, Harry,
and lock the door.

803
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,600
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- And lock the door, Harry.

804
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,840
He does not wish
to be disturbed, you know.

805
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,080
Please, Doctor, hurry.
I can't stand the pain.

806
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,440
Yes. Now, then let me see.

807
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,240
- Ow.
- What?

808
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,080
- My eye.
- I thought it was your tooth.

809
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,160
- But it is my tooth.
- I wish you would make your mind up.

810
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,640
I don't normally make castle calls
in the middle of the night.

811
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,440
Doctor.

812
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,880
Wait while l...

813
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,680
Yes, that's...

814
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,040
There it is.

815
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,760
Now, open wide, please.

816
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,040
Now, let me see.

817
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,360
Tell me when this hurts.

818
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,280
Is it that one?

819
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,360
Is it that one?

820
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,360
Ah, there is the naughty one.

821
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,360
- Are you going to pull it?
- Pull it?

822
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,800
Yes, of course I will pull it.

823
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,320
Please give me something
to put me out.

824
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,240
Put you out?

825
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,760
Yes. Here, first you must wear...

826
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,400
this special anesthetic
cotton wool, you know.

827
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,960
Wear it over the eyes.
On no account look out from under it.

828
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,560
That will ruin the whole effect
of the anesthetic on the eyes.

829
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,000
- You want me to hold it like that?
- Hold it like that on the eyes...

830
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,000
while I get some...

831
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,640
Please hurry, Doctor.
I can't stand the pain.

832
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,560
Yes. Coming soon.

833
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,320
What are you doing?

834
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,960
Just rearranging the furniture...

835
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,640
in order to give you
the full effect of the anesthetic.

836
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:41,080
Doctor, I'm in agony!

837
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,320
Not for much longer.

838
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,280
That was hell down there.

839
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,040
What's wrong?

840
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,960
Whoever built this house
put the stairs in the wrong place.

841
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,160
Do you mean
you fell down the stairs?

842
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,440
I was preoccupied
with the anesthetic, you know.

843
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,480
It's really hot in here,
isn't it?

844
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,840
Now, the...

845
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,240
anesthetic.

846
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,480
"Nitrous oxide."

847
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,200
What's that?

848
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,880
That is the anesthetic,
you know.

849
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,320
Oh, good.

850
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,960
Yes, it is good, yes.

851
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,480
Please, Doctor,
the pain is getting worse.

852
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,640
Please, hurry up.

853
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,440
A few whiffs of this,
and you won't feel a thing.

854
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,000
- All right.
- Now, breathe deeply.

855
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:58,160
- How's that?
- It's fine.

856
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,080
How do you feel?

857
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,440
A little dizzy.

858
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,560
- What's so funny?
- I don't know. Nothing.

859
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,160
- Then why are you laughing?
- I don't know.

860
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,040
- Why are you laughing?
- Because I can't help it.

861
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,520
Yes.

862
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,120
I love it.

863
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,160
- Come on.
- It's gonna hurt.

864
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,080
Good. Lovely.

865
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,120
I will have to use more leverage.

866
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,160
I don't know what you gave me,
Doctor...

867
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,920
but it's giving me hallucinations.

868
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,800
Your whole face has changed.

869
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,720
It has?

870
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,960
How's this?

871
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,360
Grotesque!

872
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,920
We just got word, boss.
Clouseau is still alive.

873
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,520
I knew it.

874
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,240
He has pulled the wrong tooth.

875
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:08,440
There's only one man
who would pull the wrong tooth.

876
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,040
It's Clouseau.

877
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,760
Kill him.

878
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,480
Get Fassbender and his daughter
into the control room.

879
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,560
What about Clouseau?

880
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,880
Priorities.
First I will pick a target.

881
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,800
Then Clouseau.

882
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,360
Now we'll see
who has the last laugh.

883
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,600
They've all betrayed me,
and now they will have to pay.

884
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,480
What shall I destroy?
Buckingham Palace? Too small.

885
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,400
How about London?
Not big enough.

886
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,880
England! Yes, England.

887
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,840
Good-bye, Piccadilly

888
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,400
Farewell, Leicester Square

889
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,680
You are just in time,
Professor.

890
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,400
Within five minutes,
I shall destroy England.

891
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,320
England!

892
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,760
No more cricket.

893
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,600
No more warm beer, Professor.

894
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,000
No more fish and chips.
No more...

895
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,240
England!

896
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,240
Do something.

897
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,600
You brought it on yourself.
It's too late.

898
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,880
Wait!

899
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,800
Do something!
Come back! Help me!

900
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,240
Look!

901
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,680
You've gotta help me.

902
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,760
Help, Professor!

903
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,480
Cato, my little yellow friend,
I'm home.

904
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,080
I gave Cato the night off.

905
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,960
But what has happened
to my room?

906
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,160
Darling?

907
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,360
My darling.

908
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,760
Darling, sing to me.

909
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,320
Sing to you? Oh.

910
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,760
Come to me

911
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,680
And the world

912
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,280
It will be ours tonight

913
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,360
Where did you go?

914
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,120
- Your voice?
- Yes, that was my voice.

915
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,800
That was my voice singing
a little song we used to sing...

916
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,920
in the Resistance
to keep up the courage.

917
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,840
Was it hard for you
in the Resistance?

918
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,600
Very hard, but not as hard
as it is now.

919
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,520
Darling, relax.

920
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,000
Resistance is over.

921
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,680
My darling.

922
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,840
My beautiful darling.

923
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,000
What?
