1
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,341
What are you doing, kid?

2
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,368
You use RMB in Hong Kong? Are you crazy?

3
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,543
I have no HK dollars
my friend, it's nothing I can do

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,913
I am not your friend

5
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,918
Can't you see I am in uniform?
Call me sir

6
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,681
Sir, I've been standing for an hour

7
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,688
I'm so thirsty
how about you borrow me a few dollars

8
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,691
When my uncle arrive, he'll pay you back

9
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,920
Everybody in Hong Kong needs help

10
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,451
who bothers to help you

11
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,896
You better beg the machine Can I?

12
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,297
Sir, please buy me a drink

13
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,365
This vending machine is not sir

14
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,894
You have to call him Mr. Machine

15
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,936
Mr. Machine, please buy me a drink

16
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,555
Thank you, Mr. Machine

17
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,455
What take my uncle so long?

18
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,725
Hurry up, after this
we would have played 200 rounds

19
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,206
I haven't slept for 3 days already

20
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,209
What? Want to leave with the money?

21
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,368
Oh, shit

22
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,569
What's it? What?

23
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,875
My nephew is coming from Guangzhou today

24
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,404
I have to pick him up at the station
see you

25
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,450
Black Tat, wanna run away?

26
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,214
You better clear the bills first

27
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,945
I didn't say I quit

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,254
But I have to pick my nephew up first

29
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,816
Clear the bills?
You think you will win for sure

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,693
You'll know it when we finish... Ping

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,756
OK, let me Say a prayer first

32
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,466
Oh, let me say some prayers too
God of Dogs bless me

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,901
Ping, be careful

34
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,109
Fishy Shing, you want to pick up Ping
you better go to the club

35
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,874
You don't have to leave your business

36
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,280
and play mahjong here
what's so good about her?

37
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,147
You like her big ass

38
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,712
Say it to yourself
it has been so many years

39
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,451
At least you'll have a happy ending
if you get married

40
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,014
I haven't met the right one

41
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,425
The right one?
You must be waiting for Blackie Tat

42
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,521
Who said I like him?

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,396
Everybody knows!
You better think about it

44
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,998
Gamblers usually
won't have a good ending

45
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,929
After my prayers, I will surely win

46
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,773
I will beat Blackie Tat

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,309
Touch wood

48
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,848
The God of Dogs? You worship a dog?

49
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,011
Damn you

50
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,989
Come on
let's worry about win or lose later

51
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,282
Where is Ping?

52
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,927
She went to the toilet
are you in a hurry to lose?

53
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,452
Damn you

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,797
Blackie Tat, you are not young anymore

55
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,994
He is only teasing you
and you put your nephew aside

56
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,525
Go pick him up now

57
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,505
You really think
I leave my nephew alone?

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,737
Honestly I'm afraid to see him

59
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,977
Why?

60
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,971
Have you heard a disease
called Natural-born losing control?

61
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,809
What is that?

62
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,410
It is a disease that

63
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,078
a man will lose control anytime
anywhere

64
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,055
He'll have no idea what he's done

65
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,551
I don't understand

66
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,522
This is a hereditary disease
from my family

67
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,928
My grandmother used to be like this

68
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,659
Whenever her sister called her
she'd gone crazy

69
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,098
My uncles said that

70
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,830
It is because the brain is affected by
certain sound waves

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,929
If my nephew calls me Uncle

72
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,234
I'm OK but if

73
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,741
He formally calls me Uncle Tat
I'll lose control

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,675
What will happen when you lose control?

75
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,905
Don't stay too long then
I might rape you

76
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
That's good, I've been waiting for this

77
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,115
Can you still control
your droppings then?

78
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,011
If I can't, I will do it in your mouth

79
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,781
It's 7 o'clock already
how comes you people are still sleeping?

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,424
I really worked all night last night

81
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,827
I don't want your explanation

82
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,832
I really don't have another man

83
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,060
Here it is

84
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,530
It's been scratched

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,337
1th or 7th floor?

86
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,269
I don't trust you

87
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,900
If you don't believe it
you can call him

88
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,712
It's better to call him here
Rather than looking for him each floor

89
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,578
Uncle Tat

90
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,917
What's the noise?

91
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,287
Danny, just open up
What do you want me to do then?

92
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,316
You say I love you' 10 times
then I'll open the door

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,557
All right, I love you...

94
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:41,429
I love you...

95
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,315
I love you...

96
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,080
Wait. Thanks

97
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,089
So selfish

98
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,362
I love you...

99
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:22,737
I love you...

100
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,946
Is this a swordplay from North China?

101
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,019
Chung, open up

102
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,926
Old Lady
why did you attack me with your sword?

103
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,391
Or it is from South China?

104
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,962
You don't have to sting me
even I guess it wrong

105
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,901
Bad-tempered

106
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,213
Uncle Tat, Uncle Tat

107
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,714
Good morning. Excuse me...

108
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,777
Why are you so noisy
early in the morning?

109
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,390
Uncle is not here
Let see check upstairs

110
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,554
Tat...

111
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,694
Tat your ass

112
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,468
Fine, I'll wait here

113
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,404
You have to go out someday

114
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,412
But if he doesn't, I'll be damned

115
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,521
The massacre in Shum Cheng
you can't run, uncle

116
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,855
Comrade

117
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,020
Is it evacuation?

118
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,260
Do you know
the murderer of the massacre?

119
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,129
Of course, that's a big news

120
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,828
I know he's hiding in this building

121
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,565
But I don't know which unit
This is his picture

122
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,938
If I get the right one
you'll be in deep shit, Ping

123
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,309
I'll take care of Ping, right?

124
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,312
You're in trouble

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,415
What's the matter?
Freeze, this is the police

126
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,482
What's the matter?
I have a sure-win hand

127
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,686
What's the problem, sir?

128
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,525
This murderer of Shum Cheng just raped
and killed a family of seven last night

129
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,723
You're a beast

130
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,992
It was me!

131
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,499
Don't you remember
he was with us last night?

132
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,092
Oh yes, I was with you last night

133
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,625
Sir, maybe you've made a mistake

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,103
We have witness

135
00:08:59,138 --> 00:08:59,934
Who's it?

136
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,132
That's him

137
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,934
Do you recognize me? I'm Sing

138
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,238
You son of a bitch

139
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,847
Let me go Police

140
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,553
Uncle Tat

141
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,523
Please help me

142
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,527
Don't worry. He'll be OK soon

143
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,322
I said don't worry

144
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,160
What have I done?

145
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,362
That's the same old cop, Uncle Tat

146
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,072
Help me

147
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,110
He loses control of himself

148
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,315
Help me, partner

149
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,750
My uncle is not a rapist

150
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,322
Help me...

151
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,856
Stop

152
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,587
Don't do that

153
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,290
Hereditary lost of control

154
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,329
It's my turn finally

155
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,004
What are you doing?
Why are you using the cutting board?

156
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,583
I'm sorry. I was a bit emotional

157
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,952
Sorry, I was a bit emotional

158
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,652
Sorry...

159
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:27,790
Nuts

160
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,653
Sorry...

161
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,790
Look at yourself

162
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,700
You look like monster, look at your hair

163
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,435
I thought it's popular in Hong Kong

164
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,906
Popular your ass

165
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,203
Again? Take it off

166
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,703
I've told you the kids from China
is cold-blooded

167
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,343
No sense of belonging

168
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,043
Call the cop?

169
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,380
I am the murderer of Shum Cheng?

170
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,018
What are you then?

171
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,120
The rapist of Guangzhou?
You son of a bitch

172
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,525
This is such a stupid old trick

173
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,488
There's a lighter inside the can

174
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,356
In the past. It was so obvious that

175
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,662
You were the one who informed the police

176
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,463
Otherwise how could you dad

177
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,270
Be the first person to be executed
during the Cultural Revolution

178
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,877
The little girl is falling, watch out!

179
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,782
She's falling

180
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,978
Lost of control

181
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,846
Chee?

182
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,386
You can see through the walls?

183
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,163
Yes, if I want to

184
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,497
What's the color of my underwear?

185
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,359
You haven't wore any

186
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,230
Wait a moment

187
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,271
What are these?

188
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,005
Birds

189
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,943
What kind of bird?

190
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,446
Those that can't fly

191
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,075
What are the hidden ones?

192
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:08,120
3 green in the middle
4 red on right and 4 white on the left

193
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,684
That's all

194
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,464
Fuck you

195
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,799
What you see in front of you
is not concrete. It's money

196
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,905
Money is everywhere in Hong Kong
Remember this

197
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,141
Be hygienic, pick it up

198
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,784
Sing
did you say after your sickness at 9

199
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,725
You realized
you have a supernatural power

200
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,558
Did the head of your unit know?

201
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,790
Oh yes Oh yes

202
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,058
Did they ask you to work for them?

203
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,861
Of course they did What then?

204
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,425
I was asked to patrol the city
the 1st year

205
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,869
To see if the underground pipes were OK

206
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,601
If yes, I had to ask for repair

207
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,002
I was doing good the 2nd year

208
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,002
I was promoted to be a customs officer

209
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,015
But after
they installed an X-ray machine

210
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,813
I lost myjob at once

211
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,052
I am lucky this time

212
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,050
Why?

213
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,326
All you have to do is to use
your supernatural power in gambling

214
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,921
Then we'll be rich

215
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,293
I don't know how to gamble

216
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,265
I just played mahjong a few times

217
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,134
Count on me. There're a lot of things
that you don't know

218
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,435
If you don't understand, ask

219
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,504
This is the Paradise of the rich

220
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,378
You can be like them if you have money

221
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,543
Good food, good house, good cloths
beautiful cars and women

222
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,984
What if I don't have money?

223
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,988
No money?

224
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,549
It will be like the two of us
give up everything

225
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,551
Watch out kids

226
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,354
In Hong Kong
you must say the right things

227
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,592
When you have the chance, don't miss it

228
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,792
Do you wanna do it?

229
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,331
Are you doing it?

230
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,528
Yes, of course yes

231
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,127
I'll do everything

232
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,330
Which one are you good at?

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,832
How are you doing, Uncle Tat
this's my fiancee

234
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,844
Really?

235
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,974
This is my nephew Sing, Say hello

236
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,571
Hello

237
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,877
Miss, I'll do it

238
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,443
Not this one

239
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,014
My nephewjust arrived from China

240
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,423
I'll get marry soon
I didn't work in the club already

241
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,653
Congratulations

242
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,185
Thank you Say congratulation

243
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,329
Say it

244
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,994
I'll come to your wedding

245
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,768
On your wedding day, I will surely come

246
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,906
Come, come your ass

247
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,602
Everybody likes to gamble in Hong Kong

248
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,342
It can roughly be divided into...

249
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,249
Mahjong, Tin Kau, Pai Kau
Poker, Dice etc

250
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,415
How about insect fighting?

251
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,420
Insect

252
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,879
You think this is China?

253
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,881
How about horse?
Horseracing is popular here

254
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,326
I can't put a horse
on the table to show you

255
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,761
After the training of these few days

256
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,290
Although you are not an expert
at least you are getting familiar

257
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,761
How about this hand?

258
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,972
I'll rearrange them like this

259
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,033
Are you sure?

260
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,842
I'm just making it fun, Uncle
Don't you like it?

261
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,642
Bet...

262
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,880
Please put down your bet

263
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,188
Last call, bet please...

264
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,191
4, 5 and 6. Big

265
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,561
Big

266
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,328
What happened?

267
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,598
I heard that the nephew of Blackie Tat

268
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,159
Hejust arrived from China
and won 10 games in a row

269
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,000
The house almost goes broken

270
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,632
Open, 4, 5, 6, 15 points. Big

271
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,974
That's weird

272
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,338
I'll take a leak. You'd better watch

273
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,384
Put down your bet

274
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,079
This is 13 points. Big

275
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,722
Don't push the house too far

276
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,488
Or we won't get much out of it

277
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,426
What does it mean?

278
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,794
We'll have to lose this time
together with others

279
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,626
OK, small this time

280
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,701
Small...

281
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,536
Last call please

282
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,596
13 points

283
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,200
Open, 2, 5, 6, 13 points. Big

284
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,573
13 points

285
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,269
You're crazy
You bit on small and 13 together

286
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,281
You're setting me up

287
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,510
I win while you lose. I like it

288
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,745
So what

289
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,774
You son of a bitch

290
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,220
Nothing I can do if you're so courageous

291
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,282
Then that's fine
Why don't you hit the other side also?

292
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,684
Uncle...

293
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,659
Old man
don't get yourself killed for the money

294
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,097
You're not having much luck

295
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,033
I like it. What can you do?

296
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,865
Nothing I can do if you're so courageous

297
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,870
Then that's fine

298
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,895
Do you know who I am?

299
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,665
I don't give a shit

300
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,139
Old man, you're talking too much
I'll fix you up

301
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,242
Don't go. Let me do it

302
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,211
Uncle, trust me

303
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,373
I can do it now You?

304
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,212
Do I look like I can't?

305
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,945
That's exactly what you look

306
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,885
Don't let my appearance fool you

307
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,519
My friend...

308
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,949
You can't beat old man

309
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,687
I'll beat you too, kid. Get him

310
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,522
Don't, don't hurt his head

311
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,121
Don't hurt his head

312
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,395
Go away

313
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,937
Are you OK?

314
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,877
I'm fine

315
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,845
Hold on

316
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,913
This one hurts. Oh it hurts

317
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,827
You think you're a good fighter?

318
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,524
If your brain is hurt
what do I do then?

319
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,430
You'll be dead now
if I didn't give a hand

320
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,095
This kind of things happened to me
every week

321
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,694
I like it. What can you do?

322
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,897
Nothing I can do if you're so courageous

323
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,372
Then that's fine

324
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,671
It's my duty to protect my nephew

325
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,142
Go first if this happens again

326
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,345
Get it?

327
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,556
Sorry

328
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,093
Do me a favour, comrade
I'll remember you

329
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,195
Hold tight

330
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,462
Thank you

331
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,468
I will marry you later

332
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,268
You don't have to drive so fast actually

333
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,072
My danger is over

334
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,176
Yours is over, how about mine?

335
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,148
This's the fastest

336
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,456
Why do you stop?

337
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,396
No gasoline

338
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,068
Don't worry, Miss, I'll be around

339
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,643
Why are there so many people
going after you?

340
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,503
I killed their boss

341
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,646
I'll kill you if you run

342
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,806
Brother

343
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,314
We're all friends and brothers

344
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,289
Maybe we'll be one family
in our next life

345
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,021
We should not attack each other
for such a small thing

346
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,992
I do understand your feeling now

347
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,293
Because my brother died when I was three

348
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,471
Not only that
my younger brother died when I was four

349
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,736
You talk too much, where are you from?

350
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm from Guangzhou

351
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,608
Let's kill the bloody Chinese gangsters

352
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,733
Stand aside

353
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,264
Billy

354
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,207
Step aside, brother

355
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,039
You, stand aside please

356
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,049
Let me do it

357
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,400
It's my turn now. Hey, look over there

358
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,992
See you later, kid

359
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,922
Why are you calling me kid?

360
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,332
What's your name comrade?

361
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,804
My name is Yee Mong

362
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,568
Yee Mong

363
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,733
Bye-bye

364
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,872
Her mole is so tempting

365
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,028
Yee Mong, I am actually a good fighter

366
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,290
I really am, don't you trust me?

367
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,165
Yes, I do

368
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,534
I don't think you do

369
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,368
Believe me, I do

370
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,636
You only want me to show you my skills

371
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,836
Don't.... I don't believe then

372
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,142
If you don't believe, I'll have to prove

373
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,545
I know you will say this

374
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,844
Then it OK now

375
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,646
Don't fight

376
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,416
Where is Mr. Hung?

377
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,288
Mr. Hung is having a game
with Mr. Chan from Taiwan

378
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,657
Wait until he finishes his game

379
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,350
If we both have a flash, I'm bigger

380
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,118
OK, 5 million

381
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,995
But don't forget
I might have a royal flush

382
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,531
If so, you won't look so nervous

383
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,160
I don't believe you have a royal flush
I'll add 5 million

384
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,573
Why don't you simply show your hand?

385
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,440
How much have you got?

386
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,372
Around 8 million

387
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,980
OK, I will add 8 million

388
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,480
Mr. Hung
you have misjudged me this time

389
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,715
I really have a royal flush

390
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,621
What a coincidence

391
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,125
Mr. Hung, this is exactly the situation

392
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,155
in which big money is lost, isn't it?

393
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,727
Wait a minute

394
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,663
You are right

395
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,563
Damn coincidence makes one lose

396
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,106
Damn it

397
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,819
Chung, I'm sorry

398
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,153
You're lucky this time

399
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,780
You'll not be so lucky next time

400
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,652
It's not luck that I have, it's ability

401
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,760
You'd better watch out in next month's

402
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,319
World Gamblers Championship

403
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,131
You're too arrogant

404
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,029
I will definitely be the Champion

405
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,128
Let's go

406
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,771
Mr. Hung, Yee Mong has fixed Keung

407
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,209
Well done

408
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,511
It's nothing

409
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,120
By the way, in the casinojust now

410
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,857
There's an interesting man

411
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,365
Doctor said
Chee's operation will cost $100,000

412
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,801
Now the money we've got is not enough

413
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,134
Why don't we go to the race course
tomorrow?

414
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,900
I have some exclusive tips

415
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,606
Do your tips work?

416
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,939
I know the horse's owner

417
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,277
So you little bastard finally come back

418
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,509
Uncle always... Yee Mong

419
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,915
This is too early for dreaming

420
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,351
Let plan our bets tomorrow
in the race course

421
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,359
How about this round?

422
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,922
No. 3 looks a little depressed

423
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,100
No. 4 has some respiratory problem

424
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,702
No. 5 and 6 keep talking

425
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,069
I think No. 7 is most aggressive
Let's bet on No. 7

426
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,038
Are you serious? No. 7 will not win

427
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,043
Damn you. Trying to fool me

428
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,973
You can even see that
No. 7 is aggressive?

429
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:24,277
All the experts are saying that
it will fail

430
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,977
If the experts are so good
they should all be rich then

431
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,211
Let's go

432
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,618
Oh yes, you're the best

433
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,351
I'm not blaming you
Horses are different from Mahjong

434
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,621
You can't be totally out of line

435
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,289
This No. 7 is ridiculous

436
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,030
Stay here. I'll place my bet

437
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,929
Don't you trust my anymore, Uncle?

438
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,594
It's done

439
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,270
Do the tips work?

440
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,398
Iwill bet my life on it

441
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,308
No. 6 with No. 2, 3 or 4, Quenelle

442
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:54,977
$100 each bet

443
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,145
Thanks

444
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,014
Hurry...

445
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,190
No. 6...

446
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,924
Go faster, I've bet my life on it

447
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,666
No. 7! I should have trusted you!

448
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,108
That's great

449
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,168
Uncle

450
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,446
We've made it. Did you bet on No. 7?

451
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,571
The damage is already done

452
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,946
Only a little bit

453
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,780
I saw a friend there. Let me go over

454
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,184
Wait... What should I bet on this time?

455
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,949
I think...

456
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,656
Don't speak up

457
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,823
Write it here

458
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,153
Don't look

459
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:55,871
0k

460
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,304
No. 6, we'll be rich

461
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,381
That's not necessary, Shing

462
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,645
Luk. Shing

463
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,148
What a coincidence

464
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,584
Did anything happen to Luk?

465
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,390
I want to take a bet for Chee...

466
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,690
to get the operation fee
But she lost it all

467
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,526
Is Chee sick?

468
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,996
She's got a heart-disease
and need money for operation

469
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,394
But she lost all her money. Poor Chee

470
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,598
Luk

471
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,041
Can you show me your ticket?

472
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,470
Here! It's useless now

473
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,480
Not really! Let see if I can help

474
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,311
The only thing you can help is

475
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,577
to give me some money

476
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,778
I'll do my best, ok?

477
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,913
No. 7 has won just now

478
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,184
That's great

479
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,726
I'll bet on No. 6 next Of course

480
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,028
You win because of me
You'd better buy me dinner

481
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,998
Of course

482
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:03,499
No. 6, No. 6...

483
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,779
I see smoke coming out from his head

484
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,277
No. 9?

485
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,684
Don't...

486
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,796
Don't...

487
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,502
Don't look at me like that
I'm the victim too

488
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,936
We trust the wrong person

489
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,548
Luk
the bastard asked me to bet on No. 6

490
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,178
Luk, look

491
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,715
He turned it into No. 7

492
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,187
That means we've made it

493
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,118
You can change the number?

494
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,854
That's right, he can do it

495
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,418
Luk, go and get the money now

496
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,054
Don't gamble anymore

497
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,691
I know, Sing
I want to thank you for Chee

498
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,633
That's enough. Go get the money first

499
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,638
Hey, kid, you really know how to do it?

500
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,240
Please turn my No. 6 into No. 9 then

501
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,640
Ijust wrote No. 9

502
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,736
But I put my bet on No. 6.
Stop the crap, come on

503
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,545
I can't
Every time I use my supernatural power

504
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,416
I need to rest for 1 or 2 months

505
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,817
Can't change anymore

506
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:23,878
1 or 2 months?

507
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,119
That means we don't have to gamble
anymore after today

508
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,752
Soccer? Can you do that?

509
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,700
How's that? The doctor said that
this is an excellent medicine

510
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,367
You'll recover soon. Getting better?

511
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,508
Guess what have I got?

512
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,637
Fingers

513
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,512
I've told you
the western medicine doesn't work

514
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,486
Let me give you a special recipe

515
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,314
Sing

516
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,224
Shing, just stay where you are
Chee wants to see you

517
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,163
That's right

518
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,255
Good girl. Chee

519
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,833
What happened to Ping's mouth?

520
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,894
It's nothing

521
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,834
Look said
you can change anything you want

522
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,773
What can I do for you?

523
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,243
I just want you to change here for me

524
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,612
It want them to be bigger

525
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,579
But I'm afraid I'll make it even smaller

526
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,449
All right with me too

527
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,511
Then you can reduce the size of my ass

528
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,621
Tat. Blackie Tat

529
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,153
Coming... There's a letter

530
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,859
What is it? A letter

531
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,390
Give it to me

532
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,167
Look What's that?

533
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,538
What letter is that?

534
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,803
An invitation

535
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,771
Hung Kong is the most prominent man
among the gangsters

536
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,748
His nickname is King of Gamblers

537
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,482
He is paying some attention
on both of us

538
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,851
It's an opportunity for us

539
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,719
Only can we become his right hands

540
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,816
We'll have endless money

541
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,191
Even we do not stay with him
we can still make money

542
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,857
I know

543
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,263
They've made it clear already

544
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,790
if you don't help him this time

545
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,529
We will be dead-men soon

546
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,366
But I've lost my power now

547
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,997
He will also kill us if he knows it

548
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,702
That's why we can't let him know

549
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,910
Don't gamble with him
just show your power to scare him

550
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,181
Don't be too serious

551
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,654
Did you see that Ace?

552
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,354
No

553
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,255
One

554
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:42,891
Two

555
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,491
Three

556
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,755
And four

557
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,122
There are only 3

558
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,198
This is called rumour

559
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,330
When you become famous

560
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,806
you have to watch your posture

561
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,968
After that, you have to package yourself

562
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,613
Put it on

563
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,514
This is perfect

564
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,687
And this one too, put it on

565
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,848
Overcoat, I've seen it in China

566
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,287
Be serious

567
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,189
Every one on the gambling table
has his own style

568
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,128
This is the scare armour
for the Gambling Saint

569
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:19,561
That's right

570
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,055
From now on
your nickname will be the Gambling Saint

571
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,661
You'll have your own style

572
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,702
The Gambling Saint

573
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,369
May I know how to spell your nickname?

574
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,966
Bull shit

575
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,135
Shit

576
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,947
Stop playing with the dirty stuff

577
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:43,181
Put on the sunglasses
so that none can see your eyes

578
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,647
Also
put some gel on your hair to look tougher

579
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,520
I can't do this Why not?

580
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,551
Really not Why not?

581
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,325
I hate styling gel

582
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,197
Don't push me. Uncle Tat

583
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,634
Where's the little bastard

584
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,367
Come here, put on some gel

585
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,609
Gel on the moustache
how about my armpit?

586
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,170
Don't kid, come on

587
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,377
I'm serious
I don't want to gel the whole body

588
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,317
Uncle Tat, I want to tell you

589
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,980
It is all useless if I don't Iooktough

590
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,251
That's why you need this gel
on your hair. Then you look tough

591
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,484
Please don't, it stinks

592
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,993
Stink your ass, I have it
all over my face and can't smell it

593
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,086
Come here, smell Together

594
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,559
Oh, shit

595
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,833
Your appearance is OK
but you need to watch your posture

596
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,105
This I can't teach you
you better watch the video

597
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,943
The God of Gambler

598
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,842
He looks great, I admire him so much

599
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,374
Iwill never look like him

600
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,909
That's why you need to learn

601
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,362
What is he walking so slowly?

602
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,731
Is that a wig?

603
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,934
What? I've washed it many time
and it still smells

604
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,861
What time shall we meet him?

605
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,429
7 o'clock

606
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,142
Mr. Hung, he's here

607
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,229
Please

608
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,396
Bring it

609
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,627
You should be proud of yourself
you even walk differently

610
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,328
Are you Mr. Hung?

611
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,296
Right

612
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,234
What can I do for you, Mr. Hung?

613
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,238
I always like to gamble
with the youngsters

614
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,433
Why don't we forget about gambling?

615
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,534
I can show you some of my tricks
And that's it for today

616
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,670
Show your tricks

617
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,210
This is a good one
I haven't seen before

618
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,144
Wrong

619
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,585
This means prosperity for everyone

620
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,456
Full of fortune for the whole family

621
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,994
Can you see the Aces?

622
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,202
Don't screw up this one

623
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,453
This is called vanishing
Everything's gone

624
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,154
Are you OK? I hope I haven't hurt you

625
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,097
I knew these tricks when I was a kid

626
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,627
We'd better talk about gambling

627
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,271
I hope that's not necessary

628
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,744
Why can't let me in? You can't go in

629
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,440
Icant?
lam his uncle as well as his manager

630
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,538
What are you doing inside?

631
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,515
It's none of your business

632
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,111
Leave him alone then. Can I sit down?

633
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,015
This $500,000 is your capital

634
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,256
We'll play around of dice. You don't
have to pay me back if you lose

635
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,593
If you win, the money is all yours

636
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:57,325
That's nice
Then you don't have to worry

637
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,163
I'll play it slowly then. Good luck

638
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:05,931
Ready the dices

639
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:06,738
0k

640
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,281
Mr. Hung

641
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,884
You first

642
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,496
Thanks. Give me new dices

643
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,858
I have to use ivory dices

644
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,428
Those three were made by ivory

645
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,599
I mean ivory from North Pole Elephant
North Pole?

646
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,602
Forget it
I'll live with Indian elephant

647
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,273
You can start

648
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,844
Come on

649
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,022
$50,000 for big

650
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,931
Big or small

651
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,005
Please give me some change
I'll bet $50 small

652
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,378
No, minimum bet is $50,000

653
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,076
Open 3, 5 and 5, big

654
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,584
Mr. Hung, I think this guy is a fool

655
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:12,367
OK, let me show his hand, small

656
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,132
I don't believe
you can see through the cup

657
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,638
Who do you think you are?

658
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,274
I don't believe it, too bad

659
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,176
That's not bad
you must have practiced a lot

660
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,856
Great. What's the matter?

661
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:45,096
Great. Terrific, Good

662
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,834
Yee Mong Mr. Hung

663
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,474
Give him another $500,000

664
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,042
All right Mr. Hung

665
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:01,947
It's time for dinner
Can I invite both of you to dinner?

666
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,485
Mr. Hung asked me to give you $500,000
He wishes you can win

667
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:19,262
No problem, just tell me, I will win

668
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,669
Let's start

669
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,470
Please put down your bets

670
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,149
4, 5 and 6, big

671
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,453
Open

672
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,130
3, 2 and 2, small

673
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,037
So the kid likes Yee Mong

674
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,011
3, 6 and 5, big

675
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,216
3, 4 and 1, small

676
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,632
That's great, 3 sixes, 3-of-a-kind

677
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,148
Cheer up

678
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,157
I hope you can work for me All right

679
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,627
No need to explain
I've been waiting so long

680
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,398
Don't worry, he will call us back

681
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,960
Mr. Hung, shall I call him back?

682
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,465
No, don't push him too much

683
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,441
Better set him up slowly

684
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,872
They didn't ask for us

685
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,742
Is it? We better go back ourselves

686
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,906
My Yee Mong

687
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,885
Stop dreaming
why does Mr. Hung invite you?

688
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,544
Because I could see through things

689
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,418
Really?

690
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,319
Do I wear underpants?

691
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,482
You've worn Luk's

692
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,553
Did you win then?

693
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,821
Just afew million

694
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,795
Over a million
its good enough for a house

695
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,093
I've given the money away as tips

696
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,259
You gave out a million as tips?

697
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,031
You told me to have style
and treat money as shit

698
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,565
You're not young anymore, don't pretend

699
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:42,169
Someone can see through things
in this world

700
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,143
You are now with Hung Kwong

701
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,175
Don't let him know who you really are

702
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:56,249
Are you kidding, boss?
You just give us $700,000 each month

703
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:00,458
I didn't say I want you
I just want your nephew

704
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,397
If you want my nephew
you have to sign me too

705
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,900
There are some conditions

706
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,370
We need body guards
for cars we want Rolls Royce

707
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,202
For flying, we want first class, and

708
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,003
Stop for now
I'll leave this condition open for you

709
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,479
You can add this later
Is it okay with you?

710
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,146
More or less

711
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,510
My conditions are much simpler

712
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,213
I need your nephew to represent Taiwan

713
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,416
To win the World Gambler Championship

714
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,420
Then you'll have everything you want

715
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,457
If not, you are breaking the contract

716
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,889
I'll do my best, it's difficult to say

717
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,832
Remember
breaking contract means death for you

718
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,194
Is there such term in the contract?
It's just been added

719
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,169
Mr. Hung, we'vejust checked

720
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,878
The kid is going to sign with Chung
tomorrow

721
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,774
As soon as
he signs the contract with them

722
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,413
Even if we get him

723
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,281
According to the regulations

724
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,287
We can't send him for the Championship

725
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,791
But we cannot let him
represent Taiwan too

726
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,228
Betray me? Take him to the dogs

727
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,559
I didn't do it, I didn't do it

728
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,801
Better sign
everything according to your conditions

729
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,540
Yes, except the condition you just said

730
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,874
In this World Gambler Championship
the reward is ten million

731
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,709
Do I have to explain to you? No

732
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:29,447
English? Let me do it. A, B, C, OK

733
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,418
Sign here? It's your turn

734
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,827
Why did the Taiwanese don't look at you
when he speaks

735
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,329
I don't know

736
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,032
Never mind
rich people have peculiar temper

737
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,127
But I have something to ask him
face to face

738
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,940
Hey Boss
my nephew has something to ask you

739
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,742
I had something to ask you
It's about...

740
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,086
Don't ask...

741
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,456
Better ask now
if you had something in mind. Ask then

742
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,185
Oh, I just want to know
why you always look up

743
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,658
Done

744
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,397
Follow me, let's hide in the room

745
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,997
Run faster

746
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,204
Oh, no

747
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,404
The exit...

748
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,411
Up-stairs... Quick

749
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,705
Let's go up-stair

750
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,026
Yee Mong

751
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,330
Watch out

752
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:58,823
Be careful

753
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,307
Go downstairs

754
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,622
Bon, are you all right?

755
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,131
You just arrive at the right time
let's go

756
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,968
I can't believe you would do this

757
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,942
If I kill Hung Kwong. You would do
the same thing if you were me

758
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,900
Good for you, Yee Mong
At last you're doing the right thing

759
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,768
Nonsense. The right thing?
She is always been mine

760
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:08,930
Get rid of him

761
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,840
Let's forget it. Spare him

762
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,376
He saved me once

763
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,944
Good, you do have my style

764
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,812
Let's go
Yee Mong is not suitable for you

765
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,619
Boss, this way please
there's too many people

766
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,684
Yee Mong, are you all right?

767
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,319
Don't leave me...

768
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,990
Boss, jump

769
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,397
Jump quickly

770
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,865
Are you crazy? It's too high

771
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,769
God, they're crazy

772
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,500
I'll jump first, follow me

773
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,537
Do we have another choice?
I am not young anymore

774
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,046
Don't be afraid, I'll go first

775
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,515
And I'll get you, okay?

776
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,352
Make sure you can

777
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,382
All right, I'll catch you, come on

778
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,759
This signal is so confusing

779
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,591
Run away quickly

780
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:11,431
Don't chase me, here I come

781
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,434
So you're still alive

782
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,031
Run, run quickly

783
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,735
You bastard
you said you're gonna to catch me

784
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,906
be quick shut up

785
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,207
You bastard

786
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,736
Come on...

787
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,816
It hurts

788
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,979
Come on, be quick. The ship is leaving

789
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,216
Yee Mong, are you all right?

790
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,252
Yeah, thank you

791
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,091
But I cannot be Mr. Hung's undercover
anymore

792
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,694
No more undercover
we have to fight man to man

793
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,566
Hey, be serious

794
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,095
Are you all right?

795
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,241
Yeah, and you? I'm ok

796
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,738
I'm hurt

797
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,547
It's a small scratch, no big deal

798
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,149
No, I want ice-cream

799
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:13,998
My God, after meeting Yee Mong
that bastard...

800
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:16,364
doesn't think anything else but her

801
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:18,193
The tournament is going to start
tomorrow

802
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:21,205
Please bless him to win. Thank you

803
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,644
He only sends some to protect us

804
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:31,308
but not help us to do the housework

805
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:38,284
Be a good boy Sing, what card it is?

806
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:42,288
Somebody is coming back
Luk, what's wrong with your waist?

807
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:46,987
Rheumatism. Sing
I'll prepare some soup for you

808
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,827
You guess

809
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:50,932
Yee Mong

810
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:53,938
Right... guess again
The tournament is going to start tomorrow

811
00:52:53,972 --> 00:52:55,166
You'll get yourself killed
if you keep being like this

812
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:56,902
Yee Mong doesn't have moustache

813
00:52:56,942 --> 00:53:02,380
Don't move your hand
what have you been doing?

814
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:04,906
I've told you that Yee Mong would not
fall for a country boy like you

815
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,212
Oh, Yee Mong

816
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,717
If you have money

817
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,450
Don't move

818
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:18,689
You are a pain in the ass

819
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,358
Yee Mong, pick one first

820
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,958
I'll revenge

821
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:28,500
Where are you? Yee Mong

822
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:42,183
BOSS

823
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:47,291
Sing I've found you Yee Mong

824
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,815
I've found Yee Mong for you

825
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:50,785
It's lucky that you speak up

826
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:51,625
The same for you

827
00:53:51,663 --> 00:53:53,858
Sit down, time, place, where

828
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,890
Of course I can tell you
but I have a deal

829
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,731
For mine & Yee Mong's sake
I'll do anything

830
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:00,067
If you win tomorrow's tournament
I will bring you to Yee Mong

831
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,094
No problem

832
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,103
What's this card?

833
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,803
Ace. Diamond Ace

834
00:54:20,392 --> 00:54:21,620
You can't go inside

835
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,950
King and Three two pairs
for Canada Representative

836
00:54:51,523 --> 00:54:52,888
Six full-house
for Hong Kong Representative

837
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:54,084
Hong Kong representative win

838
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:01,329
We Win

839
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,032
Thank you, thank you

840
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:05,733
Thank you

841
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,867
A covered Ace Great

842
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:14,042
This round doesn't count

843
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:16,872
Boss The contract has been signed

844
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:18,280
I don't think we've got the deposit

845
00:55:18,884 --> 00:55:20,374
Uncle, did we win?

846
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:21,908
Yes Where's Yee Mong?

847
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,920
Boss, we'll go first

848
00:55:24,122 --> 00:55:25,282
We finally did it

849
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:55,903
What is it? You look

850
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,405
Very pretty

851
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:10,125
Do you like it?

852
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:34,018
What are they doing?

853
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,512
Protect you

854
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:38,680
Protect? Wait a minute

855
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,150
Why are you following me?

856
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:44,252
This is my duty

857
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:47,129
I am having a romantic time
with Yee Mong, leave us alone

858
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:49,258
Go away or I'll lose temper

859
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:52,464
Lose temper?
I got five men here, you better watch out

860
00:57:52,604 --> 00:57:54,196
Now you are the bad buy

861
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,207
Yes, so what?

862
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:57,708
You got it, there's nothing I can do

863
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:58,367
That's enough

864
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,378
I don't believe
they would dare fighting back

865
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,071
Boss
if Sing doesn't want to be followed

866
00:58:05,116 --> 00:58:06,879
Let's fix them up

867
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:09,284
I'm glad that I am his relative
I should be safe

868
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:13,586
Don't follow him if Sing doesn't like it

869
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,560
The best body-guard is already
next to him

870
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:19,256
That is Yee Mong

871
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:23,733
Sometimes you have to trust the women

872
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:30,638
Ying

873
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,973
Tat
why are you so urgently looking for me?

874
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:35,912
Nothing, I know you are a good fighter

875
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:39,474
I need you and your girls' help

876
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:42,617
Tat, so you are in business again

877
00:58:42,654 --> 00:58:45,179
But I and my girls haven't done this
for a while

878
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:46,952
It's been a while
since I last did it too

879
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:50,453
The thing is, my nephew is in trouble

880
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,895
I need some girls with good Kung Fu
to protect him

881
00:58:53,198 --> 00:58:55,996
If I can't get it, no one can get it

882
00:58:56,334 --> 00:58:57,266
Yes

883
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:14,650
I have worked for Mr. Chan
for many years

884
00:59:14,786 --> 00:59:17,755
Very few people knows that

885
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,383
Mr. Chan treats me good

886
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,625
I lost my parents when I was small

887
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:28,497
He's been taking care of me since then

888
00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:31,594
What are you laughing at?

889
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,335
I just want to go to toilet

890
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,104
What I mean is

891
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:39,741
I'll laugh when I want to go to toilet

892
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:41,939
Excuse me

893
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,916
Kneel down

894
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,198
Mr. Hung wants him, not you

895
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,369
It's not worth to sacrifice for him
come with me

896
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:49,909
Let's go

897
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,046
Yee Mong

898
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,111
Don't go

899
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:55,684
Jesus Christ?

900
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,153
No, it's uncle

901
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:15,133
Don't go out

902
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:16,105
Don't stop me

903
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,164
Uncle Tat

904
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:38,593
You can't fool me anymore

905
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:47,465
You think I'm stupid?

906
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:13,887
Is you? Right

907
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:15,428
Are you all right?

908
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,195
Yeah, what's this? How about you?

909
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:18,133
I'm ok

910
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,966
Bubbles coming out Yes

911
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:20,561
How come?

912
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:22,232
I don't know, Let's go

913
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:30,407
Royal Flush
Hong Kong Representative wins

914
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:36,210
Taiwan Representative Mr. C.S. Cho
is absent due to sickness

915
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:38,614
I haven't won Hung for 10 years

916
01:02:38,656 --> 01:02:40,123
I am going to win this time

917
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:42,854
Since you are getting old and stupid
to let him absent

918
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:46,394
Boss
what Yee Mong did has torn him apart

919
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:47,830
This is forgivable

920
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,356
I don't give a shit
if he absents for one more round

921
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:52,300
Sing will definitely be knocked out

922
01:02:52,337 --> 01:02:53,668
I'll bet my life on it

923
01:02:53,705 --> 01:02:55,969
Your life? That's too much

924
01:02:56,007 --> 01:02:58,840
I said yours, not mine

925
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:02,310
Boss, do you think we can find Yee Mong?

926
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:04,975
I don't know, maybe she is dead already

927
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,200
Sing

928
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:32,508
Falling in love again

929
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:36,240
I love her but she doesn't love me

930
01:03:36,614 --> 01:03:37,706
Nephew

931
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:42,015
Uncle, you better leave me alone here

932
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:44,280
You will never understand love

933
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:45,914
Of course I understand!

934
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:49,154
When I was young
I also experienced a lot of

935
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,855
life-torturing romances

936
01:03:53,531 --> 01:03:56,625
It's not life-torturing
if you have more than one relationships

937
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:58,326
Open your eyes

938
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,569
I don't want to see anything
but Yee Mong

939
01:04:02,607 --> 01:04:04,302
Open up your bloody eyes

940
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:11,211
Don't touch It's all illusion
you can see it but can't feel it

941
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,441
Home come you have her picture?

942
01:04:13,484 --> 01:04:17,079
I got it from my boss to comfort you

943
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,589
Give it to me, give it to me please

944
01:04:19,657 --> 01:04:22,649
Ok, let me tell you then
appearances change

945
01:04:22,694 --> 01:04:24,525
Today Yee Mong is so fine
but after some time

946
01:04:24,562 --> 01:04:26,757
Because of the magic of your love

947
01:04:26,898 --> 01:04:31,562
She'll gain weight gradually

948
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,264
I will try my very best to nourish her

949
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:37,741
Because she always look at you
with half open eyes

950
01:04:37,775 --> 01:04:42,405
She'll gradually become... like this

951
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,742
These'll be Yee Mong's eyes?

952
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:47,615
Yes, Can't you see yourself in her eyes?

953
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:49,847
Yes, I can

954
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:54,356
This is, living in a world of love
she'll always smile

955
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,622
I'll make her happy every day

956
01:04:56,661 --> 01:05:00,563
That's why her mouth will grow bigger

957
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,522
Will her mouth grow
if she kisses too much

958
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:05,934
Yes. That's why after a few years

959
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,633
Her mouth will become. Like this

960
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:12,943
Can this be her mouth?

961
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:15,639
Don't you see her lips
are opening for you?

962
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:18,981
Yes, I can feel it

963
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:22,246
She will be so proud to have your love

964
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:24,913
I will do my very best
to make her feel proud

965
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:26,218
She will be proud of me

966
01:05:26,324 --> 01:05:28,053
When she's proud, her nose will grow

967
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,427
When her nose grows
she will be like this

968
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:34,565
Jesus...

969
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:38,296
Don't
this is Yee Mong after a few years

970
01:05:38,336 --> 01:05:39,394
It won’t be

971
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:42,529
Nephew, look at yourself now

972
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:44,666
You won't love her
you wanna change your mind

973
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,074
You won't love Yee Mong anymore

974
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,704
Only because
she gains a little bit of weight

975
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,236
She changes because she loves you

976
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:51,509
But now you wanna dump her?

977
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:55,110
No, my love for her will never change

978
01:05:55,153 --> 01:05:56,916
Ok, from now on

979
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:59,013
You'll have to get used
to her future look

980
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,648
A pretty woman will change

981
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:03,353
Especially when a woman falls in love
who will change even faster

982
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:05,858
If you think you should give her up

983
01:06:05,897 --> 01:06:07,888
I'll destroy this for you

984
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,229
No, uncle, no, give me back, don't

985
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:11,292
Don't do it, give it back to me

986
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:12,893
There you go

987
01:06:12,937 --> 01:06:14,996
I will not give you this picture
I will give her to you in person

988
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,006
Where is it?

989
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:17,802
Yee Mong, come on in

990
01:06:24,882 --> 01:06:25,906
Fix him up

991
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:29,217
Yee Mong Sing

992
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:33,016
Fix me up, come fix me up

993
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:35,415
No

994
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,687
Why not?

995
01:06:36,928 --> 01:06:38,725
I have tried hard to get involved

996
01:06:38,763 --> 01:06:41,698
but I can't, he smells fishy

997
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:46,294
Making fun on my girl? I will kill you

998
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,703
You go out, go out, go out first

999
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,305
Bastard, what do you want?

1000
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:53,241
It looks bad

1001
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:55,768
When we split the money with Tat
it looks better

1002
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:58,373
With Sing
we will be rich for the rest of our lives

1003
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,383
We?

1004
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,174
I do itjust for you

1005
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:10,152
I didn't spend too much time
with your dad

1006
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,123
But in my memory

1007
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:21,996
That's why even you're not my son

1008
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:24,200
But in my heart

1009
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:27,269
I have always treated you as my own son

1010
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,442
I am sorry, uncle

1011
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:36,113
I don't know my supernatural power
can cause all these troubles

1012
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:37,643
Your supernatural power
has nothing to do with it

1013
01:07:37,688 --> 01:07:39,155
But it is Yee Mong

1014
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,920
Your love for her
has affected your power

1015
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:44,052
From now on you have to forget about her

1016
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:46,325
Build up your confidence
recover your power

1017
01:07:46,364 --> 01:07:50,095
I am deeply in love
I have no one to depend on

1018
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,796
You do, you can depend on Ping

1019
01:07:52,837 --> 01:07:54,566
You can change your target

1020
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:57,330
No, I can't, Ping is not Yee Mong

1021
01:07:57,675 --> 01:08:01,338
Yee Mong is my Goddess, not Ping

1022
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:04,177
That's right
you can even call me your Goddess, right?

1023
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,842
No, Yee Mong is a Goddess with make-up

1024
01:08:08,886 --> 01:08:10,217
Ping can be one too

1025
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:11,947
Can she?

1026
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,422
Can I?

1027
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:22,528
Sing, be ready for your Goddess

1028
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,033
Ping is coming

1029
01:08:26,904 --> 01:08:28,303
The Democratic Goddess

1030
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:43,476
This doesn't count

1031
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:50,994
What're you looking at?

1032
01:08:51,095 --> 01:08:51,925
It's you

1033
01:08:51,963 --> 01:08:52,861
Sing, what are you doing?

1034
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:54,797
I found Yee Mong

1035
01:08:54,832 --> 01:08:56,595
This mole on the armpit...

1036
01:08:57,101 --> 01:08:58,033
What do you want?

1037
01:08:58,069 --> 01:08:59,434
We can talk

1038
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:03,569
Fishy Sing
don't stare at sing like this

1039
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,842
It looks weird on the street

1040
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:10,336
For money's sake, raise her arm, go

1041
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:12,474
Luckily her scar is not on her butt

1042
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,615
Going out, Sing?

1043
01:09:27,398 --> 01:09:28,763
Need any drinks?

1044
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,794
Yee Mong, what do you want?

1045
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:35,004
Give me a lemon squash

1046
01:09:35,072 --> 01:09:36,835
Yee Mong likes iced coffee

1047
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:39,306
I don't drink coffee

1048
01:09:39,977 --> 01:09:43,606
Whoa are you? I am talking to Yee Mong
shut up

1049
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:49,209
OK, one coffee for her, one for Yee Mong

1050
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:52,620
I want a lemon squash with a mixed grill

1051
01:09:53,024 --> 01:09:54,992
Please give me a pig's knuckle

1052
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,718
It's finished, thank you

1053
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,222
Nuts

1054
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,632
So he knows you like mixed grill

1055
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,866
Are you hot? You are sweating

1056
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:14,176
Of course I am
I have to raise my hands all the time

1057
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:16,872
I am talking to Yee Mong, shut up

1058
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:18,812
I will clean up your sweat

1059
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:26,288
Stop fooling around. I will do it

1060
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:31,223
I thought I will never see you again

1061
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:32,996
They are both freaks

1062
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:39,994
Actually
I am a fighter, do you believe?

1063
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:44,566
I am the boxing champion of Guangdong
two years in a row

1064
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,441
Overall champion, before I came here
I just won the match

1065
01:10:47,478 --> 01:10:51,574
Against Fukian's champion
do you know that?

1066
01:10:52,883 --> 01:10:56,148
Yee Mong, are you listening? That's true

1067
01:10:57,388 --> 01:11:01,085
Actually I, really want you to know that

1068
01:11:01,892 --> 01:11:03,723
After you left

1069
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:06,896
I beaten up the guys, I want you to know

1070
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:08,023
Peter is looking for you

1071
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:09,362
I am busy

1072
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,268
I want to tell you I care about you

1073
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:18,634
Yee Mong wants to sleep
she is getting tired now

1074
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:20,735
She is talking to me right now
how can it be?

1075
01:11:20,845 --> 01:11:24,178
I really need to take a leak
it cannot be controlled, let her go

1076
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:27,846
You are lying, give me back my Yee Mong

1077
01:11:29,687 --> 01:11:31,279
I don't believe it

1078
01:11:31,322 --> 01:11:33,620
How would you have the need
if you haven't had anything?

1079
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:35,181
Eat something first

1080
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:36,386
Eat

1081
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,357
Take this rib-eye, it's tender

1082
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:43,763
It's useless, Yee Mong has no teeth
how can she eat?

1083
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,826
It seems better with some ketchup

1084
01:11:46,904 --> 01:11:49,236
Shit, I will have allergy

1085
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:53,038
Put some mustard it's even better

1086
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:57,908
It's notjust allergy
I will be in deep trouble

1087
01:11:58,516 --> 01:12:00,609
It is perfect now

1088
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,017
Yee Mong likes sausage

1089
01:12:07,925 --> 01:12:09,153
Are you crazy?

1090
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:11,418
You said you have lost your teeth
and can't eat

1091
01:12:11,562 --> 01:12:13,689
We'd better eat something good, waiter

1092
01:12:13,731 --> 01:12:16,063
Two lobsters, one baked crab shell

1093
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,101
That's not necessary
Yee Mong is full already

1094
01:12:19,136 --> 01:12:20,899
You don't have to eat, right?

1095
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,532
What are you doing?

1096
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:28,073
Yee Mong is sick

1097
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,710
Doctor...

1098
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,082
You are crazy!

1099
01:12:33,117 --> 01:12:35,881
I really don't want that kind of money

1100
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,547
How can an armpit eat lobsters?

1101
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:39,112
It hurts so much

1102
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:42,883
You really have a great arm-pit
it even eats the shell

1103
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:45,259
You wanna see Yee Mong? Forget it

1104
01:12:47,498 --> 01:12:48,487
Are you OK, Yee Mong?

1105
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,294
It's OK

1106
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,857
Call the ambulance, quick

1107
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:55,062
The doctor said
my hand will take a week to recover

1108
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:56,265
Are you happy now?

1109
01:12:56,307 --> 01:12:58,639
I'll bring you to a place you like

1110
01:12:59,343 --> 01:13:00,469
Where's that?

1111
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:04,005
It's nice, isn't it?

1112
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:08,049
Yee Mong, is it nice? Yee Mong

1113
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:11,545
Yee Mong, are you all right?
Yee Mong, you've knocked out!

1114
01:13:14,992 --> 01:13:16,186
Oh, you're here again

1115
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:19,059
You steal Luk's underwear again

1116
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:20,063
Tat

1117
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:22,465
She knows I've stolen her underwear

1118
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,488
Shit

1119
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:29,398
Ah Ping, what?
What's wrong with your armpit?

1120
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,670
I want to go sun bathing with Yee Mong

1121
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:33,436
You better go & put sun tan oil first

1122
01:13:40,918 --> 01:13:42,783
What are you looking at
haven't seen an arm-pit before?

1123
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:43,684
What's wrong?

1124
01:13:43,721 --> 01:13:45,120
Look at your mother's if you want

1125
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:54,689
2 million

1126
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:58,201
Do you need anything, sir?

1127
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:00,028
Thanks

1128
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:22,885
2 million for 4 of a kind?

1129
01:14:24,995 --> 01:14:26,519
You really know how to play

1130
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:29,756
Sir, please do not
pick your teeth with the card

1131
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,858
Sorry

1132
01:14:33,037 --> 01:14:34,402
You can't use this one either

1133
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:37,667
But I have covered Ace

1134
01:14:39,343 --> 01:14:40,935
I'm lucky all my life

1135
01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:43,606
I'll see
if I could have 4 aces of a kind

1136
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,916
2 million, 5 million more

1137
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,781
I'll see if you are really lucky or not

1138
01:14:49,286 --> 01:14:50,981
I'll follow

1139
01:14:51,422 --> 01:14:52,719
Please deal

1140
01:14:58,028 --> 01:15:00,496
It's really unbelievable
I'm calling the shot

1141
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:02,828
Show your hands

1142
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:09,363
It's not the last hand, I'll come again

1143
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:11,707
Loss to 4 twos

1144
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,205
Right, save it for the next game

1145
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:27,586
Uncle How about the matter?

1146
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:32,523
Don't take chance, it's too dangerous

1147
01:15:32,563 --> 01:15:36,556
It's impossible, I can hear
his heart beat, it's bursting

1148
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,498
Don't do it next time

1149
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,001
Yes. Time to start

1150
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:44,474
Please sit, we take photographs later

1151
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:50,377
Ladies & gentlemen, this is
to introduce Taiwan champion gambler

1152
01:15:50,414 --> 01:15:53,383
Mr. Chan Chung together
with Wong Hung Kwong from Hong Kong

1153
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:55,647
Signing the gambler Championship

1154
01:15:55,853 --> 01:15:57,912
Apart from the money

1155
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:02,391
Both sides agree to place bet
for the amount of US$100,000,000 each

1156
01:16:02,493 --> 01:16:05,257
To be formal, I would like each of you
to act as witness

1157
01:16:05,295 --> 01:16:07,490
Now, both parties will sign the contract

1158
01:16:19,777 --> 01:16:21,039
Well, are you winning?

1159
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:22,511
Of course

1160
01:16:22,713 --> 01:16:24,180
Good night

1161
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:25,807
Let's say thank you to the God

1162
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:26,781
Where is Shing?

1163
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:28,148
Maybe in the room

1164
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:29,913
Luk, where are the incenses?

1165
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,486
It's under the table

1166
01:16:34,224 --> 01:16:35,657
Why are you cleaning up?

1167
01:16:36,894 --> 01:16:39,328
I used to live happily here before

1168
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:42,724
It's because of Luk
Chee and Blackie Tat

1169
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,529
We arejust like a family

1170
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:47,093
Though we've fought over mahjong bills

1171
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:51,164
And always have quarrels
but there's no hard feeling

1172
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:52,800
But since Sing arrived from China

1173
01:16:52,843 --> 01:16:55,539
I have been hiding
and let you go out with him

1174
01:16:56,146 --> 01:17:01,015
It's all Blackie Tat's fault
look at him

1175
01:17:01,051 --> 01:17:04,680
He's Tat's uncle, but he never
teach his nephew to work hard

1176
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:09,988
And treat him as his golden egg
he sees Sing like his father

1177
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:13,360
He beg him, pledge him, look at yourself

1178
01:17:13,397 --> 01:17:15,592
I loved you
because you were respectable in the past

1179
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:17,930
There's a lot of rich guy
offer you their hands

1180
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:20,266
But you turn them down, money is nothing

1181
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:21,532
It's important to be happy

1182
01:17:21,572 --> 01:17:23,005
You don't need to keep him company

1183
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,668
I feel so bad
to see you doing this kind of thing

1184
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:29,978
You talk like a man of honour

1185
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:31,412
I like it

1186
01:17:32,049 --> 01:17:33,038
Really?

1187
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:38,252
Shing, don't blame Ping
it's all my fault

1188
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:41,451
Sure it is
you betray your friends, your family

1189
01:17:41,492 --> 01:17:42,686
Forgive me, God

1190
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,125
It's none of God's business

1191
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:48,154
God gives you special power
you should make good use out of it

1192
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:49,392
and help the poor

1193
01:17:49,433 --> 01:17:51,867
But you just use it for girls and money

1194
01:18:29,473 --> 01:18:32,169
I am not treating you as my golden egg

1195
01:18:33,443 --> 01:18:35,741
It's because
I've been poor for a long time

1196
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:40,074
I Just want us to have some good days
in future

1197
01:18:41,585 --> 01:18:43,382
I know this is tough

1198
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:48,017
If we haven't signed the contract
I won’ t let you do it

1199
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:53,991
I'm sorry, Uncle

1200
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:56,932
Sorry to make you all so sad
I gotta go now

1201
01:18:56,967 --> 01:19:00,664
If you go to Guangzhou someday
I'll show you around

1202
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:04,868
Hey, uncle, I think we've made a mistake

1203
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:08,674
I'll never gamble again
and you better quit it too

1204
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,151
Shit, I wonder if they are OK

1205
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,786
It's all your fault

1206
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:22,992
Let's try to find him

1207
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:24,492
OK, let's go

1208
01:19:25,996 --> 01:19:28,590
They can go, but not you

1209
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:49,081
My friend, have you seen this guy?

1210
01:19:49,386 --> 01:19:50,182
No

1211
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:50,948
Look again

1212
01:19:50,988 --> 01:19:52,250
No

1213
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:57,552
Tat

1214
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,592
Find someone when you're still young
get married

1215
01:20:08,372 --> 01:20:10,203
But never marry a gambler

1216
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:20,314
Give me 'play boy' please

1217
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:22,848
Where's it?

1218
01:20:26,023 --> 01:20:28,423
I've seen him in the casino before

1219
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:29,152
Really?

1220
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,386
Seems like Hung's man

1221
01:20:30,427 --> 01:20:31,758
You think they have Sing?

1222
01:20:31,795 --> 01:20:33,285
I don't know Follow him

01:20:36,066 --> 01:20:36,862

How are you? Very good

1226
01:21:15,906 --> 01:21:17,237
Come get your food

1227
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:21,935
The girl looks familiar

1228
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:25,209
That's Yee Mong
the girl on the picture Tat showed us

1229
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,706
If we save her
Chung from Taiwan will surely release Tat

1230
01:21:28,752 --> 01:21:30,310
You are smart

1231
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:41,292
Hong Kong representative Hung Kwong
is here

1232
01:21:46,837 --> 01:21:48,805
Taiwan Representative Chan Chung
is here also

1233

01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:26,435
What happened? Why does C.S. Cho
from Taiwan still not arrive?

1249
01:23:28,872 --> 01:23:30,339
I want to talk to thejudge

1250
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,731
I want to postpone the game
for 10 minutes

1251
01:23:34,978 --> 01:23:36,275
OK, let's do this

1252
01:23:39,482 --> 01:23:41,245
The Taiwan representative
doesn't feel good

1253
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:42,876
The doctor is on the way

1254
01:23:46,356 --> 01:23:48,620
Ladies and gentlemen, we have decided

1255
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:50,455
To postpone the game for 10 minutes

1256
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:55,924
You will replace him, can you?

1257
01:23:55,966 --> 01:23:59,094
Let me do it
this isn't breaking any rules

1258
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:02,502
You look at me
don't you both like looking at me?

1259
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:06,100
All of you are useless
how can you let him runaway?

1260
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:09,077
If he doesn't come back later
I will castrate you

1261
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,482
Brother, do me a favour
when you castrate

1262
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:17,850
Use a sharp knife
or the wound will get inflamed

1263
01:24:17,888 --> 01:24:20,322
We don't use knife, we use hammer

1264
01:24:20,357 --> 01:24:21,346
Hammer?

1265
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:22,858
We like to knock it down

1266
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:38,099
The game has been postponed
for 10 minutes

1267
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:41,542
Taiwan's Mr. Cho still hasn't shown up

1268
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,877
According to the regulations
if one side is absent

1269
01:24:44,915 --> 01:24:47,110
And can't participate, he is giving up

1270
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:50,984
So the champion of the game is...

1271
01:24:51,021 --> 01:24:54,320
Wait a minute
Taiwan's representative is here

1272
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,485
Damn it, I thought he won't come

1273
01:25:25,522 --> 01:25:28,457
He really scared the shit out of me
that's ridiculous

1274
01:25:34,364 --> 01:25:36,855
He put on hair gel, He really did!

1275
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:24,876
Now both sides are here, the game...

1276
01:26:24,914 --> 01:26:25,938
Wait a minute

1277
01:26:37,794 --> 01:26:39,921
A friend of yours sends his regards

1278
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:42,457
I will be the winner of this game

1279
01:26:54,511 --> 01:26:56,035
It's Yee Mong's earring

1280
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:05,219
I think your power is gone, isn't it?

1281
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:07,049
Please be ready

1282
01:27:26,543 --> 01:27:28,738
Shit, I can't see the cards

1283
01:27:31,381 --> 01:27:32,541
What is he doing?

1284
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:34,081
Does he fake it out?

1285
01:27:35,885 --> 01:27:37,352
I wanna quit

1286
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:41,956
What's he doing, wanna quit now?

1287
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:43,686
What the hell is going on?

1288
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:46,160
He fakes it out?
He wanna make fun of me?

1289
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:50,422
Please be quiet, ladies and gentlemen

1290
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:55,570
He hasn't got the right to quit
let me tell you

1291
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:58,938
If he loses the game, I'll kill you both

1292
01:27:58,975 --> 01:28:02,206
Boss, Sing is kid
if you want to kill somebody, kill me

1293
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:10,609
My skill is definitely
not as good as his

1294
01:28:10,854 --> 01:28:13,049
All right, I'll have to take the chance

1295
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:15,215
Sorry, I think I'll play again

1296
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:21,321
That's right
be a gentlemen like a Taiwanese should

1297
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:23,790
Please start

1298
01:28:45,188 --> 01:28:46,678
Mr. Hung, yourturn

1299
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,524
$500,000

1300
01:28:59,936 --> 01:29:01,403
Mr. Cho, your turn

1301
01:29:03,473 --> 01:29:07,432
I'll follow, add another $100,000,000

1302
01:29:11,381 --> 01:29:13,474
What kind of strategy is this?
I've never seen it

1303
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:24,251
Young man, this is only the 1st round
I'll quit

1304
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:32,331
What is he doing?
This is only the 1st round

1305
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,768
I don't know either, that crazy folk

1306
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:47,213
Mr. Cho, your turn

1307
01:29:52,589 --> 01:29:54,250
I'll bet everything
let's not waste our time

1308
01:29:56,226 --> 01:29:57,454
Are you kidding?

1309
01:29:57,493 --> 01:29:59,188
Betting all you have again?
What's the matter?

1310
01:29:59,229 --> 01:30:01,663
Mr. Hung, be calm, you may quit

1311
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:04,963
Please do not interface
your opponent's mood

1312
01:30:05,435 --> 01:30:07,869
Mr. Hung looks a little emotional

1313
01:30:15,878 --> 01:30:16,936
I'll quit

1314
01:30:18,348 --> 01:30:21,181
What's the little bastard doing?

1315
01:30:23,186 --> 01:30:25,177
What are you looking at? Show your cards

1316
01:30:27,657 --> 01:30:28,715
Again?

1317
01:30:30,093 --> 01:30:31,321
One more time

1318
01:30:49,312 --> 01:30:52,008
What's wrong with him?
Each game is the same

1319
01:30:52,048 --> 01:30:54,516
What do you know
he knows his skill is not as good

1320
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:56,450
He is forcing Mr. Hung to bet on chance

1321
01:30:56,753 --> 01:30:57,742
Chance?

1322
01:31:14,103 --> 01:31:15,695
Mr. Hung, yourturn

1323
01:31:17,307 --> 01:31:18,274
$2 millions

1324
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:19,636
Mr. Cho, your turn

1325
01:31:19,676 --> 01:31:22,338
Show hand, show hand

1326
01:31:23,446 --> 01:31:25,107
I'm listening to the crowd

1327
01:31:32,422 --> 01:31:34,720
Be slow, we still have time

1328
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:44,730
There's only 15 minutes left

1329
01:31:46,069 --> 01:31:48,537
I cannot go on like this or I will lose

1330
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:51,540
Can I be beaten by his beginner's luck?

1331
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:54,340
Have you heard of beginning's luck?

1332
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,711
Be quiet, everybody quiet please

1333
01:32:07,256 --> 01:32:09,520
I don't believe
you use such a poor trick

1334
01:32:09,559 --> 01:32:11,789
This is the best trick, idiot

1335
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:15,786
Why don't we forget about skill
just bet our luck, start dealing

1336
01:32:40,923 --> 01:32:43,153
You'll lose if you don't have a flush

1337
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:46,923
If I have a flush
your 3-aces will have to go

1338
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:50,031
3-of-a-kind, can't I have 4-of-a-kind?

1339
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:53,962
Then can't I have a royal flush? Deal

1340
01:33:30,907 --> 01:33:33,501
What about now? Can you hit 4 aces?

1341
01:33:33,543 --> 01:33:35,408
If you can, then you'll beat my flush

1342
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:06,267
What's it?
Don't dare show us your cards?

1343
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,440
What is he doing?

1344
01:34:16,486 --> 01:34:17,783
Shifting the cards

1345
01:34:19,021 --> 01:34:20,488
This is the state-of-the-art

1346
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:28,889
Have you finished?

1347
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:30,989
I have the right to think, haven't I?

1348
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:32,466
You're playing with me, aren't you?

1349
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:54,952
What is going on?
It takes so long to open his cards

1350
01:35:00,196 --> 01:35:07,534
Tat... Tat...

1351
01:35:21,284 --> 01:35:24,310
What are you waiting for?
I don't care who's coming, open up

1352
01:35:42,338 --> 01:35:43,168
Open your cards

1353
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:45,305
Look at Sing

1354
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:46,365
He is getting the Ace

1355
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:54,373
Ace...

1356
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:03,890
Ladies and gentlemen, 4 Aces

1357
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:13,229
You wanna beat my flush with 3 Aces?

1358
01:36:13,603 --> 01:36:17,801
stop dreaming, oh, spade Ace?

1359
01:36:20,576 --> 01:36:25,604
I win, so I shifted it over there

1360
01:36:25,715 --> 01:36:27,979
I got it, Uncle Tat

1361
01:36:28,017 --> 01:36:29,041
He won

1362
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:35,222
The covered card should be Heart K
what about now?

1363
01:36:35,257 --> 01:36:36,690
Nothing, the biggest you have is an Ace

1364
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:38,591
He has 3-Aces, therefore he wins

1365
01:36:39,462 --> 01:36:40,326
He's cheating

1366
01:36:41,797 --> 01:36:45,028
That's right, so what
where's the evidence?

1367
01:36:45,067 --> 01:36:46,329
You changed my card

1368
01:36:46,869 --> 01:36:48,393
Security, get him

1369
01:36:50,373 --> 01:36:51,362
I object

1370
01:36:51,707 --> 01:36:55,074
Cheating in front of me?
You think I'm stupid? Take him out

1371
01:37:07,356 --> 01:37:09,756
Ladies and gentlemen, I announce that

1372
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:13,159
The Champion of today's competition is

1373
01:37:13,195 --> 01:37:15,356
Mr. C.S. Cho representing Taiwan

1374
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:17,560
I didn't expect the kid to be so good

1375
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:38,879
Thanks for bringing Yee Mong here
so that I can use my power

1376
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:41,520
Shing, you were right about me yesterday

1377
01:37:41,557 --> 01:37:44,685
I should use my power to help those
who really need help

1378
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:54,393
Congratulations

1379
01:37:58,074 --> 01:38:00,542
Thanks for giving me the chance
to be with you

1380
01:38:00,609 --> 01:38:03,077
I know you did all these for business

1381
01:38:03,112 --> 01:38:05,637
I know we are from two different worlds

1382
01:38:09,185 --> 01:38:10,049
Yes

1383
01:38:37,179 --> 01:38:39,841
I have spent all my life in the US.

1384
01:38:39,882 --> 01:38:42,578
I could get my PhD degree
at the age of 18

1385
01:38:43,052 --> 01:38:46,852
But later
my father gave me his whole business

1386
01:38:46,889 --> 01:38:49,380
Then I didn't need the PhD degree

1387
01:38:49,425 --> 01:38:50,983
I have a wish, I wish that...

1388
01:38:51,026 --> 01:38:51,856
Uncle

1389
01:38:51,894 --> 01:38:54,055
What a coincidence, let me introduce

1390
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,587
This is my nephew Sing
you just met before

1391
01:38:56,632 --> 01:38:59,294
Sing, this is my new girlfriend Pheonia

1392
01:39:01,837 --> 01:39:02,895
Not this one

1393
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:04,200
I know...

1394
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,635
Pheonia, how are you?

1395
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:08,937
I'll leave you then All right

1396
01:39:08,978 --> 01:39:10,206
Tonight, we...

1397
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:12,440
Congratulations, Uncle Tat
