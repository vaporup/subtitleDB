1
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,025
Close your eyes.

2
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,277
Close em.

3
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,600
See how many you gotta go through...

4
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,603
to get a good one?

5
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,014
Are you ready?

6
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,767
No.

7
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,270
You can see what?

8
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,688
Who's?

9
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,315
Not till Monday.

10
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,566
Whose is it?

11
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,039
I don't know a grip, a gaffer,
somebody's foot, a shadow of it.

12
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,834
I can't, I can't... okay well

13
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,044
if I can see it then they can see it too.

14
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,379
If they can't do it,

15
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,131
I mean how many times are
you going to go around this?

16
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,674
Hire a new team.
What's the problem?

17
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,967
It has been a while.

18
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,762
I'm sorry about that but
your work is just amazing.

19
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,972
When we saw your take on it

20
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,391
everyone instantly knew
we'd gone to the right place.

21
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,685
I just have a few questions for you.

22
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,566
Taking the yellow soil

23
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,831
This was my daily work

24
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,418
What is it?

25
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,295
Do you have more?

26
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,838
My friends, though.

27
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,895
No, no.

28
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,146
Stay awake.

29
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,023
You feel refreshed?

30
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,943
Is there any food?

31
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,945
All the food is poisoned.

32
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,114
Your throat is parched.

33
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,118
Make a pitcher of ice
water, bring a small glass.

34
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,169
You can leave the tile.

35
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,131
The rest of the floor will
support your weight now.

36
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,139
I have to apologize.

37
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,184
I was born with a disfigurement
where my head is made

38
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,228
of the same material as the sun.

39
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,273
It makes it impossible for
you to look directly at me.

40
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,193
It has always been this way.

41
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,617
The water before you is somehow special.

42
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,329
When you drink it you feel
revived and full of energy.

43
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,749
It is better than anything you've ever tasted.

44
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,251
Take a drink now.

45
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,595
There are two approaching
armies, hunger and fatigue,

46
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,223
but a great wall keeps them at bay.

47
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,642
The wall extends to the sky and will stay

48
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,645
up until I say otherwise.

49
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,359
Each drink is better than the last,

50
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,571
leaving you with the desire to have one more.

51
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,993
Take a drink now.

52
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,931
The next drink must be earned
and I'm going to tell you how.

53
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,268
Focus closely on my instructions.

54
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,979
I will ask you to repeat them from memory.

55
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,295
One one thousand, two one thousand,

56
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,380
three one thousand, four one thousand.

57
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,345
The water has lost its appeal.

58
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,889
It doesn't seem as enticing as before.

59
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,100
You have no craving for it.

60
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,812
Kris I just got a call.

61
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,438
It's your mother.

62
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,982
She says she's been taken by several men.

63
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,359
Oh no.

64
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,488
She says they won't let
her go unless you pay them.

65
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,992
No...

66
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,371
Oh no. Do you have any money?

67
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,872
No I don't.

68
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,541
I'm sorry.

69
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,043
Can you think of anything?

70
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,004
She sounds brave but I
think they're hurting her.

71
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,798
Mom...

72
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,385
I have the house.

73
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,011
You own the house?

74
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,139
I own part of it.

75
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,682
I could, maybe I could...

76
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,225
What's the equity?

77
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,602
$36,000.

78
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,231
Is that enough?

79
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,734
In coins?

80
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,319
Coins?

81
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,691
Five thousand.

82
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,779
Forty-five hundred.

83
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,782
Three thousand.

84
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,457
Weather is beautiful.

85
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,043
You feel like walking a bit
so you park a block away.

86
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,468
Did I hand you back your card?
There we are.

87
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,719
Current balance is at the bottom.

88
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,388
Please allow 3-4 business days
for availability of funds.

89
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,556
Is there anything else I can help you with?

90
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,766
No thank you, that's it.

91
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,476
Thank you for stopping in
Ms. Fischer, have a great...

92
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,984
Yes ma'am, how may I help you?

93
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,320
Who can I speak to about a
home equity line of credit?

94
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,488
I can help you with that.

95
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,489
My name is Marie, please have a seat.

96
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,491
Oh I love your scarf.

97
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,494
Over...

98
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,958
and under, through and now you're white.

99
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,428
Crown me.

100
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,018
One one thousand, two one thousand,

101
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,521
three one thousand, four one thousand

102
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:36,726
Kris, the wall has crumbled, fallen down.

103
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,126
It won't come out.

104
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,652
And did you try anybody else?

105
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,320
Because I spoke to Shelly

106
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,905
and she does not remember talking to you.

107
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,573
Yes, it was a voicemail, I left a voicemail.

108
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,783
Where's Roth today?

109
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,159
Why isn't he telling me himself?

110
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,870
He couldn't be here today
and that's now what we're...

111
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,373
I had the flu, okay?

112
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,709
I had a 106 degree temperature.

113
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,940
That's not... that's
not my signature.

114
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,942
I didn't... it's not...

115
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,573
And here's a deposit slip from September.

116
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,408
Yeah, that's my handwriting.

117
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,119
This is different obviously.

118
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,271
So we do all their
printing and their literature.

119
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,481
It's just a small school district but,

120
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,525
this is the address right here,

121
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,361
so if you ever need any printing, signage,

122
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,529
just come in or call.

123
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,947
I don't need... I never in a
million years would I ever...

124
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,323
I don't need any signage.

125
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,491
This is you, Kris?

126
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,158
Yeah, that's me.

127
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,034
Okay.

128
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,494
Umm...

129
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,246
I'll call.

130
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm not going to call for signage though, right?

131
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,667
I don't need any signage.

132
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,044
Okay, Kris?

133
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,754
Okay, Jeff.

134
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,426
Uh, hey...

135
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,679
it was good meeting you.

136
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,605
I called you.

137
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,733
I can't do this every day.
This makes me late for work.

138
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,610
You're four trains after me.

139
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,114
So you're going to have to answer if I call.

140
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,618
I'm going to call. Again.

141
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,625
I picked up an MBA.

142
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,585
That's what the, that's what the firm does.

143
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,964
It has a commercial half, the
other side's personal wealth.

144
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,756
Where is it?

145
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,592
It's, you can actually see it.

146
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,635
It's a high rise.

147
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,638
The Palomar Building, C&L Crowne, that's us.

148
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,723
Why do you take the train?

149
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,849
Why do I take the train?

150
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,226
Yes, it's just everyone

151
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,644
that takes the train is either homeless

152
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,021
or had their license revoked or you know.

153
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,648
Do you want to see my driver's license?

154
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,649
No.

155
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,653
That's a gift for us.

156
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,281
See there's this path forward
where I wait to tell you

157
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,659
and you either use it as an excuse

158
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,578
or maybe you don't but, I don't know.

159
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,665
I was diagnosed about a
year ago and I take these

160
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,376
and I take those and it's fine.

161
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,961
It seems fine.

162
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,379
It seems fine to me.

163
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,672
So there's that, and...

164
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,425
I think I saved us both three to four weeks.

165
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,551
Alright.

166
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,094
Thank you.

167
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,680
I'm going to get the check and we can...

168
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,559
...get out of here.

169
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,686
I'm sorry.

170
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,813
That was stupid.

171
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,858
I don't know what I'm meant to say to that.

172
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,109
What do I say to that?

173
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,318
I don't know.

174
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,244
Why don't I-I'll tell
you something and then you,

175
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,122
you don't care at all do you?

176
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,707
It's not- yeah alright.

177
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,711
Before we pass this trash I'm
going to tell you something.

178
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,719
Um...

179
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,721
I am divorced.

180
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,723
That's not good right?

181
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,724
It's not great.

182
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,933
Yeah.

183
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,967
Where's Michel?

184
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,345
We have clients with ten times this revenue

185
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,971
that don't have near the tax liability you do.

186
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,599
So we can have another conversation about

187
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,059
how screwed up the code is,

188
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,062
or you can take the charge against and solve it.

189
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,490
Does your wife take any medications?

190
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,158
No.

191
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,910
Does she have any health problems?

192
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,869
Asthma.

193
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,691
Just want to say that I hope today's better.

194
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,446
I made a list of the things
I want to try harder at.

195
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,200
I love you.

196
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,286
Those are just words,
they don't fix anything Jill.

197
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,630
It's not a short I'm going to
the store to get some more.

198
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,507
Wait a second.

199
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,217
I'm on the way out the door.

200
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,220
I just want to tell you I hope today is better.

201
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,722
And that I love you.

202
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,933
Damn it Jill those are just, those are words.

203
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,643
They don't mean anything.

204
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,769
Not now Jillian.

205
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,062
I want this to be a good day.

206
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,230
Just leave me alone.

207
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,232
I love you.

208
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,777
I think you were right about a lot of things.

209
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,404
I love you.

210
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,573
I want today to be peaceful.

211
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,909
Damn it Jill, this is worthless.

212
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,372
Ben.

213
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,456
Now you want to talk?

214
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,958
I'm way out the door Jill.

215
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,877
I just want to say that...

216
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,963
...I hope today is better.

217
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,340
And that I love you.

218
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,884
I want to believe you.

219
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,731
Hey, while I'm at it I'll pick up that filter.

220
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,750
Is it alright that I have that there?

221
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,794
You going to fall down
if you don't have it there?

222
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,587
Yeah, maybe.

223
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,095
See this woman here with the knitting?

224
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,391
She's a, she's a former Senator, right?

225
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,145
Like a Nobel winner, but
her category is mittens.

226
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,106
So she, she rides... what?

227
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:35,898
You lost me.

228
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,233
Just got a little too...

229
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:37,942
Little?

230
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,485
[Kris÷ Little cute, yeah.

231
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,404
I don't know.
What do you have in mind?

232
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,240
Alright, how about that guy?

233
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,117
Tell me about him.

234
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,619
He's divorced.

235
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,539
Yeah, yep.

236
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,625
Because she cheated.

237
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,711
No?

238
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,338
No. Oh, he did.

239
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,423
He cheated.

240
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,842
No. What was it?

241
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,427
Alcoholic.

242
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,935
Some substance of some kind.

243
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,439
The illegal kind.

244
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,735
I would think that there's some marriages

245
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,404
that could survive something like that maybe.

246
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,739
Maybe, but...

247
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,740
Not yours?

248
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,533
Not ours, no.

249
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,494
From her perspective.

250
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,455
I mean everything just flipped, you know.

251
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,249
The guy she thought she married
turned out to be somebody else,

252
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,460
a junkie, and uh...

253
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,963
all the savings, all
the plans, everything resets.

254
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,965
The lights turn on,

255
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,135
and I'm holed up in some hotel across town.

256
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,225
I have to open the store tomorrow.

257
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,645
Not that early, I bet.

258
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,481
No, I'm lucky to have that job.

259
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,527
The sign store job you're lucky to have it?

260
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,159
It's not my fault when it goes wrong.

261
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,580
Yes it is.

262
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,802
Why do you live in hotels?

263
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,181
I do the books for a group
that owns a few of them.

264
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,976
So it's sort of... a perk.

265
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,435
Right, but why do you choose...

266
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,812
I am starving...
Are you hungry?

267
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,522
You've got to be right?

268
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,944
It always just reminds me of family vacations.

269
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,447
Maybe because of the smell of chlorine

270
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,949
and bleach in the sheets,

271
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,785
the glasses wrapped in plastic.

272
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,496
Yeah...

273
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,832
We would go to this...
there's this place in Vermont

274
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,667
that we would go when we were kids.

275
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,960
It's like a colonial...

276
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,503
In Vermont?

277
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,462
Yeah.

278
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,590
It was historic and there was museums,

279
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,676
but the thing that stood out for
us was that they...

280
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,470
we would stay at this hotel with an indoor pool,

281
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,641
and it was just the biggest
deal in the world for us.

282
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,685
Because one, it's indoor...

283
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,647
Two, you can swim... What's
going on with you?

284
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,236
What are you thinking?

285
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,698
Is it good?

286
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,450
No.

287
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,369
You have a message.

288
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,706
Are you going?

289
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,000
To the banquet?

290
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,171
I mean it's going to be work, you know.

291
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,923
It's people from work.

292
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,591
For three hours.

293
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,098
I thought we could go...

294
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,682
...if you want.

295
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,480
You want to?

296
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,447
I'm sorry.

297
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,631
I like you so much.

298
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,676
I do. I like you so much.

299
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,219
I have...

300
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,804
You are kidding right?

301
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,891
I have been really careful
not to lie about something.

302
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,811
And through omission,

303
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,813
I may have given you an impression

304
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,816
that isn't quite real.

305
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,526
I work here.

306
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,737
I work on 29th C&L Crowne.

307
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,447
I'm not an advisor.

308
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,824
I don't broker.

309
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,036
I do interdepartmental reports,
okay, I don't have an office.

310
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,247
I work in common space, I work with interns.

311
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,833
Greg pays me in cash to keep me off their books

312
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:55,838
because if there is ever
an audit, I am a liability.

313
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,258
I stole money, Kris.

314
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,220
Shifted it from account to account,

315
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,471
until I could grab it.

316
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,764
Right, because if you...

317
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,099
I lost my broker's license...

318
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,226
and they covered for me.

319
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,979
But if I was anybody else I would be in prison.

320
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,106
So I am lucky to have this job.

321
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,152
When you walk into that hotel...

322
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,820
you're going to know.

323
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,864
When you walk into that
banquet, you're going to know.

324
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,824
Because everybody there knows.

325
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,242
And they look at me in a certain way,

326
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,077
and they talk to me in a certain way.

327
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,496
In a way that you don't look at me yet.

328
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,626
That was smart.

329
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,506
To wait to tell me.

330
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,845
I'm sorry.

331
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,852
Think you might be using that wrong.

332
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,315
Which direction is this?
Is that east?

333
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,818
You can see the whole city from up here.

334
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,927
I think I might be pregnant.

335
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,831
Won't let anyone near them.

336
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,042
They just crowd back in the corner.

337
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,086
Violent.

338
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,171
Oh yes, she's got a litter on the way.

339
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,965
They can get very protective.

340
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,467
Never seen the parents behave so.

341
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,470
Just never had them break my damn fence.

342
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,723
There's a fellow down the
road buys them from me.

343
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,975
Well, if you need another buyer,
I know some petting farms.

344
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,143
They'd love to have some piglets.

345
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,062
Okay, sure, sure, thanks so much.

346
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,693
First off, you're not pregnant.

347
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,945
No, I did a test. I am.

348
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,489
The HCG in your blood tells us you're not.

349
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,991
And that's more definitive.

350
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,160
Okay.

351
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,705
Now, you didn't list it in your
questionnaire, but...

352
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,125
have you had any surgical
procedures in your pelvic area?

353
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,211
Maybe a cyst was removed or a biopsy?

354
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,844
I'd say post cancer.

355
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,014
This is where they removed
the tumor, this cavity.

356
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,767
She says no.

357
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:55,809
No what?

358
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,644
Someone was in there.

359
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,856
Trauma here, and...

360
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,941
How are you supposed to help someone like that?

361
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,829
By all appearances you're a survivor

362
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,456
of stage three endometrial cancer.

363
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,500
The good news is that there isn't any sign

364
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,419
of any remaining carcinoma.

365
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,047
Lab shows that you're in no immediate danger.

366
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,052
The trauma it left behind is significant.

367
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,098
Well, I'm saying two things.

368
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,101
It is highly unlikely given
the state of the organs

369
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,812
that you could ever become pregnant.

370
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,858
If by some miracle you were to conceive,

371
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,652
the faculties are too damaged
to carry a baby full term.

372
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,130
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.

373
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,841
Krissy?

374
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,052
Krissy? Krissy!

375
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,887
Where'd you go?

376
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:55,888
Something happened to me...

377
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:56,722
I was looking for you!

378
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,140
Something bad happened to me.

379
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,141
I know that, I don't care.

380
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,267
No you don't know!

381
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,435
I don't even know what happened.

382
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,352
I can't see my niece and nephews and...

383
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,770
Kris, why?

384
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,355
Why? What are you talking about?

385
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,148
I have to go there.

386
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,316
Okay, listen to me.

387
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,984
I want to, I want to marry you.

388
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,152
I'm married to you right now.

389
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,153
I need a car.

390
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,446
I'm marrying you, today.
Do you understand?

391
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,283
Yes. We'll get a car.

392
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,118
Today.

393
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,876
Do you know this place?

394
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,590
I want to say yes.

395
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,175
For you.

396
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,927
I want to.

397
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:39,056
Is there, is there a direction that you feel

398
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,099
that you're more drawn to?

399
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,726
I don't know.
Is there one you feel drawn to?

400
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,729
I say right.

401
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,314
Left.

402
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,815
You sure?

403
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,650
No.

404
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,152
Then let's go right.

405
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,154
I'm going to go wherever you go.

406
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,324
You know that.

407
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,203
I feel like you know.

408
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,216
We should go on a trip.

409
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,886
Get somewhere.

410
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,972
Where would we go?

411
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,307
Somewhere bright.

412
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,191
They could be starlings.

413
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,193
They could be starlings.

414
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,071
When I was little, my
friend Renny would come over

415
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,239
and I'd get really mad

416
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,241
because every time my Mom would bake cookies...

417
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,367
I knew a kid called Renny...

418
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,743
...he'd eat them all.

419
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,953
...this fat kid

420
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,038
He was fat, my neighbor Renny.

421
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,415
I told you this story

422
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,666
Is lunch ready?

423
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,754
Doesn't it look an improvement?

424
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,592
It's much better.

425
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,385
Much better right?

426
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,511
I guess so.

427
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,597
Who said that?

428
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,764
Who said that?

429
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,182
Who said they were Grackles?

430
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,267
Grackles.

431
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,268
They could be starlings.

432
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,269
They could be starlings.

433
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,271
So I was really excited to go swimming.

434
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,272
Yeah.

435
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,315
And he didn't even have a chance to tell me

436
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,858
that there was bird shit all over the slide,

437
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,276
so I went down anyway.

438
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,402
Wait.

439
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,278
Renny.

440
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:16,778
Right.

441
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:17,988
My neighbor.

442
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,406
You're tell- you're
doing it again.

443
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,574
You're doing it again.

444
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,367
The kid almost drowned me.

445
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,749
We should go on a trip.

446
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,627
Get somewhere.

447
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,590
Where would we go?

448
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,300
To Vermont?

449
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,012
That place that you know?

450
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:43,847
Maybe.

451
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,311
How do you get there?

452
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,147
Renny used to come over and eat
all the chocolate chip cookies

453
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,315
No, no, no I'm talking about a different one.

454
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,608
Renny is my friend.

455
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,734
With the pool and the slide.

456
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,111
With the pool and tried to drown me, yes,

457
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,906
I tell you a story and then you've taken it

458
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,325
and you've made it your own,
you do this all the time.

459
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,118
How do you get there?

460
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,497
The place where you and your family you'd go

461
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,374
on vacation in Vermont?

462
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,125
You drive Kris.

463
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,086
What road would you take?

464
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,337
I would have to get a map.

465
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,005
You don't remember?

466
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,091
It's just some country road.

467
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,425
I was six.

468
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,137
No I was six.

469
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,347
I told you that story.

470
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,973
No you didn't, no.

471
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,558
Yes, he held me under remember,

472
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,976
he held me under water.

473
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,355
So I'm not allowed to talk about my childhood?

474
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,940
Talk all you want, just don't talk about mine.

475
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:35,857
You think it's your childhood?

476
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:36,900
What about the trampoline?

477
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,276
With Mick?

478
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,152
No, that's you, that's yours.

479
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,362
That's me, thank you for that.

480
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:40,987
What about Renny?

481
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:41,530
No.

482
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,364
Almost drowned me?

483
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,573
Then lied to my mom about it?

484
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,449
No that's mine.

485
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,534
That's you, right, okay

486
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,535
That happened to me!

487
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,953
Kris!

488
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,247
Not only that but you're also
trying to tell me that

489
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,382
They could be starlings.

490
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,301
They could be starlings.

491
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,774
Ring.

492
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,722
where are you?

493
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,890
I don't know.

494
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,475
I can't find them anywhere.

495
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,476
Can't find who?
Where are you?

496
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,810
I know they're here.

497
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:46,853
I can feel them here.

498
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:47,896
I can't find them.

499
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,731
I've been looking everywhere for them.

500
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,357
Are there three windows?

501
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:51,900
Yeah.

502
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:52,650
Two doors?

503
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,359
Uh huh.

504
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,694
Go in the one on the right.

505
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,821
It's just a room.

506
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:57,864
No it's a passage.

507
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,032
Go to the other side you're going through.

508
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,577
Now what?

509
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,953
- You in the room
- Yes.

510
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,288
- Is there a chair on the right?
- Yes.

511
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,748
Fire extinguishers yes?

512
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,749
Yeah.

513
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:08,750
There should be a door in front of you,

514
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,043
a gray door, go through that.

515
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,337
Go past the columns then

516
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,463
look for a door on the left,

517
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,339
the next one, the next one.

518
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,757
Go down two flights of stairs.

519
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,883
Take the elevator.

520
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,516
Come on let's go.

521
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,059
Why were you at my work?

522
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,686
I didn't know I was.

523
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,773
What are we doing?
Where are we going, home?

524
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,651
Kris? Where are we going, home?

525
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,361
Kris, home?

526
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:37,904
Yeah, home.

527
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,046
"Oh husband," replied his wife.

528
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,256
Do you hear that?

529
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,050
Hear what?

530
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,469
There's like a...

531
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,598
There's this sound coming
from underneath the house.

532
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,772
I don't hear anything.

533
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,065
It's really high pitched.

534
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,484
You're scaring me a little bit.

535
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,288
Kris, it's an old house.

536
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,165
There's nine things in this
house that sound like that.

537
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,501
Can you just, can you just
go in there, just go in there

538
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:44,460
I'm going to go in.

539
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,378
Thank you.

540
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,088
I haven't slept at all.

541
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,507
I'm sorry. It's really...

542
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,843
You don't believe me.
I'm not lying.

543
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,094
I may have...

544
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:55,054
I think I...

545
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,600
There's a weird flowing sound.

546
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,062
Right through the main, whatever this thing is.

547
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,105
The pipe.

548
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,692
But it's not what you're doing.
It's like low.

549
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,610
You know what I'm saying?

550
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,321
It's both, it's both those sounds.

551
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,699
It's both low and high at the same time.

552
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:15,908
No.

553
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,118
Yeah.

554
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:17,994
No, you...

555
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:22,623
Yeah, it's like a low and high.

556
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,836
It's like low and high.

557
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,902
Kris?

558
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,288
What are you doing here?

559
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,498
I love to be alone.

560
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,543
You love what?

561
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,307
The sun is but a morning star.

562
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,517
What'd you say?

563
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,529
The wildest sound ever
heard makes the woods ring far

564
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:42,323
and wide.

565
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,424
Faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear.

566
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,432
Their roots reaching quite under the house.

567
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,564
Fearing that they
would be light-headed.

568
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,775
For want of food and also sleep.

569
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,235
Light-headed?

570
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:27,159
Prevailing blue mixed with yellow of the sand.

571
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,704
Sunshine is the color of the water.

572
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:33,374
I used to wonder at the halo
of light around my shadow

573
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,335
And fancied myself one of the elect.

574
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,698
Economy.

575
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,828
When I wrote the following pages, or rather,

576
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,246
the bulk of them

577
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:58,542
I lived alone in the woods, a
mile from any neighbor,

578
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,003
in a house which I had
built myself, on the shore

579
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,464
on the shore of Walden Pond.

580
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:10,596
And earned my living
by the labor of my hands only.

581
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,892
I lived there for two years and two months.

582
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,771
At present I am a sojourner
of civilized life again.

583
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,486
He heard a low and distant sound.

584
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:26,904
But grand, and impressive.

585
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,823
Unlike anything he had ever heard.

586
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,491
Gradually swelling and increasing.

587
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:34,119
As if it would have a
universal and memorable ending.

588
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,497
Asullen rush and roar.

589
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,669
The rays which stream through the shutter

590
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,295
will be no longer remembered

591
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:44,505
when the shutter is wholly removed.

592
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,509
The finest qualities of our nature,

593
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:51,011
like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved.

594
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,222
A stream flowing out in that direction

595
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,723
through a wooded valley.

596
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,600
But stream there was none.

597
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,936
I am glad to have drunk water so long.

598
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,522
For the same reason that
