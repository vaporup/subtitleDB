1
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,457
Rise and shine!

2
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,047
Come down to earth

3
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,757
Come on
you lazy girl, get up!

4
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,056
Ah, Ah
wake up!

5
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:29,960
Hey!
you, drop it

6
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:31,055
Hey!

7
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:39,267
No way!
No running, I told you.

8
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,233
Your asthma might relapse!

9
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,118
Holy cow!
Stop tormenting your sister.

10
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,719
Ouch!
This is some morning.

11
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:03,423
Here we go again!

12
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,728
Back on your computer again?

13
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:09,429
It's mine.
I won it in a raffle.

14
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,439
Right, and you
keep it all to yourself.

15
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:15,465
Perhaps I'll throw it out soon.

16
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,139
Mom, get me a piano.
A piano!

17
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:26,647
How about a tutu?

18
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,850
I need one for the ballet recital.

19
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,755
No way.
Keep the old one!

20
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,522
- No. I want a pretty new one!
- Be quiet!

21
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,274
Oh, my god!

22
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:01,918
I need to pee, dad.

23
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Bye, darling.

24
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,024
Don't lose any more buttons!

25
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,307
Jadoo!

26
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:42,858
Better just to sell the shares
and take the hit.

27
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,458
Yes. Sell them this afternoon.
Sure.

28
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,664
This is Chulsoo Lee
at Core Securities.

29
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:54,174
Sure, I'll be right there.

30
00:04:57,712 --> 00:04:58,974
This is the BN System schedule.

31
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:02,811
Some major players
and fund managers are on it secretly.

32
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:05,410
You should get to it.

33
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,017
Would manipulation be necessary?

34
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,418
No choice!

35
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,420
The juicy details will be out in a week.
Keep buying for the clients.

36
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,463
- Recommend it to some market makers!
- This is...

37
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:23,536
Head Office is watching this.

38
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:25,129
There'll be a big bonus.

39
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:31,934
You have four kids.
Aren't you going to send them to college?

40
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:37,951
Hi!

41
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:43,150
Hi, what are you doing here?

42
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,158
Having dinner with a school friend.

43
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:50,457
Is he your client?

44
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:51,658
You know him?

45
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,167
Who doesn't?
He's the big tuna!

46
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:58,160
Thanks to his rich father-in-law.

47
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:03,268
Then again, 90% of his assets
belong to his wife.

48
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:05,705
He's just fronting.

49
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:06,610
Really!

50
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:09,807
Where's MY father-in-law?

51
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:15,215
How's your wife?

52
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,120
She SHOULD be doing fine.

53
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,424
We got a divorce.
Last month.

54
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:28,030
After 20 years of marriage,
some irreconcilable differences!

55
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,230
Nothing but bickering.

56
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,936
How about you?
on every Wednesday night?

57
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,543
Well...

58
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,950
Time for the Wal-Mart
special of the day.

59
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:48,443
Fresh octopus on sale
for 4,000 won, half price!

60
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,649
I've got to run!

61
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,513
I got it first.

62
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,112
I picked it up first.

63
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,218
Right? It's mine.

64
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:24,424
She got it first.

65
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,726
Donkey face!

66
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,434
Hello!

67
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,438
Hi, how are you?

68
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:42,670
My goodness! Did you get hurt?
Are you alright?

69
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,546
Don't forget this octopus.
Come on.

70
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:52,745
Have a good day!

71
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:02,388
What did the general
manager say?

72
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,700
Four kids, how are you going to send
them to university?

73
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:11,402
Same old lines.
So, what did you say?

74
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,600
No more manipulation!
I'd rather be fired!

75
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:23,913
That's what I wanted to say,
but I couldn't.

76
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:28,521
Are you going to?

77
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,524
The market will get better.
Let's not be greedy.

78
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,425
Yes! We need principles,
at least minimal ones.

79
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:37,624
Unanimous!
Revolution completed!

80
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:40,133
To our lasting pledge!

81
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,292
Cool!

82
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:52,940
Dear God,
thanks for the Pentium III you provided.

83
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,041
I'm enjoying it. Be merciful and send me
a new computer to complete your love.

84
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,179
Amen.

85
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:25,111
Daddy!

86
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,411
Not tonight.
It's Wednesday!

87
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:34,412
- Honey!
- yes?

88
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:37,015
Did we pay the monthly assessment?
I don't see the receipt.

89
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:40,618
We switched to automatic debit
on that one, remember?

90
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:45,530
Right.
Hon, right there!

91
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,830
Yeah, there?

92
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,154
Do you like doing it with me?

93
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:17,461
My saggy breasts, stomach,
I've changed.

94
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:21,664
A little bit, and the belly.

95
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:22,964
Thanks!

96
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,475
Don't like it?
I like it!

97
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,076
Darling, you want to
make another baby?

98
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:36,082
Are you out of your mind?

99
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:41,076
Younghee Kim!
That'll be the right thing to do
for the Kim family with not many children.

100
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:43,885
Just one more, okay?

101
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:46,984
How about two more
for a volleyball team?

102
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:48,494
There's an idea.

103
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,191
Nonsense!
Nonsense!

104
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:52,698
Stop it.

105
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,201
Not there.

106
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:04,942
I miss Besame Mucho.

107
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,139
The cafe in the country side?

108
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,445
Where we first met!

109
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:13,146
I doubt it's still there.
That was a long time ago.

110
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:13,949
It was!

111
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,974
BN System concludes a contract on
technology transfer with the S Tech, U.S..

112
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:42,778
Here's correspondent
Sungchul Kim

113
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,477
With the details.

114
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,976
With the deal completed
BN System

115
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,479
expects over
$10 million in royalties.

116
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,689
The company
also plans to attract

117
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,493
additional contracts with other int'l

118
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,932
industry leaders
on the technology transfer.

119
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,732
The deal is about to be
completed after their continued

120
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,432
efforts for the last six months.

121
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,048
Shares for BN System?
That'll be hard...

122
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,450
Mr. Kim, this is Chulsoo Lee.

123
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:23,752
What do we do?
We can ignore Mr. Jung's request...

124
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,452
Not on BN System.
No way.

125
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:31,556
Of course,
the price will go up further.

126
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,463
Sell them now.

127
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,967
Please listen to me!

128
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,765
This is confidential information.

129
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,464
Buy as much as you can.

130
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,473
Please don't be greedy!

131
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:43,874
What's wrong with you.
All the others except you

132
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:44,878
...recommend it strongly...

133
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:46,775
I've got to be going.

134
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,574
- What happened?
- What?

135
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:53,586
What happened
to your minimal principles?

136
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,678
I was drunk...

137
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:55,779
Don't take seriously.

138
00:12:56,823 --> 00:13:00,520
What did you say?

139
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,529
What's all this?

140
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:05,726
A word of advice!
Shoot straight!

141
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,629
Just like computers,

142
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,830
Life should be upgraded.

143
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,431
How long are you going to stick
to your lousy sense of justice?

144
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:17,937
Chulsoo.

145
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,036
Let me, let me!

146
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,446
Please calm down.

147
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:24,143
Please calm down.

148
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,655
This reflects your
performance this month.

149
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:30,452
You don't think you can stay?

150
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:35,560
Head Office recommended
someone to take over.

151
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,154
This'll be your last week.

152
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,466
I don't understand.

153
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,468
If you can't do it,

154
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,663
you should quit.
This is so unreasonable.

155
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,469
Head Office wanted this done

156
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,668
and you didn't join us.

157
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,725
I am so sorry.

158
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:47,057
Dad!

159
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,465
Daddy!

160
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:49,969
Come here,
my precious ones!

161
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,061
Not until after dinner.

162
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:53,768
What's the occasion?

163
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,468
It's not mom's birthday yet.

164
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,410
What do we have here?

165
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:01,414
It's from your friend...

166
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:05,406
Jinsuk?
He sent this?

167
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,511
We have no room for this.
Send it back.

168
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:10,022
No! The piano is mine!

169
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,924
Play some!
If you're good, we'll keep it.

170
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:22,535
Dad.

171
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:37,047
- Come on, darling!
- No.

172
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,551
Come on.

173
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:39,643
And turn...
Haeoh.

174
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,257
Click!

175
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,963
- When does the picture come out?
- I am not sure.

176
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:01,497
My little sweetie!

177
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,805
- Dig in, Jioh!
- Yes.

178
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,106
How come you
don't eat octopus?

179
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,410
She doesn't.
Because she's fussy.

180
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,211
Settle down, kids.

181
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,716
- Want some more rice?
- Fill it to the brim with rice!

182
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,427
Perhaps I should quit my job

183
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,828
and open a restaurant.
l mean with your cooking skills!

184
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:25,832
Don't even think it!

185
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:48,147
- What are you doing?
- Keeping household accounts.

186
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,960
We're loaded!

187
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:00,091
One more payment left on
your dead brother's debts.

188
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,897
After that, we'll keep saving
and move into a 3 bedroom

189
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,904
apartment in 2 years.

190
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:08,396
Thank god all the
payments are made.

191
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,805
At least, I've been bringing home
a fat paycheck.

192
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:16,009
- It didn't take too long.
- True.

193
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,422
What's this?
No name on it?

194
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,219
Give it back to me!

195
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,527
Some secret account of your own?

196
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:30,427
Give it back.
Give it back to me!

197
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,399
Hey, I want to see it.

198
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:35,628
Stop it!

199
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:45,502
Aah! Stop it!

200
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,038
You really like free stuff!

201
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:52,051
God is with me.
He answers my prayers.

202
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:55,851
God must be bored these days.

203
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,481
Could you be more attentive?

204
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,188
I AM!

205
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,688
- Did you call for Chinese noodles?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,366
Too much dust.
Wear this.

207
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:17,809
I think I have a problem.
I keep coughing.

208
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:20,369
You have your God!

209
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,608
Stop the nonsense and polish this.

210
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,011
Hey you!
You clean yours!

211
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:30,923
Don't call him "Hey". Show some respect.
He's your older brother.

212
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:40,923
Dear God
Let me get out of this hell.

213
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,834
I need rest
and peace of mind most.

214
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,738
Let my parents love only me.
and let me grow up soon

215
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:50,743
And marry Ricky Martin!
Amen.

216
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,915
Chinese food is here!

217
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:49,433
- Is this the
residence of Mr. Chulsoo Lee?
- Yes?

218
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:53,530
We're from the Court Office.
Were you a guarantor for Mr. Kang??

219
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,742
Yes.

220
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:59,643
Mr. Kang defaulted on a note for
700 million won and disappeared.

221
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,945
According to the Civil Law 527,
Article 611, your property

222
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,042
And possessions are seized

223
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,255
What's all this about?
Seizure?

224
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:15,158
Didn't you receive
the repayment notice?

225
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:18,460
From now on,
you're not to remove those
seizure stickers off of the subject items.

226
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,864
That's illegal and you will be
prosecuted accordingly.

227
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:26,664
In case you don't pay it all
back by the 12th of next month,

228
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,765
...this apartment will be auctioned off.

229
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,072
Can you repay the debt now?

230
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,677
- We'll proceed according to the law.
- You go away.

231
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,456
No. You've got the wrong house.

232
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,858
This must be a mistake.

233
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:24,159
This is the right house
madam.

234
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:24,856
No!

235
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:47,346
What are we going to do?

236
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,857
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

237
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:56,655
You even got fired!

238
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:03,101
It'll take 30 years
to come up with that kind of money.

239
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,597
How will you get
the money in one

240
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,198
month?

241
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:17,606
You're insane.
You must be, doing all this!

242
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:25,816
You be nice to
your dad from now on.

243
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,528
Don't ask him for money or toys
I won't allow it.

244
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:32,531
Come and talk to me instead.

245
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:33,725
We already do.

246
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:38,836
I'll start working tomorrow.
You have to get ready
for school for yourself.

247
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:41,432
No more newspaper,
milk, and yogurt!

248
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:42,736
No more private lessons!

249
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:44,334
Really?
I don't have to take my lessons?

250
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:45,742
But I still want to go
to my ballet lessons.

251
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,145
- Listen to me!
- No, I'll keep going there.

252
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,149
You're so immature.

253
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,845
I got the leading role
in our ballet presentation.

254
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:02,889
It must have been hard
for you to bring this up.

255
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:12,802
I'd like to and should
lend you the money.

256
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,309
But I don't have any.
I'm not any better off. Sorry.

257
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,309
No, I am sorry.

258
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:25,514
You sound just the same.

259
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,213
How have you been?

260
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:35,116
That much money made
on real state?

261
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,423
Turn it down!

262
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:42,628
And? That's just great...

263
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:43,226
Turn it down! By the way

264
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:50,336
Can you lend me some money?

265
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,745
Bitch. Didn't I lend her money

266
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,443
For her sick child?

267
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:10,094
Hello!

268
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:14,393
Did you move?
What?

269
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:20,799
You want the police
to come after you?

270
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:25,602
My god, get in there!

271
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:27,808
Mom, she started it!

272
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,405
No more. Go to your room.

273
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:35,309
As you know,
I was never a good student.

274
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:41,817
And now, a lot of MBA holders
from the U.S. are working under me.

275
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,126
What good is it to become
the top of the class in school?

276
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,224
That's why I don't pressure
my kids to study.

277
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:51,431
They can just play
computer games.

278
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:54,832
And if they're good,
I'll support them fully.

279
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:57,434
Who knows? They might make
a hell of a lot money with it!

280
00:24:57,477 --> 00:24:58,341
You silly!

281
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:04,383
Taeoh.

282
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,076
Yeah, what?

283
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,383
Do you by any chance have any...?

284
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,083
Have you heard about Dongho?
He's in deep shit now!

285
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:12,284
What happened?

286
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,293
Thanks to Jinsuk Kang.

287
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,887
He lost 100 million won lent to Jinsuk.

288
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,296
Jinsuk defaulted on 700 million won.

289
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:21,095
Not everyone is cut out for business.

290
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:25,093
Anyone here lend money to Jinsuk?

291
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:26,799
No way.

292
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,101
Sit down!

293
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,301
Good to know.

294
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:30,707
Long time no see!

295
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,904
Hey, Seungmin.
Come on here.

296
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:34,106
Sure.

297
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,205
Come here.

298
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,408
I hear you're raking in money.

299
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,308
How have you been?
Good to see you

300
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:42,913
here at the alumni meeting.
How's it going?

301
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:46,119
- Okay.
- Yeah...

302
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,129
I heard you moved to
another company. Is it nice?

303
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:52,723
I'll see how it goes.
How about you?

304
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:54,323
About to quit.

305
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:57,427
Been setting up my own business.

306
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,835
Your own business?

307
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:02,068
Online securities company
and I'm a bit short of money.

308
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:07,670
Seungmin, do you have any spare money?
About 50 million won.

309
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:11,172
- What's happened to you?
- What?

310
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:14,379
At least, you didn't lie before.

311
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:20,086
- What do you mean?
- I know you got fired yesterday.

312
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:28,390
This is crazy. My former coworker
will be your replacement.

313
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,513
Crazy. On top of everything else,
coming home like this!

314
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:52,518
Jioh, Jioh!
I've got pizza for you.

315
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:58,522
Youndoo, Jadoo wake up!

316
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:06,372
You stink!

317
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,566
Your beard, so rough!

318
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:14,073
You must be enjoying this.
Go brush your teeth and get to bed!

319
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,178
Yeah.

320
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:26,589
Ouch! Ouch!

321
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:30,091
Couldn't you just come home safe?

322
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,598
My hands are full with
four kids as they are!

323
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:38,197
Stupid to get hurt!

324
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:00,757
Delicious?

325
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:05,556
Yummy?

326
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,565
Yeah.

327
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,567
Good!

328
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,775
Stop it.
I already know how you feel.

329
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:26,882
I closed the savings account today.
27 million won. 100 million won to go.

330
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,585
Don't be so weak.
I know you are strong.

331
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:42,094
Kids.

332
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,501
No one can force us to leave.

333
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:48,200
No one is going to force us to leave.
Because I am Chulsoo Lee!

334
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,902
They can't fucking break me!

335
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,204
Honey.

336
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:55,203
Jioh, Haeoh I can still run.

337
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:58,217
I can still run
I can run.

338
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:02,551
I'm going to fucking run.
Fuck.

339
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,052
Honey!

340
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,058
Daddy!

341
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm not with the company,
but I'd like to continue
to manage your shares.

342
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:32,284
I won't disappoint you.
Trust me.

343
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:34,347
Thanks but no thanks.

344
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:37,185
No investment
without reliable information.

345
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:40,587
I'm confident.
Trust me!

346
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:44,084
Information is the key factor.

347
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,291
I need juicy tips to trust you.

348
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,302
For example,
tips on BN System.

349
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:57,400
You've changed a lot.

350
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:59,809
Time has passed.
<20day before repayment deadline>

351
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:03,508
I was hesitant about coming here.
First time since high school.

352
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:07,315
What if you don't recognize me?

353
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:09,821
You look just the same.
Haven't changed one bit.

354
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:16,418
I read the article on your donations
to schools. A pleasant surprise.

355
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:19,722
And I remembered the old days.

356
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:23,826
Remember I was pursuing you
for three years?

357
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:27,828
Long letters to you were never
answered. Not even a glance at me.

358
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:31,438
I'm sorry about those days.

359
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,441
That's in the past.

360
00:30:41,387 --> 00:30:44,447
- Are you married?
- Yeah,

361
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,958
- Kids?
- Four.

362
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:50,759
What does your husband do?

363
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:55,463
Used to work for a securities company.
He lost his job.

364
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,100
I have a favor to ask you.
I know this is too much to ask.

365
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:10,804
But I know you from school,
and maybe there's hope.

366
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:17,411
My husband cosigned for
someone who defaulted.

367
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:19,617
Our apartment is slipping away.
100 million won will save it.

368
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,229
Pardon me, sir.

369
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:30,133
Your appointment is at 3 at the
Hotel Shilla. Better get going

370
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,136
I know.

371
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,938
I'm sorry, we didn't even have
coffee together.

372
00:31:35,975 --> 00:31:38,239
That's all right.

373
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:40,438
Leave your number
and I'll call you.

374
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:54,859
You hit me!

375
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,094
How dare you?

376
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:04,796
Shut up! You four kids
are ganging up on my son.

377
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,600
He did it first,
he did....

378
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,106
The son of a bitch said
we are beggars. Come on!

379
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,107
What, son of a bitch?

380
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:12,806
What's wrong with you?

381
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:16,414
We're not beggars!

382
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:20,715
My mom said so. That you beggars
will be thrown out of your house.
Didn't you, mom?

383
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:23,415
Who called us beggars?

384
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,718
Mom.

385
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:26,720
Stop crying.

386
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:40,337
I know this is too much to ask....

387
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:43,638
But can I see the plans?

388
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:46,545
That's not possible.

389
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:47,841
Please!

390
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,849
I'll pretend I never heard this.

391
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:54,148
I still respect you.

392
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:28,914
After paying my brother's debts,
I thought we'd be better off.

393
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:32,522
I am really sorry.

394
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,319
sorry...

395
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:42,123
What have we done to
deserve this?

396
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:57,546
No choice.
This is our reality.

397
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:01,179
We could rent a small room.

398
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,079
I'll check it up
with the real estate agent.

399
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:06,282
I won't move out of this house.

400
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,890
I earned it.

401
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,489
Our first child Eunoh died of asthma
in a small basement-level studio.

402
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:21,295
I was using the sewing machine,
dusting the place, while he was dying

403
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,602
of pneumonia.

404
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:28,607
Just to make a few more bucks.
My heart was torn when
we scattered his ashes into the river.

405
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,107
To me, this house means him.

406
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,621
I'll never lose any of
our children again.

407
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:46,123
I cancelled everything but the
insurance policy for their future.

408
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,223
Can you make
the payment tomorrow?

409
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:16,089
You're so immature.

410
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:18,187
Do you think mom will be happy
with a birthday gift now?

411
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,292
What do we do then?

412
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,699
Lottery tickets naturally.

413
00:35:23,736 --> 00:35:25,704
Win two 50 million won prizes,

414
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:27,205
and we won't have to move.

415
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,900
That's not easy.

416
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:32,104
God never disappointed me.

417
00:35:32,144 --> 00:35:34,408
Always answers my prayers.

418
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:35,504
That's true.

419
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,516
I don't like that.

420
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,714
How about a vote?
It's split one to one between us.
You decide Youndoo.

421
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:45,212
What do you think?
Move into a tiny basement apartment
with no room for your piano?

422
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:46,417
No!

423
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,618
Your choice!

424
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:00,160
Hands up!

425
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:04,075
Who told you to break
your piggybank?

426
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,475
And didn't even won 1,000 won.

427
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,585
Hello?
ls this Ms. Kim's house?

428
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:17,782
Yes.

429
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:18,881
A package for you.

430
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:20,289
Please sign here.

431
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,607
Pretty shoes.

432
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,208
Mom,
did daddy send all this?

433
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,809
It must be for mom's birthday.

434
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:50,117
Keep your hands up!
Come on!

435
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:37,893
How did you like the opera?

436
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:43,898
Well, it's been a while.

437
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:46,496
You used to like it.

438
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,505
Did I?

439
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,100
Madam Butterfly was a true story
included in an American magazine.

440
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:57,309
A play writer called David something
adapted it for stage and Puccini
made it into an opera.

441
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,046
I used to listen to it
a lot back in high school.

442
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,251
I've been forgetting about it.

443
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:13,258
I'd never thought I could
see you again. If you hadn't come

444
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,767
we would have never met again.
I'm glad you still look
pretty much the same.

445
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,769
It's nice to be rich.

446
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:36,087
You said you need money?

447
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,397
Thank you.

448
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,897
It might take a while
but I'll pay it back.

449
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:53,099
What's your account number?

450
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,196
I don't need money.

451
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,400
No, that's not right.
It's a big sum.

452
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:57,203
It's all right.

453
00:39:57,242 --> 00:39:58,709
No, I can pay it back.

454
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:02,271
Don't.
I want something else instead.

455
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:05,116
You're still pretty.

456
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,320
Madam Butterfly was a geisha
selling her body.

457
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:14,121
In comparison,
this'll be the best transaction!

458
00:40:17,563 --> 00:40:20,532
I am sorry.
I asked for too much.

459
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:40,908
<17day before repayment deadline>

460
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:43,648
You are insane.

461
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,453
This'll be the last time.
Get me the data.

462
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,356
- No.
- Please!

463
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:51,453
Listen, this is so not like you.

464
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,360
What's to be like me?

465
00:40:58,203 --> 00:41:01,604
After ten years, they fired me
for being honest. My best friend

466
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:07,105
took away my house and ran away.

467
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,808
I have nothing to lose or fear.

468
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,319
My children are...
my last hope to keep.

469
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,218
I need the file.

470
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:24,321
This is the data you wanted.

471
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:28,331
2 billion won is to be used,
with 1 billion to be the expected profit.

472
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:31,333
I'd like 10% of it.

473
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,333
Those are not great terms
for me.

474
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:37,833
I could lose the capital

475
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:40,140
and you risk nothing.

476
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:43,238
I won't take a penny

477
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:45,147
if you don't get the expected profit..

478
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:56,956
Are you confident?

479
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:00,597
If I weren't,
I wouldn't have started this.

480
00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:38,968
<15day before repayment deadline>

481
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:13,530
<12day before repayment deadline>

482
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:24,713
<9day before repayment deadline>

483
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,248
This is our monthly wine club
get-together.

484
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:34,053
I told them about you,
and they are anxious to see you.

485
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:37,962
You can just have a casual talk
with them. No pressure.

486
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:39,661
Yes, sir.

487
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:42,963
The shares on Whajin
Tech seem stagnant.

488
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,265
We've got the shares,

489
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:49,171
and necessary data.
No need to worry.

490
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,072
Are you wearing some perfume?
Nice!

491
00:43:53,712 --> 00:43:54,679
My usual.

492
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:58,073
What fragrance do you like,
Mr. Lee?

493
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,528
You look better.

494
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,130
Have some more.

495
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:22,235
Hello!

496
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:26,142
Mr. Jang, this is Mr. Lee
I told you about.

497
00:44:26,178 --> 00:44:27,543
Mr. Lee, this is our
corporate lawyer.

498
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,740
Hello, how are you?
I'm Chulsoo Lee.

499
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:31,248
Hi, nice to meet you.

500
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:31,942
Hello!

501
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,450
Hello!
Hi!

502
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:34,247
Is Chairman Kim here?

503
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:36,151
He's waiting for you.
Come this way.

504
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:09,011
0, 1, 6

505
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:11,413
Hey, you're still up?

506
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,121
A lullaby? You said you
don't like it any more.

507
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:22,524
I see.

508
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:30,931
Rock a bye baby,

509
00:45:32,277 --> 00:45:37,146
in the tree top,

510
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:44,751
when the wind blows,

511
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:51,552
the cradle will rock ....

512
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:10,510
You weren't around.
Where were you?

513
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:12,710
I was resting in the den.

514
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:15,519
Should have rested at home.

515
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:18,220
It was a party for couples.

516
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:23,621
Plus I got to talk with Mr. Lee.

517
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:26,521
Mrs. Lee,

518
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:27,930
somebody left this for you

519
00:46:27,966 --> 00:46:29,433
He asked me to hand it to you.

520
00:46:30,268 --> 00:46:32,429
Thank you.

521
00:46:45,784 --> 00:46:47,149
What's the meaning of this?

522
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:52,045
They are the keys to my house.
Whenever you are ready.

523
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,651
I'm not that kind!
Don't do this again.

524
00:46:58,997 --> 00:47:01,488
- Honey...
- Yeah?

525
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:05,127
Nothing.

526
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:09,100
One week left!

527
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:21,916
Don't worry.
I'll keep this house no matter what.

528
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:41,537
I already know!
But you're the only one to turn to.

529
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:45,838
Please, this'll be the last time.

530
00:47:45,877 --> 00:47:50,246
Are you listening?
Are you still there?

531
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:52,648
Can you hear me?

532
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,382
<7day before repayment deadline>

533
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:12,901
It's me. Couldn't reach
you at work or your home.

534
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:16,600
Where are you now?
Call me once you get this message.

535
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,108
Please!

536
00:48:23,048 --> 00:48:27,212
My husband told me
you're having a hard time at home.

537
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,216
Will get better thanks to you.

538
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:32,616
Thanks for the other day.

539
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:36,017
I didn't see anything.

540
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:43,300
Nobody else knows about it,
right?

541
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:57,641
No one's around here.

542
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:09,487
- Don't do this to me.
- It's all right.

543
00:49:39,157 --> 00:49:44,424
Things are going well.
Do you want to stop?

544
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:42,577
Why didn't you tell me?

545
00:50:44,722 --> 00:50:47,088
You are as honest as one
an ever be.

546
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:50,288
That's why you were fired.

547
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:53,491
Why would you not tell me?

548
00:50:54,532 --> 00:50:57,990
If I did, would you
be able to resolve it?

549
00:50:58,703 --> 00:51:00,830
We are husband and wife.

550
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:03,033
I quit it.

551
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:06,043
I'm not in it any more.
Stop it!

552
00:51:10,982 --> 00:51:13,246
Why should I give you the share?

553
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,945
Who else would compensate me?

554
00:51:14,986 --> 00:51:16,453
My husband hired you.

555
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,149
You caused all this.

556
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:20,749
All right. l'll take care of it.
Quiet down.

557
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:24,857
How will you handle it?

558
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,856
You were getting 10% from him.

559
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,662
I can give you 20%.

560
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:33,568
Are you joking?

561
00:51:34,506 --> 00:51:36,565
Does it matter whose money
you use for the investment?

562
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,478
I'll advance you 100 million won.

563
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:43,077
Take me to your house.

564
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,476
I want to do it in your bed.

565
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,887
- You're insane.
- Correct.

566
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:57,190
I've got to be insane to make
such an offer to someone like you!

567
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:04,358
<5day before repayment deadline>

568
00:52:52,317 --> 00:52:53,477
Eight and...

569
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:58,683
one, and two, and

570
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:02,117
three, and four...

571
00:53:30,288 --> 00:53:33,951
What happened?

572
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:36,756
She's been watching us
from outside the windows for days.

573
00:53:36,794 --> 00:53:38,955
I asked her in. Severely asthmatic.
I had no idea.

574
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:43,058
She seems stressed out.

575
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:46,969
She should stay here for a few days
till her breathing becomes stable.

576
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:48,563
Doctor, will she be all right?

577
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:57,174
What happened?
Where's Youndo?

578
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:58,773
She's hospitalized.

579
00:53:58,816 --> 00:54:00,807
Where are you going?

580
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:04,413
To get the money. We can't just let
her slip away like our first son.

581
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:15,227
Did you have lunch?

582
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,234
I don't care about lunch now.

583
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:19,429
How could you eat
at a time like this?

584
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,938
If only you hadn't lost the house,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

585
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:23,031
Right, it's all my fault.

586
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:24,439
Yes, it's all your fault.

587
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:26,841
That's why I'm running around
like a dog for the money.

588
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:29,439
How soon can you make
100 million won that way!

589
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,142
We have not just one,
but four kids.

590
00:54:32,183 --> 00:54:34,743
Even without the medication,
it's hard to make a living.

591
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:37,050
Do you realize how much it takes
to raise the kids?

592
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:39,056
Jioh's mom never
contributed a dollar.

593
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,059
That's enough.
The kids can hear us!

594
00:54:42,093 --> 00:54:44,459
Where are your buddies?

595
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:46,963
Where are your school friends

596
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:49,159
when we're struggling like this?

597
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,963
You've done so much for them!

598
00:54:51,002 --> 00:54:54,062
Okay, I'll be back with the money.
I'll do anything to get it!
Do whatever it takes!

599
00:54:58,209 --> 00:55:01,701
This policy will mature this month.
Why not wait for it?

600
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:04,608
I know. I'd just like to
close the account.

601
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,710
Did you bring the fees
for the organ test?

602
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:20,121
The surgery will take 3 to 4 hours,

603
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:23,622
...and you'll be hospitalized
for 3 weeks

604
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:26,432
I want to be upfront about this.

605
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:30,832
A healthy person can survive

606
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,843
with only one kidney.

607
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:36,745
However, some complications

608
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:39,841
may occur after the surgery.

609
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:54,562
I'll call you
about the results tomorrow.

610
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:07,411
Hello!

611
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:12,213
Hello!

612
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:29,128
The results are due today.

613
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,431
I've been waiting for two hours.

614
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:33,937
I still haven't heard from you.

615
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:37,737
Call me at the coffee house
when you get this message.

616
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:39,242
I'll be waiting.

617
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:55,385
<3day before repayment deadline>

618
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:10,999
Can we talk?

619
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:16,997
Is this because
he's not your real son?

620
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:18,909
Chulsoo!

621
00:58:19,043 --> 00:58:20,908
He's no blood relation to you.

622
00:58:20,945 --> 00:58:23,209
But, to me, he's like my own son.
Don't you remember

623
00:58:23,247 --> 00:58:25,408
What my brother said when dying?

624
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:28,810
I've done my share.

625
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,218
Money, money, money.

626
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:34,224
He must have been driven
to the edge.

627
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:38,126
Right! That's what I thought, too.

628
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:39,629
His friends made fun
of him being poor.

629
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:42,224
He must have felt terrible!

630
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:52,131
Is this you, Jioh?
I know...

631
00:58:52,176 --> 00:58:55,043
...yes...
I know

632
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,777
On the 12th, 12th. Yes,
I fully understand.

633
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:03,684
I'll pay it back even if
I have to rob your bank. Okay?

634
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,405
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

635
00:59:35,453 --> 00:59:37,216
Who's that, mom?

636
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:40,421
Do you know him?

637
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,726
No, I don't know him.

638
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,728
Let's get in.

639
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:02,830
I'll come and see your new sofa.

640
01:01:02,873 --> 01:01:04,932
- Sure, see you.
- See you.

641
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,545
Hello!
Have you been to the hospital?

642
01:01:12,883 --> 01:01:13,440
Yes.

643
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:16,553
If you need money,
please tell me.

644
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:18,455
Good bye.

645
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:21,754
Be careful. Hello!

646
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:25,057
Do you know
Youndoo's hospitalized?

647
01:01:25,096 --> 01:01:27,064
How come?
What's wrong with her?

648
01:02:05,469 --> 01:02:06,834
Is this what you like?

649
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:12,135
It was a gift for my wife.

650
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:26,852
Now I smell of your wife.

651
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:34,059
How do you kiss your wife?

652
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:47,267
Remember Hyoungsuk?

653
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:50,838
He used to ask for money
for his rocket building project.

654
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:52,676
He's a professor at KAlST now.

655
01:02:58,689 --> 01:03:00,020
Youngmin used to live
in your neighborhood.

656
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:05,928
He delivered all my letters to you,
did you know?

657
01:03:45,002 --> 01:03:46,264
I'm going to go take a shower.

658
01:05:20,464 --> 01:05:21,931
Jioh,
Let's play some baseball.

659
01:05:23,867 --> 01:05:24,834
What's wrong?

660
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:28,033
I heard something from outside.

661
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:30,438
Ignore it.

662
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:34,037
Jioh, Jioh!
Let's play some baseball.

663
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:40,143
Nobody's out there.

664
01:05:40,184 --> 01:05:42,550
I can't do this.
Let's just stop.

665
01:05:42,586 --> 01:05:44,451
We've a long way to go.

666
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:47,651
Sorry.
You'd better get going.

667
01:05:47,691 --> 01:05:49,454
Don't do this.

668
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:52,053
Please leave.

669
01:05:53,497 --> 01:05:54,555
We've just begun.

670
01:05:54,598 --> 01:05:55,963
Stop it!

671
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:59,999
After you had your way with me!

672
01:06:00,037 --> 01:06:05,407
You caused the whole nonsense.

673
01:06:05,442 --> 01:06:09,003
You almost stole
the documents you have.

674
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:15,610
What's the difference between
that and selling your body?

675
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,718
I am sorry.

676
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:26,824
Younghee!

677
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:30,529
Don't do this to me.
Let me go!

678
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:53,155
Please forgive me.

679
01:07:14,645 --> 01:07:16,806
Mom, I've got to pee.

680
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:43,836
Mom, Mom!

681
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:02,492
It must be nice for you
to have a mother.

682
01:08:02,526 --> 01:08:03,185
Yeah.

683
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:08,095
I used to have my mother around.

684
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:11,999
When I was young,
we were so poor.

685
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:17,198
No father, practically no food.

686
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:22,407
One day I was coming home
from school.

687
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,209
I saw my mother at the marketplace.

688
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:28,217
I was happy to see her
and almost said, "Hi, mom!"

689
01:08:29,453 --> 01:08:30,715
But I had to hide instead.

690
01:08:33,156 --> 01:08:35,920
She was shoplifting some octopus
at a grocery store.

691
01:08:39,863 --> 01:08:44,027
On the dinner table
lay the octopus - nicely prepared.

692
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:48,233
I loved octopus but didn't
even touch it.

693
01:08:50,073 --> 01:08:52,837
And not even a glance at my mother.

694
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,374
I was embarrassed...

695
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,384
And now I think I know...

696
01:09:06,123 --> 01:09:08,785
How she felt as she was
stealing that octopus.

697
01:09:18,936 --> 01:09:23,600
I am sorry.
I just had to leave.

698
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:27,802
My mom stole the
octopus to feed me

699
01:09:29,046 --> 01:09:31,207
but I just couldn't do it.

700
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:35,718
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

701
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:32,163
I can't keep the promise
to save the house.

702
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:36,977
I tried everything I could...

703
01:10:40,517 --> 01:10:42,781
Indeed, everything I could do

704
01:10:47,524 --> 01:10:48,786
Sorry.

705
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,941
<The day before repayment deadline>

706
01:11:57,027 --> 01:11:59,427
Jadoo, can you give me a hand?

707
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:27,739
Dear God! Please ignore
my prayers from now on.

708
01:14:28,879 --> 01:14:31,643
But just once this time,
please answer my prayer.

709
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:40,750
I promise I'll share prizes

710
01:14:42,592 --> 01:14:44,856
...and clean the fish tank.

711
01:14:47,998 --> 01:14:53,061
So please don't
let us have to move out!

712
01:14:54,304 --> 01:14:56,067
I don't want to move.

713
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:26,128
It's me, Younghee.

714
01:15:26,169 --> 01:15:29,434
I've got something to tell you.

715
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:34,034
Sorry about the last time.
I apologize.

716
01:15:34,778 --> 01:15:38,839
Are you at home?
What time do you get out?

717
01:15:38,882 --> 01:15:43,319
I'd like to see you.
It doesn't matter if it's late.

718
01:15:45,789 --> 01:15:50,749
No, I have to see you.
I'll come over to your house.

719
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:54,256
I don't mind it very late.
Finish your work first.

720
01:15:56,199 --> 01:15:57,257
Yes.

721
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:01,396
I can wait.

722
01:16:03,139 --> 01:16:04,003
Yes.

723
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:36,522
If you're not up to this,
you can go home.

724
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:39,929
It's your choice.

725
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:53,098
<7 AM, April 12, repayment deadline>

726
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:06,683
What time is it?

727
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:10,390
We don't have to move out.

728
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:17,092
Get up.
Let's go to the bank.

729
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:27,398
You get commission
based on the number of clients
visiting your site.

730
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:29,911
With the recession,
you don't make much money.

731
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:31,413
At least you can afford
to be honest here.

732
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:33,608
Thank you.

733
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,608
Jihoon Han at Neo M&A,
didn't he lend you the money?

734
01:19:37,654 --> 01:19:39,918
Yes, my wife knows him
from high school.

735
01:19:39,956 --> 01:19:43,289
You'll have to work
your ass off to pay it back.

736
01:19:43,326 --> 01:19:45,658
I'll work hard and
pay it all back.

737
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:42,480
Is this Neo M&A?
Could I speak to your president?

738
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:45,487
Yeah,
I'd like to come visit him.

739
01:20:48,324 --> 01:20:50,690
I'm Chulsoo Lee.

740
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:53,787
He knows Younghee Kim.
She's my wife.

741
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:56,794
Yes.

742
01:20:59,002 --> 01:20:59,730
Daddy.

743
01:21:03,773 --> 01:21:05,934
Quiet down!

744
01:21:07,577 --> 01:21:10,944
You bought a new dress?
New shoes, too?

745
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,448
Didn't daddy get them
for your birthday?

746
01:21:13,483 --> 01:21:15,849
She wore these shoes
to the opera.

747
01:21:22,992 --> 01:21:25,460
One, Two, Three, Four

748
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:55,686
Did you order?

749
01:21:57,627 --> 01:21:58,651
Would you like
your noodles cut up?

750
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:01,129
Yes, cut hers up fine,
but not mine, please.

751
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:16,441
What's the occasion?
Visiting me at work.

752
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,639
Just because.

753
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:22,749
It's been a while since we had
cold noodles together. Right?

754
01:22:34,497 --> 01:22:36,658
- Darling?
- Yeah?

755
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:39,865
I...

756
01:22:43,906 --> 01:22:45,168
It's very hard for me.

757
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:49,770
Do you want coffee instead?

758
01:22:49,912 --> 01:22:51,470
It's very hard for me.

759
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:55,779
You're the only one I can talk to.

760
01:23:00,256 --> 01:23:01,917
I can't go on

761
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:05,427
with a straight face.

762
01:23:08,664 --> 01:23:09,926
Don't speak.

763
01:23:12,268 --> 01:23:13,030
I...

764
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,128
One more word,
I won't tolerate.

765
01:23:17,073 --> 01:23:19,041
I slept with another
man for money.

766
01:23:21,277 --> 01:23:22,437
I needed the money.

767
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,948
I knew it wasn't right
but I did it.

768
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:32,454
I'm sorry, darling.

769
01:23:38,795 --> 01:23:40,854
Jihoon Han, I met him.

770
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,967
If you cared about the kids and me,

771
01:23:48,604 --> 01:23:51,164
you should have kept the
secret to the grave.

772
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:58,674
No matter how much it hurts
You should have kept it to yourself.

773
01:24:00,049 --> 01:24:01,107
Why did you have to tell me?

774
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:07,116
Shouldn't have...
until the last moment.

775
01:24:11,661 --> 01:24:16,121
I meant to keep it in
my heart till I die. But I can't.

776
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:23,132
Every time I see the kids or you,

777
01:24:24,474 --> 01:24:25,441
I get so scared.

778
01:24:29,178 --> 01:24:32,545
Day by day
I try to pull myself together.

779
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:38,247
But I just can't go back
to the way I was. I can't.

780
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:47,556
I could have let it pass.

781
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:55,762
I was going to let it slide
and go on.

782
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:58,872
What now?

783
01:25:02,245 --> 01:25:07,808
It'll be hell to face
each other from now on.

784
01:25:12,655 --> 01:25:14,714
What do we do now?

785
01:26:25,027 --> 01:26:27,018
<1 month later>

786
01:26:27,463 --> 01:26:32,526
- How's the presentation coming along?
- All right.

787
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:36,732
Could you ask someone else
to go on this business trip?

788
01:26:37,473 --> 01:26:40,840
You're in charge of the project.

789
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:45,844
They are expecting you.
Something urgent?

790
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:51,947
No, I can't just leave
the kids alone for three days.

791
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:54,749
Isn't your wife at home?

792
01:26:58,995 --> 01:27:02,590
I'm sick of this.
We've had it for a month.

793
01:27:03,032 --> 01:27:05,899
I miss Mom's food.

794
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:11,607
Are you crazy?

795
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:13,199
- You didn't like it, so I tossed it.
- You!

796
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:17,611
- If you're done, go away.
- Pick it up. You pick it up.

797
01:27:17,647 --> 01:27:20,912
- Pick it up.
- None of your business.

798
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,508
What's all this about?

799
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:26,214
You're not even our family.
Our dead uncle was your real father.

800
01:27:26,255 --> 01:27:27,620
Don't you think I know?

801
01:27:32,862 --> 01:27:35,023
Isn't this a picture of your family?

802
01:27:35,064 --> 01:27:38,932
Without you, mom and dad
would have liked me better.

803
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:43,530
Go away.
Mom left us because of you!

804
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:44,834
Daddy.

805
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:04,085
Am I too heavy?

806
01:28:05,428 --> 01:28:07,396
No.

807
01:28:10,433 --> 01:28:14,893
Light as a feather.
I think this is our first piggyback.

808
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,805
Tonight I'll make it up to you.

809
01:28:27,249 --> 01:28:30,116
I wanted to be strong.

810
01:28:32,455 --> 01:28:38,416
And I never showed
my weak side to others.

811
01:28:42,064 --> 01:28:44,225
Even when my brother died,

812
01:28:45,468 --> 01:28:48,437
...and when your grandparents died,

813
01:28:49,972 --> 01:28:51,439
I didn't cry.

814
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,141
But...

815
01:29:02,017 --> 01:29:10,391
Just can't help crying now.

816
01:29:12,428 --> 01:29:16,387
I really meant well.

817
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:22,400
And worked hard.

818
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:32,408
But I only hurt you and
couldn't protect mom.

819
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:37,018
How did this happen?

820
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:41,621
I'm too ashamed to face you.

821
01:29:45,161 --> 01:29:50,224
I wonder what you think of me.

822
01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:55,730
I'm scared.

823
01:29:58,574 --> 01:30:00,439
Can you understand me?

824
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:07,138
Can you understand me?

825
01:34:16,165 --> 01:34:21,728
The lamb got scared and ran away.

826
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,931
The lion became sad.

827
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:25,633
- No, sadder.
- Sadder.

828
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:12,006
Mom!
Dad!

829
01:36:16,752 --> 01:36:20,415
Dad! Mom! Did you see
me dancing in the center?

830
01:36:20,455 --> 01:36:22,616
He did.
He even took some pictures.

831
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:25,024
Dad, I didn't cough at all.
Right, mom?

832
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,527
Boy, she talks.

833
01:36:26,562 --> 01:36:28,530
Didn't I look like a real fairy?

834
01:36:28,564 --> 01:36:30,828
Of course, only prettier.

835
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:32,629
Really?
l am prettier?

836
01:36:32,668 --> 01:36:34,636
No
you were the ugliest!

837
01:36:42,277 --> 01:36:44,745
Can you take a picture of us?

838
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,542
Sure.

839
01:36:48,584 --> 01:36:50,142
Smile.

840
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:55,848
Thanks. Would you like me
to take one of you?

841
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,259
If you would!

842
01:36:58,293 --> 01:36:59,385
Okay, gather around.

843
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:02,397
Jioh!

844
01:37:04,733 --> 01:37:06,997
Why are you standing over there,
silly?

845
01:37:13,942 --> 01:37:15,603
Wow, big family!

846
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:23,017
Come on, smile.

847
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:27,215
Whiskey, cheese, kimchi ....

848
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:32,421
Here we go!

849
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:34,219
Smile, smile!

850
01:37:34,663 --> 01:37:40,533
One, two, two and a half

851
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:41,501
Three.
