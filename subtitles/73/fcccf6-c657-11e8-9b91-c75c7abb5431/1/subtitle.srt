1
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,258
It's too little.

2
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,458
What are you saying?

3
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,395
- Nothing
- Go away

4
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,335
You are in charge this time.
My men will do what you say

5
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,571
Your boy is arrogant,
you tell him yourself.

6
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,012
You think who you are? You are so late

7
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,146
Wah Dee hurry,
Big Brother is waiting for you.

8
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,986
It's to get money for
godfather's litigation.

9
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,964
Trumpet wants you to be the driver.

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,797
I haven't done it for a while.

11
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,596
But if you Brother Seven wants me,
I'll do it.

12
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,264
If you don't like it, don't do it.

13
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,703
If Big Brother asks me, I'll do it!

14
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,208
O.K. then, wait for my call!

15
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,139
Don't put on airs, little brother!

16
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,314
Let's go!

17
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,419
Wah Dee, I know you don't want to do it.

18
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,849
But Trumpet biases towards us.

19
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,956
After all, he is one of us.

20
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,017
You know...

21
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,494
Favors can never be repaid fully.

22
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,859
Godfather's affair concerns us all.

23
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,263
Trouble again,
if nothing else leave quickly.

24
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,966
- Brother Seven, I'm leaving, good night!
- See you.

25
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,673
Ambulance and police are coming!

26
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,663
It's been ten minutes.

27
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,417
Wait...

28
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,394
I'm leaving first!
Bye Bye!

29
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,379
Manger!

30
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,222
Don't move!

31
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,172
Open the safe! Hurry!

32
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,743
Get up quickly!

33
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,707
You bastard, get up!

34
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,375
- Be quick!
- I'm getting up.

35
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,319
- Open it!
- I'm opening it.

36
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,727
Two cups of coffee and tea.

37
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,205
- Three egg sandwiches.
- Hurry!

38
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,432
Go after him!

39
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,500
Calling control...

40
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,012
Stop!

41
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,337
Don't move!

42
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,511
Stop! Don't move!

43
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,249
Get off! Go!

44
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:17,921
Let go of the hostage!

45
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,051
Stop! Stop the car!...

46
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,287
Stop the car!

47
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,236
This should be enough for us to enjoy.

48
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,437
Put it away!

49
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,775
Big Brother, he's coming!

50
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,475
What are you doing?

51
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,524
Stay low and keep quiet, it will be O.K.

52
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,441
How did you manage to get away.

53
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,744
Where's the money?

54
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,818
Give it to him!

55
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,052
Police are looking for us.

56
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,218
First, get a place to hide.

57
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,993
Not the right amount.

58
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,154
This is it.

59
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,696
We risked our lives for this.

60
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,730
If you don't want it, fine.

61
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,797
You are taking advantage of me.

62
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,798
So what?

63
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,391
Not happy,
tell your Big Brother to see me.

64
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,316
Don't bother her, she's out of this!

65
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,458
Go away...

66
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,622
What's happening? Who is she?

67
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,562
I used her to get away.

68
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,531
She recognizes all of us now.

69
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,532
Do you want all of us in trouble?

70
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,261
I brought her here, I'll be responsible.

71
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,396
Good, you're responsible.

72
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,632
It's your man, don't leave any trace.

73
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,976
Do it clean.

74
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,885
There are no cars here,
I'll give you a ride.

75
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,396
"The booze sinks in."

76
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,501
"When will it block out my sadness."

77
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,004
"The past will all calm down."

78
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,247
"Unable to break through."

79
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,709
"Unable to see clearly ahead."

80
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:13,624
"Conflict and coercion still present."

81
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,463
"Treading on a grey path."

82
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,836
"Like the reflection is the abyss"

83
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:33,275
"Shouldering my sufferings and regrets."

84
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,783
"Your eyes are filled with tears."

85
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,019
"The world is unknowingly filled
with emptiness."

86
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:51,224
"Woo... please don't leave."

87
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,599
"Thinking of you again."

88
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,434
"Who will cover up for me."

89
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,372
"Want to know you wherever I go."

90
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,376
"Unable to remove the trace."

91
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:12,509
"Unfortunately we each have to face."

92
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,116
"One's own destiny and goal."

93
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,888
Try to stay home.

94
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,330
Why are you so dirty all over?

95
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,399
Nothing!

96
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,823
Come again when you are free.

97
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,767
Having a late night snack!

98
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,864
Wait! Ah Lin!

99
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:17,774
Today is your Mom's death anniversary,
go up and burn this for her.

100
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,215
What happened to your hand?

101
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,549
Never mind him, he's always like this.

102
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,416
Are you O.K.?

103
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,646
Let's go in!

104
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,653
Bar girl kills herself for love.
Jumps in the middle of the night.

105
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,531
Moon in the sky, shining on me.

106
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,638
Lost it all at the tables.

107
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,000
Lost all my money.

108
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,944
Why do I have nothing, I'm not a hooker.

109
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,783
Madam, give me some face.

110
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,778
You haven't written the ticket yet!

111
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,581
You better be earlier next time.

112
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,884
Yes, I'll be earlier next time.

113
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,980
I'll be earlier tomorrow
and every other time

114
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,993
Thank you Madam,
I'll be earlier tomorrow.

115
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,461
Interfering with my area.

116
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,960
Hey, who's this?

117
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,633
Wah Dee, don't play.

118
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,900
I've got some important things
to tell you.

119
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,736
Be serious, listen.

120
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,174
The police and the gang
are looking for you.

121
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,972
What you and Trumpet did is out.

122
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,411
The police got hold of Trumpet.

123
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,211
Rumour has it, you sold them out.

124
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,817
Go find a place to hide.

125
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,821
Informer...

126
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:48,755
Don't run!

127
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,980
Hit, I dare you!

128
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,777
You'll know when we get back.

129
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,881
Get the car!

130
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,456
Turn around, go!

131
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,422
Kong Sir, this is my nephew!

132
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,262
Please give me some face, Kong Sir!

133
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,269
Who respects you? The police or the gang.

134
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,202
- Which side respects you?
- None...

135
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,899
You only look after people's car.

136
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,031
Lean against the wall.

137
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,809
Yes, Kong Sir, he's young...

138
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,242
Do you want to enjoy the air-con
in police station?

139
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,771
Lean against the wall.

140
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,613
Bastard, you dare play games with me!

141
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,878
Don't think you're so great to this man.

142
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,216
Shut up, go away!

143
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,320
Tell me, what have I done!

144
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,790
You'll know later.

145
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,203
You bastard, still putting on airs.

146
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,231
Just because you're police.

147
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,037
My grandfather was also a police.

148
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,640
He didn't put on airs, he cared for me.

149
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,140
Kong Sir!

150
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,289
Go and take a look!

151
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,238
Go nearer if you can't see well!

152
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,192
Told you to get rid of her.

153
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,025
Do you want to see the end of us?

154
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,896
If she wanted to,
she could have identified us!

155
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,334
She might say it
after further questioning.

156
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,299
I don't have time for this everyday.

157
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,970
If you don't want to do it,
I'll get my men.

158
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,011
Get out!

159
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,883
Is it this one?

160
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,919
Too big.

161
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,757
What about this?

162
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,799
Too small.

163
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,460
We've done this so many times.

164
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,061
How about this one?

165
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,234
Too big again!

166
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,535
Say it clearly, then I put it on.

167
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,836
Get on!

168
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,106
Get on!

169
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,324
Bastard, I'll get you wherever you go.

170
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,624
I'm coming, Boss!

171
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,598
They were welding up there.

172
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,498
- So I placed the papers on.
- As if I owe you.

173
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,196
Thank you. Thank you.

174
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,400
Boss, your car is the most current model.

175
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,874
Good on gas and smart looking, let's go!

176
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,405
Slowly, Boss, slowly! So happy.

177
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,512
Another business.

178
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,648
Wah Dee? Are you OK, out already?

179
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,619
Did Big Brother come?

180
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,019
No, haven't seen him!

181
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,618
Yes, fresh.

182
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,384
Tell Big Brother I'll be at Bamboo Hill.

183
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,824
Good Bye!

184
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,358
What happened?

185
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,797
Did 4336 call back? Try again.

186
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,738
Call 9333, Wah Dee calling.

187
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,938
Call me once he gets Brother Seven.

188
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,361
What time can I get home?

189
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,929
I didn't call the police,
they found my purse,

190
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,833
so they found me.

191
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,236
May I call back home?

192
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,474
They don't know
where I am or what I'm doing!

193
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,818
They will be worried.

194
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,382
I won't be coming home tonight, Ah Sang!

195
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,648
I'm staying with my classmates.

196
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,519
She's leaving for the U.S. tomorrow.

197
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,363
O.K. I know.

198
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,403
Alright, alright, Bye!

199
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,249
Is this your first lie?

200
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,723
Second, the first time was
at the police station.

201
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,049
I'm going to bathroom.

202
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,639
Let's go!

203
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,840
How about one more man, Miss!

204
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,180
Open the door!

205
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,218
Get hold of the girl.

206
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,767
Where are you going? Don't you dare
play games with me.

207
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,411
Cut his hand off.

208
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,641
Trumpet doesn't get this any bigger.

209
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,216
It's his own fault, protecting the girl.

210
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,250
Don't move!

211
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,479
I promised her she will be alright.

212
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,782
Who is responsible if she identifies us?

213
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,979
I'll be responsible.

214
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,049
What are you saying, you wounded my man,

215
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,491
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

216
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,425
Trumpet, I'm his Big Brother,

217
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,590
I assure he'll be responsible.

218
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:48,829
Wah Dee, let's go!

219
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,800
Go? What about wounding my man?

220
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,206
Now this is settled.

221
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,883
Get away!

222
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,400
- Big brother
- Let's go!

223
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,387
You've bleed a lot!

224
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,762
- Are you alright?
- Leave me alone!

225
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,133
Go home!

226
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,475
Don't follow me!

227
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,466
He comes home only when he's hurt.

228
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,074
Stop nagging such unlucky words.

229
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:39,973
Did I say it wrong?

230
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,102
Please stop it! It is very irritating!

231
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,743
How is it?

232
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,476
O.K., but a bit lower
and that will be it.

233
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,044
Who's paying me?

234
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,516
Money, follow me! Ma Ma Mia!

235
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,682
Those bastards, we should pay them back.

236
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,986
Yes, stab them back.

237
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,787
Let him sleep down here.

238
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,426
Let's go buy some stuff for soup.

239
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,431
Snakehead soup will help the healing.

240
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,362
First throw this out.

241
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,092
Why is there so much bleeding this time?

242
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,466
You just try letting someone stab you.

243
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,687
Good morning!

244
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,189
Please call 98!

245
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,698
Who's calling 98? Hey, who's calling?

246
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,849
Ah Sang said you're not eating properly.

247
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,254
Hello JoJo, it's getting cold now.

248
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,686
Remember to put on more clothes.

249
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,586
Ah Sang said
you missed the dancing lessons.

250
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,523
You have to continue the lessons.

251
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,318
There are a few universities here.

252
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,463
I think they're not bad.

253
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,127
Aunt Mary's daughter has just arrived.

254
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,295
She knows quite a few boyfriends already.

255
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,740
We've already bought a house here.

256
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,454
- And be good!
- Bye!

257
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:42,630
Moon in the sky, shining on me.

258
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,233
- Mister!
- Who are you?

259
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,161
What is it?

260
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,429
Do you remember me?

261
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,567
Are you crazy!

262
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,871
There're thousand of girls
passing by daily,

263
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,170
who will remember you.

264
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,504
You called me 'fresh'. Do you remember?

265
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,250
Oh 'fresh', you're something.

266
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,386
He's never been stabbed for a girl.

267
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,155
How is he now?
I've brought him some soup.

268
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,595
Wow, you even brought him soup.
Good, let me have a sip.

269
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,598
- Stop it!
- Shit!

270
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,698
Do you know where he is?

271
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,564
Even if I know I won't say it.

272
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,868
What do I have the gain?

273
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:35,478
What? $100 for the information? Save it!

274
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,756
Why do I have nothing, I'm not a hooker.

275
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,221
Sorry to bother you!

276
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:56,073
Allah Ah Tor. Nah mor allah a tor.

277
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,074
Holding a big banana.

278
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,433
Hey Miss, have a drink with me!

279
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,408
Alone? Let's dance!

280
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,279
May I invite you?

281
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,506
Elope...

282
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,043
What? Pretending to be a lady!

283
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,633
Don't stay if there's nothing else.

284
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,947
Go away, why are you following me?

285
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,220
I'm returning your jacket.

286
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,060
And the lighter.

287
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,023
Get on the bike!

288
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,763
Hey! Amigo!

289
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,513
Wah Dee, she's not bad, let's compete.

290
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,949
Alright, bring out your best girl.

291
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,350
Strawberry!

292
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,053
How do we compete?

293
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,822
You in front, I follow,
between 2 lamp-post.

294
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,398
I will pass you.

295
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,801
You're putting money in my pocket.

296
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,371
$10,000! Bring me the keys!

297
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,407
- As you like.
- Bring me the keys!

298
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,388
Clear the field!

299
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,807
Get on!

300
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,586
Get on and don't fall off. Understand?

301
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,125
Are you scared?

302
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,869
Get off if you're scared, get off!

303
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,756
If you're that good, don't fall off.

304
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:26,299
Ready! 1,2,3.

305
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,758
What are you looking at?
Are you pissed off?

306
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,998
Hold on!

307
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,447
Are you O.K.? Isn't it fun?

308
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,381
It's my birthday,
that's why I looked for you.

309
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,495
- What is it?
- Excuse me!

310
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,761
Hey, we're closed.

311
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,966
- What do you want?
- Buy yourself a drink!

312
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,104
Hey, what are you looking for?

313
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:02,549
- 17 years old? Are you telling the truth?
- It's true!

314
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,518
Better add more, I don't believe you.

315
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:10,683
Alright, shall we leave it like that?

316
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,624
When's your birthday?

317
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,024
I don't know!

318
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,367
How can you not know?

319
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,961
I don't know, what's unusual about it?

320
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,138
Why not treat today as your birthday.

321
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,270
We can celebrate together from now on.

322
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,342
Good!

323
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,084
Let's blow together!

324
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,919
From now on, we share the birth date.

325
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,123
- Today, let me celebrate for you.
- OK!

326
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,158
You're terrible.

327
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,808
Go in now.

328
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:47,747
Wah Dee, wait, this is for you.

329
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,438
It's raining hard, Sang!

330
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,771
Why are you soaking wet, Miss?

331
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,336
And you smell gasoline all over.

332
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,142
It's nothing, Ah Sang!

333
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,873
Take your shoes off and go in.

334
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,847
- Quickly change your clothes.
- I will.

335
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,849
- Be careful you'll catch a cold.
- I know!
