1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,315
Miss! Miss!

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,755
- Come over!
- What is it?

3
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:26,599
Very hot!...

4
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,730
- It is her, kidding with you.
- It's not me!

5
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,973
What are you up to, kid?

6
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:10,875
1,2,3... 1,2,3... 1,2,3... 3!

7
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:12,206
You're lost!

8
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,751
Stop nagging and go get us something.

9
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:17,686
You two are evil.

10
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:20,655
Your girl is very accommodating.

11
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:22,893
So are you, old devil!

12
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,729
Hey, are you serious this time.

13
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,631
Don't say nonsense.

14
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:33,401
I knew it as soon as I saw you two.

15
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:40,136
Hey, can you help me sell this motorbike?

16
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:42,246
Are you sure? Such a pity.

17
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,716
Well, if I had some money.

18
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:51,449
I can go into 2nd hand car business.

19
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,582
What? Do you want to go straight?

20
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:59,362
Nine out of ten remain that way.

21
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:01,589
It won't be that easy, Ah Dee!

22
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,369
Those kids came to bother me last night.

23
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:14,338
Want me to retire.
Says this street is theirs.

24
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,341
They don't know
what they're getting into.

25
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:23,687
Don't disappoint me.

26
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,454
Don't come back if you fail.

27
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:32,129
I've been here for over ten years.

28
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,856
I'm not afraid of them!

29
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:43,630
Forty dollars!

30
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:44,605
- Sorry to bother you.
- Thank you!

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,507
This is rough area.

32
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,670
Aren't you afraid being alone?

33
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,037
I am meeting someone.

34
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:51,648
I know, you're meeting Wah Dee.

35
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,318
Just a piece of advice.

36
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:55,884
Do you think he is serious?

37
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,019
He's nice so you won't identify him.

38
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,916
You are being used.

39
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,048
What are you saying?

40
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:02,592
None of your business!

41
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:03,992
What is it?

42
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,553
What is it?

43
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:09,457
That case is not finished yet.

44
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,101
I'll get you someday.

45
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,405
I'll get you someday.

46
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,911
Are you finished.

47
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,742
- Have some tea, Miss Yuen!
- Thanks.

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,712
It's not Yuen, it's Miss Huen!

49
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:33,218
It's O.K., call me JoJo.

50
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:36,117
- It's English.
- I know.

51
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:38,657
Can you stop singing?

52
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,262
What should I call them?

53
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:46,296
Just call us moms.

54
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:48,064
What do you mean 'Moms'?

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,334
What's wrong with it?

56
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:52,239
We raised him since he was very small.

57
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,206
Please take my little present.

58
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,012
Ask him whether we are his moms or not.

59
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,070
Stop talking and open the door.

60
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:58,114
Oh, I forgot to leave a note outside.

61
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,661
Hey, man, no.

62
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,493
- I'm not available today
- Then what about the other two?

63
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,265
All 3 busy, go home and get your mom.

64
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,237
Something urgent came up,
I can't take you home.

65
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:22,371
I'll call you.

66
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,842
Keep quiet! Let me see what it is.

67
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:36,343
- Let me see!
- Give it back to me.

68
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,789
You shouldn't do it, you're our guest.

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,452
That's OK, I like doing it.

70
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,594
Wah Dee seldom brings friends home.

71
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,999
His mom was cruel, jumping from the roof.

72
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:52,535
"Plop", and there she was on the ground.

73
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:54,400
Left this little burden behind.

74
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:57,534
Where's his father?

75
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,338
Even his mother doesn't know who he is.

76
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,712
Does he have any other relatives?

77
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,146
I hear he has a grandfather in Macau?

78
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,596
What is it Ah Sang?

79
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,895
Why are you so late Miss?

80
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:26,369
- Sir and Madam just got off the plane.
- Really?

81
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,076
- Daddy.
- Good girl.

82
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,942
I'm so happy to see you, my good girl.

83
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:42,412
I missed you very much.

84
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:44,647
Come over here!

85
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,153
These are
Canadian Universities' brochures.

86
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,060
I've chosen two,
you pick out one yourself.

87
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,222
We're going up now.

88
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,233
Don't come back so late next time.

89
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:05,675
Come up, Ah Sang!

90
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,133
- Has he returned the call?
- Not yet!

91
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,968
Try again then.

92
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,769
Big Brother!

93
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,770
Wah Dee, why are you this late?

94
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:45,341
How is Godfather?

95
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,213
He's having his operation.

96
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:47,943
Bastard, let's get rid of them.

97
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,779
Don't get so excited, Trumpet?

98
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:50,853
We don't even know how Godfather is yet.

99
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:54,492
If Godfather dies,
I don't care if he's young or old.

100
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,923
I'll kill them.

101
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,454
How is it?

102
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,795
I've told them to go to the restaurant.

103
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:17,147
I asked you to call him earlier.
What are you saying?

104
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,744
Go wait whether or not there's any news.

105
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:23,510
Everyone waits at the restaurant, get it?

106
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,449
I'm sorry, we did all we can.

107
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,588
Fuck, let's all go!

108
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:52,015
- Mummy!
- Why aren't you sleeping?

109
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,214
I'm waiting for my friend's call
from U.S.

110
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,319
- Is it important?
- No!

111
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:00,857
Go to sleep then if it is not important.

112
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:01,915
Alright!

113
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:40,956
Are you trying to scare me?

114
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,125
I've been around much longer than you.

115
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,335
I'm telling you, old man.

116
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:49,403
I talk to you just because you're old.

117
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,766
Talk to my Big Brother
if you're unhappy.

118
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:53,436
Go ask your Big Brother Trumpet.

119
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:54,706
Who was around first.

120
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:59,406
He wants to have fun.

121
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,918
I'm telling you.

122
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:13,093
I don't want to see you here tomorrow.

123
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,790
Understand? Let's go!

124
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:29,175
Rotten kid, trying to scare me.

125
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:33,006
Would I be scared? Damn it?

126
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:37,385
Are you O.K., Bo? Where is Wah Dee?

127
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,788
How do I know where he is.

128
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,723
You said he was hurt in a fight,

129
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,266
you must know where he is.

130
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:54,268
Leave him alone,
he'll always be like that.

131
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,998
Please tell me where he is?

132
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,444
You two are impossible.

133
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,743
Can you tell me if Wah Dee is here?

134
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,580
He's upstairs!

135
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,915
Thank you!

136
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,829
Are you his grandfather?

137
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,289
Grandfather!

138
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:40,771
I won't be able to give you anything.

139
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,812
Come over here!

140
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,429
Will you regret?

141
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:32,325
"Striding together in the sky."

142
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:37,732
"Put away strife and conflicts."

143
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:47,602
"My heart is full of romance."

144
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,579
"Laughter between us,

145
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,718
is the best moment."

146
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:03,527
"Never mind if it is real or false,

147
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:07,223
though wrong, we'll never part."

148
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,500
"Free to be naive again."

149
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:19,503
"Hope we will always stay close."

150
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:35,188
"I can finally be with you."

151
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:41,927
"I can see clearly all over."

152
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:51,674
"Being ordinary is so good."

153
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,274
"Laughter between us,

154
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,277
is the best moment."

155
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:07,382
"Never mind if it is real or false,

156
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,958
though wrong, we'll never part."

157
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,023
"Free to be naive again."

158
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:22,766
"Hope we will always stay close."

159
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,871
Come, today is Mid-Autumn festival.

160
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:32,575
Let's have a piece of moon-cake.

161
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,307
I don't like moon-cakes.

162
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,719
Grandfather, sit down and eat something.

163
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,447
Yes, grandfather, eat something first.

164
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,220
With Wah Dee leaving this time,

165
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,852
I don't know when he'll be back.

166
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,289
These two pillows are for you.

167
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:49,961
Thank you!

168
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,735
There's this other one.

169
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,542
Wow, it's very beautiful.

170
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:00,975
This needs one too.

171
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,580
You scare me.

172
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,783
Kid, you are enjoying yourself.

173
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,724
Oblivious to what's around you.

174
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,730
Her parents have filed
kidnapping charges.

175
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,059
I'm telling you now.

176
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,690
Go back to H.K. right away
and you'll be O.K.

177
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,165
Also, your Big Brother is having trouble.

178
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:15,745
Daddy, Mummy!

179
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:17,815
Come with me!

180
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:21,621
Wait for me!

181
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:22,885
Get on!

182
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,119
Ah Sang!

183
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:28,989
- Go home, Miss!
- Let me go!

184
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,124
C.I.D.!

185
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,640
Her mother filed the charges, not me.

186
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:41,568
Ah Sang, get her into the car.

187
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:44,204
- Wah Dee!
- Go!

188
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:52,347
Let him go, why are you detaining him?

189
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:57,521
Wah Dee...

190
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,202
What? This is none of my business!

191
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,474
It's her mother who's charging you.

192
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,315
And there's the jewel-factory robbery.

193
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,783
Eventually I'll get you.

194
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,379
Hey! Chan Sir!

195
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:27,685
Yes, let the kid go!

196
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:30,093
What do you mean let him go?

197
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,353
What exactly does she want?

198
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,093
She's not laying any charges.

199
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,721
We'll discuss it in my room.

200
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,028
JoJo is just a kid, it's not up to her.

201
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,068
I'll take her to Canada for schooling.

202
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,204
I don't want so much trouble.

203
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,007
Don't worry, Shirley.

204
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:46,876
It'll be alright, we're school mates.

205
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:48,103
Thanks a lot, John!

206
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,440
Why is it like that Chan Sir?

207
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,243
She's canceling the charges.

208
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,145
You're canceling the charges.

209
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,082
What, close the case,
we haven't got him yet.

210
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,212
I'm taking you off Miss Huen's case.

211
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,584
It's obvious she's protecting him.

212
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,352
You don't want any part of this?

213
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,922
We had a deal, I get your daughter back.

214
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,225
And she'll be our witness, what now?

215
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,564
Are you playing games?

216
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,861
Shut up, what are you saying?

217
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:14,261
- John, I'm busy, I've got to leave.
- Good!

218
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,706
- When you're free, visit me in Canada.
- Yes, I will!

219
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:20,736
Let's go, JoJo.

220
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:26,640
Still no clues to the jewel robbery case.

221
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:27,877
Is this the way you work.

222
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,576
Don't just stand there, get going!

223
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,514
Yes, Sir!

224
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:52,369
Here's a good spot for you.

225
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:57,207
What do you expect for a few dollars?

226
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:21,304
- What is it?
- None of your business!

227
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,299
- Hey, come on, what is it?
- Nothing!

228
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,734
Run, I'll see where you can go?

229
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,574
- What's wrong with your face?
- Nothing

230
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,616
I got beaten up.

231
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:36,686
Don't make trouble, Ah Dee!

232
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:38,118
- Don't stop me.
- Leave it, don't make any trouble.

233
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,278
You've been bullied and we do nothing.

234
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,880
Your Big Brother and the others
are looking for you.

235
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,860
There's enough money for everyone.

236
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,087
I can still earn my living.

237
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,390
Look at you, you're degrading me.

238
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:47,556
If you got the guts,
we'll get even with them.

239
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:48,996
If I've got the guts I'll be Big Brother.

240
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,759
Not just doing cars.

241
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,096
You think I'm happy with this?

242
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,670
Depending on the gang.

243
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,834
So you have the guts.

244
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,603
But you're still stabbed and on the run.

245
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,801
Brother Seven is in trouble now.

246
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:08,584
I haven't interfered in the past 2 years.

247
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:10,978
But Trumpet won't leave me alone.

248
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:12,748
What does he want?

249
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,091
He wants to be the head.

250
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:16,785
Will the men accept him?

251
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:20,160
Brother Seven is better
whichever way you see it.

252
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,528
Shut up!

253
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,364
Trumpet is like a mad dog now.

254
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,633
You've all stepped on his toe before.

255
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,836
I don't want fighting between ourselves.

256
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,906
Trumpet wants to meet us at AA.

257
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:41,478
This is it, who does Trumpet think he is.

258
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,781
I've been around much longer than him.

259
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,720
Brother Seven, I'll support you tomorrow.

260
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:48,655
Go get me a pack of cigarette.

261
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,316
Brother Seven?

262
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,961
Go on.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,490
- Brother Seven!
- Rambo!

264
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:06,175
The police want Trumpet
to hand over someone.

265
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:22,955
Big Brother, I'll always listen to you.

266
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,493
I'll go up tomorrow!

267
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:40,767
It's because of him
you're going to Canada.

268
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,070
Later on, you'll know you were right.

269
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:50,350
Bring more clothes, it's snowing there.

270
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,946
If not enough,
we'll buy some more over there.

271
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,590
- I want to get off the car.
- No, you cannot.

272
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:56,453
We just have you.

273
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,552
Even if we're wrong,
it's for your good.

274
00:21:58,663 --> 00:21:59,561
- I want to get off the car.
- No, you cannot.

275
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:01,096
Stop the car! Stop the car!

276
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,393
- JoJo!
- Miss!

277
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,192
JoJo! You cannot go.

278
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:07,531
I'll go to Canada with you,

279
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:09,071
but tonight I have to see him.

280
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,981
Don't drink too much, have some food.

281
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:28,948
What is it? Are you drunk?

282
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:32,788
Ah Bo, get me a hot towel, quick!

283
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:49,471
Where are you going?

284
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,679
To the toilet!

285
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:52,773
I'll go with you.

286
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,173
No need!

287
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:12,299
How was the money today?

288
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,505
Go...

289
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:35,882
Let it go, Ah Dee!
Don't beat him up anymore!

290
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,558
Have a good look.

291
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:41,690
This street is Rambo's, is that clear!

292
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:55,646
This is the last time I can help you.

293
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:13,193
Are you alright?

294
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:16,798
I am alright, you can go.

295
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:20,997
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

296
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:53,101
He's in a bad mood, I'm leaving.

297
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,570
- Go!
- I'm leaving!

298
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,311
Take care of him, he drank too much!

299
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:18,351
I've washed all your clothes.

300
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,188
Hang them up if it's sunny tomorrow.

301
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:25,866
I bought some food, it's in the fridge.

302
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:58,829
The lighter is behind the flowerpot.

303
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,504
I don't like my place so tidy.

304
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:19,350
I don't like it so clean...

305
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,218
I'm in the triad.

306
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:45,741
Closed.

307
00:27:59,924 --> 00:28:01,016
Trumpet, what do you want?

308
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,548
A snake cannot be without a head.

309
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,159
The top spot is mine.

310
00:28:04,328 --> 00:28:06,228
You can retire to care for your pets.

311
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:07,763
If your men want to, they can follow me.

312
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:09,331
If not, just disappear.

313
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,399
But I want him.

314
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,333
Trumpet, you're asking too much.

315
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:15,666
Ah Sang, sit down!

316
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,768
Trumpet, even if I am willing to go.

317
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,847
Will my men listen to you.

318
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,075
So there's nothing else to discuss.

319
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:28,340
We're all family...

320
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,214
Go to die.

321
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:37,118
Killing me will not help you much,
Trumpet.

322
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:58,006
Run!

323
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,762
Wah Dee, get in the car!

324
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,411
Fuck, I knew Trumpet would do this.

325
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:13,615
Good thing I was smart.

326
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:15,617
Don't panic, Wah Dee!

327
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm not Rambo if I do not get him back.

328
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,383
Lung Bui, it's Rambo.

329
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:52,688
I am looking for him too.

330
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:55,195
He's not in Wan Chai for sure.

331
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,029
What's Snake's phone and call number?

332
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:01,229
You call him up for me right away.

333
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:03,603
Say I want to find Trumpet.

334
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,907
Let me know when you find him.

335
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:13,846
I have to leave for Canada. Take care.

336
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,482
No regrets in loving you. JoJo.

337
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,065
Get someone to fix the kitchen freezer.

338
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:36,396
Get in the car first, JoJo!

339
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:39,772
Cut off this branch, it's a bit long.

340
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:43,472
Get someone to paint the outer wall.

341
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,911
Also, change the water tank on the roof.

342
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,342
If the piping needs to be changed,
do them.

343
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,995
"Made the decision, no regrets."

344
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:10,303
"Don't ask why it is."

345
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:15,705
"I don't care even if it's wrong."

346
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:20,044
"My fate is still unclear."

347
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,115
"Unable to tell between
reality and ideals."

348
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:30,319
"We were never apart."

349
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:35,994
"Life is short, no regrets spent with you."

350
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:40,402
"Shuttling between the sky and the shores."

351
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:45,098
"Remembering a scattering
and fading sight."

352
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:49,974
"Don't forget my true affections."

353
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,615
"Understand my loss of freedom."

354
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,117
"A moment of romance is enough."

355
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:09,458
"Without a word, please forgive me."

356
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:14,027
"Enduring to the end alone."

357
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:20,602
"I want to ask why is love so short."

358
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:24,541
"Trapped in sadness."

359
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:29,380
"Life is short, no regrets spent with you."

360
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:34,151
"Shuttling between the sky and the shores."

361
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:39,452
"Remembering a scattering
and fading sight."

362
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:43,890
"Don't forget my true affections."

363
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:11,159
"Life is short, no regrets spent with you."

364
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:16,391
"Shuttling between the sky and the shores."

365
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,100
"Remembering a scattering
and fading sight."

366
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:26,041
"Don't forget my true affections."

367
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,254
Station 161.

368
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:45,350

369
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:46,394
Password.

371
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:49,560
Rambo says Trumpet is at Happy Sauna.

372
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,598
Asks you to go at once.

373
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:52,566
Thank you!

374
00:35:47,591 --> 00:35:50,992
JoJo, whatever you wish for us.

375
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:56,493
Pray to God.

376
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:02,192
Wah Dee!

377
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:09,738
Wah Dee! Wah Dee!

378
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:08,325
Wah Dee, come over!

379
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,194
He should be out soon.

380
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:15,270
He has two men with him, I'm not scared.

381
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:21,572
I'm not scared,
I want to kill the bastard.

382
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:25,640
How are you?

383
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:30,349
Are you alright?

384
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:34,317
It's nothing!

385
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:42,392
I'm O.K.!

386
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:14,258
"Forgive me for being silent."

387
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:18,391
"Life is still with you."

388
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:25,405
"You have searched for the lost sounds."

389
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:29,337
"The day has set and gone."

390
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:33,381
"We all hope to keep youth with us."

391
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:40,520
"Missing you. I can hear sighs
for you in my dreams."

392
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:44,355
"If I cannot spend my life with you."

393
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:48,294
"It's not because I do not want to."

394
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:55,696
"I've told you how I feel inside."

395
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,436
"Like we're in different worlds."

396
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,206
"We long for what is past."

397
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:11,186
"Life is short.
To enter into where you left off."

398
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,812
"Just a glimpse."

399
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:18,020
"Let the flames of love forever burn."

400
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:22,357
"Youth please return."

401
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:25,729
"To keep me company."

402
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:29,604
"If I cannot spend my life with you."

403
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,039
"It's not because I do not want to."

404
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:41,043
"I've told you how I feel inside."

405
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,784
"Like we're in different worlds."

406
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:48,416
"We long for what is past."

407
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:55,989
"Life is short.
To enter into where you left off."

408
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:17,411
I killed Trumpet, I did it.

409
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,130
"Just a glimpse."

410
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:33,793
"Let the flames of love forever burn."

411
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:37,701
"Youth please return."

412
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:41,503
"To keep me company."

413
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:44,739
"If I cannot spend my life with you."

414
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:48,841
"It's not because I do not want to."

415
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:56,391
"I've told you how I feel inside."

416
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,923
"Like we're in different worlds."

417
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,863
"We long for what is past."

418
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:11,298
"Life is short.
To enter into where you left off."

419
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:19,580
"Life is short.
To enter into where you left off."
