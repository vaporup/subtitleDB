1
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:27,712
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...

2
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:46,788
Hey, mister, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

3
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:10,153
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.

4
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,796
4,000 pesos is the big prize.

5
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:14,153
Get away from me, you little beggar.

6
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,836
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.

7
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,590
I ain't got 4 pesos.

8
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:22,152
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.

9
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:26,311
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.

10
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,626
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...

11
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:37,871
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.

12
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,991
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.

13
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,956
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.

14
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:47,750
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.

15
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:51,196
Give me a twentieth
so I don't have to look at your ugly face.

16
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:55,267
Come again next time.

17
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,748
I always have the winners,
all the lucky numbers. Good luck.

18
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,226
Thirteen.

19
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:14,507
Excuse me.

20
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:23,947
Cigarette?

21
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:27,633
Thanks.

22
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,871
- It's hot.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,070
What a town, Tampico.

24
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,427
You said it, brother.

25
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,078
If I could get a job
that'd bring enough to buy passage...

26
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,911
I'd shake its dust off my feet
soon enough, you bet.

27
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:53,193
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish...

28
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,951
and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.

29
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,832
You can sit on a bench
till you're three-quarters starved.

30
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:02,671
You can beg from another gringo,
or even commit burglary.

31
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,635
You try shining shoes in the street...

32
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:07,710
or peddling lemonade out of a bucket
and your hash is settled.

33
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,834
You'll never get another job
from an American.

34
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,716
Yeah, and the natives
would hound and pester you to death.

35
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:15,551
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?

36
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,152
Can you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

37
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:00,067
Hey, mister.

38
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,268
Will you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

39
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:04,269
Such impudence never came my way.

40
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,076
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.

41
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,308
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.

42
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:09,990
Now you put the bite on me again.

43
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,228
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.

44
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,754
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.

45
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:19,069
I never looked at your face, just
your hands and the money you gave me.

46
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:21,991
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.

47
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,909
This is the very last you get from me.

48
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:27,593
Just to make sure you don't forget
your promise, here's another peso.

49
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,669
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on...

50
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:33,114
you have to make your way through life
without my assistance.

51
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:43,755
Hey, buddy, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

52
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,511
I won't give you a red cent.

53
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,907
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.

54
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,829
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

55
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,432
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.

56
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,349
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.

57
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:56,747
The ferry's making off,
one of my men hasn't shown up.

58
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:59,955
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.

59
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:02,506
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.

60
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:06,866
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.

61
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,755
- I'm your man.
- Come on.

62
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,188
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.

63
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:28,629
Okay, you guys, get aboard.

64
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:42,876
Take it your way.

65
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,836
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?

66
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,354
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't
any shade up there on that derrick.

67
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:21,272
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires
in your own private steam bath.

68
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,877
And the sooner we're through...

69
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,916
the sooner we'll be back in town
drinking cold beer.

70
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,956
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.

71
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,075
Yeah, it's coming to us
working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.

72
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,149
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?

73
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:36,354
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.

74
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,633
What about our pay anyway,
and when do we get it?

75
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,949
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right...

76
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,598
don't worry about that,
when we get back to Tampico.

77
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:48,068
What could you do with money out here
anyway, except gamble and lose it?

78
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,308
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.

79
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,628
The agent was supposed to be here
with the dough.

80
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:16,117
Don't know what could've happened.

81
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:18,996
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.

82
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,477
You men stay here.

83
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,708
Any objection to a couple of us
coming with you?

84
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,868
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?

85
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,471
I don't think you'd do that.

86
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:30,437
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough
to buy me a glass of beer.

87
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:34,029
Say, you two guys meet me
over at the Cantina Madrid.

88
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:37,190
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there
no later than 3:00.

89
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:43,637
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.

90
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:44,867
I haven't seen him lately.

91
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,108
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?

92
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:50,315
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?

93
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:53,637
Say, how long you guys
been around Tampico, anyway?

94
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,276
What's that got to do with it?

95
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:58,828
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans
fall for McCormick's tricks.

96
00:09:58,918 --> 00:09:59,953
How do you mean?

97
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,472
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you
to work for him.

98
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:05,277
When it comes time to pay off,
he takes a powder.

99
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:11,830
How much we got left
of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?

100
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:15,354
- $2.50.
- That's not even enough for one bed.

101
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:20,390
I know a joint that's full of rats,
scorpions and cockroaches.

102
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:24,397
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.

103
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,317
Have another...

104
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,831
...jobs that were a dime a dozen
ain't to be had at all.

105
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:45,987
Streets are full of guys...

106
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,196
pushing each other over a meal.

107
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,190
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.

108
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,556
The mountain's waiting for the right guy
to discover and take her treasure.

109
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,674
The question is: Are you the right guy?

110
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,716
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.

111
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,870
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?

112
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,587
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.

113
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,431
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.

114
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:14,511
His find represents not only his own labor
but that of 999 others to boot.

115
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,835
That's 6,000 months, 500 years...

116
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,386
scrambling over mountain,
going hungry and thirsty.

117
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:24,676
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of
the human labor that went into finding it.

118
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:27,636
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.

119
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:31,427
Gold ain't good for nothing
except for making jewelry and gold teeth.

120
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:32,917
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.

121
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:36,707
You start out to tell yourself
you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.

122
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:39,596
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.

123
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,148
After months of sweating yourself dizzy,
few provisions, finding nothing...

124
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,308
you finally come down to $15,000,
then $10,000.

125
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:48,390
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...

126
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,992
"and I'll never ask for anything more
the rest of my life."

127
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,989
$5,000 is a lot of money.

128
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:55,190
In this joint it seems like a lot.

129
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:57,997
But if you made a real strike,
you couldn't be dragged away.

130
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,229
Even the threat of death wouldn't
keep you from adding $10,000 more.

131
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,991
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.

132
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:05,830
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.

133
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,113
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.

134
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:11,315
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.

135
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,873
I'd take only what I set out to get.

136
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,392
Even if there was still $500,000 worth...

137
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:18,469
lying around, waiting to be picked up.

138
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,867
I've dug in Alaska
and Canada and Colorado.

139
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,791
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home...

140
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,392
and almost enough over
to cure me of the fever I'd caught.

141
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:30,073
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.

142
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:32,832
Yeah. I know what gold does
to men's souls.

143
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,151
You talk as though you struck it rich
sometime or other, pop.

144
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,512
How about it?

145
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,866
Then what are you doing in here,
a down-and-outer?

146
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,188
That's gold. That's what it makes us.

147
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,746
Never knew a prospector yet
that died rich.

148
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,671
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it
trying to find another.

149
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,749
I'm no exception to the rule.

150
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:56,077
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now
but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.

151
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,554
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe
if anybody's willing to share expenses.

152
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,833
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.

153
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:05,308
But you got to have a stomach
for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.

154
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,708
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.

155
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,631
Partners accusing each other
of all sorts of crimes.

156
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:16,396
As long as there's no find,
the noble brotherhood will last.

157
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:20,630
But when the piles of gold begin to grow,
that's when the trouble starts.

158
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,435
I wouldn't mind
a little of that kind of trouble.

159
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,829
I think I'll go to sleep...

160
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,472
and dream about piles of gold...

161
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,914
getting bigger and bigger.

162
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,951
Do you believe what the old man...

163
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,313
who was doing all the talking
at the Oso Negro...

164
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:44,990
said the other night...

165
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:48,627
about gold changing a man's soul
so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...

166
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:51,186
that he was before finding it?

167
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,030
Guess that all depends on the man.

168
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,995
That's exactly what I say.

169
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,349
Gold don't carry any curse with it.

170
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,477
It all depends on whether or not
the guy who finds it is the right guy.

171
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,146
The way I see it...

172
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,832
gold can be as much of a blessing
as a curse.

173
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:11,552
Look who's coming out
of the Hotel Bristol.

174
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,072
Is that Pat McCormick
or am I seeing things?

175
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,312
It's him.

176
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,832
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.

177
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,877
Why don't you and me
go and buy me something?

178
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,188
I could use a new pair of shoes.

179
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,509
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.

180
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,192
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.

181
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,792
López. I want you guys
to come and have a drink with me.

182
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,676
I've got business
to attend to with these men.

183
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,352
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.

184
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,108
Okay.

185
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,666
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?

186
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,794
I've been looking all over for you.

187
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,517
Three shots of rye.

188
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,190
Make mine brandy, Three Star.

189
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,712
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.

190
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,149
I suppose you're wondering
about that money that's coming to you.

191
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:05,196
The fact is I haven't been paid off
on that contract myself.

192
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,271
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.

193
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,952
It will come through by Monday
and we can set out Friday.

194
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:13,596
Here's mud in your eye.

195
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:19,157
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.

196
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,593
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.

197
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:24,715
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25°/o.

198
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,117
I guess I can make it 30°/o.

199
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,995
And the balance, say,
the middle of next week?

200
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,431
Nothing doing. Right here and now.

201
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,510
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.

202
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,237
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?

203
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,593
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.

204
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,589
If you want to get us liquored up...

205
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:43,193
No, I'm just inviting you
to have a friendly drink with me.

206
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:49,193
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.

207
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,668
Yeah, give us our money.

208
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,637
I can't see.

209
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,433
$50. $100.

210
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:05,433
$200.

211
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,513
$300.

212
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:10,386
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.

213
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,708
Let's beat it before the law arrives.

214
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,158
Here's for the drinks
and the use of the cantina.

215
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:26,554
- You know something, Curt?
- What?

216
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,155
We ain't very smart,
hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.

217
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,237
Money's getting shorter every day...

218
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,230
and soon we'll be right back
where we were, on the bum again...

219
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:39,674
pushing guys for dimes,
sleeping around in freight cars.

220
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:41,990
That's right. Got any ideas?

221
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:45,991
That old man in the Oso Negro
started me to thinking.

222
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,033
What about?

223
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:49,427
Why not try gold-digging for a change?

224
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,112
It ain't any riskier
than waiting around here for a break...

225
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,395
and this is the country where the nuggets
of gold are crying for you...

226
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:59,232
to take them out of the ground,
make them shinin' coins...

227
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,711
on the fingers and necks of swell dames.

228
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,394
One thing, living in the open is cheaper
than it is here in Tampico.

229
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,388
Our money'd last longer.

230
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:10,993
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance
of digging something up would be.

231
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:12,830
We'd have to have equipment, all right.

232
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:17,070
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.

233
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,475
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.

234
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,755
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.

235
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,590
You can't tell
about some of those old guys.

236
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:28,317
It's surprising sometimes
how tough they are.

237
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,628
I don't know what gold looks like
in the ground.

238
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:34,154
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows
and people's mouths.

239
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:36,628
You know anything about prospecting?

240
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,154
Not much when you come right down to it.

241
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:42,150
We might have real use
for an experienced guy like that old-timer.

242
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,229
Let's go hunt him up right away.

243
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,638
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.

244
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:51,186
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.

245
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:53,553
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.

246
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:57,074
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.

247
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,547
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.

248
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,674
If you don't take a risk,
you can't make a gain.

249
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,316
How much dough you guys got to put in?

250
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:05,832
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.

251
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,388
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools,
weapons and essential provisions.

252
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:10,706
What do we need weapons for?

253
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:12,629
Meat's one thing and bandits another.

254
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,755
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.

255
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,068
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?

256
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:19,746
Not a red cent.

257
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:24,797
Give me my money, señor!

258
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,869
10°/o I get for selling the winning ticket.

259
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,027
Get away from me, will you?

260
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:30,154
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number...

261
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,751
gives a present to the seller...

262
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,157
I don't want any lottery ticket!

263
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,991
If you don't, you have bad luck
the rest of your life.

264
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,036
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?

265
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,428
Why, he's trying to tell you
he sold you the winning ticket.

266
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,276
Hey, wait a minute.

267
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,151
This what you mean?

268
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,788
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.

269
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,391
Where?

270
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,116
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.

271
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:56,190
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

272
00:19:56,318 --> 00:20:00,436
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.

273
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,793
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.

274
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,632
Here, son, here's a present for you
with my blessing.

275
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:11,072
Would you like to shake the hand
that bought that ticket?

276
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:13,149
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

277
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:15,433
You stand to profit out of this
the same as I do.

278
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,473
How do you make that out?

279
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,834
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?

280
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,987
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

281
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:24,275
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.

282
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:27,873
If we make a find,
we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.

283
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,392
If not, the difference
between what you and I put up...

284
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:33,151
ain't enough to keep me
from being where I was this afternoon:

285
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,627
Polishing a bench
with the seat of my pants.

286
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:37,276
Put her there, part.

287
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,234
We'll buy our burros at Perla and
head northwest away from the railroad.

288
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:56,910
It's no use looking near a railroad...

289
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,351
or any kind of a road at all...

290
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:01,987
because construction engineers examine
every bit of ground around the road...

291
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,193
while they're building them.

292
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:04,870
We got to go where there's no trails...

293
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,156
where no surveyor or anyone who knows
anything of prospecting has been before.

294
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,557
The best place to go to is...

295
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:14,790
where any salaried person wouldn't go,
because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.

296
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,269
I got three of them!
How many did you get?

297
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:19,713
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.

298
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,026
I got three. Nice shooting?

299
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,837
That bullet hole's two inches
from my head. That was close.

300
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,113
The bullets were sure flying
thick and fast in here.

301
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,756
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.

302
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:31,194
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.

303
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,633
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.

304
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,948
Big boulder on the track so train stop.

305
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,553
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers
on the train waiting for them.

306
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:40,991
Not many passengers get killed.

307
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:42,636
Here's where we're bound for.

308
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:44,993
Don't show whether there's mountain,
swamp or desert.

309
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:47,308
That shows the makers of the map
don't know.

310
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,787
Once on the ground,
we open our eyes and look around.

311
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,597
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow...

312
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:55,397
who could smell gold
like a jackass can smell water.

313
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,512
What's all that about?

314
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:46,748
We're going into country
very wild and dangerous.

315
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,032
Have to cut through jungles...

316
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:50,757
and climb mountains so high
they rise above the clouds.

317
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:54,717
Tigers so strong they can climb trees
with burros in their mouths. Good.

318
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,552
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it
means few outsiders have set foot there.

319
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,356
Well, let's get going.

320
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:08,787
If there was gold in them mountains,
how long would it have been there?

321
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:11,517
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?

322
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:13,111
What's our hurry?

323
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,028
A couple of days more or less
ain't going to make any difference.

324
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:19,388
Remember what you said
back in Tampico...

325
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,436
about having to pack that old man
on our backs?

326
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:28,754
That was when I took him
for an ordinary human being...

327
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:30,397
not part goat.

328
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,194
Look at him climb, will you?

329
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,388
What gets me is how he can go all day
in the sun without any water.

330
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:43,469
Maybe he's part camel, too.

331
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:46,154
If I'd known what prospecting meant...

332
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:50,026
I'd have stayed in Tampico
and waited for another job to turn up.

333
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:58,673
- What's the matter?
- Look.

334
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:04,073
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...

335
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,427
Gold.

336
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,427
Come back, we've found something!

337
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,390
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it,
here, in this rock.

338
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,668
Look here. Look, it's all around.

339
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:23,597
What else could it be?

340
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:26,153
Only gold shines and glitters like that.

341
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,510
We've struck it, Curt.

342
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,667
Look, from the looks of things...

343
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:35,356
we've struck it rich.

344
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:37,550
Look, it's all over here.

345
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,749
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.

346
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:40,907
- That's right.
- Howard!

347
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,192
Come on. Look.

348
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:45,955
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.

349
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,316
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner
for a carload.

350
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,437
It ain't gold?

351
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:53,230
Pyrite. Fool's gold.

352
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:55,748
Not that there ain't
plenty of the real stuff here.

353
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,715
We've walked over it four or five times.

354
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:00,187
A place yesterday looked like
rich diggings, but the water...

355
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:01,996
for washing the sand was 11 miles away.

356
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,514
The other places, there wasn't much gold
to pay us a good day's wages.

357
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,907
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me...

358
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:10,671
before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.

359
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,192
Sometimes it can be more precious
than gold.

360
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:14,867
Burro.

361
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:28,268
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.

362
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:30,435
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?

363
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,074
Big winds from the north
this time of year...

364
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:36,992
when they blow hard, this desert country
stands right up on its hind legs!

365
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,432
There's only a few more miles
of this heavy stuff.

366
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,827
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.

367
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,834
You fellows, how about some beans?

368
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,877
You want some beans?

369
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,631
Going through some mighty rough country
tomorrow. You better have some beans.

370
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:24,550
You know what I'm thinking?

371
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,194
I'm thinking we ought to give up...

372
00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:29,150
leave the whole outfit...

373
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:31,117
everything behind.

374
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:33,470
Go back to civilization.

375
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:37,147
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!

376
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:40,196
I got two elegant bedfellows
who kick at the first drop of rain...

377
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,667
and hide in the closet
when thunder rumbles.

378
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:44,191
What great prospectors.

379
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,587
Two shoe clerks reading
about prospecting for gold...

380
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:49,988
in the Land of the Midnight Sun,
south of the border or west of the Rockies.

381
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,194
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!

382
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,315
Go ahead, throw it. If you did,
you'd never leave this place alive.

383
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,310
Without me, you two would die here
more miserable than rats.

384
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,151
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?

385
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,911
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something,
my fine bedfellows.

386
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:08,434
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.

387
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:09,473
Look at each other.

388
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,994
Did you ever see anything like yourself
for being dumb specimens?

389
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:17,473
You're so dumb...

390
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,153
you don't even see the riches
you're treading on with your own feet.

391
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,393
Don't expect to find nuggets
of molten gold.

392
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:33,628
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.

393
00:30:33,718 --> 00:30:36,107
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.

394
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:38,234
Up there's where we've got to go.

395
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,749
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.

396
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:48,066
Gold, I mean.

397
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:49,796
Sure don't look like I thought it would.

398
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:53,314
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.

399
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,036
It don't glitter. I thought it would.

400
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,348
It will when it's refined by some other guy.

401
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,554
All we got to do is mine it
and get it back there.

402
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:02,994
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.

403
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,591
You got to know how to recognize it.

404
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:06,509
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.

405
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,112
Got to know how to tickle her
so she'll come out laughing.

406
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:11,109
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.

407
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:13,632
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.

408
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,591
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?

409
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:17,952
Depends on how hard we work.

410
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:20,029
We better pitch our camp
down the mountainside.

411
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:21,517
Why, when the digging's here?

412
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,476
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters,
and get away with it maybe.

413
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,550
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.

414
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,710
An emissary from a big mining company
would be here soon...

415
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:33,710
with a paper in his hand
showing we had no right to be here.

416
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:38,428
How does it feel to be men of property?

417
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:44,111
The tanks'll leak some at first...

418
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:47,031
until the boards begin to swell
and close the seams.

419
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,389
I sure had some cockeyed ideas
about prospecting for gold.

420
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,634
It was all in the finding, I thought.

421
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,756
I thought you just had to find it,
pick it up, put it in sacks...

422
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:00,669
and carry them off to the nearest bank.

423
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:03,716
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.

424
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,789
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.

425
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:07,357
Open the sluice gate.

426
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,388
How much do you figure it to be now?

427
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,030
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.

428
00:32:50,238 --> 00:32:52,593
When are we going to start dividing it up?

429
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:56,397
Anytime you say.

430
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,151
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.

431
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,433
We're all going back together
when the time comes.

432
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:04,351
Why not wait till we get paid
and then divide the money?

433
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,554
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.

434
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:08,947
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.

435
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,317
Make each guy responsible
for his own goods.

436
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:14,429
I'd just as soon have it that way.

437
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:17,316
I don't like the responsibility
of guarding your treasure.

438
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,717
Who asked you to?

439
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,548
That's right. You never asked me.

440
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,550
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy
of the three.

441
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:25,713
You?

442
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:28,233
How come?

443
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:32,192
I said the most trustworthy. As far as
being the most honest, no one can say.

444
00:33:33,318 --> 00:33:34,637
I don't get you.

445
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:37,027
Suppose you're charged
of taking care of the goods.

446
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:40,428
One day I'm deep in the brush
and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.

447
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,316
That'd be your chance to pack up
and leave us in the cold.

448
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,596
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would
think me likely to do a thing like that.

449
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:50,115
Right now, it wouldn't be
worth your while...

450
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:54,111
but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces,
think of such things you will.

451
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,511
How's about yourself?

452
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,831
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.

453
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,954
You're a lot tougher
than when we started out.

454
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,427
By the time the pile's grown
to be really tempting...

455
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,270
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.

456
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:07,428
You'd catch me
and string me up in no time.

457
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:09,827
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.

458
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,988
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.

459
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:13,909
Maybe it'd be a good idea...

460
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,148
to cut the proceeds up
three ways every night.

461
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:18,547
It'll relieve you of a responsibility
you don't like.

462
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:19,753
Swell by me.

463
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,430
After we got a couple of hundred ounces...

464
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,873
it'll be a nuisance
carrying bags around our necks.

465
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,950
Each of us will have to hide his share
from the others.

466
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:31,429
And after that, he'll have to be forever
on watch that his hiding place's not found.

467
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:33,713
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.

468
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:37,516
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas...

469
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,431
even supposedly decent people get
when gold's at stake.

470
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:41,707
All right.

471
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:44,790
Here she goes three ways.

472
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:02,713
Dobbs!

473
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,471
Howard, come quick!

474
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,911
He's coming around.

475
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:14,277
Lay still a minute
till you get your senses back.

476
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:16,392
What happened?

477
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:19,074
Part of the mine caved in on you.

478
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,316
Got a knock on the head.

479
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:28,917
No bones broken?

480
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,351
I don't think so.

481
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:34,194
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.

482
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,749
I owe my life to you, partner.

483
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,107
Forget it.

484
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,188
What'll you do
with your hard-earned money...

485
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:56,916
when we get back and cash in?

486
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:59,671
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end...

487
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:02,795
when it comes to a hard day's work,
but I'm not the man I was once.

488
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:06,393
Next year, next month, next week,
by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.

489
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,355
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place...

490
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,713
get a little business, hardware,
grocery store...

491
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:13,915
spend the better part of my time
reading comics and adventure stories.

492
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,387
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again...

493
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:18,912
wasting time and money
trying to find another gold mine.

494
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,034
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?

495
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:24,076
I figure on buying some land
and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.

496
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:26,353
How did you come to settle on peaches?

497
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,037
One summer, when I was a kid...

498
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:31,110
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest
in the San Joaquin Valley.

499
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:33,629
Boy, it sure was something.

500
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:35,795
Hundreds of people, old and young.

501
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:37,989
Whole families working together.

502
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:39,796
At night, after a day's work...

503
00:38:39,878 --> 00:38:43,188
we used to build big bonfires
and sit around and sing to guitar music.

504
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,349
Till morning sometimes.

505
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:49,268
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing,
and go to sleep again.

506
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,069
Everybody had a wonderful time.

507
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:56,036
Ever since then I've had a hankering
to be a fruit grower.

508
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:58,951
It must be grand
watching your own trees put on leaves...

509
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,994
come into blossom and bear.

510
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:05,037
Watching the fruit get big
and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.

511
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,755
What's all that about?

512
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,876
We're telling each other
what we aim to do when we get back.

513
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:15,548
Now me, I got it all figured out
what I'm gonna do.

514
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,515
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.

515
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,556
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath
to sweat and soak...

516
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:23,675
till I get all the grime and dirt
out of my system.

517
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:27,713
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and
gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.

518
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,197
Dozen of everything.

519
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:31,867
Then I'm going to a swell cafe...

520
00:39:32,398 --> 00:39:35,470
order everything on the bill o' fare
and if it ain't just right...

521
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:37,992
or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out...

522
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:40,148
and make him take the whole thing back.

523
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:41,797
What's next on the program?

524
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,030
Well, what would be?

525
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:56,914
If I were you, I wouldn't talk
or think about women.

526
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:59,034
It ain't good for your health.

527
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:03,147
Yeah, maybe you're right,
seeing how the prospects are far off.

528
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:04,432
You know what?

529
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,118
We ought to put a limit on our take,
agree between us...

530
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:09,268
when we get so much
we pull up stakes and beat it.

531
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,555
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.

532
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:15,106
$25,000, small potatoes.

533
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:16,707
How much do you say?

534
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:19,312
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.

535
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:22,515
That'd take a year if the vein held out,
which wouldn't be likely.

536
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:25,874
What's a year more or less
when that kind of money is to be had?

537
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,392
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.

538
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:30,355
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.

539
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:32,827
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.

540
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:34,715
I need dough and plenty of it.

541
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,351
$25,000 in one piece...

542
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,429
is more than I ever expected
to get my hands on.

543
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:40,553
Small potatoes.

544
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,754
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.

545
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,306
Hog, am I?

546
00:40:45,438 --> 00:40:47,633
Maybe you don't know,
but I'd be within my rights...

547
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:50,152
if I demanded half again
as much as you get.

548
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,193
How come?

549
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:54,076
There's no denying I put up
the lion's share of the cash.

550
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:57,195
So you did, Dobbsie,
and I always meant to pay you back.

551
00:40:57,278 --> 00:41:01,066
In any civilized place the biggest investor
gets the biggest return, don't he?

552
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:03,588
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.

553
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,268
Not that I intended to demand it,
but I'd be within my rights if I did.

554
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:09,269
Next time you call me a hog
just remember...

555
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,950
what I could've done if I'd wanted to.

556
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:14,075
I think it'd be wise not to put things
strictly on a money basis.

557
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:17,150
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.

558
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:28,392
I just don't like being called a hog,
that's all.

559
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,553
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.

560
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:13,071
Out for a midnight stroll?

561
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,114
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.

562
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:17,075
- So?
- What's the matter?

563
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:20,833
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.

564
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:36,876
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.

565
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:41,352
Where is Dobbs?

566
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,872
Poking around in the dark out there.

567
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:49,549
He's sure taking a long time out there.

568
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,388
I think I'll go have a look-see.

569
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,837
Where's Curtin?

570
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:19,915
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.

571
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:48,830
It's my turn again but I won't take it...

572
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,432
if you stop worrying
about your goods and go to bed.

573
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:53,190
We got work to do tomorrow.

574
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,715
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.

575
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:11,271
I'm not that dumb.

576
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:14,474
The day you try to put anything
over on me...

577
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:17,026
it'll be a costly one for both of you.

578
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,507
Any more lip out of you
and I'll up and let you have it.

579
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:36,148
If you know what's good for you, you
won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.

580
00:44:39,758 --> 00:44:42,670
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.

581
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,988
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.

582
00:44:45,078 --> 00:44:46,989
He's just spoiling for trouble.

583
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,428
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.

584
00:44:56,518 --> 00:44:58,668
"How about you going to the village?"

585
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,228
Who does Howard think he is,
ordering me around?

586
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:02,512
What's that, Dobbs?

587
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:03,872
- Nothing.
- Better look out.

588
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,914
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.

589
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,636
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?

590
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,390
Certainly not you or Curtin.

591
00:45:09,478 --> 00:45:11,946
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?

592
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:13,391
Blow it out, it'll do you good.

593
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,992
Don't think you two
are putting anything over on me.

594
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:18,034
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.

595
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,267
You know more than I do.

596
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,395
Why am I elected to go to the village
instead of you or Curtin?

597
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:25,868
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.

598
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:26,993
The two days I'd be gone...

599
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:29,797
would give you lots of time
to discover where my goods are.

600
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:31,152
If you fear along those lines...

601
00:45:31,238 --> 00:45:32,876
why don't you take your goods with you?

602
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,677
And run the risk of having them
taken from me by bandits?

603
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:37,908
If you run into them,
you'd be out of luck anyway.

604
00:45:37,998 --> 00:45:40,148
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.

605
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:43,470
So that's it. Everything's clear now.

606
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:45,550
You're hoping bandits will get me.

607
00:45:45,678 --> 00:45:48,067
That would save you a lot of trouble,
wouldn't it?

608
00:45:48,158 --> 00:45:50,718
And your consciences
wouldn't bother you none neither.

609
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,514
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.

610
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:22,917
Just like I thought.

611
00:46:22,998 --> 00:46:25,068
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.

612
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:30,275
I've a good mind to haul off
and pump you up, chest and belly alike.

613
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,314
Would you mind telling me
what this is about?

614
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,389
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.

615
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:35,627
Well, I'll be.

616
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:39,748
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?

617
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,306
Seems like I accidentally stumbled
on Dobbsie's treasure.

618
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:45,390
Accidentally? Why were you trying
to pry up that rock?

619
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:47,275
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.

620
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:48,711
Brother, I got to hand it to you.

621
00:46:48,798 --> 00:46:51,517
You can certainly pick up a good story
when you need one.

622
00:46:52,238 --> 00:46:55,514
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.

623
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,518
Let's see you stick your hand in
and get your goods out.

624
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:00,509
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.

625
00:47:01,438 --> 00:47:02,507
But you try any bad moves...

626
00:47:02,598 --> 00:47:05,271
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.

627
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:07,030
Reach in and get your goods.

628
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:09,837
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow,
won't we, Howard?

629
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:14,549
They never let go, do they, Howard,
once they grab onto you?

630
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:19,633
You can cut them in two and the head
will still hang on till sundown, I hear.

631
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:22,676
By that time the victim
doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.

632
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,669
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.

633
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:27,956
Why don't you stick your hand in
and get your treasure?

634
00:47:28,038 --> 00:47:29,437
Couldn't be because you're scared...

635
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:31,634
after the way you've been shooting
your mouth off?

636
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:32,628
Show us you ain't yellow.

637
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:35,471
I'd hate to think my partner
had a yellow streak up his back.

638
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:37,867
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...

639
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:41,390
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.

640
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:44,436
Another bad move out of you
and I'll blow you to kingdom come.

641
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:47,112
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?

642
00:49:33,878 --> 00:49:35,709
The federales are very efficient.

643
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:39,948
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?

644
00:49:40,038 --> 00:49:42,427
Yeah, seems between them
they had a diamond ring...

645
00:49:42,518 --> 00:49:44,827
pearl earrings, a lot of money
and a railway ticket...

646
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,352
with the date of the Aguascalientes
train robbery on it.

647
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:49,747
They've been here several days,
drinking, shooting...

648
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,432
The villagers are afraid
to go out of their huts.

649
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,110
Where are they taking them now?

650
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:55,711
To the cemetery.

651
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:09,832
The federales
don't operate in our American way.

652
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:13,115
They're not fingerprint experts,
but they can follow any trail.

653
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:15,314
Against them, no hideout is any use.

654
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:17,673
They know all the tricks of the bandits.

655
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:20,226
You can bet your sweet soul
they'll trace down...

656
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,071
every last one of that group
that attacked the train.

657
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:26,150
It'll take time,
months maybe, but they'll do it.

658
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,750
Not many Americans get around this way.

659
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:34,874
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.

660
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:35,947
That so?

661
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:38,632
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.

662
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:40,593
My name's Cody.

663
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:42,907
I'm from Texas.

664
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:46,155
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.

665
00:50:46,238 --> 00:50:48,149
- Professional?
- Yeah.

666
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:49,872
What all do you hunt?

667
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,906
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.

668
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:56,113
How long did you say
you'd been in these mountains?

669
00:50:56,198 --> 00:50:57,233
A few months.

670
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:00,116
Ever seen anything
that looked like pay dirt?

671
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,669
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods
up in those mountains.

672
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,474
No, I know
the whole landscape around here.

673
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:09,992
If there'd been gold,
you can bet I'd have seen it.

674
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:11,875
There's nothing doing here for gold.

675
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,949
I can look at a hill five miles away...

676
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,393
and tell you if it carries
an ounce or a shipload.

677
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:18,666
If you haven't found anything...

678
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,430
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.

679
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,873
There's indications in the valley,
lots of indications.

680
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,188
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge...

681
00:51:25,278 --> 00:51:26,791
washed down by the tropical rains.

682
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:28,914
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.

683
00:51:31,438 --> 00:51:32,917
So much for those bandits.

684
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:37,110
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans
when it comes to swift justice.

685
00:51:37,198 --> 00:51:39,314
Once the federales get their mitts
on a criminal...

686
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:42,515
they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.

687
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:43,667
When he's dug deep enough...

688
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:47,228
they tell him to put the shovel down,
smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.

689
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:50,988
In another five minutes he's being covered
over with the earth he dug out.

690
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:53,831
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.

691
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:08,549
I meant what I said about going along
with you. Those are my burros.

692
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:11,835
I'm ready to start
if you'll let me go with you to your camp.

693
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,307
Thanks anyway,
but I prefer going it by myself.

694
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:15,712
Good luck.

695
00:52:27,638 --> 00:52:31,153
I went way around, stayed on hard ground
which wouldn't show the tracks.

696
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:34,708
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.

697
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:37,551
I guess it's only a matter of time
till he shows up here.

698
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:41,507
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.

699
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:45,193
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent
and then report us to the officials.

700
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:48,588
Once they come, we can't stay
or take our goods with us if we left.

701
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:51,397
There's nothing else to do
but kill him the minute he appears.

702
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:52,911
No crime to visit these mountains.

703
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:56,070
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.

704
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:57,989
If you were to shoot him
it might come out.

705
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,830
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.

706
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:02,830
We can push him off a rock
and claim it was an accident.

707
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,749
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?

708
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:05,953
We'll toss for it.

709
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:08,748
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?

710
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,351
- Absolutely.
- How come?

711
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:12,110
Because there he is.

712
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:30,515
Come over by the fire.

713
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:42,547
I know quite well,
you fellas, I'm not wanted here.

714
00:53:42,638 --> 00:53:43,832
Even after what you told me...

715
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:46,716
I couldn't resist the desire
to sit and jaw with an American.

716
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:49,312
Why don't you go where Americans
want to talk to you?

717
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:50,513
Durango isn't too far off.

718
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:53,271
They got one
of them American clubs there.

719
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,077
I'm not after that.

720
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,076
I've got other things on my mind,
more important.

721
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:01,275
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.

722
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:03,110
Our biggest worry is your presence here.

723
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,313
We got no use for you.

724
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,992
We don't even want you
for a cook or a dishwasher.

725
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:08,751
No vacancies, understand?

726
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:12,789
In case I don't make myself clear,
you'll be doing yourself a favor...

727
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,948
packing up and getting out
tomorrow morning.

728
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:18,075
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.

729
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:20,513
Thanks.

730
00:54:21,278 --> 00:54:24,793
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.

731
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:27,391
Tonight, you're our guest.

732
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:30,117
But tomorrow morning...

733
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:33,270
Iook out, no trespassing around here,
you know?

734
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:34,951
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?

735
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:43,109
I got myself five foxes and a lion
while you were away at the village.

736
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,269
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.

737
00:54:45,558 --> 00:54:48,072
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.

738
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:51,230
Excuse me for butting in, but there's
no game here worth going after.

739
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:52,956
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter...

740
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:55,677
to clean up all around
for five miles in each direction.

741
00:54:57,758 --> 00:54:59,396
Yes, there's no good hunting here.

742
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:01,196
That's why we made up our mind
to leave...

743
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:03,155
so that we could look
for something better.

744
00:55:03,238 --> 00:55:05,593
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.

745
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,236
It took us some time to find it out.

746
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:08,717
Poor ground, you say?

747
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:10,670
Depends on what you're looking for.

748
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:12,193
For game, yes.

749
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:14,788
Mighty good ground for something else.

750
00:55:15,998 --> 00:55:17,317
What might that be?

751
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:19,033
Gold.

752
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,467
That's a good one.

753
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,913
I told you in the village,
there's no gold around here.

754
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:32,149
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.

755
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:35,947
If you haven't found any gold here,
you're not as smart as you appear to be.

756
00:55:36,038 --> 00:55:38,188
Well, maybe, you're right.

757
00:55:38,478 --> 00:55:39,433
Who knows?

758
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:43,432
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.

759
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:45,477
Guess I'll sleep on it.

760
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:47,517
I'll hit the hay.

761
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:49,273
Yeah. Me, too.

762
00:55:49,918 --> 00:55:51,397
See you in the morning, mister.

763
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:09,357
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?

764
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:11,906
Whether he is or not,
he looks fairly harmless to me.

765
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,037
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.

766
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,149
I'm keeping my boots on this night.

767
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:22,547
Might take it in his head
to murder us in our sleep.

768
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:25,710
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?

769
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:28,471
You guys go to sleep
and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.

770
00:56:28,558 --> 00:56:30,037
Then you both can take your turns.

771
00:56:30,118 --> 00:56:32,393
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.

772
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:03,026
Good morning, friend.

773
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:07,029
Where'd you get the water
to make coffee?

774
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:09,268
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?

775
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,747
We didn't carry that water here
for you to make coffee.

776
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:14,955
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.

777
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:16,517
I'll fill it up for you.

778
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:17,707
What's up?

779
00:57:18,078 --> 00:57:19,909
I caught this guy stealing our water.

780
00:57:20,198 --> 00:57:23,270
The next time I'll let it out of you
through little round holes.

781
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,748
I thought I was among civilized men
who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.

782
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:28,351
Who's not civilized?

783
00:57:35,278 --> 00:57:37,269
I could easily do the same for you.

784
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:39,474
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.

785
00:57:40,078 --> 00:57:41,272
This time I took it.

786
00:57:41,598 --> 00:57:42,997
Thanks for your kind attention.

787
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:46,229
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.

788
00:57:46,478 --> 00:57:47,831
I mean to stay right here.

789
00:57:47,918 --> 00:57:50,034
The brush and the mountains are free,
aren't they?

790
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:52,586
Sure. That's right,
whoever's first on the spot.

791
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,714
That holds for hunters,
but not for gold miners.

792
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,187
Unless they have happened
to have registered their claim.

793
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:58,791
Who says we have a claim to register?

794
00:57:58,878 --> 00:58:02,234
Whatever you say or don't say,
tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.

795
00:58:11,382 --> 00:58:13,657
I know you guys
can bump me off any minute...

796
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:16,336
but that's a risk worth running
considering the stakes.

797
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:18,060
Let's lay all our cards on the table.

798
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:20,576
As I see it, you guys have to do
one of three things:

799
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:23,699
kill me, run me off
or take me in with you as a partner.

800
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:25,659
Let's consider the first.

801
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:28,814
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.

802
00:58:28,902 --> 00:58:29,937
If you start killing them...

803
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:32,456
how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.

804
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,739
Also, don't forget,
the one actually to do the bumping off...

805
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:38,177
would forever be in the power
of the other two.

806
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:41,334
The only safe way would be
for all of you to drag out your cannons...

807
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:43,731
and bang away at the same instant
like a firing squad.

808
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:46,290
We wouldn't stop at anything
to protect our interests.

809
00:58:46,382 --> 00:58:47,861
I claim killing me isn't it.

810
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:51,178
But, of course, that's for you to decide.

811
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,461
As for choice number two...

812
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,533
you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.

813
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:57,340
We'd get you if you did that.

814
00:58:57,502 --> 00:59:00,016
We'd get you
if we had to go all the way to China.

815
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:03,174
25°/o of the value
of your find is the reward I'd get.

816
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:05,059
And that would be mighty tempting.

817
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,976
It's a strong argument
in favor of number one.

818
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:09,461
I don't deny it.

819
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:11,373
But let's see
what number three has to offer.

820
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:14,455
If you take me in as a partner,
you don't stand to lose anything.

821
00:59:14,702 --> 00:59:18,251
I'll not ask a share in what you've made
so far, only in the profits to come.

822
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:21,101
What do you say?

823
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:26,215
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over
among ourselves?

824
00:59:26,302 --> 00:59:27,496
Not at all. Go ahead.

825
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:29,613
I have to look after my burros anyway.

826
00:59:43,702 --> 00:59:46,296
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.

827
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,532
Either we bump him off
or make him a partner.

828
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:51,216
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy
that likes being taken advantage of.

829
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:52,895
Do the mug in, I say.

830
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:54,416
He told us how, didn't he?

831
00:59:54,502 --> 00:59:56,697
All of us hold out our cannons
and let him have it.

832
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:58,420
What do we gain by bumping him off?

833
00:59:58,502 --> 01:00:00,857
If he was asking to share in what we made
it'd be different.

834
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:02,614
I don't mind being taken advantage of...

835
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:04,499
if it isn't money out of my pocket.

836
01:00:04,582 --> 01:00:05,981
And whoever else comes along...

837
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:08,735
they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?

838
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:11,462
You got a point there.
No question about that.

839
01:00:12,502 --> 01:00:13,491
But killing...

840
01:00:13,582 --> 01:00:16,813
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.

841
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:21,021
Let the majority decide.

842
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:24,261
What's your vote, partner?

843
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:25,810
For or against?

844
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,017
For.

845
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:36,898
Let's make it short and sweet for him.

846
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:15,773
So it's number one, is it?

847
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:18,092
Better take a look down that hill first.

848
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:31,896
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.

849
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:33,700
So that's your stinking game, is it?

850
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:36,774
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.

851
01:01:36,862 --> 01:01:39,092
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.

852
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:40,331
What's that?

853
01:01:40,422 --> 01:01:42,652
If it's what I think it is,
may the Lord be with us.

854
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:46,371
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.

855
01:01:46,462 --> 01:01:49,101
Some villager must have told them
about the American hunter.

856
01:01:49,182 --> 01:01:52,379
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.

857
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:54,896
We better start thinking
of a way to defend ourselves.

858
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:58,258
We can hide in the rocks but
we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.

859
01:01:58,342 --> 01:02:00,014
The best thing is to fight.

860
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:02,377
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout...

861
01:02:02,462 --> 01:02:04,453
for the time being
and watch their movements.

862
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:06,931
You herd all the burros
in that thicket there.

863
01:02:07,022 --> 01:02:10,537
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings
and dump them in the trench.

864
01:02:47,022 --> 01:02:48,660
They're turning onto the trail.

865
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:50,778
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.

866
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:53,660
They'll be an hour getting here
so we better eat something.

867
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,495
Come on down, friend.

868
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:56,091
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?

869
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:58,093
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.

870
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:00,377
They think whoever was here is gone.

871
01:04:04,742 --> 01:04:07,176
Some want to go back down
the mountains, others want to stay...

872
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:09,856
and use this site as headquarters
to raid the villages.

873
01:04:09,942 --> 01:04:11,170
How about pouring it into them?

874
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:14,618
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.

875
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:35,016
We are federales.

876
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:37,538
You know, the mounted police.

877
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:40,132
If you are the police,
where are your badges?

878
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:42,941
Badges? We ain't got no badges.

879
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:45,574
We don't need no badges.

880
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:48,017
I don't have to show you
any stinking badges.

881
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:50,093
Better not come any closer.

882
01:04:52,982 --> 01:04:54,938
We didn't try to do you any harm.

883
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:57,457
Why don't you try to be
a little more polite?

884
01:04:57,662 --> 01:05:00,540
Give us your gun
and we'll leave you in peace.

885
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,774
I need my gun myself.

886
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:06,378
Throw that old iron over here.

887
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:08,657
We'll pick it up and go on our way.

888
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:11,540
You go anyway without my gun,
and go quick.

889
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,172
All right.

890
01:05:38,742 --> 01:05:41,779
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.

891
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:45,419
We don't want to get your gun
for nothing. We want to buy it.

892
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:49,813
Look, I have a gold watch
with a gold chain...

893
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:51,781
made in your own country.

894
01:05:52,022 --> 01:05:56,015
The watch and the chain,
they're worth at least 200 pesos.

895
01:05:56,622 --> 01:05:58,214
I'll change it for your gun.

896
01:05:59,262 --> 01:06:01,935
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.

897
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:04,053
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.

898
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:08,131
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?

899
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,371
I'll show you.

900
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:29,175
Anybody get hurt?

901
01:07:30,622 --> 01:07:32,180
Looks like we won that round.

902
01:07:32,942 --> 01:07:36,696
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.

903
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:39,171
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.

904
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:42,493
Since they know there's four guns,
they'll be more determined than ever.

905
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:46,495
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.

906
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:50,295
Cody, are you all right?

907
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:39,457
He's dead.

908
01:08:41,142 --> 01:08:43,053
Got it right through the neck.

909
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:45,457
One less gun.

910
01:08:50,262 --> 01:08:52,412
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.

911
01:08:53,382 --> 01:08:55,737
If they're up to what I think they are,
it ain't funny.

912
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:57,938
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.

913
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:59,137
An old Indian trick.

914
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:02,214
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.

915
01:09:02,302 --> 01:09:06,500
I'd be willing to trade my share of the
mine right now for a few hand grenades.

916
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,533
You'd better get to your posts.

917
01:09:30,942 --> 01:09:32,773
They're beating it.

918
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:42,775
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

919
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:45,857
Wait a minute,
this may be some trick to lure us out.

920
01:09:45,942 --> 01:09:49,332
I don't think so. They ain't
good enough actors for this kind of a trick.

921
01:10:05,662 --> 01:10:07,892
Hey, partner. Up here.

922
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:10,451
Here's a sight if there ever was one.

923
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:24,732
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.

924
01:10:24,822 --> 01:10:28,212
They must've gotten it from the villagers
there were bandits headed here.

925
01:10:28,302 --> 01:10:30,179
Why don't they wait here,
make a fight of it?

926
01:10:30,262 --> 01:10:31,741
They know all the tricks, that's why.

927
01:10:31,822 --> 01:10:35,053
With us behind and the federales facing
them, they wouldn't have a chance.

928
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:36,734
Go get them, sic 'em time.

929
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:39,734
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.

930
01:10:39,822 --> 01:10:40,732
Am I happy.

931
01:10:40,822 --> 01:10:43,461
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.

932
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:46,734
I wonder who he is.

933
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:50,620
And if he's got any folks.

934
01:10:50,702 --> 01:10:51,896
Supposing he has?

935
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:53,973
Let's take a look at his belongings.

936
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:16,061
A few hundred pesos.

937
01:11:17,262 --> 01:11:20,060
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.

938
01:11:21,462 --> 01:11:24,056
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.

939
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,380
Reckon she's his girl.

940
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:29,576
Not bad.

941
01:11:31,342 --> 01:11:34,015
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.

942
01:11:34,302 --> 01:11:38,136
"It was such a relief to get word
after so many months of...

943
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:40,497
"silence.

944
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:44,096
"I realize, of course, that...

945
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:49,018
"there aren't any mailboxes
that you can drop a letter in...

946
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:52,217
"out there in the wild."

947
01:11:52,662 --> 01:11:54,015
You better read it.

948
01:11:54,662 --> 01:11:57,415
"But that doesn't keep me
from worrying about you.

949
01:11:58,742 --> 01:12:03,099
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses
his daddy almost as much as I do.

950
01:12:03,422 --> 01:12:05,936
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '

951
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:09,580
"You say if you do not make
a real find this time...

952
01:12:09,662 --> 01:12:11,141
"you'll never go again.

953
01:12:11,622 --> 01:12:14,739
"I cannot begin to tell you
how my heart rejoices...

954
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:17,532
"at those words, if you really mean them.

955
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:20,577
"Now I feel free to tell you...

956
01:12:20,822 --> 01:12:23,416
"I've never thought
any material treasure...

957
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:28,140
"no matter how great, is worth the pain
of these long separations.

958
01:12:29,982 --> 01:12:32,894
"The country is especially lovely this year.

959
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:36,699
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.

960
01:12:37,302 --> 01:12:39,418
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.

961
01:12:40,062 --> 01:12:42,178
"The upper orchard looks aflame...

962
01:12:42,382 --> 01:12:44,896
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.

963
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,618
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.

964
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:50,372
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.

965
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:57,778
"Of course, I'm hoping
that you will at last strike it rich.

966
01:12:58,222 --> 01:12:59,735
"It is high time for luck...

967
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:01,899
"to start smiling upon you.

968
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,214
"But just in case she doesn't...

969
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:07,500
"remember we've already found
life's real treasure.

970
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:10,172
"Forever yours, Helen."

971
01:13:14,702 --> 01:13:16,897
I guess we better dig a hole for him.

972
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:29,931
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.

973
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:32,297
Want my opinion?
lt'll be a lot less from now on.

974
01:13:32,382 --> 01:13:34,134
We've taken
all the gold this mountain has.

975
01:13:34,222 --> 01:13:35,860
How much do you figure we got to date?

976
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:38,854
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.

977
01:13:38,942 --> 01:13:40,580
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.

978
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:44,337
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.

979
01:13:44,422 --> 01:13:46,140
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.

980
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,178
The sooner the better
as far as I'm concerned.

981
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:49,980
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.

982
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:53,054
It'll take a week to break the mine,
put the mountain back in shape.

983
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,097
Do what to the mountain?

984
01:13:54,182 --> 01:13:56,093
Make her look like
she was before we came.

985
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,217
I don't get it.

986
01:13:57,302 --> 01:13:59,736
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.

987
01:13:59,822 --> 01:14:03,258
The least we can do to show our gratitude
for all the wealth she's given us.

988
01:14:03,342 --> 01:14:05,776
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.

989
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:08,936
You talk about that mountain
like it was a real woman.

990
01:14:09,702 --> 01:14:12,421
She's been a lot better to me
than any woman I ever knew.

991
01:14:12,502 --> 01:14:15,255
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.

992
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:54,380
I reckon that's about everything.

993
01:14:54,462 --> 01:14:57,454
Each man's burros with his goods
will be his own responsibility.

994
01:14:57,542 --> 01:14:58,497
Come on.

995
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,014
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.

996
01:15:03,902 --> 01:15:06,291
Yeah, thanks, mountain.

997
01:15:31,262 --> 01:15:32,900
I've been thinking about her.

998
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,373
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.

999
01:15:36,102 --> 01:15:37,057
You know what?

1000
01:15:37,182 --> 01:15:40,857
We ought to give them a fourth just
as if he'd been our partner from the start.

1001
01:15:40,942 --> 01:15:42,660
What? A fourth of all our goods?

1002
01:15:42,942 --> 01:15:44,933
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?

1003
01:15:45,022 --> 01:15:48,094
If not for him, we wouldn't have
walked away from that mountain.

1004
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:49,092
Ask Howard.

1005
01:15:49,302 --> 01:15:51,452
The buzzard would have gotten fat
on us all right.

1006
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:54,010
Yeah, it might just as well have been
one of us.

1007
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:56,411
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.

1008
01:15:57,102 --> 01:15:59,411
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.

1009
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:02,892
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.

1010
01:16:02,982 --> 01:16:04,335
Fourth? Sure.

1011
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:07,380
You two guys must have been born
in a revival meeting.

1012
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:17,821
We got company.

1013
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,021
Steady, boys.

1014
01:16:54,382 --> 01:16:55,451
Coffee.

1015
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,701
Give him some tobacco.

1016
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:19,139
We give them our tobacco,
they give us theirs, I don't get it.

1017
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,292
Why not everybody smoke his own?

1018
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:23,614
Take some and thank them.

1019
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,734
They're after something.

1020
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,658
Takes them a while to come to the point.

1021
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,531
To say what you want right off the bat
isn't considered polite among Indians.

1022
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,938
They got nothing but time?

1023
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:41,701
His boy fell in the water,
they fished him out.

1024
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:44,421
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.

1025
01:18:45,782 --> 01:18:47,420
I'll go have a look at the boy.

1026
01:18:47,502 --> 01:18:50,414
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.

1027
01:18:58,622 --> 01:19:00,738
Look after my goods while I am gone.

1028
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:45,457
Tequila.

1029
01:22:09,702 --> 01:22:12,694
Artificial respiration did it
and a few Boy Scout tricks.

1030
01:22:12,782 --> 01:22:14,852
I think it was more shock than drowning.

1031
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:18,378
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.

1032
01:22:18,502 --> 01:22:21,699
How did these Indians know we were
in this neck of the woods anyhow?

1033
01:22:21,782 --> 01:22:25,695
When you're near their villages,
don't ask me how, they just know.

1034
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:55,297
What's up?

1035
01:22:55,382 --> 01:22:57,976
He's insisting we return to his village
and be his guests.

1036
01:22:58,062 --> 01:23:00,735
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.

1037
01:23:11,422 --> 01:23:14,141
If he doesn't pay off his debt
all the saints will be angry.

1038
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,655
This is no laughing matter.

1039
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:19,337
I'm afraid he's determined
to take us with him, even if it means force.

1040
01:23:19,422 --> 01:23:20,821
I'll handle this.

1041
01:23:26,222 --> 01:23:29,692
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way
out of this. Put your guns away.

1042
01:23:29,782 --> 01:23:33,491
Have every Indian in the mountain on
our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.

1043
01:23:42,382 --> 01:23:43,815
What'd he say then?

1044
01:23:43,942 --> 01:23:46,979
It didn't make any difference
about you guys but I have to come.

1045
01:23:47,062 --> 01:23:49,292
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.

1046
01:23:49,382 --> 01:23:50,781
Why don't you go with them?

1047
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:53,820
Stay a few days and we'll meet you
in Durango. We'll wait there.

1048
01:23:53,902 --> 01:23:56,336
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.

1049
01:23:56,422 --> 01:24:00,097
If they found out they might forget he was
their honored guest and bump him off.

1050
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,059
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?

1051
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:05,771
We'll take them with us if you want us to
and wait for you in Durango.

1052
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,658
I reckon that's about the only solution.

1053
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:13,371
I bet you'll remember this
the next time you try to do a good deed.

1054
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:16,734
Maybe after I've stayed with them
they'll give me a horse.

1055
01:24:16,822 --> 01:24:18,653
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.

1056
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:20,653
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.

1057
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:23,017
Yeah, all the luck in the world.

1058
01:24:23,222 --> 01:24:27,056
We'll be lonesome without you. But
my Sunday school teacher used to say:

1059
01:24:27,622 --> 01:24:30,819
"You got to learn to swallow
disappointments in this sad life."

1060
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:32,096
Hurry up and join us.

1061
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:35,140
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.

1062
01:24:35,222 --> 01:24:37,292
One of them squaws might marry you.

1063
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:41,098
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out
a good-looking squaw and marry her.

1064
01:24:41,182 --> 01:24:44,492
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.

1065
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:46,015
So long, partners.

1066
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:49,534
See you in Durango.

1067
01:25:46,422 --> 01:25:48,936
Ain't it always his burros
that won't march in line...

1068
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:52,731
stray off the trail and smash their packs
against the trees and rocks?

1069
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:57,455
I wish they'd stray off far enough
to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.

1070
01:25:57,982 --> 01:26:00,177
Why'd you offer
to carry his goods for him?

1071
01:26:00,262 --> 01:26:02,059
As if he couldn't manage by himself.

1072
01:26:02,142 --> 01:26:04,610
He knew what he was doing
when he turned them over to us.

1073
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,533
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?

1074
01:26:07,302 --> 01:26:10,499
What's the use of railing against
the old man? It won't do any good.

1075
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,335
Save your breath
for the next piece of trail.

1076
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:15,612
I'm stopping here for the night.

1077
01:26:15,782 --> 01:26:18,933
If you want to go on it's okay with me,
but take his burros with you.

1078
01:26:19,022 --> 01:26:20,501
They ain't my responsibility.

1079
01:26:20,582 --> 01:26:23,050
It's early. We can make four,
five miles more before dark.

1080
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:26,930
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.

1081
01:26:28,062 --> 01:26:29,336
Ordered me?

1082
01:26:30,582 --> 01:26:31,571
You?

1083
01:26:33,142 --> 01:26:35,212
Who's ordering who to do anything?

1084
01:26:35,662 --> 01:26:38,096
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.

1085
01:26:40,222 --> 01:26:42,656
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.

1086
01:26:45,342 --> 01:26:47,333
All right, if you can't go any further.

1087
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:49,174
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.

1088
01:26:49,262 --> 01:26:51,412
I can go four times
as far as a mug like you.

1089
01:26:51,502 --> 01:26:54,938
But I don't want to. I could if I want to,
but I don't want to, see, mug?

1090
01:26:58,142 --> 01:26:59,894
What's the use of hollering?

1091
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:03,179
We're started on something
and we've got to finish it, like it or not.

1092
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:04,775
We'll camp here.

1093
01:27:11,782 --> 01:27:13,818
Wonder what the old man's doing now.

1094
01:27:13,902 --> 01:27:17,577
Eating a meal of roast turkey
and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.

1095
01:27:17,662 --> 01:27:20,222
This is the first day we've had
to manage without his help.

1096
01:27:20,302 --> 01:27:22,577
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.

1097
01:27:22,662 --> 01:27:24,857
How far away
do you suppose the railroad is?

1098
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:27,581
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.

1099
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,375
I figure we can reach the high-pass
in two days more...

1100
01:27:31,462 --> 01:27:33,817
then it'll be three or four days
to the railroad.

1101
01:27:33,902 --> 01:27:36,735
That's figuring no hard luck
on the trail, of course.

1102
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:42,020
What's the joke, Dobbsie?

1103
01:27:43,742 --> 01:27:45,539
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

1104
01:27:45,622 --> 01:27:47,977
In on it? Sure I will.

1105
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:49,611
Sure.

1106
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:54,097
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?

1107
01:27:54,222 --> 01:27:57,055
I was thinking what a bonehead play
that old jackass made...

1108
01:27:57,142 --> 01:28:00,532
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?

1109
01:28:00,622 --> 01:28:03,375
Figured he'd let us do his sweating
for him, did he?

1110
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:06,136
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?

1111
01:28:07,222 --> 01:28:09,099
Can't you see? It's all ours.

1112
01:28:09,182 --> 01:28:12,140
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.

1113
01:28:12,942 --> 01:28:14,136
I don't follow you.

1114
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:16,690
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?

1115
01:28:16,782 --> 01:28:19,250
All right, to make it clear
to a dumbhead like you...

1116
01:28:19,342 --> 01:28:22,812
we take all his goods and go straight
up north and leave the jackass flat.

1117
01:28:22,902 --> 01:28:26,133
You aren't serious, are you? You don't
really mean what you are saying.

1118
01:28:26,222 --> 01:28:29,055
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing
he don't mean.

1119
01:28:31,742 --> 01:28:36,054
As long as I'm here and can do anything,
you won't touch the old man's goods.

1120
01:28:36,222 --> 01:28:38,053
I know exactly what you mean.

1121
01:28:38,262 --> 01:28:40,617
You want to take it all for yourself
and cut me out.

1122
01:28:40,702 --> 01:28:44,775
No, I'm on the level with the old man,
like I'd be with you if you weren't here.

1123
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:48,138
Get off your soapbox. You only sound
foolish out here in this wilderness.

1124
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:49,780
I know you for what you are.

1125
01:28:49,862 --> 01:28:53,537
For a long time I've had my suspicions
about you and now I know I've been right.

1126
01:28:53,622 --> 01:28:56,898
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.

1127
01:28:56,982 --> 01:28:58,415
I see right through you.

1128
01:28:58,502 --> 01:29:01,812
For a long time you've wanted
to bump me off at the first opportunity...

1129
01:29:01,902 --> 01:29:03,938
and bury me out here
in the bush like a dog...

1130
01:29:04,022 --> 01:29:07,731
so you could take not only the old man's
goods but mine in the bargain.

1131
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:10,935
When you get to Durango safely
you'll have a big laugh...

1132
01:29:11,022 --> 01:29:13,297
thinking how dumb
the old man and I were.

1133
01:29:14,742 --> 01:29:17,859
You make another move towards me
and I'll pull the trigger.

1134
01:29:18,782 --> 01:29:21,250
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.

1135
01:29:24,822 --> 01:29:26,574
Was I right, or was I?

1136
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:30,298
You and your Sunday school talk
about protecting people's goods.

1137
01:29:30,622 --> 01:29:33,534
You. Go on, stand up,
and take it like a man.

1138
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:35,381
Come on, get up.

1139
01:29:38,662 --> 01:29:39,856
Let go of it.

1140
01:29:42,982 --> 01:29:45,291
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.

1141
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:46,895
Now listen to me...

1142
01:29:47,342 --> 01:29:49,014
Look, you're all wrong.

1143
01:29:49,102 --> 01:29:52,253
Not for a moment did I ever intend
to rob you or do you any harm.

1144
01:29:52,342 --> 01:29:53,775
Just like I said...

1145
01:29:53,862 --> 01:29:57,172
I'd fight for you and yours
like I'd fight for the old man's.

1146
01:29:57,262 --> 01:29:59,617
If you really mean that
give me back my gun.

1147
01:30:07,262 --> 01:30:08,741
My pal.

1148
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:15,020
Wouldn't it be better the way things are
to separate tomorrow or even tonight?

1149
01:30:15,102 --> 01:30:17,980
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?

1150
01:30:18,062 --> 01:30:21,498
So you could fall on me from behind,
sneak up and shoot me in the back.

1151
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:22,935
All right, I'll go first.

1152
01:30:23,022 --> 01:30:24,899
And wait for me on the trail
to ambush me?

1153
01:30:24,982 --> 01:30:27,098
Why wouldn't I do it now
if I meant to kill you?

1154
01:30:27,182 --> 01:30:29,491
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.

1155
01:30:29,662 --> 01:30:33,450
You don't have the nerve to pull the
trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.

1156
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:37,455
If you think like that, there's nothing
to do but to tie you up every night.

1157
01:30:42,262 --> 01:30:44,492
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.

1158
01:30:44,582 --> 01:30:47,176
Three times 35 is 105.

1159
01:30:47,382 --> 01:30:50,454
I'll bet $105,000
you go to sleep before I do.

1160
01:31:28,702 --> 01:31:30,932
Get up there at the head of the train.

1161
01:32:28,902 --> 01:32:30,051
Get up!

1162
01:32:31,942 --> 01:32:35,696
The cards are dealt the other way now,
and for the last time. No more shuffling.

1163
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:38,137
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.

1164
01:32:38,222 --> 01:32:40,611
I won't take orders from you
like I had to do today.

1165
01:32:40,702 --> 01:32:44,172
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.

1166
01:32:44,262 --> 01:32:47,891
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take
from me when I wasn't looking at you.

1167
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:50,496
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?

1168
01:32:50,582 --> 01:32:53,301
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?

1169
01:32:53,382 --> 01:32:57,170
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and
made your getaway taking all our goods.

1170
01:32:57,262 --> 01:32:59,139
He'll be looking for you and not me.

1171
01:32:59,222 --> 01:33:03,056
Up. March. Today I had to march
to your music, now you march to mine.

1172
01:33:03,142 --> 01:33:04,734
- Where?
- To your funeral.

1173
01:33:05,942 --> 01:33:07,534
Come on, keep going.

1174
01:33:08,302 --> 01:33:10,338
Get up. Sleepy?

1175
01:33:11,102 --> 01:33:13,821
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.

1176
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:52,980
Maybe I didn't kill him.

1177
01:33:53,502 --> 01:33:56,494
Maybe he just staggered and fell down
without being hit.

1178
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,493
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.

1179
01:34:48,862 --> 01:34:51,456
No, they won't find him.

1180
01:34:52,982 --> 01:34:55,860
I'll dig a hole for him
first thing in the morning.

1181
01:35:02,582 --> 01:35:03,856
This fire...

1182
01:35:04,622 --> 01:35:06,101
don't give much heat.

1183
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:12,941
Conscience.

1184
01:35:14,302 --> 01:35:15,530
What a thing.

1185
01:35:17,622 --> 01:35:20,819
If you believe you've got a conscience,
it'll pester you to death.

1186
01:35:20,902 --> 01:35:23,575
But if you don't believe you've got one...

1187
01:35:23,742 --> 01:35:25,460
what can it do to you?

1188
01:35:26,182 --> 01:35:30,095
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing
about nonsense.

1189
01:36:43,862 --> 01:36:46,057
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.

1190
01:36:46,742 --> 01:36:49,176
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.

1191
01:36:49,782 --> 01:36:53,570
In a week, the buzzards and the ants
will have done away with him anyway.

1192
01:36:56,982 --> 01:37:01,021
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?

1193
01:37:08,982 --> 01:37:09,937
No.

1194
01:37:11,822 --> 01:37:15,337
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?

1195
01:37:17,062 --> 01:37:19,974
Best thing to do
is to get to the railroad in a hurry.

1196
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:43,056
Burro.

1197
01:37:45,422 --> 01:37:47,492
It's better not to have buried him.

1198
01:37:47,702 --> 01:37:49,579
I did right, yeah.

1199
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:55,132
What I should have done, maybe,
was bury his clothes...

1200
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:57,891
and leave him to the ants
and the buzzards.

1201
01:37:58,222 --> 01:37:59,450
Buzzards!

1202
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:03,333
If somebody saw them circling,
they'd know something was dead.

1203
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,532
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.

1204
01:38:07,542 --> 01:38:08,941
Lucky for me.

1205
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:37,817
Curtin!

1206
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:48,136
Where are you?

1207
01:38:59,662 --> 01:39:02,938
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.

1208
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,411
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.

1209
01:39:08,582 --> 01:39:10,777
I got it. The tiger.

1210
01:39:11,822 --> 01:39:16,100
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have
dragged him off to his lair, that's what.

1211
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:20,821
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones
will be left to tell the story.

1212
01:39:26,782 --> 01:39:28,579
Done as if by order.

1213
01:41:05,742 --> 01:41:07,892
I came to in the middle of the night.

1214
01:41:08,702 --> 01:41:10,932
My gun was on the ground beside me.

1215
01:41:12,142 --> 01:41:15,498
He must have left it there
to make it look like suicide.

1216
01:41:16,782 --> 01:41:20,457
I figured he'd come back in the morning
to see if I still had a flicker of life.

1217
01:41:20,542 --> 01:41:23,010
I thought about waiting for him
and letting him have it...

1218
01:41:23,102 --> 01:41:25,900
but there was a good chance
in my condition I might miss...

1219
01:41:25,982 --> 01:41:28,291
so I decided to crawl away
like a poisoned dog.

1220
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:31,852
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.

1221
01:41:31,942 --> 01:41:34,410
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.

1222
01:41:34,502 --> 01:41:38,381
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off
with our goods and is on his way north.

1223
01:41:38,462 --> 01:41:41,374
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.

1224
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:42,656
What do you mean?

1225
01:41:42,742 --> 01:41:45,051
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.

1226
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:47,815
I think he's as honest
as the next fella, or almost.

1227
01:41:47,902 --> 01:41:50,860
The mistake was leaving you two
in the depths of the wilderness...

1228
01:41:50,942 --> 01:41:52,773
with more than $100,000 between you.

1229
01:41:52,862 --> 01:41:55,057
That's a big temptation, partner,
believe me.

1230
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:56,621
He shot me down in cold blood.

1231
01:41:56,702 --> 01:41:59,819
After I was down he shot me
a second time just to make sure.

1232
01:41:59,902 --> 01:42:03,178
If I was young and out there with one
of you, I'd have been tempted, too.

1233
01:42:03,262 --> 01:42:06,220
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,
but I reckon I would've been tempted.

1234
01:42:06,302 --> 01:42:08,862
There now. You're almost as good as new.

1235
01:42:09,902 --> 01:42:12,291
Now, to find that thief
and get our goods back.

1236
01:42:21,582 --> 01:42:24,574
They're not only giving me a horse
but coming to protect me.

1237
01:42:24,662 --> 01:42:26,220
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?

1238
01:42:26,302 --> 01:42:28,418
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.

1239
01:42:28,502 --> 01:42:30,732
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.

1240
01:42:30,822 --> 01:42:34,178
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.

1241
01:42:34,262 --> 01:42:35,377
I'm going.

1242
01:42:35,622 --> 01:42:37,897
Well, I reckon you're going.

1243
01:43:08,102 --> 01:43:09,251
Burro!

1244
01:44:52,062 --> 01:44:53,814
Have you got any cigarettes?

1245
01:44:57,062 --> 01:44:59,815
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco...

1246
01:45:01,062 --> 01:45:02,495
if that'll do.

1247
01:45:03,142 --> 01:45:05,861
No paper to roll it in?

1248
01:45:06,542 --> 01:45:07,691
Papers?

1249
01:45:10,542 --> 01:45:11,941
Here you are.

1250
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:16,616
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.

1251
01:45:17,742 --> 01:45:19,380
That's where I'm headed.

1252
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:21,693
I've got to sell my burros.

1253
01:45:22,462 --> 01:45:25,022
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.

1254
01:45:25,102 --> 01:45:26,251
Matches?

1255
01:45:30,462 --> 01:45:33,022
Money? We need money, too.

1256
01:45:33,982 --> 01:45:36,576
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver...

1257
01:45:37,462 --> 01:45:39,020
maybe two or three.

1258
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,419
How much is the pay?

1259
01:45:49,422 --> 01:45:50,650
Two pesos.

1260
01:45:51,142 --> 01:45:53,451
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...

1261
01:45:53,542 --> 01:45:56,579
I got to wait till I get to town
so I can get the money.

1262
01:45:58,342 --> 01:46:00,253
Do I know you from someplace?

1263
01:46:01,102 --> 01:46:02,660
Maybe I know you.

1264
01:46:03,582 --> 01:46:05,698
No, I don't think so.

1265
01:46:08,102 --> 01:46:10,172
- Are you alone?
- No.

1266
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:13,021
I'm not alone.

1267
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:17,140
I got a couple of friends
coming along on horseback.

1268
01:46:17,902 --> 01:46:20,336
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.

1269
01:46:31,382 --> 01:46:32,781
That's funny.

1270
01:46:33,062 --> 01:46:36,577
A man all by himself in bandit country
with a string of burros...

1271
01:46:36,782 --> 01:46:39,455
and his friends behind him on horseback.

1272
01:46:46,662 --> 01:46:48,732
Your friends must be very far behind you.

1273
01:46:48,822 --> 01:46:51,461
Pablo cannot see any dust
even from their horses.

1274
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,380
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.

1275
01:46:57,982 --> 01:47:01,054
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.

1276
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:03,452
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.

1277
01:47:04,102 --> 01:47:06,172
I never laid eyes on you until now.

1278
01:47:07,142 --> 01:47:09,053
What you got in the bags?

1279
01:47:14,982 --> 01:47:17,894
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.

1280
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:21,334
That's what they are, hides.

1281
01:47:21,662 --> 01:47:23,857
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.

1282
01:47:25,102 --> 01:47:26,171
Yeah.

1283
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:31,811
Sure you don't want to come along
with me and help me with the burros?

1284
01:47:37,742 --> 01:47:38,970
Burro.

1285
01:47:49,382 --> 01:47:50,940
Get away from my burro.

1286
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:55,580
We can sell those burros
for just as good a price as you'd get.

1287
01:47:55,662 --> 01:47:57,175
Get away from my burro.

1288
01:47:57,262 --> 01:48:01,813
You can't frighten even a sick louse
with that. You can only shoot one of us...

1289
01:48:02,302 --> 01:48:06,090
and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.

1290
01:48:06,182 --> 01:48:07,934
So what with your gun?

1291
01:48:08,462 --> 01:48:10,771
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.

1292
01:53:19,142 --> 01:53:22,418
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.

1293
01:53:43,502 --> 01:53:45,732
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?

1294
01:53:46,302 --> 01:53:49,453
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?

1295
01:53:57,102 --> 01:54:00,014
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.

1296
01:54:02,062 --> 01:54:05,179
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.

1297
01:54:30,422 --> 01:54:31,537
What?

1298
01:54:45,382 --> 01:54:48,340
He heard the bandits talking
while they were waiting to be shot.

1299
01:54:48,422 --> 01:54:50,936
They thought it was bags of sand
hidden among the hide...

1300
01:54:51,022 --> 01:54:53,217
to make it weigh more
when Dobbs went to sell them.

1301
01:54:53,302 --> 01:54:54,576
Where are they?

1302
01:55:02,422 --> 01:55:04,811
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!

1303
01:55:29,142 --> 01:55:30,894
Looks like a norther.

1304
01:57:21,062 --> 01:57:24,259
Laugh, Curtin, old boy,
it's a great joke played on us...

1305
01:57:24,342 --> 01:57:26,856
by the Lord, or fate, or nature,
whatever you prefer...

1306
01:57:26,942 --> 01:57:30,378
but whoever or whatever played it
certainly had a sense of humor!

1307
01:57:30,462 --> 01:57:32,896
The gold has gone back
to where we found it!

1308
01:57:51,622 --> 01:57:54,932
This is worth ten months
of suffering and labor, this joke is!

1309
01:58:20,982 --> 01:58:23,291
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?

1310
01:58:23,782 --> 01:58:26,660
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned
as a medicine man.

1311
01:58:26,742 --> 01:58:28,733
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...

1312
01:58:28,822 --> 01:58:31,495
roof over my head,
and a drink now and then to warm me up.

1313
01:58:31,582 --> 01:58:34,221
I will be worshipped, fed,
and treated like a high priest...

1314
01:58:34,302 --> 01:58:38,011
for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.

1315
01:58:38,102 --> 01:58:39,694
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

1316
01:58:39,782 --> 01:58:42,580
Even you'll take off your hat
when you see how respected I am.

1317
01:58:42,662 --> 01:58:45,495
The day before yesterday,
they wanted to make me their legislature.

1318
01:58:45,582 --> 01:58:46,810
Their whole legislature!

1319
01:58:46,902 --> 01:58:50,497
I don't know what that means. I think
it's the highest honor they can bestow.

1320
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:53,255
Yeah, I'm all fixed
for the rest of my natural life.

1321
01:58:53,342 --> 01:58:55,378
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?

1322
01:58:55,462 --> 01:58:56,975
I haven't got any idea.

1323
01:58:57,062 --> 01:59:00,657
You're young. You've got plenty of time
to make three or four fortunes.

1324
01:59:01,102 --> 01:59:03,900
You know, the worst ain't so bad
when it finally happens.

1325
01:59:03,982 --> 01:59:06,780
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be
before it happens.

1326
01:59:06,862 --> 01:59:09,092
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.

1327
01:59:09,302 --> 01:59:12,100
All I'm out is $200
when you come right down to it.

1328
01:59:12,182 --> 01:59:14,491
Not very much compared
to what Dobbsie lost.

1329
01:59:14,582 --> 01:59:16,573
Any special place you're bent on going?

1330
01:59:16,662 --> 01:59:18,892
No, all places are the same to me.

1331
01:59:19,422 --> 01:59:22,380
You can keep my share of what the burros
and the hides'll bring...

1332
01:59:22,462 --> 01:59:26,341
if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.

1333
01:59:26,422 --> 01:59:30,131
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.

1334
01:59:34,302 --> 01:59:35,496
How about it?

1335
01:59:37,622 --> 01:59:38,850
It's a deal.

1336
01:59:41,662 --> 01:59:43,175
Well, let's get going.

1337
01:59:57,262 --> 01:59:59,332
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.

1338
01:59:59,422 --> 02:00:01,253
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
