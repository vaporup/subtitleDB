1
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,810
I hate that part.

2
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:37,458
Bounty hunters, have you
completed your mission?

3
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,802
Oh, yeah, we wasted him.

4
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,044
Check out the head
on this sucker.

5
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,315
Fine, however, an earlier
expedition remains incomplete.

6
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,453
A G-sweep of the planet Earth
indicates residual Crite life.

7
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,293
- G-sweep's wrong.
- No way, Your Holiness...

8
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,564
I was there.
I saw it all.

9
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,226
The G-sweep is
infallible.

10
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:58,144
The council is very nervous
when it comes to the Crites.

11
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,181
They are a lethal plague
and must be wiped out.

12
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,453
Pay for the Hexapod kill
shall be withheld

13
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,556
until the eradication
of Crites on Earth is verified.

14
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,732
There must be no doubt.

15
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:17,339
Does this mean
we're going back to Earth?

16
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,585
What takes you
to Grover's Bend, son?

17
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:49,313
My grandmother
lives there.

18
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,455
Oh, Easter vacation
with Granny, huh?

19
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,404
That's
a good grandson.

20
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:58,692
You know what the Bend's
famous for, don't you?

21
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,204
What's that?

22
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,347
Hasn't your granny ever told you
about those space porcupine things?

23
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,702
No. No, she never did.

24
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:11,079
Bunch of folks hereabout
think they came

25
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:14,179
from one of those unidentified
flying UFOs or some such.

26
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,672
Some say those
little boogers attacked

27
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,895
one of the farms
outside of town.

28
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,155
Maybe a friend
of your granny's, huh?

29
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,601
The Browns.

30
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:27,272
No... no, no.
She doesn't know any Browns.

31
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,356
Come on, man!

32
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,365
Buried treasure
right this way.

33
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:57,413
What the hell
are we doing?

34
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,527
Ain't nobody lived here
in two years.

35
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,585
What exactly
are we looking for?

36
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:07,624
Collector's items.
Nothing like them.

37
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:10,795
Just like all the other weird shit
you got in your store.

38
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:14,412
Jeez, it's freezing
in here.

39
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,663
What are they?

40
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,213
Whatever you tell people
they are.

41
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,378
So what do you say?

42
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,505
These things
ain't worth dick!

43
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,935
Okay, fine.

44
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,793
I'll just take 'em
up to K.C.

45
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:42,764
See what one of them big antique
stores'll give me for them.

46
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,226
- You do that.
- But...

47
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:48,885
a case of Meister Brau would
save me a lot of trouble.

48
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:54,127
- Load 'em up.
- Right!

49
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,473
Perfect fit!

50
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,777
Come on, kids,
let's go. Hurry up.

51
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,700
Hey, Sis, dinner's
at 6:00, okay?

52
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,326
'Kay, Megan!

53
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,967
- You put...
- No, no, no.

54
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,902
Okay, okay. We'll pull the photo
one column to the left.

55
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:01,431
Now we'll keep
the 4H Club sidebar,

56
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,181
and we will swap
the sidewalk weeds issue

57
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,899
with the Easter egg hunt
right here!

58
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,303
- l-l...
- Yeah.

59
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,086
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi, honey!

60
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:16,219
- I got the returns.
- Just put them back by the...

61
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,298
- the typeset, will you?
- Okay.

62
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:21,206
What do we do about
the 39-pound squash?

63
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,616
We bury it somewhere
on page four.

64
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,966
- Didn't you say it was 29 pounds?
- 39.

65
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,588
I weighed
ol' jumbo myself.

66
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:33,952
Better move it
up to page one.

67
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,420
We're still looking
at empty space here.

68
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,370
Put that back!

69
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,381
I got a stop-press
story for you.

70
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,113
What's that?

71
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,290
"Bus driver
finds Grover's Bend"?

72
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,839
"Brad Brown is
back in town."

73
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,568
Bradley Brown?!

74
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,494
The boy who cried
'critter.'

75
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,145
We don't want to get scooped
on this one, Mr. Morgan.

76
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:09,152
Not much chance of that, Sal.
We're the only paper in 80 miles.

77
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,712
This is big news
in Grover's Bend.

78
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,345
Inquiring minds
want to know!

79
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:15,683
- Like mine.
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,551
Just forget it, Sal. That boy's
stories nearly tore this town apart.

81
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,829
Just let Grover's Bend
forget about that night.

82
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,832
I mean it, Sal, no...
Brad Brown.

83
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,358
Brad who?

84
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,827
Snacktime!
Here we are!

85
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:54,855
Don't you have
any Clark Bars or Milk Duds?

86
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,123
Honey, fresh vegetables
are high in fiber,

87
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:01,225
and we need fiber
for a healthy B.M.

88
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:04,531
We don't want to get
constipated, do we?

89
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,949
- No!
- No, we don't.

90
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,233
I know who that is!

91
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:19,934
Bradley, come on in.

92
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,488
- Hi, Nana.
- Look at you...

93
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,529
you're shooting up
like a stinkweed.

94
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,488
You've been
eating red meat.

95
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,635
No! No, no, no.
Not me.

96
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:33,838
It's the worst thing
you could do to that body.

97
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,875
Come in here and have
a good snack with these kids.

98
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,567
You know the carnivores
have short intestines

99
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,610
and the meat passes
right out through?

100
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,439
But we're herbivores,

101
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,548
we've got great
long intestines

102
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,498
and the meat
just rots in there.

103
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,785
No, no, you stop it.

104
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,533
Quigley, get your stupid dog
out of the way.

105
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,237
Chili Dog,
get in the back.

106
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,484
Go on, get back.
Go on.

107
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:23,765
Get in the back.

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,688
Get in the back
you miserable son of a bitch!

109
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,379
Go on!

110
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,517
- It's just a dog.
- So was "Cujo."

111
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,910
Shit.

112
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,339
Hi, Harv.

113
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,234
What in the hell
are you doing here?

114
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,840
Important business.
Brad Brown is back in town.

115
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,947
Oh... well,
on the important chart

116
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,440
I'd put that right
between a pineapple quiche

117
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,007
and a pimple
on the ass.

118
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,758
I thought you'd want to talk with
him... about the critters and all.

119
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:32,511
Why in the hell would I want
to do a thing like that?

120
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,962
If I never talk
to anybody

121
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,480
about them things
that shall remain nameless,

122
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,620
I'll die a happy man...
and besides that,

123
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,336
I ain't been sheriff of this burg
for two glorious years.

124
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:45,601
Why don't you
run along home, Sal,

125
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:48,800
because they're about
to start the bonus round.

126
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,211
Here's the last of them.

127
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:59,620
Put them with the rest
of them, brain dead.

128
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,893
So... what about
them brewskies?

129
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,873
This is all that
plain-wrap piss.

130
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,853
I thought we agreed
on Meister Brau.

131
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,805
I ain't got
no Meister Brau.

132
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,182
Then I'm taking two.

133
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:30,952
And a couple of these!

134
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:40,775
I hate teenagers.

135
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,934
Quigley!

136
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:52,161
Now... what in the hell
am I gonna do with you?

137
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,672
...Right onto highway 54,
just outside of Grover's Bend.

138
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:00,426
We'd love to see ya.

139
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:04,853
- Moo-ve.
- # At the Hungry Heifer #

140
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,925
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

141
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,130
Say...

142
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,371
how come...

143
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,741
you look like
that rock and roll guy,

144
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,164
and Lee's still a...

145
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,725
nothing-face?

146
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,233
Because this body fit.

147
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,793
Lee stays
a nothing-face

148
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,166
till he finds
the right self.

149
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,470
Can't live
in the wrong self.

150
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,555
Charlie quiet.

151
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,448
- Charlie thinking.
- Thinking what?

152
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,994
just about going back to Earth
after all this time.

153
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,556
Don't want to?

154
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,506
I don't know.

155
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,346
On Earth, I was
just a big nobody.

156
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,770
I had one friend...

157
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,537
and he was
just a kid.

158
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,679
- Brad.
- Yeah.

159
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,557
Hey, hey, uh...

160
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,011
you wouldn't just leave me
on Earth, would you?

161
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:15,888
Charlie bounty hunter.

162
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:20,522
Yeah...

163
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,389
yeah, Charlie
bounty hunter.

164
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,451
You guys are okay,
you know that?

165
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,875
# At the Hungry Heifer #

166
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:38,223
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

167
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,175
How about some buffalo chips
or a Moo shake?

168
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:42,323
We've got a two-for-one
Easter special.

169
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,369
No, thanks.

170
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,737
Wesley.
What are you doing here?

171
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,559
Let's have us
a beer.

172
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:51,253
Don't you get it?

173
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,917
Let's just say
I'm not the Van Halen type.

174
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,854
All right!

175
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,947
I hate elevator
music too.

176
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:01,019
Look...

177
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:03,420
what other choice
you got?

178
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:08,019
Wesley, I've got to go
to work! Leave me alone!

179
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,949
Leave her alone.

180
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,950
Just, you know...
cool it, okay?

181
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,187
Well, looky here.

182
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,251
Little Bradley Brown.

183
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,274
I haven't seen you
in a long time, peewee.

184
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:27,702
How's your little
space monsters?

185
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:30,442
I don't want to start
any trouble, okay, Wesley?

186
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,251
Did you hear that?

187
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:35,289
The little mouse
don't want any trouble.

188
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,150
Well, that's too bad.

189
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,352
I'm warning you,
I've been taking karate.

190
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,144
I don't want anyone
getting hurt,

191
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:47,457
so just keep
your distance.

192
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:52,890
Somebody call the sheriff!

193
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,355
Shouldn't have
come back, asshole!

194
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,806
Nobody wants you here!

195
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,618
Thanks for
the getaway. I'm...

196
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,385
Bradley Brown.

197
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,388
Do I know you?
Did we go to school together?

198
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,502
You used to throw cherry bombs
in the trash cans.

199
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,201
Are you a senior?

200
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,667
Yup.

201
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:22,494
- What?
- Ponytail and braces.

202
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:26,016
- And zits.
- You're Megan Morgan?!

203
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,629
Does your dad still run
the newspaper?

204
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:31,266
I'm a reporter there.

205
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,581
Really?!

206
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,366
Kinda like a "Jimmy Olsen"
with breasts.

207
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:47,430
Chili, chow!

208
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:53,478
Well, shit.

209
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,213
I reckon you'll come back
when you get hungry.

210
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,709
But I'm going home.

211
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,468
Mr. Quigley? Len?!

212
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,365
Are you here?

213
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,531
Nana, it's scary
in here.

214
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,542
It's okay, hon.

215
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,197
Nothing here
can hurt you.

216
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,461
Especially no dead frog.

217
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,806
- Don't touch that!
- I didn't hurt it!

218
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,728
Never mind that, Len.

219
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,696
Where are those Easter eggs
you called me about?

220
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,712
Oh, they're
in the back.

221
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,755
Where on Earth
did you get these, Len?!

222
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,881
They're from Europe.

223
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,161
What are you
asking for these?

224
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,244
Uh...

225
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:08,691
10 bucks... each.

226
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,943
That's not what you'd ask
the church, now, is it?

227
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,956
Oh, of course not.

228
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:16,208
Of course not!

229
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:20,504
I'll give you $20
for the stack.

230
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:21,492
You can have
half for $25.

231
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,501
- 20.
- For half.

232
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:30,317
These really are
special, aren't they?

233
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,815
Yeah, really.

234
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,416
- How long are you in town?
- Just through Easter vacation.

235
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,904
- Where do you guys live now?
- Up in Kansas City.

236
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:52,761
KC, K or KC, MO?

237
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,216
This isn't for
"The Gazette," is it?

238
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:58,291
I'm thinking of going to college
there next year, okay?

239
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,469
Sorry, I just get nervous
with reporters and stuff.

240
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:04,848
'Cause of all that talk
about those...

241
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,326
space monsters
a couple years ago?

242
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,847
No such thing
as any "space monsters."

243
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:12,568
Really?

244
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:16,533
Yeah, that was just a stupid kid's
dumb dream. It never happened.

245
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,368
Oh, thanks for
helping me, honey.

246
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,717
And for being such a good girl,
I've got a present for you.

247
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,832
- What?
- Just wait.

248
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,178
Wow, a chocolate bunny!

249
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:56,065
It's better than chocolate,
honey, it's carob!

250
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,641
You might as well
take one of these too.

251
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,343
- Thanks, Nana.
- Happy Easter, darling.

252
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,670
Shit.

253
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,977
Easter sucks.

254
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,213
Jeez-oh-peese.

255
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,018
What the...?

256
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,576
Chili Dog?

257
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,455
Chili, boy.

258
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:22,407
Chili?

259
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,230
Chili, wake up, boy.

260
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,553
Looks like someone's
getting sleepy.

261
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:06,732
Not me!

262
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:09,008
Go on. You want to be
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

263
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:11,280
for the big Easter egg hunt
tomorrow morning.

264
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,864
But I'm not
sleepy yet, Daddy.

265
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:14,960
- Really!
- Uh-huh.

266
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,785
Come on,
I'll tuck you in.

267
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,828
Okay...

268
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:20,429
"Okay..."

269
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,403
- 'Night, brat.
- 'Night, creep.

270
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:32,278
Super daughter.

271
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,036
- Want to get under the covers?
- No, it's too hot.

272
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:39,283
Oh, okay. 'Night, night,
sleep tight.

273
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,075
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

274
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,307
I'll just bite it
right back!

275
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:44,786
Yeah. Oh...
uh-oh!

276
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,831
What's that
in your hair?

277
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:49,043
'Night, Daddy,
I love you.

278
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,259
I love you, too.

279
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,225
I'm going to bed now,
Bradley.

280
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,055
Don't stay up
too late.

281
00:24:38,303 --> 00:24:40,441
You knew no one
would believe it.

282
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,268
Didn't you?

283
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,621
I sure do
miss you, Charlie.

284
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,300
Where did you go?

285
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,526
Honey, are you all right?

286
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,300
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

287
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,928
- Your Easter candy's a real mess.
- Ewww...

288
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:05,904
Would you look at this?

289
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:09,004
You ladies are doing
a wonderful job.

290
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:12,425
Now, Reverend!

291
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,702
Those are
for the children.

292
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:17,425
The Easter
Bunny's here.

293
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,505
Right on time.

294
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:22,441
Midge, would you bring
the sheriff his package?

295
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,753
- Here you go.
- There you are.

296
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,570
Are you sure you couldn't get
somebody else to do this?

297
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,125
Sheriff Harv did it
for 20 years running.

298
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,257
Well, I ain't
Sheriff Harv!

299
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,548
Don't be
such a gloomy Gus.

300
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:36,752
Sheriff, just help us out.

301
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,954
Who knows, you might even
have yourself a good time.

302
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,030
Fat chance.

303
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,525
Well, you better
hurry, ladies.

304
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,316
- Resurrection's in 45 minutes.
- Oh!

305
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,900
- Put this down on the other side.
- Okay, Emily.

306
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,280
Spread them out
so they're all even.

307
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:12,122
Good morning,
children.

308
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:13,910
Happy Easter.

309
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:15,856
We're going to have
to be patient today.

310
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:19,743
We can't start the hunt
until the services are over.

311
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,676
I have it on good authority
that the Easter Bunny himself

312
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,571
just might make
an appearance.

313
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:27,767
Go on now!

314
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,924
Thank you.

315
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:47,581
Boy, pretty good
crowd today.

316
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,088
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

317
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:01,534
- I thought he was gone!
- He's trouble.

318
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,289
...back here.
- That's him.

319
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,904
Brad!

320
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:10,785
Welcome, friends.

321
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,760
Welcome one and all.

322
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:17,470
Today, of course,
is the Day of Resurrection.

323
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,873
So it seems only fitting

324
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:22,624
that some of you
have chosen this day

325
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,742
to resurrect
your church-going habit.

326
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:33,948
Why'd I ever let her
talk me into this?

327
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:42,753
Honey, that's
awfully beautiful.

328
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:41,637
Aw, this is great.

329
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,133
The Easter Bunny with
his Tehachapi hanging out.

330
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,497
It'd give them kids
a real education.

331
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:11,854
What the hell was in you?

332
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:27,402
...and entering
into the sepulcher,

333
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:31,501
they saw, sitting
on the right side,

334
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,646
a young man...

335
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,717
clothed in a long,
white garment.

336
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,984
And they were
afrighted.

337
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:11,918
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go.

338
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,111
There you are.

339
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:28,945
My dad just ran
your grandma home.

340
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:30,355
Are you okay?

341
00:32:30,394 --> 00:32:32,534
Yeah, I'm all right.

342
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,927
What do you think
happened to the sheriff?

343
00:32:37,616 --> 00:32:40,660
You heard 'em. It was probably
some kind of farm accident.

344
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,002
Farm accident?!
You saw him!

345
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,110
That was no
farm accident.

346
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:46,293
What are you
trying to say?

347
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,603
You were telling the truth
about those things.

348
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:51,355
- There are no such things!
- I don't believe you.

349
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,685
I mean, I do
believe you.

350
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:58,015
I mean, I believe what
you said a couple years ago.

351
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:00,315
Do me a favor and don't
do me any favors, okay?

352
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:03,680
Don't you think
we better go see Harv?

353
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,323
Well, I'm going.

354
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,815
Megan...

355
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,430
Harv?!

356
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,341
We need you in town, something
awful's happened at the church.

357
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,289
What the hell are
you doing here, boy?

358
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:42,081
We think it might have
been those... creatures.

359
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,135
What creatures
would that be?

360
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:48,512
- It's true, Harv.
- You see 'em?

361
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:49,957
Not exactly, but I...

362
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:53,596
Then don't be bringing me grief!
You go tell the sheriff.

363
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:56,800
- The sheriff is dead!
- They got him up at the church.

364
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:00,960
His stomach
was eaten out.

365
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,163
Folks are saying it was some farm
machine accident, but it wasn't.

366
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:07,134
You have to come with us, Harv!
What are you doing?

367
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:09,510
What does it look like
I'm doing, Einstein?

368
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,551
I'm doing what
any intelligent,

369
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,819
God-fearing
Grover Benders would do!

370
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,808
I'm haulin' ass!

371
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:18,549
You can't leave now!
This town needs you!

372
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,756
Yeah? This town
voted me out in a landslide.

373
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,477
This town can
kiss my ass!

374
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,659
I can't believe you're
just going to run away.

375
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,927
We need you, Harv.
We need a sheriff.

376
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,549
Go check the yellow pages.

377
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:40,752
hi...

378
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:42,446
this here's
American culture.

379
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:44,109
Good reading.

380
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:45,741
G-Good articles.

381
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:47,820
Transform.

382
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,511
Oh no, Lee.

383
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:56,459
No, no, Lee.
Don't look at me, Lee!

384
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,753
Kill Crites.

385
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,608
Hey, guys!
Hey, wait up!

386
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,611
Hey, Lee!

387
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,187
Lee, you're gonna
need this!

388
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:02,137
Okay, let's think about this. Maybe
there is a logical explanation.

389
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,378
What do you mean?
Like really bad stomach ulcers?

390
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,105
It could have
been a dog!

391
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,893
Yeah, and it could have been
the brain from Planet Eros.

392
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,967
You saw him, Brad.
It was no dog.

393
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:15,703
What's the matter?

394
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:19,160
I need a little air. I was going
home to take a hot bath and I see...

395
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,568
- Slow down.
- Rolling, rolling, towards me...

396
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,870
- It's getting bigger and bigger...
- Take a breath!

397
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,464
And it's got
these big teeth...

398
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,094
- Where did it go?!
- Into Quigley's.

399
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,111
- Mr. Quigley!
- Get in the truck. Lock the doors.

400
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:31,739
You can't go.
Let's get help!

401
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:34,168
Who are we gonna call?
Critter Busters?

402
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:35,868
Just stay behind me
in the truck!

403
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,942
Mr. Quigley?

404
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,403
Anybody home?

405
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,824
Mr. Quigley,
are you okay?

406
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,480
Nobody's home.
Let's get out of here.

407
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,950
Get up!

408
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:27,935
Bradley,
look behind you!

409
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:30,595
Get in the truck!

410
00:38:31,593 --> 00:38:32,543
Get in!

411
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,769
- Roll up the window!
- It's broken!

412
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,177
- Come on!
- God damn it!

413
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,796
Come on, come on!

414
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,973
- You're flooding it!
- Then you drive!

415
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:48,487
Dear God,
that critter thing!

416
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:52,010
Get away,
I am not kidding!

417
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,593
Yuck, veggies, ugh!

418
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,399
Nana, the critters
are here.

419
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,449
No, shit, Bradley!

420
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:39,879
Damn meat eaters!

421
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:44,174
Where are you going?
Bradley!

422
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,632
- Where's the communicator?
- What communicator?

423
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:57,741
The one the bounty hunters
gave to me.

424
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:59,668
Bounty hunters?!

425
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,174
- The space guys.
- Oh, you mean the remote control.

426
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:04,724
- It's always on the TV.
- Not the remote control.

427
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:06,928
Nana, this is not
the remote control.

428
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:36,376
Those bounty hunters!

429
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,918
That was fast.

430
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:41,972
- More Crites.
- Yeah, a lot more.

431
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,377
Boy am I glad
to see you.

432
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,097
B-both of you.

433
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:50,424
These guys are great.

434
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,632
Charlie!

435
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:04,661
Brad.

436
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,201
I can't believe it!

437
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:12,474
Look at you... all dressed up
like one of them.

438
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,824
Well, I am one of them.
I'm a bounty hunter.

439
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,049
Yeah, right.

440
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:18,843
No, no, no.
I work with them.

441
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:21,596
Are you still...?

442
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:26,173
I don't need that anymore.
See... see...

443
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:28,095
up in space,
I am somebody.

444
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:30,135
See, I got a job
and a meaning.

445
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,056
So I guess that means
you won't be staying long then.

446
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:40,217
Probably not.

447
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:43,837
B-but, see, Brad...

448
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,786
I gotta go where
the cosmic winds blow me.

449
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,058
I gotta...

450
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,749
go...

451
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:53,122
where no man
has gone before.

452
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:57,691
Well, it's really good
to have you back, Charlie.

453
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:01,689
Even if it's just
for a little while.

454
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:08,587
Hey, wait!
Help us out over here.

455
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,970
- That guy's crazy.
- Don't go in there.

456
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,667
# Hey, little buddies,
come gather 'round #

457
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:25,518
# This here's the very best
eating in town #

458
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:27,918
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

459
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:30,440
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

460
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:33,032
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

461
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,625
# And wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

462
00:43:35,665 --> 00:43:38,184
# Pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

463
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:41,772
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

464
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,427
# At the Hungry Heifer #

465
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,913
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

466
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:03,128
Get out of the way!

467
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,664
Operator?! Operator,
can you hear me? Please listen,

468
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:16,123
I can't hear you. This is
the editor of the "Gazette."

469
00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:18,395
We need to get the highway
patrol here right away.

470
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,496
Operator, can you... oh, God.

471
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:27,517
Oh my God.
I can't hear you.

472
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:29,755
All I can hear is static.
If you're there...

473
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,791
can you hear me?
Can anybody out there hear me?

474
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:53,658
Daddy?

475
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,820
- Thank God!

476
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:00,673
- The critters are real.
- I know.

477
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:02,748
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah.

478
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:06,078
Did you guys hear that?

479
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:08,253
Let's get to the door.

480
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:17,762
- Oh no! Daddy!
- Get him up, come on!

481
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:21,933
- Go!
- For God's sake!

482
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:25,673
- Wesley!
- Wesley!

483
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,634
Chickenshit!

484
00:46:50,026 --> 00:46:52,392
Go on inside. You'll be
much safer in there.

485
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:54,565
I need some more
bandages.

486
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:57,895
Daddy!

487
00:46:59,018 --> 00:47:01,737
- Cindy, are you okay?
- What happened to Daddy?

488
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:03,876
Don't worry,
he's gonna be all right.

489
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,075
Shit!

490
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:30,116
Ug, what happened?

491
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:32,231
Crites feed
together.

492
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:33,897
Eat like a family.

493
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,837
Love meat.
A bad habit.

494
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:38,952
You guys
don't eat meat?!

495
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,130
Hey, who's gonna pay
for all this stuff?!

496
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,990
Look at the mess
you guys made!

497
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,677
No, Lee,
no, no, don't...

498
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:51,120
not this!
No, Lee!

499
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:11,279
Kill more Crites.

500
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:22,096
l-I gotta go, Brad.

501
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:21,788
Sorry.

502
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:25,458
It sure is quiet.

503
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,574
Maybe they're all dead.

504
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:29,686
I wish.

505
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:33,467
They're probably
waiting right outside.

506
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,406
There's a cheery thought.

507
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:42,041
It's like they're
teasing us or something.

508
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,494
I just wish I knew
where they were.

509
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,735
Lee?

510
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:10,296
Lee?

511
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:13,154
Lee?!

512
00:50:15,556 --> 00:50:17,410
What are you doing?

513
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:21,150
No! No, no, no!

514
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,715
No, Lee, please!

515
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:31,678
Hold it, Lee.
Hold on.

516
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:33,921
This is the one.
This... now, this...

517
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:35,966
This... that's it.

518
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:37,827
Good, that's it.

519
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,978
Kill Crites.

520
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:45,988
Thank you.

521
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,615
Sweet Jesus!
What was that?

522
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,224
Lee?

523
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:09,871
Ug, what happened?

524
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:12,012
Where's Lee?

525
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:49,906
Ug's losing it.

526
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:28,917
Charlie,
what happened?

527
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,844
Lee's dead.

528
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:32,700
What happened to...

529
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:34,959
Ug?

530
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:41,690
Is he okay?

531
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,439
- He ain't breathing.
- He don't have a mouth.

532
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:52,062
Try and transform, Ug.

533
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:59,839
Ug...

534
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:05,918
I'm not a good enough bounty hunter
to do it by myself.

535
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,535
Hey, get back inside!

536
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:50,884
Go on!

537
00:54:53,575 --> 00:54:55,844
If you don't get inside
I'm going to see to it

538
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,569
your dad blisters
your little butt!

539
00:55:12,298 --> 00:55:14,054
Get inside
and lock the door.

540
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,107
I'm back.

541
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:19,341
Cindy?

542
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,004
Cindy!

543
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,548
Looks like we got us
a job to do.

544
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,983
- Did you hear that?
- Uh-huh.

545
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:10,740
- What was it?

546
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:15,538
Look!

547
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:18,521
Where are
they all going?

548
00:57:18,554 --> 00:57:20,463
I don't know.

549
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:23,858
Looks like some kind of
critter convention.

550
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,911
There must be
hundreds of them.

551
00:57:48,561 --> 00:57:50,935
We can't call
in the highway patrol.

552
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:53,243
All the damn
phone lines are down.

553
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:56,060
We've got to do something.
We can't just stay here!

554
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:59,062
Those things got the west road
out of town blocked.

555
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:01,973
- We're never gonna get past them.
- Same goes for the east.

556
00:58:02,015 --> 00:58:05,146
Listen, this is
the safest place we can be!

557
00:58:05,184 --> 00:58:07,901
Now, I say we stay here and wait
the little bastards out.

558
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:10,588
- These things won't leave.
- Mind your own business, boy!

559
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:13,195
This is my business!

560
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,197
They don't give up! We have
to fight them and kill them.

561
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:17,207
Seems mighty queer to me...

562
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:20,236
two years ago when
the critters first come,

563
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,115
they come
to the boy's house.

564
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,642
The boy's back in town and
the damn things are here too!

565
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:26,749
I've been through this before!
We have to fight these things!

566
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:28,675
We don't include you.

567
00:58:28,707 --> 00:58:32,352
Now, I ain't listening to no
undersized kid from the big city.

568
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:35,487
Or no town drunk!
Or no no-faced spaceman

569
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:39,070
out of a flying saucer telling us
how to run our own town!

570
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:41,695
We didn't have this trouble
till the boy came back.

571
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:44,995
Let's not get hysterical here. That
boy saved my little girl's life.

572
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:47,232
This ain't no show of yours
either, Morgan.

573
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:49,474
I say the boy's
bad news in shoes.

574
00:58:57,223 --> 00:58:59,523
What is this bullshit?

575
00:59:02,311 --> 00:59:05,628
Them man-eating dustmops
got us roped up tighter

576
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,093
than a blue-ribbon bull
and all you folks can do

577
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:11,616
is stand here and play
kick-the-can with some punk kid!

578
00:59:12,968 --> 00:59:15,620
If we set around here
on our duffs...

579
00:59:15,657 --> 00:59:17,283
bitching...

580
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:20,289
we're gonna end up
tomorrow's leftovers.

581
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,566
I don't too much
relish that idea.

582
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:24,936
I think it's time
to fight back.

583
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:30,054
- We gotta blow them up.
- Oh, come on, boy!

584
00:59:30,091 --> 00:59:33,058
No, no, I mean it! Go out
in the field and see for yourselves.

585
00:59:33,098 --> 00:59:35,302
The critters are eating
the cattle out there.

586
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,154
It's just like Ug said,
they get together to feed.

587
00:59:38,187 --> 00:59:40,970
So let's put out the most outrageous
banquet in the world for them.

588
00:59:41,004 --> 00:59:42,827
What have you
got in mind, son?

589
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,479
Polar Burgers! We'll get them
into the hamburger factory,

590
00:59:45,517 --> 00:59:47,208
lock them in
and then blow them up!

591
00:59:47,245 --> 00:59:49,546
Who's gonna lead
this suicide mission?

592
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:58,538
Well...

593
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:00,548
it was my idea.

594
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,979
But I'm gonna
need some help.

595
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:09,166
Well...

596
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:12,173
I'm in.

597
01:00:14,256 --> 01:00:16,525
I'll go.

598
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,562
Really?!

599
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:24,592
All right, you all
just volunteered.

600
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:27,047
Come on, you bunch
of pussies.

601
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,953
You've got nothing
to lose but your lives.

602
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,847
I'll get the gate!

603
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:20,145
Go!

604
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,199
Armed and dangerous,
everybody.

605
01:02:52,997 --> 01:02:54,688
Oh my God!

606
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:56,612
It's working!

607
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:03,942
Let's roll.

608
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:15,520
Oh my God.

609
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,894
Harv, Harv!

610
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:22,146
Company's coming.

611
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,037
Wait up!

612
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,855
Hey, don't piss
them off!

613
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:35,534
Keep your distance.
Stay downwind of them things.

614
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:08,859
Everybody, ready?
Here they come.

615
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,007
Oh dear God.

616
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,351
Great.

617
01:05:46,394 --> 01:05:47,801
They stopped.

618
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:58,098
Oh shit.

619
01:06:00,892 --> 01:06:02,834
Charlie, come back here!

620
01:06:03,868 --> 01:06:05,593
Charlie!

621
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,839
They're coming back.

622
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:00,922
- Brad, I think it's gonna work.
- Shhh.

623
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:05,213
Where did that
big one come from?

624
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:28,612
Oh my God.

625
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:30,777
Look at the size
of their leader.

626
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:49,162
Brad...

627
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:17,899
Ug.

628
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:20,390
It's the bounty hunter.
He led them back.

629
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:24,586
The door!

630
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,410
Run! Blow it,
blow it!

631
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:14,893
We fried 'em!

632
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,989
Are you okay?

633
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,791
Yeah. It's just ketchup.

634
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,217
Close one, though.

635
01:09:32,312 --> 01:09:34,452
Get back, she's gonna
blow again!

636
01:09:57,286 --> 01:09:58,328
Son of a bitch.

637
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,213
Harv, it's heading
back to town.

638
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:29,022
Ohhh, Lord, Harv,
the children!

639
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:30,812
- Come on.
- Let's go!

640
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:50,080
Come on!

641
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:53,591
Come on, faster!

642
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:05,114
They're heading for town!
Come on!

643
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,042
Oh my God, I bet it's headed
for the church.

644
01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:11,743
We gotta stop it!

645
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:26,628
Inside, quick.
Quickly!

646
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:28,968
Honey, do what he says.
Get inside.

647
01:11:31,846 --> 01:11:33,669
Brad, look out!

648
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:43,745
Ram it, ram it!

649
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:48,290
I'm gonna hit it!

650
01:12:06,763 --> 01:12:08,902
- Come on!
- Run, run!

651
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:18,444
Look!

652
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,917
I'm a bounty hunter!!

653
01:12:57,203 --> 01:12:59,209
Charlie...

654
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:02,635
You mean that...

655
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,585
Charlie...?

656
01:13:24,885 --> 01:13:27,122
Good ol' Charlie.

657
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:41,584
Brad, look at Ug.

658
01:14:12,316 --> 01:14:15,129
Well, just go
on in, huh?

659
01:14:14,589 --> 01:14:17,076
You practically got
the whole run of the bus.

660
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:23,992
Goodbye, Brad.

661
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:27,027
Goodbye, Charlie...

662
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:27,998
I mean... Ug.

663
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,004
Charlie.

664
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:35,832
- Thanks, Nana. Love ya.
- I love you, too.

665
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,627
And here. Here's a...

666
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:39,753
spinach-cashew
cake I made.

667
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:41,462
Eat it if you
get hungry.

668
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:44,254
- Okay?
- Okay.

669
01:14:52,064 --> 01:14:55,229
Get a move on, son,
this bus runs on a schedule.

670
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,480
I guess I'll be
seeing ya.

671
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:07,328
Come on, son. Kiss your little
gal and let's haul ass.

672
01:15:12,771 --> 01:15:14,397
Holy shit!

673
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:21,315
Hey, can one of you guys help me
get this parachute off?

674
01:15:23,014 --> 01:15:24,901
Charlie?

675
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:27,138
Oh, I got it.

676
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,907
Charlie.

677
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:36,829
Hi.

678
01:15:46,215 --> 01:15:48,103
Ug?

679
01:15:48,136 --> 01:15:50,130
Charlie?

680
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:23,483
Say, listen...

681
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:24,205
what just
happened here?

682
01:17:24,243 --> 01:17:25,934
If I was you, partner,

683
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:28,077
I'd roll this rig
right outta town,

684
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:30,754
and not say nothin' about
none of this to nobody.

685
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,401
Bye, Megan.

686
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:38,859
Bye, Brad.

687
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,947
Hey, Charlie!
Catch!

688
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:09,246
# Hey, little buddies
come gather 'round #

689
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:11,260
# This here's the very best
eatin' in town #

690
01:19:11,299 --> 01:19:13,688
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

691
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:16,382
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

692
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,874
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

693
01:19:18,915 --> 01:19:22,228
# Wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

694
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:24,091
# You'll pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

695
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:27,448
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

696
01:19:27,491 --> 01:19:30,241
# At the Hungry Heifer #

697
01:19:30,276 --> 01:19:34,467
# We won't give you
a bum steer... #

698
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:37,631
And don't you forget,

699
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:40,988
all of your friendly Hungry Heifer
restaurants throughout the Midwest

700
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:43,681
are open on Easter Sunday.
So after church,

701
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:46,948
why don't you and your family
stop in for a creamy Moo shake

702
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,871
or some crispy
buffalo chips?
