- Okay. I'll go first. Um-[br]- Okay.

00:00:42.27,00:00:44.90
Let me say, uh, we don't[br]really need to be here.

00:00:46.01,00:00:47.91
See, we've been married[br]five years.

00:00:48.01,00:00:50.81
- Six.[br]- Five, six years.

00:00:50.91,00:00:54.37
And this is like[br]a checkup for us.

00:00:54.48,00:00:57.58
Um, a chance[br]to poke around the engine...

00:00:58.79,00:01:01.88
maybe change the oil,[br]replace a seal or two.

00:01:01.99,00:01:03.96
Yeah.

00:01:05.53,00:01:07.79
[Man][br]Very well then. Let's pop the hood.

00:01:09.80,00:01:12.23
On a scale of one to 10,[br]how happy are you as a couple?

00:01:12.33,00:01:14.63
- Eight.[br]- Wait.

00:01:14.74,00:01:18.07
Ten being perfectly happy[br]and one being totally miserable?

00:01:18.17,00:01:21.30
- [Sighs][br]- Or-[br]- Just respond instinctively.

00:01:21.41,00:01:23.04

How often do you have sex?

00:01:32.15,00:01:35.02
I don't understand[br]the question.

00:01:35.12,00:01:38.12
Yeah, I'm lost.[br]Is this a one-to-10 thing?

00:01:38.23,00:01:41.22
Like, is one very little,[br]or is one nothing?

00:01:41.33,00:01:43.99
Because, you know,[br]tech-technically speaking...

00:01:44.10,00:01:46.97
the zero[br]would be nothing.

00:01:47.07,00:01:50.05
That's right. And if we don't know[br]what one is-What's 10?

00:01:50.14,00:01:54.17
- Yeah, 'cause 10- Oh, God.[br]- [Laughs]

Well, look at Sting's day job. Who else[br]has 60 hours a week to put in the sack?

00:02:10.49,00:02:14.66
It's not a one-to-10 scenario. It's a[br]basic question. How often do you have sex?

00:02:22.77,00:02:24.67
How about this week?

00:02:28.71,00:02:30.68

00:35:57.15,00:35:59.38
[Sighs][br]Civilians.

00:36:12.33,00:36:14.60
Let's see if we can't get[br]a tune out of this trombone.

00:36:19.11,00:36:21.01
[Jasmine] We're picking up[br]a weapon signature.

00:36:21.11,00:36:23.27
Shit! Not a civilian.

00:36:24.54,00:36:26.24
[Weapon Snaps]

00:36:26.35,00:36:28.91
Oh, man.

00:36:29.02,00:36:31.75
Asshole.

00:36:31.85,00:36:33.38
[Groans]

00:36:40.29,00:36:42.35
Convoy is in the zone![br]Countdown is initiated.

00:36:42.46,00:36:44.93
[Grunting]

00:36:57.84,00:37:00.11
[Gasps]

00:37:03.82,00:37:06.11
Whoa!

00:37:06.22,00:37:08.55
You should so not be allowed[br]to buy these things.

00:37:16.76,00:37:18.56
[Guard][br]Abort! Abort!

00:37:20.23,00:37:22.72
[Helicopter Departing]

00:37:59.47,00:38:02.37
I think I got I.D.'d on that hit.

00:38:02.48,00:38:04.88
- You ever been I.D.'d on a hit?[br]- Not that I'm aware of, no.

00:38:04.98,00:38:07.17
- Right. I think I'm in trouble.[br]- You get a look at 'im?

00:38:08.25,00:38:10.91
Little thing.[br]Buck 10, buck 15 tops.

00:38:11.02,00:38:13.95
- Maybe he's Filipino.[br]- Maybe.

00:38:14.05,00:38:16.02
I'm not even sure[br]it was a him.

00:38:17.92,00:38:20.45
Are you sayin' that you got[br]your ass kicked by some girl?

00:38:20.56,00:38:22.19
- That's right.[br]- Really?

00:38:22.30,00:38:24.20
- A pro.[br]- This should be easy.

00:38:24.30,00:38:26.27
I mean, how many hitters[br]do you know that are chicks? Right?

00:38:26.37,00:38:27.83
I'm sorry, man.

00:38:27.93,00:38:30.53
- You guys want any dessert?[br]- What do you have, honey?

00:38:30.64,00:38:32.37
- Ice cream.[br]- Ice cream?

00:38:32.47,00:38:34.94
- That sounds delicious.[br]What flavors do you have?[br]- Chocolate and vanilla.

00:38:35.04,00:38:36.94
I don't like either of those...[br]separately.

00:38:37.04,00:38:39.88
But maybe mixed together,[br]that could be... a nice little dish.

00:38:39.98,00:38:41.91
You know what I mean?[br]And not just a little pink spoon.

00:38:42.01,00:38:44.38
I'd like the whole sundae.

00:38:44.48,00:38:46.45
- That could be arranged.[br]- Perfect.

00:38:46.55,00:38:49.04
Could be arranged. Did you hear that?[br]I'd like to have her kick my ass.

00:38:49.16,00:38:51.35
- You know what I mean?[br]- Right.

00:38:51.46,00:38:53.43
Did you get any other details[br]on her besides her weight class?

00:38:53.53,00:38:55.86
- Laptop.[br]- I'm sorry? You're in[br]a whole zone right now.

00:38:55.96,00:38:57.69
I'm havin' a hard time[br]talkin' to you.

00:38:57.80,00:38:59.32
- Laptop.[br]- Okay, laptop.

00:38:59.43,00:39:01.76
I wanna know[br]who that bitch is!

00:39:01.87,00:39:05.39
- Get me that tape. Get me that tape.[br]- Jane.

00:39:05.50,00:39:07.70
- What?[br]- It's Father.

00:39:14.75,00:39:18.01
The F.B.I. Secured the package.[br]The window's closed, sir.

00:39:18.12,00:39:20.21
I told you we couldn't[br]afford any mistakes on this one.

00:39:20.32,00:39:23.85
- There was another player.[br]- We do not leave witnesses.

00:39:23.96,00:39:28.42
If this player I.D. 'd you-[br]You know the rules.

00:39:28.53,00:39:31.50
You have 48 hours[br]to clean the scene, Jane.

00:39:31.60,00:39:33.50
Lookin' forward to it, sir.

00:39:36.84,00:39:39.70
All right. We have a new target.[br]Let's find out who he is.

00:39:43.38,00:39:46.31
Jesus. [Scoffs][br]What did you do to it?

00:39:46.41,00:39:48.44
Put a campfire out with it?

00:39:49.62,00:39:51.81
Buy a new one.

00:39:51.92,00:39:54.32
This one has sentimental value[br]for its owner.

00:39:54.42,00:39:56.41
Who's that?

00:39:56.52,00:39:59.72
Well, Gwen,[br]I'm just hoping you'd tell me.

00:40:01.49,00:40:05.90
So, uh, why you gotta[br]know so bad anyway?

00:40:06.00,00:40:08.43
You know me.[br]Just tryin' to return some lost property.

00:40:08.53,00:40:11.63
- Hey, Phil.[br]- Hey, John.

00:40:12.74,00:40:15.23
- Are you a vegan?[br]- No.

00:40:15.34,00:40:17.33
My girlfriend is.

00:40:19.28,00:40:21.51
Here we go.

00:40:21.61,00:40:24.58
Upgraded RAM module.

00:40:24.68,00:40:27.78
[Man On P.A.][br]Line three. Pick up.

00:40:27.89,00:40:32.09
Chip's Chinese.[br]Imported by Dynamix.

00:40:32.19,00:40:35.35
Retailed by, uh-

00:40:36.76,00:40:39.25
You know, I might be able[br]to get you a billing address.

00:40:39.37,00:40:42.10
[Typing][br]All right.

00:40:42.20,00:40:44.26
No name.[br]Just an address.

00:40:44.37,00:40:48.90
570 Lexington Avenue.[br]Suite 5003.

00:40:49.01,00:40:50.91
New York.

00:40:51.01,00:40:52.91
You know the place?

00:41:13.27,00:41:16.23
[Beeping]

00:41:29.32,00:41:31.22
Sweet Jesus.[br]Mother of God.

00:41:39.46,00:41:41.69
[People Chattering]

00:41:50.07,00:41:52.04
Why don't you both[br]go make some coffee?

00:42:06.19,00:42:09.09
[Phone Rings]

00:42:13.83,00:42:16.26
[Jasmine][br]Jane, it's your husband.

00:42:17.66,00:42:20.50
He's back from Atlanta.[br]He wants to know about dinner.

00:42:22.77,00:42:25.67
Tell him...[br]dinner's at 7:00.

00:42:25.77,00:42:29.30
Hi, John. Yeah,[br]she says dinner's at 7:00.

00:42:30.38,00:42:32.28
It always is.

00:42:34.11,00:42:36.55
[Tires Squealing]

00:43:42.08,00:43:43.98
Perfect timing.

00:43:44.08,00:43:46.05
As always.

00:43:51.79,00:43:53.95
- This is a nice surprise.[br]- I hope so.

00:43:54.99,00:43:56.89
- You're home early.[br]- I missed you.

00:43:57.00,00:44:00.63
Mm. I missed you too.

00:44:00.73,00:44:03.10
- Shall we?[br]- Yes.

00:44:17.25,00:44:19.44
Thought you only broke these out[br]for special occasions.

00:44:19.55,00:44:21.45
This is a special occasion.

00:44:26.19,00:44:28.28
Mm.

00:44:37.20,00:44:39.10
Mm!

00:44:41.91,00:44:43.84
Mm!

00:44:53.62,00:44:55.71
Mm! Pot roast.[br]My favorite.

00:45:00.86,00:45:03.38
Allow me, sweetheart.

00:45:03.50,00:45:05.49
You've been[br]on your feet all day.

00:45:05.60,00:45:08.90
- Thank you.[br]- Sure.

00:45:09.94,00:45:13.20
[Sighs][br]Mm.

00:45:24.95,00:45:26.85
So, how's work?

00:45:30.06,00:45:33.65
Actually, we had a-[br]a little trouble with a commission.

00:45:33.76,00:45:35.73
- Is that right?[br]- Yeah.

00:45:35.83,00:45:40.16
- Double booking with another firm.[br]- Huh.

00:45:40.27,00:45:43.23
- Green beans?[br]- No, thank you.

00:45:43.34,00:45:45.36
You'll have some.

00:45:49.21,00:45:51.11
I hope everything[br]works out okay.

00:45:51.21,00:45:55.58
It hasn't yet,[br]but it will.

00:45:58.88,00:46:02.51
[Cutting Meat]

00:46:04.12,00:46:06.65
Pot roast is my favorite.

00:46:06.76,00:46:08.99
Sweetheart,[br]could you pass the salt?

00:46:09.09,00:46:11.06
[Chuckling]

00:46:46.30,00:46:48.73
- Did you try something new?[br]- Mm-hmm.

00:46:50.77,00:46:53.29
Mm!

00:47:00.05,00:47:01.95
[Swallows, Clears Throat]

00:47:05.85,00:47:08.91
So, how was Atlanta?

00:47:09.02,00:47:11.58
Had a few problems ourselves.[br]Some figures didn't add up.

00:47:13.89,00:47:15.95
- Big deal?[br]- Life or death.

00:47:16.06,00:47:18.33
- Wine?[br]- Yeah.

00:47:40.82,00:47:42.98
- I got it.[br]- I got it. I'll get a towel.

00:47:55.23,00:47:57.20
Janey?

00:48:00.71,00:48:03.23
Honey?

00:48:03.34,00:48:06.24
[Tires Squealing]

00:48:10.32,00:48:12.25
Jane!

00:48:18.96,00:48:20.89
Jane!

00:48:23.16,00:48:26.19
How could I be so stupid?

00:48:26.30,00:48:28.20
[Panting]

00:48:37.44,00:48:39.88
Jane! Jane!

00:48:41.81,00:48:45.01
- [Exhales] God.[br]- [Grunting]

00:48:51.06,00:48:53.68
- [Groans][br]- [Tires Screeching]

00:48:56.93,00:48:58.62
[Gasps]

00:49:00.13,00:49:02.53
Oh, dear God.

00:49:07.74,00:49:09.76
- Oh.[br]- [Engine Revs]

00:49:09.88,00:49:12.87
Wait. No, no, no, no.[br]Accident.

00:49:12.98,00:49:14.47
- Honey? Accident.[br]- [Grunts]

00:49:14.58,00:49:16.44
Jane, stop the car! Now!

00:49:16.55,00:49:18.21
[Groans]

00:49:18.32,00:49:20.48
Jane!

00:49:20.59,00:49:22.55
You've overreacting!

00:49:22.65,00:49:25.89
Honey, let's not[br]get carried away.

00:49:25.99,00:49:29.48
- We don't wanna go to sleep angry.[br]- [Grunts] God!

00:49:29.59,00:49:31.93
Pull over.

00:49:32.03,00:49:33.83
Pull over! Pull over!

00:49:35.93,00:49:38.66
- Now, look-[br]- [Grunts]

00:49:43.11,00:49:45.08
We need to talk!

00:49:47.11,00:49:49.58
[Panting]

00:49:55.19,00:49:56.64
- [Banging][br]- [Eddie] Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

00:49:56.67,00:49:58.09
- [Banging][br]- [Eddie] Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

00:49:58.19,00:50:00.16
- Who is it?[br]- Open up.

00:50:03.06,00:50:05.53
- What the hell happened to you?[br]- My wife.

00:50:12.40,00:50:15.00
- She tried to kill me.[br]- Yes, she did. And you know what?

00:50:15.11,00:50:17.17
Gladys tried to kill me,[br]not with a car.

00:50:17.28,00:50:19.51
At least Jane was a man about it.[br]She was up front about it.

00:50:19.61,00:50:22.94
They all try to kill you-[br]slowly, painfully, cripplingly.

00:50:23.05,00:50:24.95
And then-wham.[br]They hurt you.

00:50:25.05,00:50:27.88
You know how hurt I used to be over her,[br]and I used to beat myself up?

00:50:27.99,00:50:29.98
Now I'm great.[br]I got dates all the time.

00:50:30.09,00:50:31.99
I just woke up from a thing.[br]I'm in my robe.

00:50:32.09,00:50:33.99
- You live with your mom.[br]- I live with my mom because I choose to.

00:50:34.09,00:50:35.96
Because that's the only[br]woman I've ever trusted.

00:50:36.06,00:50:38.03
Most of them[br]are passive-aggressive.

00:50:38.13,00:50:41.03
There's a whole psychology.[br]I've been reading books,[br]given what I've gone through.

00:50:41.13,00:50:42.76
And, uh, it's disgusting.

00:50:42.87,00:50:46.24
Do you know there is nothing more cruel[br]on this Earth than a 13-year-old girl.

00:50:46.34,00:50:48.53
They literally form cliques[br]in high school.

00:50:48.64,00:50:51.51
And they play cruel games on each other.[br]A-And test boundaries with each other.

00:50:51.61,00:50:53.58
- What are you talking about?[br]- I'm just saying about[br]you have to understand-

00:50:53.68,00:50:55.65
I'm hurting over here.[br]And you're talking about 13-year-old girls.

00:50:55.75,00:50:57.65
Because I'm trying[br]to get you past the hurt.

00:50:57.75,00:51:00.18
You have to understand the enemy-[br]what you're up against.

00:51:00.29,00:51:02.45
I know exactly[br]what you're thinkin'.

00:51:02.55,00:51:05.82
If she lied about that, what else[br]is it possible that she lied about?

00:51:05.92,00:51:09.12
Her job is a spy[br]to get information from people.

00:51:09.23,00:51:11.99
- French Riviera, a yacht?[br]- [Pouring Drink]

00:51:12.10,00:51:14.00
An Iranian prince?

00:51:14.10,00:51:17.23
She's supposed to get close to him[br]and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

00:51:18.74,00:51:20.80
What?[br]What are you saying?

00:51:20.91,00:51:24.84
What?[br]Your husband is the shooter?

00:51:24.94,00:51:26.84
That's impossible.

00:51:28.05,00:51:29.74
Really?

00:51:29.85,00:51:32.44
This whole thing was probably[br]planned from the beginning.

00:51:32.55,00:51:36.61
Operation Stake Out Johnny. A six-year[br]stakeout to get information from you.

00:51:36.72,00:51:38.69
Mission accomplished.

00:51:41.36,00:51:43.76
Okay.

00:51:43.86,00:51:46.06
Here's the upside.

00:51:46.16,00:51:48.19
- You don't love him.[br]- No.

00:51:48.30,00:51:51.83
You'll kill him, and nobody's[br]better at that than you are.

00:51:51.94,00:51:54.53
Thank you.

00:51:54.64,00:51:56.61
And then it'll be over.

00:52:00.48,00:52:02.17
Mm.

00:52:04.48,00:52:08.51
- [Whispers] What if she's listening?[br]- What?

00:52:08.62,00:52:11.52
Do you think it's possible[br]that she rigged the house?

00:52:11.62,00:52:13.59
- [Normal Voice] Oh, my God.[br]- Hey, dude.

00:52:13.69,00:52:17.29
It could be very possible because of[br]th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff.

00:52:17.40,00:52:19.92
It wouldn't surprise me.[br]That's probably why she doesn't like me.

00:52:20.03,00:52:22.47
- Because she heard me call her a troll.[br]- You're out of your mind.

00:52:22.57,00:52:24.97
I'm just saying it's possible. The woman[br]just tried to run you over with a car-

00:52:25.07,00:52:27.00
That she could hear you.

00:52:27.11,00:52:29.57
[Normal Voice] And I don't give a shit.[br]I hope she is listening.

00:52:29.67,00:52:32.67
[Loud] I hope you are listening, Jane.[br]You know what, I'm on to you.

00:52:32.78,00:52:35.77
You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he[br]was blinded. It's okay. She knows this.

00:52:35.88,00:52:38.48
But I'm not me.[br]I hope you're listening to me.

00:52:38.58,00:52:41.52
And I hope you know th-that I slept[br]with your friend, Jasmine. Huh?

00:52:41.62,00:52:43.11
- Shh.[br]- We're on the board.

00:52:43.22,00:52:45.66
I'm just saying we're on the board my man.[br]Come on. We're on the board.

00:52:45.76,00:52:48.23
You thought it was 37-0.[br]We got five points on the board.

00:52:48.33,00:52:52.02
I nailed Jasmine and she was[br]bad in bed, baby. Johnny, I'm not-

00:52:52.13,00:52:55.29
I know you're embarrassed, but, come on,[br]it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin' to.

00:52:55.40,00:52:57.80
The guys we work with, they don't know.[br]I'm never gonna tell them.

00:52:57.90,00:53:01.50
The people she works with probably got[br]a big laugh over this over the last six years.

00:53:01.61,00:53:03.63
But so what? Who cares?[br]That's not important.

00:53:03.74,00:53:07.23
Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book[br]have been written.

00:53:07.35,00:53:09.71
In the first 150 pages,[br]Johnny's been a clown.

00:53:09.81,00:53:12.34
You can write[br]the last 10 pages.

00:53:12.45,00:53:15.58
You've been smoked,[br]but you can write the last 10 pages.

00:53:17.96,00:53:20.42
Great talk, man. We should[br]do it more often. It was a great talk.

00:53:20.53,00:53:23.09
- I'm proud of you.[br]- I'm gonna borrow this.

00:53:23.20,00:53:27.13
- I like where your head's at.[br]- I'll do it in the morning.

00:53:28.80,00:53:30.70
- You okay?[br]- Yep. Okay.

00:53:30.80,00:53:32.77
- Good night.[br]- Good night.

00:53:36.27,00:53:38.87
- [Door Opens, Closes][br]- [Sighing]

00:53:48.19,00:53:50.21
You don't love him.

00:53:50.32,00:53:53.42
- Good night, John.[br]- Good night, Eddie.

00:53:53.53,00:53:55.46
- Good night, Mom.[br]- [Door Closes]

00:54:12.98,00:54:14.95
[Sniffing]

00:54:43.41,00:54:45.31
Okay, girls, let's go.

00:54:45.41,00:54:49.07
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.[br]You know the drill.

00:55:05.20,00:55:07.10
[Sighs]

00:55:07.20,00:55:10.33
[Man On Videotape][br]This is nice. Who picked this out?

00:55:10.44,00:55:12.60
[Chattering On Videotape]

00:55:14.24,00:55:16.97
- What is this?[br]- It looks like your wedding.

00:55:17.08,00:55:19.07
- I know what it is. What are you doing?[br]- Research.

00:55:19.18,00:55:21.74
- Background on the target.[br]- This room is wrapped.

00:55:21.85,00:55:23.81
Thank you.

00:55:23.92,00:55:26.82
[Minister]... to have and to hold,[br]to love and to cherish.

00:55:26.92,00:55:31.36
- Till death do us part.[br]- [Jane] I promise.

00:55:32.79,00:55:37.29
I, John, take you, Jane,[br]for my lawfully wedded wife...

00:55:37.40,00:55:39.42
- to have and to hold-[br]- [TV Turns Off]

00:55:39.53,00:55:41.97
[Jasmine][br]It's all coming out of the house.

00:55:42.07,00:55:44.26
Well done, ladies.[br]Let's wrap it up.

00:55:45.97,00:55:50.60
- What's going on, Mrs. Smith?[br]- Garden party, girls.

00:55:52.14,00:55:55.17
- [Girls] Oh.[br]- [Chattering]

00:55:59.68,00:56:02.21
- Hi, neighbor.[br]- John, hey.

00:56:02.32,00:56:05.55
- Hey.[br]- Ooh, pumpkin. It's a big one.

00:56:12.03,00:56:16.49
Wow. I can't believe I've never been[br]in here before. This is great.

00:56:16.60,00:56:18.54
- Let's start with the living room.[br]- Oh, yeah.

00:56:18.64,00:56:22.44
- Oh. Nice floors. They teak or something?[br]- Yeah.

00:56:23.48,00:56:25.27
Fuck if I know, Martin.

00:56:26.68,00:56:30.51
Uh, and you won[br]the Golf Masters' trophy this year.

00:56:30.62,00:56:32.24
- [Chuckling][br]- Again.

00:56:32.35,00:56:34.61
Again. It'll be sittin'[br]on your mantel next year.

00:56:42.66,00:56:44.59
[Exhales]

00:56:44.70,00:56:47.69
Oh! Oh!

00:57:12.26,00:57:15.09
Target profile is our main priority.

00:57:16.13,00:57:18.03
Utilize all means necessary.

00:57:18.13,00:57:21.69
Phone taps, credit cards.[br]Audio scan civilian frequencies.

00:57:21.80,00:57:23.63
Uh, with what, Jane?

00:57:26.81,00:57:28.74
[John][br]You've reached the Smiths.

00:57:28.84,00:57:31.87
We can't take your call right now,[br]but leave a message after the tone...

00:57:31.98,00:57:33.88
- and we'll get back to you.[br]- [Beep]

00:57:33.98,00:57:36.78
- And search the database.[br]- For what? John Smith?

00:57:40.79,00:57:44.02
- Find him.[br]- Uh, Jane.

00:57:44.12,00:57:46.22
What?

00:57:46.32,00:57:48.45
- I think I found him.[br]- Where?

00:57:48.56,00:57:50.96
Here.

00:57:52.60,00:57:55.66

00:58:01.57,00:58:04.67
I thought I told you[br]not to bother me at the office, honey.

00:58:04.78,00:58:08.34
- Well, you are still Mrs. Smith.[br]- Well, so are a lot of girls.

00:58:10.72,00:58:13.34
Careful, Jane. I can push the button[br]anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.

00:58:13.45,00:58:16.89
Baby, you couldn't find the button[br]with both hands and a map.

00:58:19.22,00:58:23.13
- Last warning. You need to disappear.[br]- [Jane] No.

00:58:23.23,00:58:24.99
- [John] Now.[br]- [Female Voice] "D" Sector clear.

00:58:25.10,00:58:27.03
You really expect me[br]to roll over and play dead?

00:58:27.13,00:58:29.36
You should be used to it[br]after five years of marriage.

00:58:29.47,00:58:31.94
Six. And I'm not leaving.

00:58:32.04,00:58:33.94
"E" Sector clear.

Evacuation in progress.

00:59:10.64,00:59:12.63
[Woman][br]I've already done this side.

00:59:12.74,00:59:14.04
Let's go!

00:59:14.15,00:59:16.98
[Klaxon Blaring]

01:00:11.94,01:00:14.87
Chickenshit!

01:00:14.97,01:00:16.87
Pussy!

01:00:21.98,01:00:23.41
You're tellin' me you had a shot at her[br]and you didn't take it?

01:00:23.44,01:00:24.84
You're tellin’ me you had a shot at her[br]and you didn't take it?

01:00:24.95,01:00:27.14
What I'm trying to say is[br]we got all this stuff here...

01:00:27.25,01:00:29.34
and you're trying to tell me[br]you couldn't take her out?

01:00:29.45,01:00:31.94
Well, now she's a problem[br]for both of us.

01:00:33.22,01:00:35.19
Now my house is priority one.

01:00:35.29,01:00:37.95
Just give me a hand,[br]will ya?

01:00:38.06,01:00:41.46
Please. You're driving me crazy[br]with the tongs in the furnace.[br]You're like an insane man.

01:00:41.56,01:00:44.73
All right.[br]They gave you 48 hours.

01:00:44.83,01:00:47.67
What do we got left here?[br]Twenty-three? Twenty-two?

01:00:47.77,01:00:49.67
Eighteen and change.

01:00:49.77,01:00:52.76
- You got 18 hours until they[br]close the book on both of you?[br]- [Woman] Eddie.

01:00:52.87,01:00:55.81
Mom! We're on high alert here!

01:00:55.91,01:00:57.81
I almost killed you right then!

01:00:57.91,01:01:00.01
You do not even realize!

01:01:00.11,01:01:02.01
[Mom][br]Never mind.

01:01:02.12,01:01:04.48
I am so done playing games[br]with this broad.

01:01:04.59,01:01:06.49
You gotta take this bitch[br]out head-on.

01:01:06.59,01:01:08.52
Don't tell me[br]how to handle my wife.

01:01:08.62,01:01:11.99
This broad is not your wife.[br]She's the enemy. And she could[br]be outside right now!

01:01:12.09,01:01:14.29
Eddie.

01:01:14.40,01:01:16.89
Got it.

01:01:17.00,01:01:20.83
Now we're talkin'. Only question is[br]how much is it to buy a vowel?

01:01:22.60,01:01:24.57

01:01:24.67,01:01:26.97

01:01:27.07,01:01:30.20
- [Woman] Blackbow Realty.[br]- [John] Yes. Hi. I'm calling from l-Temp.

01:01:30.31,01:01:32.64
[Woman] Oh, great.[br]How's that new penthouse working out?

01:01:32.75,01:01:35.58
[John] Well, just fine.[br]Thank you for asking.

01:01:59.54,01:02:01.51
[Thud]

01:02:03.54,01:02:07.11
[Man] This is security.[br]There seems to be a problem[br]with your elevator, sir.

01:02:07.21,01:02:10.01
Do you want an engineer to come up[br]and, uh, see what the problem is?

01:02:10.12,01:02:13.02
Take your time.[br]I'm really quite comfortable.

01:02:13.12,01:02:15.52
[Man][br]Are you really comfortable?

01:02:15.62,01:02:17.59
Jane?

01:02:19.03,01:02:21.36
Is that you, sweetheart?

01:02:21.46,01:02:24.43
First and last warning, John.[br]Get out of town.

01:02:24.53,01:02:27.63
You know I'm not[br]goin' anywhere.

01:02:27.74,01:02:29.70
Oh, well, so you say.

01:02:29.80,01:02:34.04
But right now you're trapped in a steel box,[br]hanging 70 floors over nothin' but air.

01:02:34.14,01:02:35.84
Oh, so this is a trap.

01:02:35.94,01:02:37.64
[Woman][br]He's in car three.

01:02:37.75,01:02:39.91
[John][br]It's never gonna work, honey.

01:02:40.01,01:02:43.35
It's never gonna work because[br]you constantly underestimate me.

01:02:44.89,01:02:47.98
- Do I?[br]- You have no idea who I am.

01:02:48.09,01:02:50.72
You have no idea[br]what I'm capable of.

01:02:51.93,01:02:54.09
Well, back at you, baby.

01:02:54.20,01:02:57.93
Let me guess. Shaped charge[br]on the counterbalance cable.

01:02:58.03,01:03:00.73
Two more on the primary[br]and secondary brakes.

01:03:00.84,01:03:02.70
Maybe?

01:03:02.80,01:03:05.53
- He found them.[br]- Yes. Thank you.

01:03:05.64,01:03:08.11
Did you also get the base charge[br]at the principal cable?

01:03:11.18,01:03:13.52
Promise to leave town,[br]or I'll blow it.

01:03:19.83,01:03:23.26
Okay. I give up.

01:03:23.36,01:03:25.33
Blow it.

01:03:26.70,01:03:30.13
- What?[br]- Go on. Blow it.

01:03:30.24,01:03:34.19
- You think I won't?[br]- I- I think you won't.

01:03:35.61,01:03:37.58
Okay.

01:03:37.68,01:03:40.41
Five, four-

01:03:40.51,01:03:43.50
- Any last words?[br]- The new curtains are hideous.

01:03:43.62,01:03:45.38
Good-bye, John.

01:03:57.00,01:03:59.52
- What the hell was that?[br]- What?

01:03:59.63,01:04:01.72
You said good-bye.

01:04:09.17,01:04:12.41
[All Shouting]

01:04:12.51,01:04:15.38

01:04:52.72,01:04:54.69
[Elevator Bell Dings]

01:05:14.51,01:05:17.57
## [Tango]

01:05:50.68,01:05:52.58
Madame.

01:05:53.81,01:05:56.34
Thought of a number of[br]lines for this moment.

01:05:57.45,01:05:59.42
"Thought I'd just drop in."

01:05:59.52,01:06:03.01
- "Hey, doll. Thanks for givin' me the shaft."[br]- Nice.

01:06:03.12,01:06:05.85
So, what did you decide?

01:06:05.96,01:06:08.86
I want a divorce.

01:06:08.96,01:06:10.93
I like it.

01:06:11.03,01:06:13.73
You proposed to me here,[br]so it has agreeable symmetry.

01:06:13.83,01:06:15.70
Coat, sir?

01:06:17.20,01:06:19.17
- May I sit?[br]- No.

01:06:30.22,01:06:32.18
[Gun Cocks]

01:06:34.79,01:06:37.22
- [Man] Champagne, sir?[br]- No. Champagne's for celebrating.

01:06:37.32,01:06:39.29
I'll have a martini.

01:06:39.39,01:06:41.36
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:06:44.90,01:06:46.76
I like the dress.

01:06:46.87,01:06:48.92
I'm in mourning.

01:06:49.03,01:06:50.97
You should wear it[br]more often.

01:06:52.74,01:06:54.71
So, what do you want, John?

01:06:56.51,01:06:58.41
We have an unusual[br]problem, Jane.

01:06:59.44,01:07:01.44
You obviously want me dead.

01:07:01.55,01:07:04.81
- Hmm.[br]- And I'm less and less concerned[br]of your well-being.

01:07:04.92,01:07:06.88
So, what do we do?

01:07:08.35,01:07:11.05
Do we shoot it out here?[br]Hope for the best?

01:07:11.16,01:07:13.06
Mm. Well, that[br]would be a shame...

01:07:13.16,01:07:16.53
because they would probably ask me[br]to leave once you're dead.

01:07:19.96,01:07:21.93
Dance with me.

01:07:24.40,01:07:26.39
You don't dance.

01:07:26.50,01:07:28.56
Just part of my cover,[br]sweetheart.

01:07:28.67,01:07:31.04
Was sloth part of it too?

01:07:34.41,01:07:36.38
Ow.

01:07:38.78,01:07:41.15
You think this story's[br]gonna have a happy ending?

01:07:41.25,01:07:44.09
Happy endings are just stories[br]that haven't finished yet.

01:07:51.33,01:07:53.30
[Glass Shatters]

01:08:06.01,01:08:08.54
Satisfied?

01:08:08.65,01:08:10.91
Not for years.

01:08:17.79,01:08:19.81
That's all John,[br]sweetheart.

01:08:38.34,01:08:40.37
Why is it[br]you think we failed?

01:08:40.48,01:08:44.35
Because we were leading separate lives?[br]Or was it all the lying that did us in?

01:08:44.45,01:08:46.35
I have a theory.

01:08:46.45,01:08:49.35
- Newly formed.[br]- I'm breathless to hear it.

01:08:49.45,01:08:51.79
- You killed us.[br]- Provocative.

01:08:53.89,01:08:55.79
You approached[br]our marriage like a job-

01:08:55.89,01:08:58.23
something to be reconned,[br]planned and executed.

01:08:58.33,01:09:00.89
And you avoided it.

01:09:01.00,01:09:03.56

01:34:09.17,01:34:11.64
Excuse me, ma'am.[br]Is it possible to get this reheated? Miss?

01:34:11.74,01:34:13.97
- Miss, I'm talkin' to you. Excuse me.[br]- [Taps Table]

01:34:16.11,01:34:18.60
- Jesus, Johnny.[br]- Good morning, Eddie.

01:34:18.72,01:34:20.91
Morning.

01:34:21.02,01:34:24.58
It's good to see[br]you're okay, man.

01:34:24.69,01:34:27.18
Tell me you got smart[br]and that you killed that lyin' bitch.

01:34:27.29,01:34:29.26
Hmm. This lying bitch?

01:34:30.69,01:34:32.75
Guess it was just[br]wishful thinking.

01:34:32.86,01:34:34.76
- I'm sorry.[br]- [John] Eddie, we got-

01:34:34.86,01:34:37.20
- It's nice to see you, Jane.[br]- Eddie. Eddie, focus, please.

01:34:37.30,01:34:39.67
- We got problems.[br]- You got problems?

01:34:39.77,01:34:42.60
Crack addicts got problems, my friend.[br]You two are smoked.

01:34:42.71,01:34:44.61
- Maybe.[br]- Maybe?

01:34:44.71,01:34:46.84
John, you got the entire[br]agency gunnin' for ya.

01:34:46.94,01:34:49.57
- Probably have her agency[br]gunnin' for you too.[br]- What about you?

01:34:49.68,01:34:51.58
- Me?[br]- Where are you at?

01:34:51.68,01:34:53.62
Where am I at?

01:34:53.72,01:34:57.35
I find myself dragging my feet[br]this morning.

01:34:57.45,01:35:00.05
I think you owe me[br]a little money anyway.

01:35:03.49,01:35:06.46
- What do you think?[br]- We don't understand each other.[br]And I understand that.

01:35:06.56,01:35:09.46
But I don't need those looks from you.[br]I've been in his life a long time.

01:35:09.57,01:35:12.23
- Eddie, Eddie. Focus. Focus.[br]- I've been in his life for a long time.

01:35:12.34,01:35:15.33
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house.[br]They shot at my wife. My own company.

01:35:17.34,01:35:19.37
If she works for who the street...

01:35:19.48,01:35:21.91
says that she works for...

01:35:22.01,01:35:24.45
you're Macy's and Gimbel's.

01:35:24.55,01:35:26.98
She would be the WE channel,[br]and you would be...

01:35:27.08,01:35:29.64
whatever channel it is[br]that competes against the WE channel.

01:35:29.75,01:35:31.74
- Know what I'm saying? You following me?[br]- Mm-hmm.

01:35:31.86,01:35:35.72
Johnny, the point is simple. Once you guys[br]decide to get off the reservation, that's it.

01:35:35.83,01:35:38.76
- Then you're off the reservation.[br]- Eddie, how bad?

01:35:38.86,01:35:40.76
- How bad is it?[br]- Mm.

01:35:40.86,01:35:42.76
You remember Canada.

01:35:42.87,01:35:45.66
- Ooh.[br]- That was kid stuff next to[br]what you're up against.

01:35:45.77,01:35:47.67
- That was you?[br]- Oh, is that a turn-on?

01:35:47.77,01:35:50.24
- She tried to kill you with a car.[br]Not my business.[br]- Stop.

01:35:50.34,01:35:53.14
A good friend stays out of it.[br]I understand. This is the facts.

01:35:53.24,01:35:55.58
If you two separate from[br]each other, you got a shot.

01:35:55.68,01:35:58.65
Not a great shot, Johnny,[br]but you got a shot.

01:35:58.75,01:36:02.38
You two stay together,[br]you're dead.

01:36:02.49,01:36:05.94
Unless you can find something[br]that they want more than they want you.

01:36:11.69,01:36:15.72
Found him. He's being held in subbasement[br]"D" of the federal courthouse.

01:36:15.83,01:36:18.27
High security.[br]Motion and thermal.

01:36:18.37,01:36:20.96
Power's on a city grid.

01:36:21.07,01:36:25.06
This is as far as we go, Jane.

01:36:25.18,01:36:28.98
- [Jane On Headset][br]Right. Thanks for everything.[br]- Good luck, babe.

01:36:29.08,01:36:31.17
[Horns Honking]

01:36:31.28,01:36:33.68
[Man][br]We have this northwesterly flow...

01:36:33.78,01:36:35.72
coming down through[br]the middle of the country.

01:36:35.82,01:36:37.72
So we're seeing successive areas-

01:36:37.82,01:36:39.88
Do one of you guys mind[br]changing the channel?

01:36:39.99,01:36:43.05
- One is moving in right now.[br]- [Whistles] Nick.

01:36:43.16,01:36:47.62
Would you please get off your fat ass[br]and change the channel?

01:36:47.73,01:36:50.10
I know. It's tough.[br]Thank you.

01:36:50.20,01:36:53.36
That's going to make things[br]even colder than they are right now.

01:36:53.47,01:36:55.44
Now, 52-

01:37:12.32,01:37:14.31
- [Chattering][br]- [Man] You guys go.

01:37:19.86,01:37:22.70
[Jane] Thirty-second window.[br]I cut the power, you grab the kid.

01:37:22.80,01:37:25.67
- Simple and clean. Got it?[br]- Got it.

01:37:26.70,01:37:28.64
So tell me.[br]How many?

01:37:31.27,01:37:33.24
Does it matter?

01:37:33.34,01:37:36.28
- Should I go first?[br]- Okay.

01:37:36.38,01:37:40.65
- I don't exactly keep count, but-[br]- [Cocks Gun]

01:37:40.75,01:37:42.68
I would say...

01:37:42.79,01:37:45.52
- high 50s, low 60s.[br]- Mm-hmm.

01:37:47.26,01:37:49.42
Been around the block, but...

01:37:49.53,01:37:51.55
- you know, the important thing is-[br]- 312.

01:37:54.20,01:37:56.17
312?

01:37:58.13,01:38:01.16
- How?[br]- Some were two at a time.

01:38:01.27,01:38:03.24
Oh.

01:38:07.51,01:38:10.21
- Honey.[br]- I'm- I'm- I'm-

01:38:21.39,01:38:23.42
Baby's in the crib.

01:38:25.60,01:38:28.19
Are you counting[br]innocent bystanders?

01:38:34.34,01:38:37.97
- [John On TV][br]Monitoring the perimeter?[br]- I checked the perimeter.

01:38:38.07,01:38:40.84
- What about the police bands?[br]- I am on the police bands.

01:38:40.94,01:38:43.07
- Connected to the main-[br]- This is not my first time.

01:38:44.68,01:38:47.21
I think we've established that.

01:38:47.32,01:38:49.44
Oh.[br][Chuckles]

01:38:49.55,01:38:51.52
All right.

01:38:51.62,01:38:53.78
[Electronic Twittering]

01:38:53.89,01:38:55.88
[Jane][br]Turn left.

01:38:55.99,01:38:57.72
Left, John.

01:38:57.83,01:38:59.95
Left!

01:39:00.06,01:39:03.43
You don't have to[br]talk to me like that. Okay?

01:39:03.53,01:39:06.47
- Be nice.[br]- Left, please?

01:39:06.57,01:39:08.47
I can't go left. You see?

01:39:08.57,01:39:11.23
There is no left. Look.

01:39:11.34,01:39:13.74
I have straight.[br]I have back the way I came.

01:39:13.84,01:39:16.07
There's no left.[br]Which way do you want me to go?

01:39:16.18,01:39:19.67
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.[br]- See what I'm sitting in?

01:39:19.78,01:39:22.08
See that?

01:39:22.19,01:39:24.65
- Take your time.[br]- Yeah. All right. Stay.

01:39:24.75,01:39:26.75
Stay there.[br]Wait for my mark. I'll find it.

01:39:29.66,01:39:31.72
Wait for my mark.

01:39:36.10,01:39:39.90
Almost there.[br]I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

01:39:47.44,01:39:50.14
What are you-John, what are you doing?[br]What are you doing?

01:39:52.28,01:39:54.77
Kill the lights on my signal.

01:39:55.79,01:39:58.15
Now. Kill the lights.

01:39:59.02,01:40:00.58
Jane, kill the lights.

01:40:00.69,01:40:02.92
- Hey. Who's that?[br]- Where?

01:40:03.03,01:40:05.96
[John][br]No, no. Not now! Turn 'em back on!

01:40:06.06,01:40:07.23
- Idiot![br]- [Alarm Blaring]

01:40:07.26,01:40:08.39
- Idiot![br]- [Alarm Blaring]

01:40:08.50,01:40:10.56
- Here they come.[br]- Hey, Nick. Uncuff me.

01:40:10.67,01:40:12.36
[John] Turn 'em on![br]Turn 'em back on!

01:40:12.47,01:40:15.10
- [Gunshots][br]- Turn 'em back on!

01:40:16.84,01:40:18.77
- Turn it back on.[br]- All right.

01:40:18.88,01:40:21.78
- [John] Give me light.[br]- [Jane] Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

01:40:22.98,01:40:24.88
[Beeping]

01:40:24.98,01:40:27.61
- Nick.[br]- Shut up.

01:40:27.72,01:40:29.55
[Alarm Continues]

01:40:29.65,01:40:31.52
[Thud]

01:40:31.62,01:40:33.56
Give me a gun.

01:40:33.66,01:40:35.82
- Nick, give me a gun.[br]- Zip it!

01:40:35.93,01:40:38.55
[All Scream]

01:40:38.66,01:40:42.06
- [Grunts][br]- [Gunshots]

[Man On TV, Indistinct]

01:40:59.08,01:41:02.14
[Groans][br]Open the door.

01:41:03.22,01:41:05.28
Open the door.

01:41:06.72,01:41:08.69
Back there.

01:41:10.83,01:41:13.49
Look out.[br]Move, move, move.

01:41:15.36,01:41:17.33
[Groans]

01:41:18.80,01:41:20.79
This guy's a wily one.[br][Grunts]

01:41:20.90,01:41:22.87
[Grunting]

01:41:27.91,01:41:29.74
Shut the door.

01:41:29.85,01:41:32.61
Move. Move. The other way.

01:41:37.19,01:41:39.28
How's this work?

01:41:41.69,01:41:44.06
- [Groans][br]- [Jane] I told you to wait for my signal.

01:41:44.16,01:41:46.29
- You didn't wait for my signal.[br]- Well, I improvised.

01:41:46.40,01:41:48.49
- You deviated from the plan.[br]- The plan was flawed.

01:41:48.60,01:41:50.96
- The plan was not flawed.[br]- Anal.

01:41:52.34,01:41:55.20
- Organized.[br]- Jane, 90% of this job is instinct.

01:41:55.30,01:41:57.47
Your instincts set off[br]every alarm in the building.

01:41:57.57,01:42:00.10
My instincts got the job done.[br]May not have been the Jane show.

01:42:00.21,01:42:04.04
No. It was the John show. It was half-assed.[br]Like Christmas. Like our anniversary.

01:42:04.15,01:42:06.71
Like the time you forgot[br]to bring my mother's birthday present.

01:42:06.82,01:42:11.72
- Your fake mother's birthday.[br]- The point is, you are always[br]the first to break team.

01:42:11.82,01:42:14.79
You don't want a team. You-[br]You want a servant for hire.

01:42:14.89,01:42:17.72
I want someone I can count on.

01:42:17.83,01:42:20.49
- Jane, there's no air around you anymore.[br]- Oh.

01:42:20.60,01:42:22.50
Okay. What is that[br]supposed to mean?

01:42:22.60,01:42:25.53
It means there's no room for mistakes.[br]No mistakes whatsoever.

01:42:25.64,01:42:28.23
No spontaneity.[br]I mean, who can answer to that?

01:42:28.34,01:42:31.70
Well, you don't have to. Do you?[br]'Cause this isn't even a real marriage.

01:42:34.01,01:42:36.27
- [Benjamin] Who are you people?[br]- Shut up!

01:42:37.91,01:42:40.44
Well.

01:42:40.55,01:42:42.78
[John][br]So, now I realize...

01:42:42.89,01:42:45.62
you witnessed the missus and I[br]working through some domestic issues.

01:42:45.72,01:42:47.95
- Oh.[br]- That's regrettable.

01:42:49.83,01:42:53.35
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.[br]That would be a mistake on your part.

01:42:53.46,01:42:56.02
Now tell us what you know.

01:42:56.13,01:42:58.00
Why do both our bosses[br]want you dead?

01:43:00.44,01:43:02.43
- You unders-[br]- [Tapping]

01:43:02.54,01:43:04.97
Honey, please.

01:43:06.38,01:43:08.28
Wrap it up.

01:43:08.38,01:43:12.21
Maybe it's not such a good idea[br]to undermine me in front of the hostage.

01:43:12.32,01:43:14.55
Sends a mixed message.

01:43:14.65,01:43:17.12
Sorry.

01:43:17.22,01:43:19.19
Girls.

01:43:20.29,01:43:22.19
- Okay.[br]- [Clears Throat]

01:43:22.29,01:43:24.78
- Where was I?[br]- "A mistake on your part."

01:43:24.89,01:43:27.69
Shut up. Options.[br]I'm gonna lay out your options for you.

01:43:27.80,01:43:30.06
- Okay? Option "A."[br]- If I could-

01:43:30.17,01:43:32.46
Shut up.[br]Option "A."

01:43:32.57,01:43:35.47
You talk. We listen.[br]No pain.

01:43:35.57,01:43:37.90
Option "B."[br]You don't talk.

01:43:38.01,01:43:40.67
I remove your thumbs[br]with my pliers.

01:43:40.78,01:43:43.80
It will hurt.[br]Option "C."

01:43:43.91,01:43:48.85
I like to vary the details a bit,[br]but the punch line is you die.

01:43:51.52,01:43:53.42
- Benjamin.[br]- Okay.

01:43:53.52,01:43:57.15
- We're impatient people.[br]- Okay.[br]- [Sighs]

01:44:01.36,01:44:03.26
Can I get a soda?

01:44:03.37,01:44:05.60
Or a juice or, uh, some-

01:44:05.70,01:44:09.83
- [Phone Bell Dings][br]- [Groans] "A." "A." Option "A." Aaah!

01:44:09.94,01:44:12.70
- Oh, that hurt.[br]- Okay. That was a nice shot.

01:44:18.01,01:44:20.11
- What's-You got a spasm?[br]- [Chuckles]

01:44:20.22,01:44:23.52
I'm tied up.[br]Why don't you check my back pocket?

01:44:31.89,01:44:34.19
I'm not the target. You are.

01:44:34.30,01:44:37.60
Both of you.[br]They found out you're married...

01:44:37.70,01:44:40.97
so they teamed up and sent you[br]to the same hit to target each other.

01:44:41.07,01:44:43.73
It was a joint task force[br]by both your companies.

01:44:43.84,01:44:47.94
Two competing agents living under[br]the same roof. It's bad for business.

01:44:48.04,01:44:51.41
- They wanted you to take each other out.[br]- You were bait.

01:44:52.88,01:44:55.87
Well, it's entry level.[br]Toehold into the company.

01:44:55.99,01:44:57.89
Couple hits,[br]they bump me up to a desk.

01:44:57.99,01:44:59.89
It's pretty cool actually.

01:44:59.99,01:45:01.89
You keep the photo[br]in your back pocket?

01:45:01.99,01:45:05.02
- What was I supposed to do? Frame it?[br]- You get rid of it. You burn it.

01:45:05.13,01:45:07.43
- Tradecraft 101.[br]- I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day.

01:45:07.53,01:45:10.26
Just like I guess you skipped the day[br]about not marrying the enemy.

01:45:10.37,01:45:13.67
You were bait,[br]or you are bait?

01:45:18.01,01:45:20.20
Belt. Belt. Belt, dude.

01:45:25.25,01:45:27.65

01:45:27.75,01:45:29.78
Two minutes.

01:45:31.22,01:45:33.19
One minute.

01:45:35.06,01:45:37.46
[Man][br]I'll get you closer.

01:45:58.55,01:46:00.45
A little help.

01:46:00.55,01:46:02.28
- [Man] Clear.[br]- [Man #2] Clear.

01:46:04.05,01:46:07.05
[Benjamin] Hey, I think I chipped my tooth.[br]Do you know if we have dental?

01:46:22.51,01:46:25.27
My way out is a boat[br]standing by in La Paz.

01:46:28.44,01:46:31.47
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

01:46:31.58,01:46:34.14
So, at least, apart,[br]we know what the odds are.

01:46:36.69,01:46:39.81
Let's just call this what it is...

01:46:39.92,01:46:41.86
and what it isn't.

01:46:46.93,01:46:48.83
All right.[br]So it's a crap marriage.

01:46:48.93,01:46:51.87
All right. I'm a mess.[br]You're a disaster.

01:46:51.97,01:46:53.87
We're both liars.

01:46:56.37,01:46:58.27
But you run,[br]you'll always be running.

01:47:01.98,01:47:04.07
I say we stay and we fight.

01:47:04.18,01:47:06.38
We finish this thing.

01:47:06.48,01:47:09.25
Then if you wanna go, you can go.

01:47:09.35,01:47:12.15
Oh, thank you.

01:47:12.25,01:47:16.05
What? "Let's call this what it is."[br]Jesus Christ.

Oh, Jesus.

This is[br]a really good store.

01:48:12.98,01:48:16.32
[Helicopter Whirring]

01:48:34.67,01:48:36.97

Oh.[br][Scoffs]

01:50:20.38,01:50:22.07
Sorry.

01:50:25.88,01:50:28.11
We'll talk about this later.

01:51:35.55,01:51:37.49
[Elevator Bell Dings]

01:51:39.29,01:51:41.26
- I'll fly.[br]- I'll be bait.

01:51:42.73,01:51:45.63
- I'm goin' clockwise, so watch my 6:00.[br]- All right.

01:52:22.10,01:52:24.07

01:52:42.45,01:52:44.08

01:54:31.76,01:54:33.73
How's it look?

01:54:37.03,01:54:39.00
It's a piece of cake.

01:54:48.11,01:54:51.24
Watch these.[br]They tend to jam. So watch 'em.

01:54:53.72,01:54:56.34
You favor your left, sweetheart,[br]so look out for right.

01:55:09.87,01:55:13.36
Damn. That boat in La Paz[br]is lookin' pretty good right now, isn't it?

01:55:18.01,01:55:20.24
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

01:55:26.62,01:55:29.14
Shut up.

01:56:57.07,01:57:00.34
[Wexler] I'm interested in the progress[br]you've made in the last few weeks.

01:57:00.44,01:57:02.34
Uh, doin' all right, aren't we?

01:57:02.44,01:57:04.34
I mean, listen.[br]I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:57:04.45,01:57:06.57
There were times I just wanted to-[br][Clicks Tongue]

01:57:06.68,01:57:08.58
- Kill her, but, uh-[br]- Likewise.

01:57:08.68,01:57:10.58
Couldn't take the shot.

01:57:10.69,01:57:12.59
- That's a good sign.[br]- Who would've thought.

01:57:12.69,01:57:14.71
- Sometimes you have to battle through.[br]- Hmm.

01:57:14.82,01:57:17.79
- That's marriage, right?[br]- Yeah. You take your best shot and-

01:57:19.63,01:57:21.53
- Oh. We redid the house.[br]- Hmm.

01:57:21.63,01:57:23.60
We did. Yes, we did.

01:57:23.70,01:57:26.60
- You know, there will always be challenges.[br]- Uh-huh.

01:57:26.70,01:57:29.00
- Threats out there.[br]- Yep.

01:57:29.10,01:57:31.70
But you can handle it together.

- So far.[br]- Yes, we ca- So far?

01:57:35.78,01:57:38.25
Oh, what is that?

01:57:38.35,01:57:40.34
I'm leaving room for the unknown.

01:57:40.45,01:57:42.78
So far.

01:57:42.88,01:57:45.58
And do you feel that[br]your relationship styles...

01:57:45.69,01:57:48.75
- are more conducive to the free flow-[br]- Ask us the sex question.

01:57:49.79,01:57:51.69
John.

01:57:52.83,01:57:55.19
