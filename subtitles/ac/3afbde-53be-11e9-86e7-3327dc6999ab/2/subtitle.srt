1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,592
Lady, it's you?

2
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:39,724
I'm Ling.

3
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,733
I'm the one who gave you your name.

4
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,268
Do you remember me?

5
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,238
Did I scare you?

6
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,410
Lots of thread.

7
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,874
It's getting longer and longer.
What do you get?

8
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,951
This dragon is nicely sewn.
The Dragon matches the Phoenix.

9
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,851
Go on,
see what else can be pulled out!

10
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:05,217
I've made a mistakes.
I'll help you.

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,027
There are 2 dragons now.

12
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,728
Dragon against dragon,
here comes a jealous phoenix.

13
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,300
I didn't come for you actually.

14
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,903
But I do want to look for you.

15
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,471
Now, I've found you.

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,504
Is this your room?

17
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,475
Are you married?

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,379
Someone's coming.

19
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:29,915
We'll take a revenge for Chimp.

20
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,424
Maybe Dawn's discovered me.

21
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,085
So he sends somebody for me.

22
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,252
Now you are in danger too.

23
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,364
It's hard for me
to talk to you like this.

24
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:48,264
Why not take advantage of that.
Let me take you out.

25
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:56,210
Let's check in different direction.

26
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,662
Disguise yourself.

27
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:21,601
As they have not yet arrived.

28
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,738
Let's go with the hookers,
so they can't find us.

29
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,956
Just relax, I've looked around.

30
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:52,395
No one is coming, let's take a rest.

31
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,596
We can have a good look of this moon.

32
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,173
I'm bringing along with your bottle.

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,275
Why don't you talk?

34
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,643
Are you Japanese?

35
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:11,685
Human's language has
too much meaning.

36
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:12,982
Someone likes flattering!

37
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,920
This is what trouble come from.

38
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,283
The men!

39
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,657
How you know what I'm talking?

40
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:39,077
We are grown in the troubled world.

41
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:42,583
When we join in the troubled world,
we grow older and older.

42
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:46,147
People love to seize their power.

43
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:50,923
But I prefer drinking!

44
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,875
I don't think you'd understand it,
now or in future.

45
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,912
So we'll never have hatred.

46
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,482
If everybody is like us.

47
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,552
We don't have to leave for peace.

48
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:34,968
I'll fix it.

49
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,836
Chief, what's the matter?

50
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:44,836
I came from the capital city.

51
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:46,780
What are you trying to do?

52
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,453
There's a cliff over there.

53
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:16,672
Miss.

54
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,403
Where are we?

55
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,659
Fortunately,
it is not made with fine steel.

56
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,325
Oh no.

57
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,099
Time to eat.

58
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,747
Is that you?

59
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:56,083
Don't talk
or there won't be a meal for you.

60
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:12,627
Sun Moon Sect conquers the world.

61
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,860
Long live the Sect.

62
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:17,862
Long live the Sun Moon Sect.

63
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,007
Long live the Sect.

64
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:25,237
Why don't you kill Ling?

65
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,850
I have my plans.

66
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:37,284
He came here to look for one person.

67
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:40,888
For her?

68
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,926
For her!

69
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:53,436
For me?

70
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,350
Not moving.

71
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,283
Here's some meat.

72
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,012
Wu!

73
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,456
Master Wu!

74
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,119
I've found you finally!

75
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,369
God blessed!

76
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:48,751
God really helps!

77
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,167
How dare you fool me! Go to hell!

78
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,100
You don't dare to kill me.

79
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,476
Make fun on me? Go to hell.

80
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,611
Wu?

81
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:37,564
Master Wu!

82
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,072
So terrible!

83
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,579
You are Master Wu?

84
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:47,214
Don't be scared!

85
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,942
Dawn locked my bone...

86
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:52,884
to forbid me using martial arts.

87
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,416
He only gives me water.

88
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:59,220
He just tortures me!

89
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:00,827
Stop! Let's go out and continue.

90
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,304
Wu!

91
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,914
You know him? That's great!

92
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,814
Kneel down! Betrayer.

93
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:25,750
Don't be scared!

94
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,718
He can do nothing to us.

95
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:28,719
Cause Damn locked his martial arts!

96
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:30,619
Take him to get our reward!

97
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,066
Lock him up!

98
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:40,762
Master Wu!

99
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:45,405
Ling, I'll kill Wu, if you come near.

100
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,678
Essence Absorbing stance?

101
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,390
We're forced by Dawn.

102
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:04,388
Please forgive us.

103
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:05,721
They are forced.

104
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,260
You can't call me Chief.

105
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,626
Just let them go!

106
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,072
I'm back!

107
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,208
- Brother.
- Ling?

108
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,517
Father.

109
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,478
Welcome back.

110
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,457
Father.

111
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:14,324
Long live to Chief!

112
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,436
Zen.

113
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:27,474
Tell all my fellows now,

114
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,338
I'm back.

115
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,878
Tell them the truth
and arrest the betrayers.

116
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:32,945
Chief!

117
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,482
I'm afraid it'd be useless.

118
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:37,108
What's justice then?

119
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,117
Justice depends on power!

120
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:44,155
Someone believes that,

121
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,261
Iike Cloud,
he didn't come for 10 days.

122
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:49,658
His legs were broken by Dawn,

123
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:52,232
and was thrown to Regret Cliff
to guard the graves.

124
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:55,269
Bao objected
the cooperation with Japanese,

125
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:58,668
he was forced to admit guilty
and was poisoned.

126
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,332
Tung disappeared over 20 days.

127
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:06,073
I think the copse towed
by the wolf was him.

128
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:10,709
Chiu was executed.

129
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:14,846
His crimes were written on tombstone
to be scolded by the fellows.

130
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:19,220
And Young, your loyal fellow...

131
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:21,788
Young?

132
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:25,592
What did they do to him?

133
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,931
He was the first one to follow Dawn.

134
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:32,733
He is in-charge
of the execution dept now.

135
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,240
He keeps on investing us.

136
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:39,211
The fellows are all scared.

137
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,273
These 2 hooks,

138
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,909
are designed by him...

139
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,714
to lock you up.

140
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:58,494
Chief, The Martial Arts of Dawn
improved a lot.

141
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:01,728
Compare with us, I think...

142
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,336
Stop!

143
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:04,864
Are you scared?

144
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,031
Chief. In order to find you.

145
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,939
Zen ruined his face and voice
to get into the gypsies camp.

146
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:13,013
Tried so hard to contact with Ying.

147
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:16,049
He just wanted to save you.

148
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,820
Wu is always a hero.

149
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:24,624
I'd never say surrender.

150
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:29,221
Dawn, I'd kill you one day.

151
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:34,027
I'll cut your body into pieces.

152
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:37,400
I won't let you die so easy.

153
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,467
I want you to become a cripple!

154
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,032
Ling!

155
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:45,338
What's the matter?

156
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:48,075
It's our holy job
to kill the bad eggs.

157
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:51,411
We'd co-operate together.

158
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:54,352
To kill the bastard!

159
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,017
If you promise me...

160
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:59,150
I can share reign with you.

161
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,827
Wu, I'll go to Ox Mountain.

162
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:06,399
With my brothers.

163
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:10,598
I think, I can't help you.

164
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:15,667
No justice at all!

165
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,748
But our blood lost would be revenged.

166
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:23,109
Dad!

167
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:28,982
I'd return these hooks to Dawn,
I swear!

168
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:44,862
- Someone's coming.
- Watch out.

169
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,541
Dig... l want your eyeballs!

170
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:50,970
Your heart, your lung.

171
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:53,742
I've got it.

172
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:56,878
Who's it?

173
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,242
Come here.

174
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,131
Sacred Volume!

175
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:14,494
Give it to me.

176
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,069
I'm in your side, Wu.

177
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,667
Same side? I was betrayed
by the one in my side.

178
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,574
Ling, you deserve it.

179
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:26,908
It's you who make such trouble.

180
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,313
We break even.

181
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,814
I'm not the one who is going to lose.

182
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:32,981
We'll leave tomorrow.

183
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:34,917
I'm not involved
in any of your business.

184
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,785
I won't disclose your secret.

185
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:38,084
I swear.

186
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:39,590
Brother, what's the matter?

187
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,797
Dad!

188
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,972
Ling, come to me in midnight.

189
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,074
To ask Ying to marry him.

190
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,868
He decided to stay,

191
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:57,911
so he is on our side.

192
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,307
Kiddo, something's wrong.

193
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:02,580
You must be kidding!

194
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,446
Ying, won't go with me.

195
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:06,644
I won't get involved
into world business for Ying.

196
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,589
I won't tell this joke to anyone.

197
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,417
So you can relax.

198
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,484
Luckily, it's a joke.

199
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:16,760
You know we will
get out of the world business.

200
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,800
Martial art is meaningless to me.

201
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,766
If you don't trust me.
Destroy my martial arts.

202
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:23,960
Destroy your martial arts?

203
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,572
Wu, you heartless guy.

204
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,465
Don't get close to me!
He knows Essence of Absorb Stance.

205
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:34,539
Well! I'll destroy your martial arts.

206
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,811
Dad, don't think that
I'm fallen in love with Ling.

207
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,947
I use him to work for us only.

208
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,487
I'm the Chief.

209
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,284
If I marry the stranger,
I'll suicide before you.

210
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,260
Brother!

211
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,735
Don't be scared, the joke is over.

212
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:03,576
Kiddo, since we can't sleep.

213
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,110
Pack up and sing.

214
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,476
We'll leave at dawn.

215
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,983
I've got it.

216
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:11,849
It's difficult to walk at night.

217
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:16,416
Ling, you'd go first.

218
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,259
I can't see you. I cannot your heart.

219
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:25,423
I'll accompany Wah's students
to go at dawn.

220
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,696
- What happened just...
- I know it!

221
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,669
I offended the Mainlanders.

222
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,632
Thank you for saving my dad.

223
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,044
I won't see you off.

224
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,544
I understand.

225
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,610
Take care.

226
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,979
Chief...

227
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:50,290
Why don't you ask him
where he is going?

228
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,621
He won't come back.

229
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,889
If you don't, I'll go and chase him.

230
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,723
So you won't be regret!

231
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,712
Wine! I've forgot to bring it along.

232
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:19,383
There'd be mine!

233
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:30,657
I've got it!
I'll go and search for good wine.

234
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:34,863
It's over!

235
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,921
Chief,
I'm instructed to draw the map.

236
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:01,688
To celebrate your attack
in 3 days later.

237
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,321
Wish you'd become our new emperor.

238
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,499
Your look?

239
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,533
Don't be scared!

240
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:18,871
Your voice changed!

241
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:22,308
Isn't it because of Sacred Volume?

242
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,147
No matter what I'd be changed to,

243
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,011
I won't forget you.

244
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:34,318
What a beautiful world.

245
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:40,327
Making heroes compete for the world.

246
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,430
You'd understand now.

247
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,800
Why I don't sleep with you.

248
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,147
Give me the Sacred Volume.

249
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,113
I will burn it.

250
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:10,996
Take it to me.

251
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,239
I'll give you my treasure,
the Sacred Volume.

252
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:22,270
You want to burn it?

253
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:24,143
Murderer.

254
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,477
Volume!

255
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,086
You are just the same
as the common people.

256
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,294
You're heartless.

257
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,794
Chief, I'm wrong.

258
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,632
- I'll follow you forever.
- You won't.

259
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,569
Go now!

260
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,534
I'm puzzled now.

261
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:56,166
I prefer dying
to be abandoned by you.

262
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:58,204
Who is it?

263
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,619
Ling!

264
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:09,346
You can speak our language!

265
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:14,494
I'm bored
so I want to drink with you.

266
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,121
But I can't guess you're...

267
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,690
What a coincidence.

268
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,563
I'm bored
because of the unpredictable world.

269
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:23,102
Since it's unpredictable, let's stop.

270
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:25,833
Will leave here tomorrow.

271
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:28,973
Leave the business to somebody else.

272
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,474
You are willing to die for me?

273
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,915
No!
I want you to stay with Ling for me.

274
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:45,249
Life is like morning dew, it's hard
for me to find a true friend.

275
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:46,724
Come on.

276
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,193
Don't let him discover
that your take.

277
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:55,961
Remember me always.

278
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,171
I am coming.

279
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,230
Where are you?

280
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,103
I am here.

281
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:07,280
- Wine, please.
- Ling!

282
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,279
I didn't know your name.

283
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,475
Cici.

284
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,353
Cici?

285
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:16,754
You've crying.

286
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:19,486
Life is so short
and so hard to predict.

287
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:21,525
We're in the same boat.

288
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,290
All I want is only one night,
please stop asking.

289
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,064
Long live...

290
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:31,535
I'm so glad that the outsiders
and fellows are all loyal to me now.

291
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,833
Chief, your voice differs...

292
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:38,874
I've been successful
in practicing the supernatural power.

293
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:41,373
Our invasion to the North.

294
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,778
And our kingdom will come true soon.

295
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,452
Invincible Dawn?

296
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,751
Wu, that old fox is useless now.

297
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,755
He'll ruin my plan only.

298
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:55,190
I've to kill him
and his followers all.

299
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:56,820
Yes, sir.

300
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:05,331
Stab the needle into the artery.
Close his sinus.

301
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:15,709
"The seas laugh,
lashing on both shores."

302
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:21,551
"Carried in the waves,
we have only the here and now."

303
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,292
"The heaven laugh at
the troubled world."

304
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:33,593
"Only they know,
who is to win and lose."

305
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:39,664
"The mountains laugh,
the rain is affair."

306
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:46,008
"When the waves grew old,
the world still goes on."

307
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:51,876
"The clean winds laugh,
such a feeling of solitude."

308
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:57,854
"My sentiments remain
laughing still."

309
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:02,696
"The earth laughs, solitude no more."

310
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:05,765
Those swordsmen treasure
their swords more than their lives.

311
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:09,302
Why don't you treasure your swords?

312
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,163
We'll retreat tomorrow.

313
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,932
So there is no use for us to have it.

314
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,571
Why don't you take the garlic
and season the food?

315
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:17,975
Don't be that anxious!

316
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,592
Drink less!

317
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:16,531
Don't miss our trip tomorrow.

318
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:19,730
Anything else you don't think
its convenient to say?

319
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:21,502
No.

320
00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:25,338
I just want to sing "Hero of Heroes"
with you till dawn.

321
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:26,605
Come!

322
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,406
Let's continue.

323
00:26:29,684 --> 00:26:35,281
"The seas laugh,
lashing on both shores."

324
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,588
"Carried in the waves,
me have only the here and now."

325
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:43,821
May I ask, who is the hero of heroes?

326
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,106
Blue Phoenix!

327
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,014
Blue Phoenix,
aren't you chasing Ling?

328
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,087
Go!

329
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,165
It's the wind

330
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,572
Dad!

331
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,342
- I smell blood!
- Blood?

332
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:50,587
There is trouble with Blue Phoenix.

333
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,932
"The Slaying Sword".

334
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,041
"The Whirlwind Blow".

335
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,121
"The Flying Bomb".

336
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,294
Don't you want to escape?

337
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,072
- Go out and have a look.
- Where is Kiddo?

338
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:41,647
- He is outside.
- Where is my sword?

339
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,010
The sword's so hot.

340
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,056
Take Blue Phoenix to leave first.

341
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:01,298
I know you are here, Dawn.

342
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:04,399
Wu, we haven't seen for half years.

343
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,467
You must be upset for
being defeating by my trap.

344
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,969
When you discovered
I'd got the Sacred Volume.

345
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,636
You afraid that I'd be successful
in practicing supernatural power.

346
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:14,213
So you must kill me.

347
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:15,948
Therefore, I'd take this risk.

348
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,711
To take action before you,
seize your position.

349
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:23,287
And establish
my own kingdom of Highlanders.

350
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,858
I'd be a historical hero,

351
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:28,018
I'd thank you Wu.

352
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:31,064
Your voice told me you were not Dawn.

353
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:32,529
Who are you?

354
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:39,701
Supernatural power
from Sacred Volume.

355
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,682
Hot sword!

356
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,257
Your sword is stabbed into the hen.

357
00:29:58,426 --> 00:29:59,723
It's edible now.

358
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:01,722
You've mistaken my sword.

359
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,262
- You said you don't want it anymore.
- Take it here.

360
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:06,332
How can you be so scared
when facing the enemies!

361
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:07,762
All rubbish!

362
00:30:12,907 --> 00:30:14,704
Chief, come! We have company.

363
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:16,737
Blue Phoenix.

364
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:18,735
She is seriously hurt!
Take her in quickly!

365
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,376
Chief!

366
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:32,385
Chief!

367
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,855
Cici...

368
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,455
Ling?

369
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,668
Long live to Japan.

370
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,599
"The Flying Bomb".

371
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:50,938
"The Whirlwind Blow."

372
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:53,336
"Essence Absorbing stance!"

373
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:57,482
Zen.

374
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,552
Blue Phoenix is seriously hurt!

375
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:02,383
- Master Wu.
- Luke, don't go there.

376
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:06,122
Japanese Gypsies,
it's a mistake to follow Dawn.

377
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,227
You are defeated by the Chief.

378
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,387
You are not qualified
to challenge him.

379
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,965
Chief, I think Dawn has come.

380
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,361
He maybe nearby.

381
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:16,328
We can drag the Wah students down.

382
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:18,438
Don't stay with us, go quickly!

383
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,406
Let's go together.

384
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,800
Our feud is too deep.

385
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,568
We can't leave like you do.

386
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:24,972
Blue Phoenix is seriously injured.

387
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,874
Please take her away with you.

388
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:29,973
You had better go now,
find some herbs to cure her.

389
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,551
Or, it'd be too late.

390
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:35,779
Blue Phoenix, if you come back
and see our corpses.

391
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,719
You'd take a revenge for us.

392
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,484
Go! Hurry up!

393
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,560
Well, let's depend a fate.

394
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:42,594
Let's go!

395
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:43,727
Take care.

396
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,535
"The Slaying Sword".

397
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,343
Essence Absorbing stance!

398
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,026
"The Flying Bomb".

399
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,696
"Powerful Hand stance".

400
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:27,671
"Division"

401
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:32,111
"Essence Absorbing Stance".

402
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,748
Timber.

403
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,747
Tell us, where is Dawn?

404
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,321
I won't tell a word!

405
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,527
Dawn, come out!

406
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,468
Kill! I want to kill...

407
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:59,162
Dad! Stop! you've not yet recovered.

408
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:02,766
Chief! There's a long way ahead,
why not revenge later?

409
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:06,003
For Sun Moon Sect,
just swallow your pride now.

410
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,408
I beg you!

411
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:09,379
I've enough!

412
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,214
Hurry up!

413
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:24,156
Wu, I'm coming.

414
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,098
Did she hurt you?

415
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,366
I'll take a revenge for you.

416
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:32,302
Take Blue Phoenix away,
don't let brother come back.

417
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:33,667
Go! Kiddo!

418
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:34,673
Are you retreated?

419
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,706
- Bull shit! Sword position.
- Yes...

420
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,548
Isn't it lnvincible Dawn?

421
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:46,085
Dawn should be a man.

422
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,932
Scum bag.

423
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:19,049
You are trapped! Wu has gone.

424
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,321
Brother.

425
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,967
There is fire over the lnn.

426
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:38,235
Shit! Would Wu do anything
to our brothers?

427
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,234
I got to go back and check that out.

428
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,973
Cici, I'll come back for you at dawn.

429
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:50,682
I want to go with brother.

430
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:52,112
I don't go to Ox Mountain.

431
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:54,277
If you see Ling,
tell him not to wait for me.

432
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:07,195
I've broken through my sinus.

433
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:10,360
The poisoned blood is
running through my whole body.

434
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,471
I can't be cured.

435
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:16,404
I want to die together with Dawn.

436
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:22,072
Blue Phoenix...

437
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:26,545
Should we stop singing
"Hero of Heroes".

438
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,046
Blue Phoenix! We'd be hurry.

439
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:34,744
I'll find a doctor to cure you.

440
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,253
I'll take you to Ox Mountain.

441
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:40,523
Let's retreat.

442
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:48,530
Chief, I haven't left you.

443
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:55,403
I'm happy.
I've waited for your return.

444
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:16,488
Sing, let's sing!

445
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:22,297
"The seas laugh..."

446
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,585
Brother.

447
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:55,694
You are already secluded.

448
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:57,787
Goodbye.

449
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:01,026
Ling, you can't even
understand the world.

450
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:02,860
Your enemies
are afraid of your revenge.

451
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:06,529
Even you hide yourself,
they won't let you go.

452
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,572
Dawn!

453
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:13,576
30 thousand of Dawn's fellows
has been sent to Blackwood Cliff.

454
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,238
They are waiting for
further instruction.

455
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,111
He wants to be emperor.

456
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,912
We'll go to Blackwood Cliff
may be we won't be back.

457
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:24,055
Dawn has the power
from Sacred Volume.

458
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:28,992
How deep is his Martial Arts?

459
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:30,686
You should understand other.

460
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:33,229
Ling, do you want to
look at the Sacred Volume?

461
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,059
What is it?

462
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:36,900
Would you let me have a look?

463
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:38,770
Take it.

464
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,964
We are in the same boat now.

465
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,006
Great!

466
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,412
I've got this Sacred Volume...

467
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,310
together with Dawn.

468
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:50,381
I knew he was aggressive.

469
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:52,017
He wanted to own it.

470
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:54,414
I copied one set.

471
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:58,718
"To practice the supernatural power,
one'd cut his penis off."

472
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:03,090
Cut his penis off...

473
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,296
Wu!

474
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:12,996
Dawn is so smart and clever.

475
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:14,899
He torture me.

476
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,509
But at last, he won't let himself go!

477
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,879
To practice the supernatural power,
he's willing to cut his penis.

478
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:25,014
He isn't a man now!

479
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,881
For this Sacred Volume.
Our Master betrayed us.

480
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:35,718
Thus we decided to leave for peace.

481
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,632
Leave for peace?

482
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:51,371
Ling!

483
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:54,644
If your next generation can't stand
the Martial Arts temptation.

484
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:56,715
And leave you
to be the sword man again.

485
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:58,509
Can you stop them?

486
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:02,244
Next generation?
I've never dreamt of it.

487
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:07,292
Swordsman! Once there is people,
once there is feud.

488
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:09,826
With feud,
there is another troubled world.

489
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:11,428
Eventually, man is troublesome.

490
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,089
How can you claim you want peace?

491
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:29,141
Sun Moon Sect conquers the world.

492
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:32,081
Long live the sect.

493
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:35,245
Long live the Sun Moon Sect.

494
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:38,016
Long live the Sect.

495
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,956
Wu is going to attack...

496
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,688
Blackwood Cliff.

497
00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:44,387
The guards have been killed.

498
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,031
They'll soon be here.

499
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,468
They are just small potatoes.

500
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,036
They have arrived.

501
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,540
I'm going to destroy those betrayers!

502
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:57,506
Only those
who obey me can keep their lives!

503
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,183
Swaying sword!

504
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,792
Cool's sword!

505
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:22,562
Attacking sword!

506
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:32,506
Cici!

507
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:35,175
Ling!

508
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:36,912
Are you Dawn?

509
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:38,311
Sure.

510
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:39,448
Kidding!

511
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:40,576
Ying!

512
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:41,777
Why don't you greet your uncle?

513
00:42:41,956 --> 00:42:43,856
No, you'd call her auntie.

514
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:51,293
The Mainlanders bully the Highlanders.

515
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:55,060
Now you bring Mainlanders
to Black Wood Cliff...

516
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,567
to interfere the internal business
of Sun Moon Sect.

517
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,864
How can you face your ancestors?

518
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:06,102
You allied with the Japanese Gypsies
to kill our fellows.

519
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:08,941
And you dare to
mention our ancestors!

520
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,346
If the Highlanders can
rule the Mainlanders.

521
00:43:12,553 --> 00:43:14,544
Dawn will be famous forever.

522
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:17,916
Shut up.

523
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,857
But before the duel, I want to know.

524
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:24,462
Did you sleep with me that night?

525
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:27,957
Brother, you...

526
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:34,166
You slept together?

527
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:40,305
Smile!

528
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:50,186
We are grown in the troubled world.

529
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,552
But we are getting older and older.

530
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:56,457
The people want to compete for reign.

531
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,330
Why not drink instead of fight?

532
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:17,615
Sacred Volume is a big joke.

533
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:19,844
You are now famous.

534
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,817
What is the guy, man or woman?

535
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:23,547
How can you sleep with him?

536
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:26,219
Kiddo,
let's end up all the thing today.

537
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,152
You know it's our Sect's business.

538
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,161
Why you go against me with them?

539
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,066
I take the revenge for my brothers.

540
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,062
Take revenge?

541
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:40,634
I haven't killed
any of your brothers.

542
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,607
I saw you kill them.

543
00:44:42,776 --> 00:44:44,266
Actually, the Wah students
are not linked with you.

544
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:46,036
They were killed of no reason.

545
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,980
You'd pay for your life.

546
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:52,045
Be careful!

547
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,620
Essence Absorbing Stance.

548
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:07,060
Your dog is killed by you.

549
00:45:07,368 --> 00:45:08,460
Time to pay back.

550
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:19,835
Kiddo.

551
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:23,041
Chief!

552
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,457
Your honour.

553
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:35,885
Watch my hook!

554
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:46,364
Take it back.

555
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,079
I thought you learned
this because of the throne.

556
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,909
Indeed you do it because of a man!

557
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:00,883
You are jealous
because I can take both.

558
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:02,783
Do you think that
all people would listen to you?

559
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:05,654
It's a pity
that Ling's his Ying and Carol.

560
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:09,459
You'd be the third if he wants you.

561
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:25,376
Betrayer!

562
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:39,548
Father!

563
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:57,066
Ling, life is really unpredictable...

564
00:46:57,244 --> 00:46:59,235
and so, we don't need to predict it.

565
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:01,243
Let's get out of here tomorrow.

566
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,460
Essence Absorbing Stance.

567
00:47:38,352 --> 00:47:39,148
Father!

568
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:40,378
Danger.

569
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:46,551
Ling, I'm sincere,

570
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:48,724
so I'm not in full strength.

571
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:52,058
How dare you try your very best
to hurt me?

572
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,889
Answer your lover!

573
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:56,467
Stop attacking your allies.

574
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,567
Why didn't you attack
his weakest point?

575
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:00,364
You don't want to, do you?

576
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:07,112
Don't talk about love between us.

577
00:48:07,314 --> 00:48:08,508
We've hatred only.

578
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:09,909
Hatred?

579
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:15,716
For revenge, or for the girls?

580
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:18,514
You heartless guy!

581
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:20,420
I want you to see them die...

582
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:21,924
in front of you.

583
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,925
Supernatural power
from Sacred Volume.

584
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:31,000
The wall will fall soon.

585
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,207
Hurry up, to the roof!

586
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:43,875
It is not safe here!

587
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:51,320
Dawn!

588
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:55,292
The whirling sword!

589
00:48:56,396 --> 00:48:57,385
Merciful hand!

590
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:58,928
Attacking sword!

591
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:05,296
The reverting sword!

592
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:08,871
Who can you save?

593
00:49:10,978 --> 00:49:12,275
Combination on 4 stances.

594
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:22,818
Kiddo!

595
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:38,603
Why do you save me?

596
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:40,133
I want to ask you...

597
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:42,901
Did I stay with you that night?

598
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:48,077
I won't tell you,
I want you to remember me.

599
00:49:48,515 --> 00:49:50,506
I want you to regret
for your whole life.

600
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:52,579
Cici!

601
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,012
- Cici!
- Ling...

602
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:02,658
Tell me, you are Cici.

603
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:41,193
Sun Moon Sect
will unite the whole world.

604
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:43,268
Long live...

605
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:44,993
Wu, our Chief!

606
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:48,833
Long live...

607
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:50,934
It's another Dawn.

608
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:54,009
- Hang Dawn up!
- Yes.

609
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:57,448
Please forgive us

610
00:50:57,684 --> 00:50:59,481
- Yang, kneel!
- Yuan, kneel!

611
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:01,281
- Lee, kneel!
- Chi, kneel!

612
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:02,513
Seto, kneel!

613
00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:05,783
Bring the betrayer of Dawn here.

614
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:07,186
- And kill!
- Yes!

615
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:10,485
Those betrays me should be killed!

616
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:23,205
- Zen!
- Chief Wu.

617
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:25,436
Anybody else in the list?

618
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:29,247
Fan, Ching, Lin,

619
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:32,476
Lui, Hoi, Cheung,

620
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:35,484
Lee, Kan, Win...

621
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:39,184
Wu, Tung, Yang, kneel!

622
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,251
- Ling!
- Ying.

623
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:47,131
Ling, go now!

624
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:49,162
What's the matter?

625
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,267
You are on the list.

626
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:53,869
Dad trusts no Mainlander.

627
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:57,435
Dad holds the power again.

628
00:51:57,677 --> 00:51:58,974
He won't let you go.

629
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,146
I'll lead you to the exit.

630
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:09,480
Who else can be trust?

631
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:13,522
Ling, follow me, quick!

632
00:52:16,163 --> 00:52:16,959
Run!

633
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:20,362
The boat is leaving.
Take the tea to the boat.

634
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,671
Ling, you can't go to Ox Mountain.

635
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,330
He won't let you go.

636
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:30,999
The gov't is going to arrest you.

637
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:36,310
You want to retreat.
The only way is to go to Japan.

638
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:38,781
What? Japan?

639
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,351
What are you going to do?

640
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:42,818
This is brought by you.

641
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,852
I cannot play your favorite song.

642
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:47,590
Take it back.

643
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:53,291
Ling!

644
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,694
Zen!

645
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:57,235
Ling, our Chief wants you back.

646
00:52:57,437 --> 00:52:59,837
If not, leave me your head.

647
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:03,474
I'll do it!

648
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:06,844
- Ying!
- I'm fine.

649
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:13,248
Willow sword.

650
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,328
What do you mean?

651
00:53:24,197 --> 00:53:27,598
If I lose, I won't blame anymore.

652
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:29,498
Come on!

653
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:35,039
I'll stop playing any competition.

654
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:48,081
Zen!

655
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:50,155
Ling, I can't arrest you.

656
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:52,718
I can't finish my job,
I'd cut my arm.

657
00:53:52,893 --> 00:53:55,384
But I envy you,
for you can leave here.

658
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:57,529
Go now! Someone's coming.

659
00:53:57,731 --> 00:53:59,028
The ship is ready.

660
00:53:59,432 --> 00:54:01,229
Please leave me alone.

661
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:02,164
Go!

662
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:05,737
Ying, let's go together?

663
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:09,033
Your father won't let you go.

664
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,907
But I am his daughter,

665
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:14,639
I'd stay with Sun Moon Sect.

666
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:18,979
The ship'd leave, hands off.
