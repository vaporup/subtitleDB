get down here and explain.

have a better handle
on this than I do.

Alai, come and explain.

517
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,831

we need to approach the planet

518

in the direction it's moving.

519
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,302

from its energy of motion.

Go on, Alai.

523
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,479
ALAI: Of course, there's
a moon we have to pass here

524
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,447
and that complicates things.

525
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,283
Because the moon's moving in
the opposite direction to us,

526
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,052
we get
a gravitational braking.

When we go into battle,

620
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,830
you will not pass
through the gates

621
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,865
until all my soldiers
are through.

622
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:05,202
Then you will remain

undrawn and unfired,

Okay, you can't just keep
your thumb on the trigger.

641
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,625
You need half a second
to recharge.

642
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,460
At least you don't have
any bad habits.

643
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,262
I don't have
any good ones either.

644

646
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,539

to hold the beam.

a tenth and a half-second.

to you privately, sir?

your back on me!

If I'm gonna be useful in this
toon, I have to practice!

681
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,022
You will do what I tell you!

682
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,091
I will follow all commands
you are authorized to give.

683
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,559
But if you take away
my free time,

684
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,560
I will get you iced.

685
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,800
Are you threatening me, snot?

686
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,036
No.

687
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,375
Listen.
I know you want to trade me.

688
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,844
But no one will take me
if I don't know anything.

689
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,813
Let me practice.
You can get rid of me sooner.

690
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,581
I already gave you an order!

691
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,049
I know. In front of everybody.

692
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,050
And you don't want
your soldiers to think

693
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,852
that you backed down.

694
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,455
So, for tonight, you can say
that you won this argument.

695
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,656
Then tomorrow,
you can tell everybody

696
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,358
that you changed your mind.

697
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,625

I'll get to train,

I changed my mind.

705
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,626
Maybe by watching my toons,
you'll learn something

706
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,561
and I can trade you easier.

707
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,563
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!

I don't think
you're hiding here

just because you care
about Bonzo.

1053
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,508
I think you're hiding

27 years after
Rackham's victory.

1081

immediately after?

There is no teacher
but the enemy.

that one particular ship,

1175

Which have...

A queen...

1180
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,198
Who directs the worker ants.

1181
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,670
What she thinks they do.

1182
01:14:02,672 --> 01:14:04,772
Without her, they can't
think for themselves...

1183
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,174
And they die.

1184
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:07,675
You destroyed
the queen's ship.

1185
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:08,910
I must have. Yes.

1186
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:11,979
But you can't be certain?
No.

1187
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,515
And so the Hegemon insisted
we keep it classified.

1188
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:16,517

the rest of the battle.

seen a queen?

1200

No. No one has.

1201
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,126
But if the Formics
have rebuilt their fleet,

1202
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,062
there must be more
than one queen.

1203
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:02,997
Yes, of course.
On their home planet.

1204
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,198

when you attacked here?

1205
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,902

No.

skinny-dipping

1220

to death on the simulator!

1221

All right. Take your seats.

we may be called on
to fight a real battle.

Let's bring your commander
up to speed.

1225
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,229
Our latest probe images
will give you an idea

1226
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,964
of what's happening
on the enemy planet.

1227
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,808
Like us, they appear to have
a population growth rate

1228
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,777
that's unsustainable.

1229
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,646
For now, they're contained
on their planet.

1230
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,148
Time is not on our side.

1231
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,183
Where are they?

to just a few hours a day.

1234
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,792
What's most alarming
is the rate

1235
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,994
at which their military power
is expanding.

1236
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,684
But they have not yet
moved against us.

1237
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:04,752
No.

1238
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,358
They're planning to colonize
another planet

Our orders are to defeat them

1241
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,896
before they pose
an irreversible threat.

1242
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:18,165
HYRUM: Their very existence
is a threat.

1243
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,300
Is that clear, Commander?

1244
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:24,071
Clear, sir.
Good.

1245
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:25,706
Carry on, Colonel.

1246
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,177
We will begin with
photo real simulations

1247
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,847
to best approximate
real battles.

1248
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:35,750
You will command
overall strategy.

1249
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:38,986
Your toon leaders will
each command a battle group.

1250
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,888
You will issue orders to them.

1251
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,190
They will issue orders

1252
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,191
to their squadrons
of drone pilots.

Finally,

your entire fleet must support

1257
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,432

We call her
"the little Doctor."

1264
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,952
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels.

1265
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:47,755
At the focus point, they reach
critical effective mass.

1266
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:49,223
A chain reaction
spreads outwards,

1267

That's the beauty
of the little Doctor.

1270
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,832
No need to identify
a specific ship for the queen.

1271
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:00,501
The chain reaction
takes out an entire swarm.

1272
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,739
But I'll only get one shot.

1273
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,240
Once the Formics
see how she works,

1274

together again.

1430

for a chain reaction.

No. I need two minutes.

this battle, Dink,

it's all or nothing now!

the wreckage will continue to
drift with us, like a shield.

his entire fleet.

when we fought Bonzo!

what you're doing.

we destroy the queens.

are our heat shield.
