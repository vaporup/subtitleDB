1
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:16,887
Come in, Weather Channel.
What‘s the forecast?

2
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,276
Fair skies, not a cloud in sight.

3
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:24,407
- Poolside?
- The same. Under control.

4
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,716
- How‘s the perimeter?
- All secure.

5
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,327
I like to come out
and do a few laps every day.

6
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:32,087
Keeps the health in good shape.

7
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:36,922
- It‘s very refreshing. Private, too.
- Yes, indeed.

8
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,167
Cumulus! 0n the double!
Maximum cloud cover!

9
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,556
Go!

10
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:50,807
Go! Go! Move!

11
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,684
Cover ‘em! Get ‘em out of here!

12
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,727
Get ‘em out! Let‘s go!

13
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:57,527
Open the door!

14
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,563
Let‘s go! Go, go!

15
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:03,316
Watch yourself!

16
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,479
- Move ‘em out!
- Come on! Move!

17
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:09,607
- Watch his back!
- Let‘s go!

18
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,887
- Here they are!
- Can we get a statement?

19
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,957
Move! Outta the way! Get down!

20
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,917
What‘s going on?

21
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,516
- Come on!
- Watch it!

22
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,607
- Friends of yours?
- No, not at all.

23
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,399
Sorry. Do I know you?

24
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,967
We‘re having a private conversation,
so if you don‘t mind.

25
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,764
Why are you just sitting there?

26
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,438
Quick! Get him into the car!

27
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,047
- No!
- Just do it.

28
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,003
- I‘m in charge.
- I don‘t think so.

29
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,679
Forget it!

30
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,202
Can anyone in this classroom

31
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,567
distinguish between
protectors and assassins?

32
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,607
Because I‘m having a hard time.

33
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,527
If this wasn‘t a simulation,

34
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:52,839
I‘d be handing in
my resignation about now.

35
00:03:56,567 --> 00:04:01,038
to hold a gun to the head of the man
you are supposed to be protecting?

36
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,327
Are you bodyguards

37
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,127
or are you kidnappers?

38
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,687
You‘re supposed to be
using your heads.

39
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:14,327
Chang, how about letting the rest
of us in on what you were thinking?

40
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:18,247
Sir, one of the lessons
that you taught us was to,

41
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:21,607
under certain circumstances,
you must be prepared to die

42
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,927
to protect the life of the subject.

43
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:26,680
I realised I was prepared to die.

44
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:39,767
There‘s more to being a bodyguard
than being fast or prepared to die.

45
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,687
In the end, your decisiveness
saved your man‘s life.

46
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:44,678
But you didn‘t earn his trust

47
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,407
and that‘s something
you are going to have to learn.

48
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:52,525
Thank you, sir.
What about the objective?

49
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,002
Will I be going with the others?

50
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:00,487
I think we‘ll be able
to find a place for you.

51
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:05,561
But I have another assignment
for you, a short one, in Hong Kong.

52
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,326
Hong Kong? Doing what?

53
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:13,847
That is James Shong,
chairman of the Tai Fung group,

54
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,600
a corporation that brings in
millions in foreign money.

55
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:21,396
You are going to be protecting
that man‘s girlfriend.

56
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,767
0n the evening of May 27,

57
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:31,127
a man was strangled to death
at the Clear Water Bay Yacht Club.

58
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,007
The victim was Lu Kin-chue,
an elderly accountant.

59
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:37,966
The suspect is Chu Kwok-man,
the reputed boss of the Liang mob.

60
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:43,287
The police believe it is related to
a case which the CAC is working on

61
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:47,047
involving $100 million
in drugs and money laundering.

62
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:51,287
Michelle Yeung, a 24-year-old,
witnessed the murder while driving.

63
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:55,326
There were two additional witnesses:
a sailor, Chan Tai-keung, 28,

64
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,565
and a security guard,
Chu Tung-ming, age 51.

65
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:05,197
Two days later, Chan Tai-keung died
in an unexplained elevator accident.

66
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:13,322
0n the same evening, Chu Tung-ming
was blown up by an unknown bomber.

67
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,844
On June 1,
as Michelle Yeung prepared her bath,

68
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,317
she discovered it had been
rigged to electrocute her.

69
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,207
She escaped injury,

70
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:32,882
and is now the sole surviving
witness to the accountant‘s murder.

71
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,364
Please, be seated.

72
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:44,079
Miss Yeung, this is Sergeant Lau.
He‘s in charge of the investigation.

73
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,957
Not bad.

74
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,798
Ken, come over here.

75
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:54,647
- What?
- I‘ve gotta get a bet down.

76
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,207
Wait a minute. Trust me.
He‘s number two to win.

77
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:02,359
- No way. Four‘s the favourite.
- Forget about it. Trust me.

78
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,597
Why the hell should I?

79
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,087
Miss Yeung, here‘s your tea.

80
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,967
- I made it myself.
- I appreciate it.

81
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,807
Most women as attractive as you
are afraid to testify.

82
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,879
What does that have to do with it?
I was a witness.

83
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,247
All righty then.

84
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:22,398
Miss Yeung, do you recognise
any of these men?

85
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,363
Are you aware of all of the dangers

86
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,167
that are involved in
identifying an accused murderer?

87
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,998
Mr. Shong says pick number one.

88
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:36,567
I see. Tell James I‘m a big girl
with my own mind.

89
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,767
- Understand?
- If you‘re scared, you should go.

90
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,367
- It‘s not me that I‘m worried about.
- They can‘t see you.

91
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,164
That guy. Number two.

92
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,407
James had no right to send you.

93
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:51,956
Miss Yeung, do you think the other
two witnesses died accidentally?

94
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,203
They were eliminated by Gregory Chui.

95
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,676
I wish you would
reconsider testifying.

96
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,487
Hello, Miss Yeung.

97
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:03,287
I heard you had
an electrical problem.

98
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:05,287
Perhaps you should take care.

99
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,438
I see. Thanks so much.

100
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,762
Bye now.

101
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:16,117
I could arrest you
right here on the street!

102
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,607
- On what charge?
- I haven‘t made up my mind.

103
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,326
- Then...
- Bye. Goodbye.

104
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,727
- Who won?
- The favourite.

105
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:32,276
- We won some money then. How much?
- I bet on your horse!

106
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,364
Why do you listen to me?

107
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,967
His name is John Chang.
He‘s been trained in Beijing

108
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,437
to be a member of an elite corps
of bodyguards called the Defenders.

109
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,527
They‘re the finest in the world.
I want nothing but the best for you.

110
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,447
I don‘t need a bodyguard.

111
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:51,007
Why can‘t you come be here with me?
You‘re all I need.

112
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:56,567
Come on, Michelle. If I could change
things, I‘d be there already.

113
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,967
Only it‘s impossible this time.

114
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,487
We‘ve been through this
so many times.

115
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:04,047
You‘ve made it very clear.
See you later.

116
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,919
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute!

117
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,998
That was so stupid of me. God.

118
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:15,477
What a place.
This guy Shong‘s got it made.

119
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:19,726
You know, he brought in one of those
big-time, Red Army bodyguards.

120
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:22,879
Supposed to show us
how to do ourjobs apparently.

121
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,597
So what? Maybe you and me,

122
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:28,281
we‘ll have to show him
how to have a good time.

123
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:32,565
Capitalists and communists.
Hand in hand.

124
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,838
What‘s this, a parade?

125
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,561
Sergeant, this man says not to worry.
He‘s taking over.

126
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,076
Hello.

127
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,716
- Charlie Lau.
- Lieutenant Chang, John.

128
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,407
- One of the Defenders.
- Listen, John.

129
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,558
That army uniform you‘re wearing
makes me kind ofjumpy.

130
00:09:56,647 --> 00:10:01,367
- I‘m in the army.
- And I‘m in the Hong Kong police.

131
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,247
- ID.
- What? Did I hear you right?

132
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,557
- Right.
- Let me see yours then.

133
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:16,847
- Let me show you mine also.
- No one asked. Put it away now.

134
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,838
I got one.

135
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,715
You‘re John Chang?
Pleased to meet you.

136
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,798
David Lai. Shall we?

137
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,367
Mr. Shong left $200,000.

138
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,598
You may use as much as you need
to protect her.

139
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,487
Thank you.

140
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,447
Please sign.

141
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,367
That‘s an awful lot of money.
He must be pretty good.

142
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,598
He looks out
for half the world‘s population,

143
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:47,317
while we only have a few hundred
crooks in Hong Kong to worry about.

144
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,247
- Mr. Shong say anything about me?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,807
- What‘d he say?
- Don‘t touch the money.

146
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,565
You tell him not to worry!

147
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:08,398
I didn‘t hear you ask permission
to go through my personal things.

148
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,487
I‘m sorry.

149
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,447
- It‘s my job.
- What job?

150
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:18,157
- I don‘t even know who you are.
- But I know who you are.

151
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:21,527
Michelle Yeung,
youngest daughter of a magistrate.

152
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,047
You had a private school education.

153
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:26,807
Harvard. Sorbonne.

154
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:30,117
- You enjoy going out shopping.
- Yes.

155
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:33,279
Tell me.
Am I supposed to be impressed?

156
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,765
My responsibility is to protect you.

157
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,727
Let me be honest.

158
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,639
You seem too young, too eager.

159
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:46,195
Must be yourfirst time.

160
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,207
- What the...
- He‘s a fake!

161
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,560
Freeze!

162
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:04,759
Hold it. Try something funny
and I‘ll put a slug in your brain.

163
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,606
I didn‘t mean that.
I was only fooling.

164
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,847
Yeah, boy.

165
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:21,047
You can‘t keep putting
metal cans into the microwave.

166
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,967
It exploded.

167
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,003
Michelle, sis, are you all right?

168
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:30,081
- You OK, Miss Yeung?
- What? Leave him alone!

169
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,243
- It was empty.
- What?

170
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:38,807
There‘s no way.
Like the man said, it was empty.

171
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,407
Billy, did you take
Charlie‘s bullets?

172
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:44,797
I only took them so I could see
how a gun‘s supposed to work.

173
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,927
- You shouldn‘t play with weapons.
- Sorry.

174
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,447
- Would you like some water?
- Thanks.

175
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:56,317
Don‘t drink it. No water or anything
else until I tell you it‘s safe.

176
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,876
- Only when you tell me?
- Yes.

177
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,367
That‘s... crazy.

178
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,287
I‘m calling James.

179
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,438
How many people have access
to this house other than family?

180
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:08,603
Let‘s count ‘em. One, two, three.

181
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,607
- Wait a minute.
- Take your time.

182
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,887
One, two, three, four...

183
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:15,799
..five, six,

184
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:21,247
seven, eight, nine.

185
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,447
That‘s your severance pay.
He won‘t be needing you.

186
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,367
It‘s OK. Thanks, Sergeant.

187
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:30,918
- You better thank the man in charge.
- Tell ya what. Call me any time.

188
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:34,244
I‘m sure you‘ll
be hearing from me. Go on!

189
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,407
Comrade Chang,

190
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,687
would you explain to me why we‘ve
just freed our entire security force?

191
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,527
The fewer people allowed around
Miss Yeung, the better I like it.

192
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:49,600
According to Chairman Mao,
the masses have boundless power.

193
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,759
You paid off the masses.

194
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,838
Now, I‘m not asking you for money.

195
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,516
Protecting Miss Yeung is my job.

196
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:02,037
Don‘t try to buy me out!
I have as much integrity as you do.

197
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,927
I was just kidding. Come on.

198
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,999
Please, don‘t get
too close to her, Sergeant.

199
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:10,007
That guy,
he‘s a real professional, right?

200
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,887
That‘s one hell of a professional,
that guy.

201
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,640
But I‘m one hell
of a professional too. Watch me!

202
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:20,087
I just shot you full of holes.
Why don‘t you fall down?

203
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,679
There are no bullets in your gun.

204
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,967
- Miss Yeung?
- My bedroom is off limits, soldier.

205
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,276
I need to make a security check
right now.

206
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,517
I‘m not opening the door.

207
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,687
- What?
- We‘ll change it.

208
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:01,076
Get out of this room
or I‘ll call the police.

209
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,247
- I‘ve already given them a call.
- You what?

210
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:07,603
Miss Yeung, you must always keep
your blinds closed.

211
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,759
Why? You can‘t do this to me.

212
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,322
That window needs bars on it.

213
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
And keep this light off. There.

214
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,767
Hold on. This is my room
and I want you out.

215
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:22,007
- Now!
- Just wait.

216
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,367
No, I won‘t wait.
I want some privacy.

217
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,487
This water valve should be replaced.

218
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,718
When are you gonna get out of here?
I wanna change.

219
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:35,645
You can‘t take those things.
They‘re mine.

220
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,597
Bring them back. Do you hear me?

221
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,879
Damn it!

222
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,887
Use this.

223
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:52,197
I don‘t want this junk.
I want you out of here.

224
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:58,647
Well? Let me have some privacy.

225
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,639
Your privacy
is not really my concern.

226
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:03,724
I‘m here for your safety.

227
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:09,527
In Beijing, do you put
cameras in women‘s bedrooms?

228
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,836
Only the ones I‘m asked to protect.

229
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,198
All done.

230
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,767
I‘m giving you an electronic amulet.

231
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,237
You must always wear it.
Press the stone to signal me.

232
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,607
There. Not bad.

233
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,447
- Impressive.
- That‘s what I keep telling you.

234
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,127
I‘m the one with all the talent,
the real bodyguard.

235
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:32,719
Let‘s see him try to do that.

236
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,765
That was just incredible.

237
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:46,007
Impossible.

238
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,124
You just throw the dart
and the board catches itself.

239
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:01,843
Mr. Chang,
I‘m Michelle‘s brother. What‘s up?

240
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,999
I‘ll give you 50 dollars
for a kung fu lesson.

241
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:10,007
I‘ve got something.
First edition Dragonball cards.

242
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,927
It‘s worth at least a hundred.

243
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,487
Mr. Shong gave it to me
for my birthday.

244
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,359
He‘s such an awesome guy.

245
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,797
Why are you sitting in my car?

246
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:36,960
I was told to by
your hotshot professional bodyguard.

247
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:40,756
Who the hell does he think he is?
I don‘t believe this.

248
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,919
This is a nice ride.

249
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:13,957
Ready? Let‘s have some fun,
Mr. Bodyguard.

250
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:19,160
Come in, Charlie. Do you read me?

251
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:22,596
- Take the old tunnel. It‘s safer.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,837
It‘s all right. I‘ll stay close.

253
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:26,883
- The old tunnel?
- Slick move.

254
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,239
Give me a little warning next time.
OK?

255
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,805
Trouble behind you. You read me?

256
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,207
He thinks it‘s Michelle.
He‘s after your car.

257
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:08,087
Take care of my back. I‘m on it.

258
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:12,046
This guy isn‘t that bright.
You don‘t look like my sister.

259
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,078
- You scared?
- Are you kidding me?

260
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,163
Come on. Watch me now.

261
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:55,917
- Hold it. You ready to die?
- It was an accident.

262
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:59,927
Yeah? How about if I accidentally
shoot you right here?

263
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,804
No.

264
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:10,967
Nice and easy.
Just some simple exercises.

265
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:14,198
One, two, three and down.

266
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:20,247
You left there in a pretty big hurry.

267
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,556
I thought you could handle it.

268
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,527
My only job here
is taking care of the girl.

269
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,727
Well, you take yourjob
too seriously.

270
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:32,037
You should learn
how to relax a little bit.

271
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:34,967
A cop can screw up
and still keep his job.

272
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,527
A bodyguard always has his mission.

273
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,678
If he fails,
he‘s not really a bodyguard, is he?

274
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,127
I‘ve sent for the headmaster.

275
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,958
Now, ready...

276
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:49,477
- It‘s only for two weeks?
- Yes, it‘s just a leave of absence.

277
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,447
He‘s made me a prisoner
in this place.

278
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:56,567
They gave me two weeks‘ leave
from the school because of him.

279
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,487
He sent my hairstylist home.

280
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,367
I wanted to work out,
so he bought all this stuff for me.

281
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,287
James, I can‘t stand him any more.

282
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:05,767
I want him to give me some peace.

283
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,527
Keep calm, Michelle. Put Chang on.

284
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,324
Bodyguard!

285
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,997
- Sir?
- John, can you ease up on Michelle?

286
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,007
Why would lease up?

287
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,887
If I‘m going to successfully
protect Miss Yeung,

288
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,767
I want to restrict
the scope of her activities.

289
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:32,207
It‘s not much longer. I just want
to be absolutely sure she‘s safe.

290
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:36,407
But if you‘re not happy with
what I‘m doing, I‘ll just walk away.

291
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:39,797
- Forget the contract.
- No. I‘m happy, John.

292
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:43,357
I want you to stay. Michelle
is impossible sometimes, isn‘t she?

293
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:46,487
It isn‘t easy being protected.

294
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:50,327
- It often is very stressful.
- I‘m sure she‘ll be all right.

295
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,683
- Let me have Michelle.
- He wants to talk to you.

296
00:22:58,487 --> 00:23:00,407
So, is he leaving?

297
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:03,001
No, actually, I, well, I warned him.

298
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,203
Now, Michelle, how‘s this sound?

299
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:10,967
If John doesn‘t ease up by tomorrow,
you tell me. I‘ll get someone else.

300
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:15,407
Yes, all right. Wait.
What time will I see you tomorrow?

301
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,167
- Tomorrow?
- We talked about it.

302
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:22,967
Tomorrow I‘m going to be shopping
for your present. Something nice.

303
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,807
What?
You spend all of your time away.

304
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:30,163
I have a house full of presents.
I want you here with me.

305
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,398
But you have a birthday coming up.
So you think about it.

306
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:37,725
You listen. Do you think
you can just buy me, James?

307
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:56,756
It‘s OK.

308
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,599
Too much.

309
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,887
- Come on, five!
- Go, number six!

310
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,798
No, no, no, no, no!

311
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,687
- Yeah!
- You rotten nag.

312
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,687
Let‘s see what we got.
What? Seven to one. Oh, my God!

313
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:48,077
If you‘d listened to me,
you would have made some money.

314
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:52,727
You bet my money
on your horse, right?

315
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:55,607
I can‘t believe it!
You fat fool, I want my money!

316
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,565
How am I supposed to get your money?
I bet it with mine.

317
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:01,567
You bet all my money on your horses?

318
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,247
- Pay it back!
- You know I can‘t do that.

319
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:07,717
All my money goes to my son‘s
education. Every last cent of it.

320
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,798
Why did you do this to me?

321
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,327
Let me look at my bank account.

322
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:19,639
I never should‘ve bet so much money
on a horse like that.

323
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,877
Yeah, what?

324
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,967
I know it‘s late.

325
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:28,836
You‘ll have your money before
the semester‘s over. More than half.

326
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,087
Yes, I have it,
but it‘s in my wife‘s name.

327
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,920
And it‘s being invested.
And wisely, I might add.

328
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,044
Who is it? Who‘s there?

329
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:10,642
What do you want? What? Get out!

330
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,525
How dare you!

331
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,920
Sorry.
Sorry, I touched it by mistake.

332
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:25,079
But Michelle! OK, I‘ll get out.

333
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,562
She‘s got a bodyguard from Beijing.
We can‘t get near her.

334
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,647
Too many excuses.
I want to hear some options.

335
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,407
We‘re working on it.

336
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:39,797
Thursday is my court date.
I want you to close this up.

337
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,957
Billy, you ready?

338
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,567
I got you something. Look at that.

339
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,567
- It‘s a model of my gun. Like mine.
- Gosh.

340
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,558
Who needs a ball?

341
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:48,365
- Where are you going, Miss Yeung?
- I have to go somewhere.

342
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:50,677
- I‘ll come with you.
- All right.

343
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,917
Just what do you think you‘re doing?

344
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,475
Do you really think that
Ken will protect you?

345
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,876
It‘s my mother. Since my father died,
she‘s all alone.

346
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:10,922
She just wants to see me. It‘s not
a crime for me to see my mom. Is it?

347
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:13,367
You‘re too dressed up for that.

348
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:17,687
Your friends invited you to
a birthday party, 1 Maryville Road.

349
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:21,567
You monitor my calls. You‘re always
listening to every word I say.

350
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,487
I have to have my privacy.

351
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:27,036
Nobody, not even you, can take away
my freedom. Not even my boyfriend.

352
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,807
You‘re lucky to have him around.
You know why?

353
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:33,047
Otherwise you‘d be dead.
And you should know it.

354
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:35,959
You bastard! Let me tell you
something. That hurt.

355
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,316
All of you are just leeches.

356
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:43,366
If it wasn‘t for Mr. Shong‘s fortune,
would you be protected?

357
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:47,047
Maybe... Not by you.

358
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:48,887
That‘s right.

359
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:52,562
Anybody as pretty as you
is bound to have a rich boyfriend.

360
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,797
Shut up! You shut up!

361
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:56,767
If I‘m pretty, is that my fault?

362
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,447
I can‘t help it
if this is what I was born with.

363
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,847
I love being attractive. I do.

364
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:05,123
And I love having
all of these things. Is that wrong?

365
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:08,836
I‘m tired of everyone
passing judgement on me.

366
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,522
Sorry, Miss Yeung.

367
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:18,763
Here. Take this.

368
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,241
You made me cry.
It won‘t happen again.

369
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,487
Miss Yeung,
after you testify in court,

370
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:48,407
my work here with you will be done.

371
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:51,287
Maybe I‘ll see you again
another time.

372
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:55,607
- I seriously doubt it.
- All right, let‘s get things moving.

373
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,527
All right.

374
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,324
Come on, Billy. Let‘s go.

375
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,247
Why is it
you‘re always creeping around?

376
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,887
The case will have to be delayed.

377
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:10,517
Gregory Chui has gastroenteritis.
He checked into a hospital.

378
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,199
My God.

379
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,607
- James!
- It‘s been delayed.

380
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,167
- Indefinitely.
- I‘m dying!

381
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,047
- Maybe a month.
- It‘s his fault.

382
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:29,517
- For all of this.
- That means I‘ll miss the mission.

383
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:34,007
I‘m hoping he‘s going to let us
get out of here!

384
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:37,927
I really need to go shopping,
without John Chang.

385
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:40,725
OK. If that‘s what you want.

386
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:51,640
I feel like I‘ve been locked up
forever. Ijust wanna shop all day.

387
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,725
Me too. And play video games.

388
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,003
Wait. I bought extra.

389
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:18,085
So how about eating some?
Here, Michelle.

390
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,116
Safe.

391
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:27,287
Come on, Billy. Over here.

392
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:29,437
So you‘re the bodyguard now.

393
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,567
- Do you think this one is pretty?
- You shouldn‘t be here.

394
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,487
This place is too crowded.

395
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:37,367
- I thought you were protecting me.
- We are.

396
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,642
It‘s just that this place
is kind of crowded.

397
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:42,884
Don‘t worry,
we‘ve got it under control.

398
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,958
What‘s that?

399
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,367
It‘s possible it came from upstairs.

400
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,247
- Billy, don‘t you think I know that?
- Just checking.

401
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,637
Michelle,
I‘m going to the video arcade, OK?

402
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:57,647
All right. Win some prizes.

403
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:01,526
- You take her, I‘ll take him.
- For sure. I‘ll take her.

404
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,800
- Excuse me.
- Full house.

405
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:32,567
Don‘t move, Billy.

406
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,683
- What‘s going on?
- Just this.

407
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:37,407
Billy thinks he‘s so tough.

408
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:39,557
I can show you a real police pistol.

409
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,207
- Stop lying.
- No way.

410
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:43,437
Miss Yeung, now it‘s empty.

411
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,958
Sorry. I never know
what to say on an elevator.

412
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:04,243
Race one, number seven.
Race seven, number one.

413
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,127
No, not race one, number one.

414
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:10,324
Race seven, number one,
and race one, number seven.

415
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:14,367
God, what could be simpler? Do I
have to repeat it all again? Billy!

416
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,040
You dropped your gun.
It was on the ground, see?

417
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:21,167
Put this right back where it belongs.
Thanks a lot.

418
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,317
The first race started?

419
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,636
Let‘s go back then.

420
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:41,687
See this? It‘s a .38 police revolver.

421
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,607
Who can we bump off?

422
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,758
Tell me about it.
It‘s not a real police pistol.

423
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,887
- Let‘s try it out.
- Don‘t move!

424
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:52,247
Wait! Don‘t do that!
It‘s a loaded gun!

425
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,479
- Come on! You know it‘s a toy.
- No, Paul. Paul!

426
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:00,047
Shoot me. Come on.

427
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,887
Paulie, don‘t do it!

428
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:06,167
- I‘m not scared.
- It‘s my gun. Now, hold still.

429
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,237
Paulie, please stop.

430
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,487
- What are you doing with that?
- What‘d you say?

431
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,603
- Give me that!
- It‘s a real gun!

432
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,647
I can try and special-order it.

433
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:21,567
But if we do that,
is the return policy still in effect?

434
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,876
I would need a deposit.

435
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:32,287
- They don‘t have my size.
- Try this one.

436
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:36,439
- Please, try this one on.
- I don‘t like the colour.

437
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,398
Go! Get out!

438
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,244
Quiet.

439
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:29,079
Ken, take care
of getting rid of the body.

440
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:33,436
Let‘s go.

441
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,197
I knew this wasn‘t a good idea.
Come on. Let‘s go.

442
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,967
No. Paulie, don‘t do it.
It‘s loaded. Listen.

443
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,923
Someone‘s gonna get it now.

444
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:38,561
Charlie, your gun!

445
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:11,436
We‘re the police.
I want everybody on the floor.

446
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,438
Wait!

447
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,603
- Are you all right?
- No, no, no, no.

448
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:28,327
- You.
- All right, show me your hands.

449
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,124
Here‘s your pistol.

450
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,599
That‘s the fake one.

451
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:50,200
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Get away. Go.

452
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,207
- Don‘t die. It‘s my fault.
- Stop it.

453
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:58,756
I‘m not dying, Billy.
I‘ve got my bulletproof vest on.

454
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,805
Then you won‘t die?

455
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:04,843
That‘s right.

456
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:06,918
I‘m sorry.

457
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,606
Thanks.

458
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,045
You‘re welcome.

459
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:36,038
Why are you crying?

460
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:40,477
I‘m sorry.

461
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:44,567
What for? For taking the gun?
Or for something else?

462
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,321
I once knew a boy named Ye Tung
who studied at the Shaolin temple.

463
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:51,767
He was given a new master
when he was nine.

464
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:56,716
The master would forgive whatever
he did, no matter how severe,

465
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:59,197
as long as Ye Tung
would say, “I‘m sorry.“

466
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:02,807
Instead of any kind of punishment,

467
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:07,358
the master would just ask Ye Tung
to say he was sorry.

468
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:10,997
It didn‘t matter what he‘d done.

469
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:14,527
Ye Tung got very good
at saying he was sorry.

470
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:17,287
One day he was playing
with some lighted candles

471
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:20,207
in the temple
of the Shining Waters.

472
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:23,677
He dropped a candle,
and the next thing he knew,

473
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:26,807
there was a fire
burning out of control.

474
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:31,167
He ran just as far
as he possibly could...

475
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,476
until something made him stop.

476
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:40,247
He returned,
hoping he would have a chance...

477
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,607
to apologise to the teacher.

478
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:48,522
He was sure that saying those words
would redeem him.

479
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:54,167
There was no opportunity
to say those words.

480
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,955
The fire made sure of that.

481
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:02,079
The master died
in the flaming temple.

482
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:05,717
The boy stopped saying “I‘m sorry.“

483
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:12,127
Hold on, John Chang.

484
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:14,925
Or should I say Ye Tung?

485
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,277
Just as the boy learned
how to stop saying those words,

486
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,447
some of us need to learn
how to say...

487
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:25,915
I‘m sorry.

488
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:39,244
Let go! That hurts!

489
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,637
- What are you trying to do?
- Where‘s the body?

490
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:48,478
He‘s right in there, in that drawer.

491
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:02,996
You‘re not supposed to remove
the bodies. It‘s against the law.

492
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:08,087
No. No. No, no. No, no, wait.

493
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,442
Take this to buy your silence.

494
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,959
Brother!

495
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:34,647
- Brother, are you all right?
- I think so.

496
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:38,407
Brother, you took my bullet,
the one that was meant for me.

497
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,557
As long as I live on this earth...

498
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:45,727
nothing will ever harm you.

499
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,718
I will protect you.

500
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:03,560
Mr. Chui isn‘t paying you
to burn ceremonial fires.

501
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,647
He‘s paying you to kill that woman,

502
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:08,567
and you haven‘t succeeded.

503
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:11,877
- This is your last...
- My brother‘s dead.

504
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:14,435
- No, please.
- Don‘t talk to me about fires

505
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:15,887
or Chui‘s money.

506
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,846
Now, you listen.
Before this is over, she‘ll be dead.

507
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:24,837
And you - you could be dead also,

508
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:26,918
as well as your boss.

509
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,798
The wounds are very strange.

510
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:34,726
The victims all died
from a loss of blood.

511
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:39,287
I don‘t know what kind
of weapon caused this.

512
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,207
It‘s a Red Army bayonet.

513
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,167
The three edges
cause rapid blood loss.

514
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,476
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Don‘t mention it.

515
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:50,327
They killed these guys
to get to the corpse, but why?

516
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,367
I really don‘t know.

517
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:56,155
Anyway, thanks for takin‘ him out.
He would have killed me.

518
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,967
Is your arm all right?

519
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:02,487
Yeah, it hurts a little bit,
but not as much as dying would have.

520
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:04,247
Yeah. Come on.

521
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:07,478
I‘m gonna have to ask you again.
Do you know this man?

522
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:10,487
I‘m warning you, Mr. Chui!
You better answer.

523
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:12,407
Don‘t threaten my client.

524
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:15,767
He has the right not to answer,
and you know it!

525
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:18,600
All right then. You‘ll be sorry.

526
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,998
I think he‘s retired Red Army.

527
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,287
The Assassin Squad, right.

528
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,437
Let me know when you
find anything out.

529
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:55,207
His name is Kar Kwok.

530
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:57,567
His brother‘s body was
stolen from the morgue.

531
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,637
He‘s the one that
almost killed Charlie.

532
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:02,807
Here‘s something to keep us going.

533
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:04,727
Do you think you‘ll catch him?

534
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:06,797
- Yeah.
- We‘ll catch him, no matter what!

535
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:11,918
I‘ll be around back.

536
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:16,247
- Clear!
- Look in here!

537
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,687
Clear!

538
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:20,287
What‘s that over there?

539
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:23,996
- Clear!
- Clear up here.

540
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,163
- Thanks.
- You‘re soaking wet.

541
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:47,556
You really shouldn‘t be up here.

542
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:50,807
I just want to thank you
for protecting me.

543
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:54,327
- I was assigned to you.
- I‘ve given you a lot of trouble.

544
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:57,399
But do you think we could start over?

545
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,476
I mean, what else do bodyguards do?

546
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:06,203
Tell me about your girlfriend.

547
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:08,567
There‘s nobody to tell you about.

548
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,717
That can‘t be.

549
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:15,117
Tell me about your family.

550
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,607
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

551
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:21,916
Did you get straight A‘s?

552
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,525
Don‘t ask me.

553
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:28,286
That‘s privileged information,
top secret.

554
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:47,117
- Pretty good hands.
- For some things.

555
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,358
Keep holding on to me.

556
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:55,678
You wouldn‘t want me to fall,
would you?

557
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,076
I might get wet.

558
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:02,637
I like walking in the rain,
don‘t you?

559
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,007
- It‘s him!
- What‘s wrong?

560
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:11,884
What is he doing?

561
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:15,963
Follow me!

562
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,800
“I am everywhere.
It‘s just a matter of time.“

563
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:20,080
Bulletproof windows
throughout the house.

564
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:24,525
I‘m tellin‘ ya. This has got me
jumpy. Is it that important?

565
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:30,079
Yeah, it is important. The assassin
knows this house, and he knows us.

566
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:32,164
I told Ken to stay alert.

567
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:36,527
You know,
tomorrow is Michelle‘s birthday.

568
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:40,042
- How about if we surprise her?
- We should have a party.

569
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:43,805
Thank you. It‘s safe, right?

570
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,078
I got you something.

571
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,478
- Here. Look. What do you think?
- I like it.

572
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:19,723
- Hello?
- It‘s me. I found a new bodyguard.

573
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:22,279
Wait a second.

574
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:29,122
It‘s James. He asked me
if I want a new bodyguard.

575
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:35,567
Look, let‘s just keep this one. Bye.

576
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,967
Wait.

577
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:40,037
- Good night.
- Good night.

578
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:16,367
Happy birthday!

579
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,767
Thank you!

580
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,598
Everything is just perfect.

581
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:25,636
You know what would make it perfect.
She loves flowers on her birthday.

582
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:29,327
But once you cut a flower, what
happens to it? It loses its life.

583
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,247
It‘s her birthday.

584
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:33,397
- Make a wish.
- All right.

585
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,242
- Happy birthday! Go ahead.
- Thanks.

586
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:43,287
- I love roses.
- I hope you like the colour.

587
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:47,087
They‘re a bunch of lifeless bodies
now, at least John says so.

588
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:49,647
I‘ll put them in water, OK?

589
00:52:59,607 --> 00:53:01,967
Freeze!

590
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:04,487
- What?
- They‘re only flowers.

591
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:07,081
Right. From Mr. Shong, right?

592
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:10,647
All right. Sorry. Get outta here.

593
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:12,527
OK, I‘m clean already. Geez!

594
00:53:12,527 --> 00:53:15,997
- Flowers from Mr. Shong.
- Here. Give them to me.

595
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:22,239
Makes your flowers look kinda puny.

596
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,318
Who asked you?

597
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:31,807
- Hello?
- Happy birthday.

598
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:35,197
- Thanks forthe flowers.
- Dinner at the Fond du Lac?

599
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:37,487
- The Fond du Lac? When?
- Tonight.

600
00:53:37,487 --> 00:53:39,447
- Won‘t that be difficult?
- Not for me.

601
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:42,287
I came in from Beijing
to take you out. I‘m in the driveway.

602
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,207
You‘re where? Out front?

603
00:53:44,207 --> 00:53:47,199
- You better not be teasing me.
- Look out the window.

604
00:53:54,287 --> 00:53:58,127
- Hi, James!
- Why don‘t you wear something nice?

605
00:53:58,127 --> 00:54:01,119
All right, I will.
I‘ll meet you in 20 minutes. Bye.

606
00:54:29,327 --> 00:54:32,207
Mr. Shong,
when did you make the reservation?

607
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:33,767
Yesterday.

608
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,997
Does anyone know you‘re having
dinner here with Miss Yeung?

609
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:39,318
- You don‘t trust me?
- That‘s not what he meant.

610
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:42,877
John‘s just making sure
I‘m not in any danger.

611
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:47,567
And you seem to understand each other
pretty well. Cheers.

612
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:50,127
Wait. Please, drink some first.

613
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,846
Sure.

614
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,118
Thank you.

615
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,601
It‘s safe. Excuse me.

616
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:09,036
- You take no chances.
- No. He‘s very, very good.

617
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:12,364
- He doesn‘t make mistakes?
- No. Never.

618
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:15,407
If he did, then
he couldn‘t be a bodyguard any more.

619
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,204
So now you‘re an expert.

620
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,807
- Mademoiselle.
- Thank you.

621
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:24,527
The chef does
a wonderful Chilean sea bass.

622
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:26,882
What do you think?

623
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:30,078
I don‘t know.

624
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:33,522
How about the salmon?

625
00:55:51,407 --> 00:55:53,967
I‘ll... I‘ll take another look.

626
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:05,325
It‘s too much for me. You decide.

627
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:48,567
- So how was your dinner?
- It was nice. Thank you very much.

628
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:52,276
- Champagne?
- No. I need to use the ladies‘ room.

629
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:17,285
- Miss Yeung?
- Thank you.

630
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:30,287
Let me help you...

631
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:32,198
John, she just fell.

632
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:35,607
Help us.

633
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:38,447
- Your boyfriend‘s a real gentleman.
- Yes, he is.

634
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:39,800
Thank you.

635
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:43,847
I‘m finished. Can we go home?

636
00:57:43,847 --> 00:57:46,645
Please, Billy.
Don‘t be rude to James.

637
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,164
Maybe it‘s not Billy‘s
kind of restaurant.

638
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:56,847
Michelle,
I have to go back to Beijing tonight.

639
00:57:56,847 --> 00:57:59,077
- I can‘t drive you.
- That‘s fine.

640
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,317
I‘m coming home on Friday.

641
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:11,206
John, you‘re just about to come
to the end of your mission.

642
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,836
- Thank you for guarding Michelle.
- My pleasure.

643
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:03,284
Good night!

644
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:19,247
Where are you going?

645
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:21,966
Making the rounds.
What are you doing?

646
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,278
Surprise.

647
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:28,087
Really? For me?

648
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:30,317
Let me help you.

649
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:34,641
It‘s automatic,
totally reliable, like you.

650
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,487
It‘s perfect.

651
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,205
Perfect.

652
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:45,156
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

653
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:53,764
I won‘t see you once this is over.

654
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,518
You probably won‘t.

655
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:01,047
You never know. Good night.

656
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,685
Good night.

657
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,567
Michelle, what happened?

658
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:16,567
I touched the button by mistake.

659
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,558
It‘s all right.

660
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,598
I have something to tell you.

661
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:28,047
I know it‘s wrong,

662
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:29,958
but I love you.

663
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,726
Does that mean you
don‘t want to kiss me?

664
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:42,360
Me?

665
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:01,158
I don‘t know what I want.

666
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:07,958
I do.

667
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,327
What‘s the matter?

668
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:34,127
- Nothing. Why?
- Sure, you‘ve been eating all night.

669
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:37,487
When something‘s bothering me,
I smoke like a fiend.

670
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,682
What‘s bothering you?

671
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:43,247
It‘s just money problems.

672
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:46,125
My son has a chance
to study medicine in the US,

673
01:04:46,207 --> 01:04:49,007
but I can‘t afford to send him there.

674
01:04:49,007 --> 01:04:53,807
I even gambled some of Ken‘s money
away trying to raise the cash.

675
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:57,647
Can you make any dough workin‘
as a bodyguard? Looks like it.

676
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:59,922
I thought you were happy being a cop.

677
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:03,441
With more money, I would be.

678
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,916
So why‘d you join?

679
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:08,847
I wanted to be a big hero,
so Ijoined the force.

680
01:05:08,847 --> 01:05:13,007
During my first year, I interrupted
a bank robbery in progress,

681
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:15,407
rescued four hostages
and shot the robber.

682
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:17,927
- So you did become a hero, right?
- Yeah!

683
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:21,158
Damn right.
They even gave me a medal.

684
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:23,238
It was when I first met my wife.

685
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:29,917
Look at this.
That was when we were still together,

686
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:32,077
before I screwed things up.

687
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:35,603
Oh, boy!

688
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:40,477
I spent so much time
trying to live up to my reputation

689
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:43,727
that I didn‘t have time for her.

690
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:45,767
And she found someone who did?

691
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:49,007
Yeah, she sure did.

692
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:52,795
Some guy with a corner office started
buyin‘ her things, you know?

693
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:55,879
How am I supposed to compete
with that on my salary?

694
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:59,119
I thought maybe she was just
looking for a little attention.

695
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:02,040
So I said to her, “It‘s him or me.“

696
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:05,396
She chose the corner office.

697
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:08,478
Why couldn‘t you talk to her?

698
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:13,360
That‘s my point:
that women like to be talked to.

699
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:17,525
I was too busy being the quiet hero.

700
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:22,603
Which reminds me,
you‘re up the same tree.

701
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:31,237
You know opportunity - it disappears
before you can ever stop it.

702
01:06:31,327 --> 01:06:36,355
How many chances do you suppose men
like us are gonna get to be happy?

703
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:41,317
All the kung fu in the world isn‘t
gonna help when it comes to women.

704
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:46,357
All I can say is...

705
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:49,007
you gotta take your shot.

706
01:06:49,007 --> 01:06:51,043
Otherwise, you‘ll regret it.

707
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:54,007
What about my responsibilities?

708
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:56,885
Sure, it would be nice.

709
01:06:58,127 --> 01:07:00,038
I bet it would be
much better than that.

710
01:07:00,127 --> 01:07:02,277
But don‘t try and you‘ll never know.

711
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:04,681
It‘s her.

712
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,997
- She‘s calling you.
- No, the pager gets stuck.

713
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:59,687
You‘re the one who‘s stuck,
and you know it.

714
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:01,325
Come on!

715
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:04,358
Come on! Hang on, Ken!

716
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:21,679
That‘s just how you looked
when you shot my brother.

717
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:24,361
Only this time, you‘re the one
that‘s gonna die, so get ready!

718
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:17,807
Charlie, take this money.

719
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:21,356
Go on. Bet it all.
Number three in the sixth.

720
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:25,007
Forget it, Ken.
You know I can‘t do that.

721
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:28,007
Come on. It‘s for your son.

722
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:30,767
If I could, I‘d bet it myself.

723
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:32,837
That‘s very good of you, Ken.

724
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:43,118
I stole a picture
of you the other day.

725
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,841
Could you sign it for me?

726
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:56,560
How about...
How about signing it with a kiss?

727
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:11,476
No! Ken!

728
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:14,956
Come on out, you cowards!

729
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:43,680
My foot.

730
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:47,203
Hurry. Hurry.

731
01:12:12,047 --> 01:12:13,446
That was close.

732
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:23,805
Watch it!

733
01:13:26,927 --> 01:13:31,478
Wait! The room is filling with gas,
the windows are bulletproof

734
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:33,327
and the doors are locked.

735
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,795
One shot and we‘re all dead.

736
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:42,359
That doesn‘t scare me.
Ready, bodyguard?

737
01:13:42,447 --> 01:13:45,996
For me, the battle is always on.

738
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:48,646
The battle?

739
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:57,484
This is your execution.

740
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:04,965
And yours as well.

741
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:08,207
You killed my best friend.

742
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:11,199
Your best friend?
What are you talking about?

743
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:14,199
He killed my brother!

744
01:14:15,487 --> 01:14:20,436
Forthat,
you‘re going to suffer, long...

745
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:22,837
and then you‘re going to die.

746
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,524
- No!
- Say goodbye..

747
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:32,997
Come on, pal! Let‘s do it!

748
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:58,396
Only one of us will stand
when this is over.

749
01:14:58,607 --> 01:15:02,447
I am trained to attack.
lam an assassin.

750
01:15:02,447 --> 01:15:04,802
But you‘re just a defender.

751
01:20:01,007 --> 01:20:02,963
Honey, I‘m home!

752
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,562
Wait!

753
01:20:17,487 --> 01:20:21,327
Please let her go! Whatever
Chui‘s paying you, I‘ll triple it!

754
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:23,716
You get away from her. Over there.

755
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,239
Get going!

756
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:32,198
He shot my brother seven times.
Oh, yeah!

757
01:20:35,087 --> 01:20:39,000
Now it‘s gonna be my turn to shoot...
seven times!

758
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:45,287
I have millions.
How much will it take?

759
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:49,127
I‘m afraid your offer‘s no good.
It‘s meaningless...

760
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:53,120
unless you want to pay someone
to take the first bullet for her.

761
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:01,487
Come on. Take the bullet.
Save the girl yourself.

762
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:04,367
- Then she‘ll love you forever.
- Wait.

763
01:21:04,367 --> 01:21:06,756
What do you think about that?

764
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:23,199
There you go. I knew you‘d do it.

765
01:21:38,447 --> 01:21:40,199
It‘s almost over.

766
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:58,127
Aren‘t you prepared to die?

767
01:21:58,127 --> 01:22:00,083
Oh, no, John. No!

768
01:22:02,447 --> 01:22:04,642
Please. My God.

769
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:11,757
So... one more bullet then.

770
01:22:25,087 --> 01:22:27,127
John! No!

771
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:28,719
Please!

772
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:46,641
- No! Uncle Charlie! Come on!
- I‘m OK.

773
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:53,445
Please!

774
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:23,567
Faster.

775
01:23:23,567 --> 01:23:27,887
Mr. Shong, John Chang
was trained to take a bullet.

776
01:23:27,887 --> 01:23:30,767
You ducked because
that‘s the natural instinct.

777
01:23:30,767 --> 01:23:33,361
There‘s no reason
for you to feel guilty.

778
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:42,040
This is from comrade Chang
to Sergeant Lau.

779
01:23:48,527 --> 01:23:50,404
Step on it, OK?

780
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:53,487
We‘re going to be late.

781
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,877
You could get authorisation
for Chang to stay in Hong Kong.

782
01:23:57,167 --> 01:24:00,523
With all your money,
you could pull the strings.

783
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:12,047
Charlie,
this is just between you and me.

784
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,518
It‘s for your son‘s education.
No more gambling, OK?

785
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:21,166
No more gambling. Yeah.

786
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:27,519
- John, wait! Wait!
- Stop right there.

787
01:24:31,727 --> 01:24:34,525
- I have a permit.
- Talk to the bodyguard.

788
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:45,647
I have written authorisation
for Mr. Chang to remain in Hong Kong.

789
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:48,207
Mr. Chang wishes to return to Beijing.

790
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:58,960
He left you this.
He‘s not coming back.
