1
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,585
My name's Marlowe.
The general wanted to see me.

2
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:15,750
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

3
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,417
- I'll tell the general that you're here.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:35,496
Good morning.

5
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:42,344
You're not very tall, are you?

6
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,220
Well, I tried to be.

7
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:49,450
Not bad-looking...

8
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,656
...though you probably know it.

9
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:53,027
Thank you.

10
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,408
What's your name?

11
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,327
Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

12
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,942
That's a funny kind of name.

13
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,256
You think so?

14
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,910
What are you? A prizefighter?

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,569
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's that?

16
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,691
A private detective.

17
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,501
You're making fun of me.

18
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,456
You're cute.

19
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,923
The general will see you now, sir.

20
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,081
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood.

21
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,248
You ought to wean her.
She's old enough.

22
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:50,656
- This is Mr. Marlowe, general.
- How do you do, sir?

23
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,584
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,272
Brandy, Norris.

25
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,050
- How do you like your brandy, sir?
- In a glass.

26
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,581
I used to like mine with champagne.

27
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,663
Champagne cold as Valley Forge...

28
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:05,195
...with about three ponies
of brandy under it.

29
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:06,950
Come, come, man!
Pour a decent one.

30
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,729
I like to see people drink.

31
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,445
That'll do, Norris.

32
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,006
You may take off your coat, sir.

33
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,589
Thank you.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,426
Too hot in here for any man
who has any blood in his veins.

35
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,975
You may smoke too.

36
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,095
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

37
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:30,820
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

38
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:34,723
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

39
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,515
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

40
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:40,190
Little I can eat, and
my sleep is so near waking...

41
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:41,801
...it's hardly worth the name.

42
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:46,020
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

43
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,790
The orchids are an excuse
for the heat.

44
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:52,236
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

45
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:53,358
Nasty things.

46
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,908
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,006
Their perfume has the rotten
sweetness of corruption.

48
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,291
Tell me about yourself.

49
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,590
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

50
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,178
I can still speak English,
when my business demands it.

51
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,289
I worked for the
district attorney's office.

52
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,974
Bernie Ohls, the chief inspector,
said you wanted to see me.

53
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,832
You didn't like working
for the district attorney?

54
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:23,049
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

55
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,856
I always did, myself.

56
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,350
What do you know about my family?

57
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,169
Well, you're a widower,
a millionaire.

58
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,155
You have two daughters.
One unmarried...

59
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:37,252
...and one married to a man
named Rutledge, but it didn't take.

60
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,842
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

61
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,978
Both pretty and both pretty wild.

62
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,360
- Why'd you want to see me?
- I'm being blackmailed again.

63
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,780
Again?

64
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,973
About a year ago, I paid a man
named Joe Brody $ 5000...

65
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,179
...to let my younger daughter alone.

66
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,520
What does that mean?

67
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,243
It means, "Hm!"

68
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,398
It didn't go through the DA
or I'd have heard.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,846
Who handled it for you?

70
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:04,873
Shawn Regan.

71
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,737
There must be some reason why
he isn't handling it this time.

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,503
Shawn has left me.

73
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,994
- I thought I hadn't seen him lately.
- A month ago, without a word.

74
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,501
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

75
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,762
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more.

76
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,581
And that at least
he'd have said good bye.

77
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:27,612
That's what hurt.

78
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,412
You knew him too?

79
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico...

80
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,648
...and I was on the other side.

81
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,441
We used to swap shots
between drinks...

82
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,427
...or drinks between shots.

83
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,726
My respects to you, sir.

84
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,274
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

85
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,794
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

86
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:50,791
But you knew that.

87
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,738
No, I didn't.

88
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,159
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

89
00:05:57,352 --> 00:06:01,284
No one was more pleased than I
when you took him on as your...

90
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:02,434
...whatever he was.

91
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,448
My friend.

92
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,625
My son, almost.

93
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,538
Many an hour he sat with me,
sweating like a pig...

94
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,786
...drinking brandy and telling
stories of the Irish Revolution.

95
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,800
Well, enough of that.

96
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,143
Here.

97
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,441
Read the other side.

98
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,544
These her signatures?

99
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,364
- Who's Arthur Geiger?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

100
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,599
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

101
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,141
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

102
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,142
I met her in the hall
and she did that to me.

103
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:02,249
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

104
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:03,649
Well?

105
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,617
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

106
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,017
They alike?

107
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,796
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

108
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,453
Vivian is spoiled, exacting...

109
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,274
...smart and ruthless.

110
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:22,533
Carmen is still a little child who
likes to pull the wings off flies.

111
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,110
I assume they have
all the usual vices...

112
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,901
...besides those they've
invented for themselves.

113
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,941
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe...

114
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,530
...it's because my hold
on life is too slight...

115
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,669
...to include any
Victorian hypocrisy.

116
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,719
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have...

117
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:43,325
...and who indulges, for the first
time, in parenthood at my age...

118
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,908
...deserves all he gets.

119
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:47,429
Well?

120
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:54,881
Pay him.

121
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,137
Why?

122
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,631
She signed these notes, didn't she?

123
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:05,823
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $ 5000 to?

124
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,778
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

125
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,933
I think he called himself a gambler.

126
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,148
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

127
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,520
They may be.

128
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,178
Think they are?

129
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,635
You want me to take this Geiger
off your back. Is that right?

130
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:24,352
Want to know anything?

131
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,050
I just want to get rid of him.

132
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,968
Might cost you a little.

133
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,075
Thanks for the drink.

134
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,732
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

135
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,870
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

136
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,809
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave.

137
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,274
About the money, the general
has instructed me...

138
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,806
...to give you a check
for whatever you require.

139
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,465
Instructed you how?

140
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,630
I see, sir. I forget
that you're a detective.

141
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,009
By the way he rang his bell, sir.

142
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,176
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

143
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,583
Good for you.
I don't need any money now...

144
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,393
...but when I do,
I get $ 25 a day and expenses.

145
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,692
- How did she know I was here?
- She saw you through the window.

146
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:17,406
I was obliged to tell her
who you were.

147
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:18,854
I don't know as I like that.

148
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,473
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

149
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,812
Just having fun trying
to guess what they are.

150
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,472
This way, sir.

151
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,727
- Go right in. Say you're expected.
- Thanks.

152
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,383
You wanted to see me?

153
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,489
So you're a private detective?

154
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,724
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

155
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,985
Or else they were greasy men
snooping around hotel corridors.

156
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,528
You're a mess, aren't you?

157
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,885
I'm not very tall either.

158
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:58,376
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

159
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,061
I doubt if even that would help.

160
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:04,322
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

161
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,732
It shouldn't be too tough.

162
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:08,005
I'd have thought
it took a little effort.

163
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,405
Not too much.

164
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,716
What will your first step be?

165
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,951
- The usual one.
- There's a usual one?

166
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,061
Sure there is.
It comes with diagrams...

167
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:19,648
...on page 47 of How to be a
Detective in Ten Easy Lessons...

168
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,920
...and your father
offered me a drink.

169
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:24,001
You must've read one
on being a comedian.

170
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:27,012
- Hear what I said about the drink?
- I'm serious. My father's...

171
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,545
- I said your father...
- Help yourself!

172
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,011
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well.

173
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,792
I want this case handled with
the least worry to him.

174
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:40,036
That's the way
I was going to handle it.

175
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,847
I see. No professional secrets?

176
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,215
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

177
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:46,759
Then what...

178
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:51,977
How'd you like Dad?

179
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,223
I liked him.

180
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,004
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

181
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,565
I suppose you know who he is.

182
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,250
You don't have to play poker with me.

183
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,427
- Doesn't Dad want to find him?
- Do you?

184
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,535
Of course. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

185
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,798
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much.

186
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,426
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

187
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:14,111
I don't see what there is
to be cagey about.

188
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,492
I don't like your manners!

189
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,274
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

190
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,958
I don't mind if you don't
like my manners. I don't either.

191
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:22,570
I grieve over them evenings.

192
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:25,092
I don't mind your drinking
your lunch out of a bottle.

193
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,518
But don't waste your time
cross-examining me.

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,887
People don't talk to me like that!

195
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,389
Do you always think
you can handle people...

196
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,308
...like trained seals?

197
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,188
I usually get away with it too.

198
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,297
How nice for you!

199
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,647
Just what is it you're afraid of?

200
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,675
Dad didn't see you
about Shawn, did he?

201
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:49,951
Didn't he?

202
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,974
Could you find him
if Dad wanted you to?

203
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,575
Maybe. When did he go?

204
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:55,014
About a month back.

205
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,478
Drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

206
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,222
They found his car parked
in some private garage.

207
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:02,494
They? Who's they?

208
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:03,904
Dad didn't tell you.

209
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:07,846
He told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

210
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,946
That's what you wanted me to say.

211
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:13,255
I'm sure I don't care
what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

212
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:15,355
I'm wasting your time.

213
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:17,829
Goodbye, Mrs. Rutledge.

214
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,157
Oh, Norris.

215
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,197
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge
didn't want to see me.

216
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,362
I'm sorry, sir.
I make many mistakes.

217
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,283
- Did you find what you wanted?
- Yes, thanks.

218
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,449
You don't look like a man who'd
be interested in first editions.

219
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,500
I collect blondes in bottles too.

220
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,797
Can I be of any assistance?

221
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,288
Would you happen
to have a Ben Hur, 1860?

222
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,384
- A what?
- Do you have a Ben Hur, 1860?

223
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:33,661
A first edition?

224
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:35,971
No, no, the third, the third!

225
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,369
The one with the erratum on page 116.

226
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:39,808
I'm afraid not.

227
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,311
How about a Chevalier Audubon,
1840, full set?

228
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,327
Not at the moment.

229
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,967
You do sell books?

230
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,490
What do those look like? Grapefruit?

231
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,271
Well, they look like books.
Maybe I'd better see Mr. Geiger.

232
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:52,860
- He's not in just now.
- That's a pity because...

233
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,445
I said, Mr. Geiger is not in!

234
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,495
I heard you.
You needn't yell at me.

235
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:11,302
I'm late for my lecture on
Argentine ceramics, so I won't wait.

236
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:12,837
The word is "ceramics. "

237
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,263
And they ain't Argentine,
they're Egyptian!

238
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,795
You did sell a book once, didn't you?

239
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,483
I'll run along to the library.

240
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:22,945
Or I could go to that bookstore
across the street, couldn't I?

241
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,605
Do so.

242
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:25,918
Thank you.

243
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,789
Is there something I can do for you?

244
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:53,021
- Would you do me a small favor?
- It depends on the favor.

245
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:56,579
- You know Geiger's bookstore?
- I think I may have passed it.

246
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,468
You know Geiger by sight?

247
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,539
What's he look like?

248
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,081
Wouldn't it be easier to go
and ask to see him?

249
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,028
I've already done that.

250
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,425
I know anything about rare books?

251
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:09,631
You could try me.

252
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,837
Do you have a Ben Hur,
1860, third edition...

253
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,726
...with a duplicated line
on page 116?

254
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:23,844
Or a Chevalier Audubon, 1840?

255
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,773
Nobody would. There isn't one.

256
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,554
The girl in Geiger's bookstore
didn't know that.

257
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,169
I see.

258
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,279
You begin to interest me vaguely.

259
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,525
I'm a private dick on a case.

260
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,635
Perhaps I'm asking too much...

261
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,879
...although it doesn't seem
too much to me.

262
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,808
Geiger's in his early forties...

263
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:57,688
...medium height...

264
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,108
...fattish...

265
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,423
...soft all over,
Charlie Chan mustache...

266
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,804
...well-dressed...

267
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,857
...wears a black hat...

268
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,214
...affects a knowledge
of antiques and hasn't any...

269
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:13,379
...and I think his left eye is glass.

270
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,460
You'd make a good cop.

271
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,011
Thanks.

272
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,827
Going to wait for him to come out?

273
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,143
They don't close
for another hour or so.

274
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,378
And it's raining pretty hard.

275
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:29,729
I got my car and...

276
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,609
That's right, it is, isn't it?

277
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,771
It just happens I got a bottle
of pretty good rye in my pocket.

278
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,440
I'd a lot rather get wet in here.

279
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,806
Well!

280
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:58,367
Looks like we're closed
for the rest of the afternoon.

281
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,242
Tell me more about this business.

282
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,487
There isn't much to tell.

283
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:09,252
What's the matter?

284
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,994
I'm just wondering if you have to...

285
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,072
Not necessarily.

286
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:24,356
Little things like that make an...

287
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,629
Hello!

288
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:42,655
I hate to tell you, but that's
Geiger's car driving up.

289
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,599
Who's the man getting out?

290
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,217
Geiger's shadow.
His name's Carol Lundgren.

291
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,211
Thanks.

292
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,252
- If you ever want to buy a book...
- A Ben Hur, 1860?

293
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:54,652
With duplications.

294
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,033
So long.

295
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,923
So long, pal.

296
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:14,848
You're cute.

297
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,496
And you're higher than a kite.
Come on, wake up.

298
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:20,861
I know you. Doghouse Reilly.

299
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,406
You're cute.

300
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,026
What do you know about this?

301
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:25,983
Mr. Geiger, here on the floor.

302
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,544
He's cute too.

303
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:33,089
You got a dead man at your feet.
How did it happen?

304
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,419
You talk a lot, Reilly.

305
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,133
Come on!

306
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:46,486
Lie down there and be quiet.

307
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,453
All right, Reilly.

308
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,462
Come on, we're going.

309
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,924
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Norris.

310
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,389
- I'd like to see General Sternwood.
- He's asleep.

311
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,729
What about Mrs. Rutledge?
Is she..?

312
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,663
Good evening, Mrs. Rutledge.

313
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,029
I've got your sister outside.
She's all right.

314
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:30,945
But she's not walking very well.
I'll need some help.

315
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:49,981
Are you sure..?

316
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,418
Yes, she'll be all right
in the morning.

317
00:24:56,993 --> 00:24:58,268
Did you do this?

318
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,318
That? Oh, yes, that's
a little special service...

319
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,744
...I always provide all my clients.

320
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,870
Including being insolent.
Where did you find her?

321
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,539
- I didn't find her.
- Then how..?

322
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,608
I haven't been here, and
she hasn't been out all evening.

323
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:13,689
That bad?

324
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,799
Just what did happen?

325
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:18,139
- You're fond of your sister.
- Yes, I am.

326
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:20,412
- Do anything for her, wouldn't you?
- Anything.

327
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:21,851
Then drop this.

328
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,481
I still think I should know...

329
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,409
Don't even ask her.

330
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,094
She never remembers, anyway.

331
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:31,288
Just what did she forget
about Shawn Regan?

332
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,438
What'd she tell you?

333
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:39,641
Not half as much as you did.

334
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:41,721
Take it easy.

335
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:44,676
I don't slap so good around
this time of the evening.

336
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,221
You go too far, Marlowe.

337
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,415
Harsh words to throw at a man...

338
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,870
...when he's walking out
of your bedroom.

339
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,481
Good night, Mrs. Rutledge.

340
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,452
Thanks, Norris.

341
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,986
I've put her car away.

342
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,797
If anybody asks,
she's been in all evening.

343
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,261
- Forget about my being here.
- I understand.

344
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:08,604
May I call a cab?

345
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,397
It'd be better if you didn't.

346
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,807
Good night.

347
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:09,625
- Hello, Bernie. Come in.
- Hello, Phil.

348
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:10,909
Don't you go to bed?

349
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:12,386
What you been doing?

350
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:13,662
Just sitting around.

351
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:14,870
All evening?

352
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:17,316
What is it?

353
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,032
Does it have to be something?

354
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:21,621
You're a friend, but when
a man from Homicide...

355
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,895
...just drops in at 2 A.M.,
I kind of...

356
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:25,564
Working on cipher, huh?

357
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:27,069
Just fooling around.

358
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,601
You're working for
the Sternwoods, aren't you?

359
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:30,723
Thanks to you.

360
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:32,286
Done anything for them yet?

361
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,397
I started today.
Then the rain came.

362
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:38,559
All right. They seem to be
a family that things happen to.

363
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,764
There's a Packard
belonging to them...

364
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,545
...washing around in the surf
off Lido Pier.

365
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,336
And there's a guy in it.

366
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,996
- Could it be Regan?
- Who?

367
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:49,625
Shawn Regan.

368
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,416
That Irish ex-legger
old Sternwood hired...

369
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,469
...to do his drinking for him?

370
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,799
What would he be doing down there?

371
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,447
What would anybody
be doing down there?

372
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,688
That's what I'm going to Lido
to find out. Want to come?

373
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,222
Yeah, I do.

374
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:07,004
- How's the weather?
- Clearing up.

375
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:10,485
- What time did that call come in?
- About 15 minutes ago.

376
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,523
- What kind of car you say it was?
- Packard.

377
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:31,900
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hi, Ed.

378
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,406
You got him out.
Who is he?

379
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:37,079
Owen Taylor. Sternwood's chauffeur,
according to his license.

380
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,352
- What's the story?
- You can see it from here.

381
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:41,529
There's where he went
through the railing.

382
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:43,677
The rain stopped here about 9 P.M.

383
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:47,552
The broken rails are dry inside.
That would put it about 9:30.

384
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:57,621
Let's have it, doc.

385
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:00,700
His neck's broken and something
hit him across the temple.

386
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:02,781
What made the bruise?
Steering wheel?

387
00:30:02,983 --> 00:30:04,536
Whatever it was, it was covered.

388
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:07,519
The wound had bled under
the skin while he was alive.

389
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:09,341
- Blackjack?
- Could be.

390
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,751
Bernie, funny thing.

391
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,148
The hand throttle is set
halfway down.

392
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,383
Thanks, Jim. So long, doc.

393
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,445
All right, boys. Take him away.

394
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:23,928
- Could be drunk or a suicide.
- Yeah, but it isn't.

395
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,076
You know anything about Owen Taylor?

396
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:28,186
Only that a few
Sternwood chauffeurs...

397
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:31,102
...lost their jobs on account
of the younger daughter, Carmen.

398
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,470
Tell me what
you're working on, Phil.

399
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:35,253
They told me blackmail.

400
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:37,211
Who were they after? Carmen?

401
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,480
This doesn't look like
the way you'd handle it.

402
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,533
You know, I got a feeling that...

403
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,276
Me? I didn't do this.

404
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,932
What were you going to say, Phil?

405
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:51,097
Give me another day, Bernie.
I may have something for you.

406
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,986
Okay. Let's go home.

407
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:03,833
Good morning.

408
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:05,847
You do get up.
I was thinking...

409
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,995
...you worked in bed,
like Marcel Proust.

410
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,556
- Who's he?
- A French writer.

411
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,210
Come into my boudoir.

412
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,676
You don't put on a front.

413
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:25,699
Not much money in this work
if you're honest.

414
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:26,936
Are you honest?

415
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:30,331
- We're going to start that again?
- I'm sorry. Also, about yesterday.

416
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,151
- Perhaps I was rude.
- We were both rude.

417
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,126
You want to see me about Taylor?

418
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,891
So you know about that?

419
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:38,368
Poor Owen.

420
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,875
The DA's man took me down to Lido.
He knew more about it than I did.

421
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:45,589
He knew Owen Taylor wanted
to marry your sister.

422
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:48,026
Perhaps it wouldn't
have been a bad idea.

423
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,135
You see, he was in love with her.

424
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:52,609
But I didn't come here about Owen.

425
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,312
You still can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

426
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:57,884
Not without his permission.

427
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,445
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

428
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:05,086
You better look at this.
A messenger brought it today.

429
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,775
"Eight thirty-five. "

430
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:08,444
That's right.

431
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,059
She takes a nice picture.

432
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,428
They want 5000 for
the negative and prints.

433
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,800
The demand came how?

434
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,947
A woman telephoned me after
it was delivered.

435
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:20,383
- What else?
- There has to be something else?

436
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:22,647
This thing isn't
worth $ 5000 to anybody.

437
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,575
- They think it is.
- Why?

438
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,971
She said if they didn't
get the money today...

439
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:29,888
...I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

440
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,189
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

441
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:33,560
What kind of a jam?

442
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,286
I don't know.

443
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,519
You know where this picture
was taken?

444
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,472
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Or when?

445
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:44,446
- Talk to Carmen about it?
- She was asleep when I left.

446
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:46,037
Figure out a story?

447
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,243
- Norris fixed that.
- How?

448
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:50,238
She was in all evening.

449
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,290
Police checked when
they called about Owen.

450
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,813
Go ahead and scratch.

451
00:32:57,662 --> 00:32:59,839
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

452
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,274
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

453
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:03,261
Why? You think...

454
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:06,206
That he knew about this picture?
I don't rule him out.

455
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,112
Outside of what the woman said...

456
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:11,481
...you don't know why
they want $ 5000 for it?

457
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:15,672
That's why I came to you.

458
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,437
There's five fingers on a glove.

459
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,192
Why didn't you go to the police?

460
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,780
You were afraid they'd find
something I couldn't sit on.

461
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,958
Then where would the Sternwoods be?

462
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,547
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

463
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:35,965
Police headquarters, please.

464
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,803
Hello, this is Mrs...

465
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:43,167
Hello. What do you want, please?

466
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:44,826
What?

467
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:46,303
I called you?

468
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,992
Say, who is this?

469
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:51,482
Sergeant Reilly?
There isn't any Sergeant Reilly here.

470
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,263
Wait a minute.
You'd better talk to my mother.

471
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:59,232
Hello. Who's this?

472
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,850
The police?
This isn't a police station.

473
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:03,288
If you know it, why did...

474
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,453
Look, this is not a police station!

475
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,917
What was that you said?

476
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:11,871
My father should hear this.

477
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:15,612
Hello. Who is this?

478
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,856
Yeah, but she just told you that...

479
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:19,736
You're the police!
He's the police.

480
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:22,459
Well, that's different.
What can I do for you?

481
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,540
I can do what?

482
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:25,719
Where?

483
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:29,086
Oh, no! I wouldn't like that,
and neither would my daughter.

484
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:32,030
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

485
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,907
You like to play games, don't you?

486
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:37,142
Why did you stop me phoning?

487
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,099
Because I'm working for your father.

488
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,260
Or because I think I'm beginning to
like another one of the Sternwoods.

489
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:45,725
I prefer the second reason.

490
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:50,396
Well, let's get back to business.
Have you got $ 5000 in cash?

491
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,342
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

492
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,190
- Where from, your father?
- I'd rather not.

493
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,697
Where would you get it?

494
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:58,835
Well, from Eddie Mars.

495
00:34:59,037 --> 00:34:59,938
The gambler?

496
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,681
That explains why you
haven't got $ 5000 in cash.

497
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,407
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

498
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:06,133
How do you know he'll
give it to you?

499
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:07,543
I can get the money.

500
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:09,845
I've been a good customer
of Eddie Mars'.

501
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:11,293
Another reason:

502
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,937
There's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

503
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:17,785
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

504
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,895
That doesn't interest you?

505
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:23,262
It might make it easier
for me to find him.

506
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:24,854
If I were looking for him.

507
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,508
Is Regan mixed up in this?

508
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,490
No. Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

509
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,397
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

510
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,956
- Tell you what?
- What you're trying to find out.

511
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:38,875
You know, it's a funny thing.

512
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:41,215
You're trying to find out
why I was hired.

513
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:43,037
And I'm trying to find out why you...

514
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,242
You could go on forever,
couldn't you?

515
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,832
It'll give us something
to talk about next time.

516
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,623
Among other things.
Oh, Mrs. Rutledge.

517
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,692
You wanted me to do something
about this, didn't you?

518
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:55,611
That call, how'd you leave it?

519
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:57,816
She's to call me at 6 p. m.
With instructions.

520
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,868
Phone me when you've heard from her.

521
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,429
As long as you're going
to pay $ 5000 for these...

522
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:03,867
...you'd better take this.

523
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,882
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

524
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:10,743
Well, it wasn't intentional.

525
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,796
Try it sometime.

526
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:21,821
- I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

527
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:26,846
Do you remember me now?

528
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:28,352
Now, see here!

529
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,912
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

530
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:34,844
I got something to sell.
Something Geiger wants. Is he in?

531
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,529
No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

532
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:39,927
Drop the veil.
I'm in the business myself.

533
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:42,296
Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

534
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,866
No, that wouldn't do.
If you'd come back tomorrow...

535
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:46,880
Say, Agnes, you...

536
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,239
Come on, Carol.

537
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:53,459
Hurry up, will you?

538
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:56,480
- Perhaps...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

539
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,235
- What do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

540
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:00,028
You'd better come tomorrow.

541
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:02,043
In the morning? Early?

542
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,891
Because it looks like
you're moving today.

543
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,078
All right, driver. Let's go!

544
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,242
Around the corner, then take it easy.

545
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,502
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

546
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,845
I'm your girl, bud.

547
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,543
It wouldn't be bad.

548
00:37:31,907 --> 00:37:35,484
That station wagon coming out
of the alley. That's the one.

549
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:21,461
Here you are, sugar.
Buy yourself a cigar.

550
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:24,443
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

551
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,584
Day and night?

552
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:28,634
Night's better.
I work during the day.

553
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,485
- What are you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly.

554
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,979
The man that didn't grow very tall.

555
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,376
What's the matter,
couldn't you get in the house?

556
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:11,100
Come on. I've got a key.

557
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:15,128
- Where'd you leave your car?
- Around in back.

558
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:32,505
Looking for something?

559
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,942
How much do you remember
about last night?

560
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:36,476
Remember what?

561
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,231
I was sick last night, I was home.

562
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:40,763
Before you went home.
In that chair there.

563
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:43,093
You remember, all right.

564
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:45,625
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb!

565
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:48,761
- Were you the one who was here?
- How much do you remember?

566
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,813
Are you the police?

567
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,732
No, I'm a friend of your father's.

568
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,621
Who killed Geiger?

569
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:56,702
Who else knows about it?

570
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,553
What, that he's dead?
I don't know.

571
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:00,663
Not the cops, or they'd
be camping here.

572
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,140
Was it Joe Brody?

573
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:03,425
Joe Brody.

574
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:05,017
Who's he?

575
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,539
I don't know how much trouble
you're used to...

576
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,330
...but I hope you've had plenty
of practice dodging it.

577
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:11,701
Did Brody kill him?

578
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,274
I kill who?

579
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,999
Yes, Joe did it.

580
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:20,506
He did?

581
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:23,574
Why?

582
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,435
I don't know.

583
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:27,765
But you're ready to tell
the police he did it?

584
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,693
That is, if we can get
the photograph.

585
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,680
You mean..?

586
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:33,501
It's gone. I looked for it.
Brody took it with him.

587
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:35,582
I've got to go home now.

588
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,475
I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

589
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,854
I wouldn't say anything
about anything.

590
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:45,182
That you were ever here.
Not even to your sister.

591
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:47,196
Just leave it to Reilly.

592
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:50,140
Your name isn't Reilly...

593
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:05,983
Excuse the casual entrance.
The bell didn't answer.

594
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:07,892
Mr. Geiger around?

595
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,502
We don't know where he is.

596
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:11,833
We found the door open
and just stepped in.

597
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:15,007
- Friends of his?
- Business.

598
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,079
We dropped in for a book.

599
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:18,834
Any message if he comes back?

600
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:22,037
No, I don't think so.
We won't bother you.

601
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,581
Just a minute.

602
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,595
The girl can go.

603
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:28,635
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Suppose I don't want to talk to you?

604
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:30,458
I've got two boys out in the car.

605
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,565
It's like that, eh?

606
00:41:35,004 --> 00:41:36,528
Run along, angel.

607
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:44,699
Your story sounds wrong.

608
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,714
That's too bad.
Got a better one?

609
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:49,494
Maybe I can find one.

610
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:58,039
Blood.
Quite a lot of blood.

611
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,765
Is that so?

612
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:00,762
Do you mind?

613
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:02,451
No, I'm used to it.

614
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:05,050
I think we'll let
the police in on this.

615
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:07,284
- We'll have some law...
- Yeah. Why not?

616
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:09,298
Who are you, soldier?

617
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,360
Marlowe.
I'm a private detective.

618
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:12,790
- Who's the girl?
- A client.

619
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,676
Geiger tried to throw a loop on her.
We came to talk.

620
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:18,073
Convenient, the door being open.

621
00:42:18,266 --> 00:42:19,762
Wasn't it?
How'd you have a key?

622
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:21,593
- That your business?
- Could be.

623
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:22,936
I could make yours mine.

624
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,554
You wouldn't like it.
The pay's too small.

625
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,429
All right, I own this house.
Geiger's my tenant.

626
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,017
- Now what do you think of it?
- You know some nice people.

627
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,917
I take them as they come.

628
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:35,509
Got any good ideas?

629
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,848
One or two.
Somebody gunned Geiger.

630
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:39,988
Or somebody got gunned
by Geiger who ran away.

631
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:43,008
Or he had meat for dinner
and likes to butcher in the parlor.

632
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:46,394
No, I don't like it either.
Maybe you'd better call downtown.

633
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,724
I don't get it.
I don't get your game.

634
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:50,038
Don't you, Mr. Mars?

635
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,819
Wondered why you didn't
ask me who I was.

636
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,543
You're telling me Geiger was
in a racket of some kind.

637
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:56,540
What racket?

638
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:57,624
I wouldn't know.

639
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,830
But I'll tell you
something you missed.

640
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:02,199
Somebody cleaned out
Geiger's store today.

641
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,030
You talk too much.

642
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:06,265
You really got those boys outside?

643
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:09,171
Open the door.

644
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,866
Open it yourself.
I already got a client.

645
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:18,358
It's all right.
Just proving something.

646
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,180
While you're here, look him over.

647
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:27,316
- Pardon me.
- Who is he?

648
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:30,136
Philip Marlowe, Hobart Arms,
Franklin Street.

649
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:32,341
Special license,
deputy badge and all.

650
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,521
All right, outside.

651
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:34,557
A shamus.

652
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:35,794
The man said, outside.

653
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:39,227
He said that.
That's what the man said.

654
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:42,900
He kills me.

655
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:45,748
Is he any good?

656
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,568
Who? Sidney?
He's company for Pete.

657
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,776
All right, talk.

658
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:52,116
Not to you.
I already got a client.

659
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:54,101
Who cleaned out Geiger's store?

660
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:56,950
Lots of weather we're having.
Did it rain at Las Olindas?

661
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:58,935
I might make it worth your while.

662
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,441
I might make it worth yours.

663
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,973
What do you care
who cleaned out Geiger's store?

664
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:05,082
- I could make you talk.
- It's been tried.

665
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,483
And?

666
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,631
Why don't you call the cops?

667
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,971
I think you'd better
get out of here.

668
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:15,229
By the way,
how's Mrs. Mars these days?

669
00:44:15,422 --> 00:44:17,522
You take chances, Marlowe.

670
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:19,804
I get paid to.

671
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:41,497
Mrs. Rutledge. I've been
waiting to hear from you.

672
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,212
I'm sorry.
I have nothing to tell you.

673
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:46,388
- She didn't call?
- No, she didn't.

674
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,167
Did you get the money,
in case she does?

675
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:54,521
I have the money. I'll get in touch
with you as soon as she calls.

676
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:58,367
All right, I'll stay
right here until you call.

677
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:21,237
Geiger?

678
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,484
You said what?

679
00:46:22,686 --> 00:46:24,958
Arthur Geiger.
The guy with the blackmail racket.

680
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,218
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- You're Joe Brody?

681
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,386
- So what?
- So you're Joe Brody.

682
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,726
And you don't know Geiger.
That's very funny.

683
00:46:32,928 --> 00:46:36,236
You've got a funny sense of humor.
Take it somewhere else.

684
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:39,545
Joe, you got Geiger's stuff.
I got his sucker list.

685
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:41,396
Don't you think we ought to talk?

686
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,806
Now!

687
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:46,296
All right. If you think
you got something.

688
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,214
You alone, Joe?

689
00:46:53,212 --> 00:46:55,005
Except for this.

690
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,896
My, my, such a lot of guns
around town and so few brains.

691
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:01,977
You're the second guy
today that thinks...

692
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:04,854
...a gat in the hand
means the world by the tail.

693
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:07,635
Put it down, Joe.

694
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:10,292
The other guy was Eddie Mars.
You ever hear of him?

695
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,342
If he gets wise to where you were
last night, you'll hear of him.

696
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:15,125
What would I be to Eddie Mars?

697
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:17,043
I don't know if you don't.

698
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:19,345
Look, don't get me wrong.

699
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:20,889
I'm not a tough guy.

700
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:22,068
Just careful.

701
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:23,574
You're not careful enough.

702
00:47:23,776 --> 00:47:26,355
That play with Geiger's stuff
was terrible.

703
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:29,655
Don't kid yourself I won't
use this if I have to.

704
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:30,872
What's your story?

705
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:33,174
Why don't you ask
your friend to come out?

706
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:35,159
She must get tired
of holding her breath.

707
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,915
Come on out, Agnes.

708
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:38,046
Hello, sugar.

709
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,993
I knew you were trouble.
I told Joe...

710
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:42,774
Ask Mrs. Rutledge to come out too.

711
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:46,256
What did you come for?

712
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:48,595
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I don't need you.

713
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:49,592
I keep out of it!

714
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,607
I don't want you here.
Will you get out?

715
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,046
But he won't let me.

716
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,097
He's curious, bothered
and wondering.

717
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,083
You bet I'm wondering
and I'll find out.

718
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,646
- Sit down.
- Stop waving that gun.

719
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:01,523
I didn't do anything.
Can't you talk without that?

720
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,221
Don't argue with the man.

721
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,628
- You're ruining things.
- I'm not. If you'd...

722
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,066
Say, look!

723
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,572
What are you up here for?

724
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:12,179
To keep her from paying you off,
and to take the cops off your neck.

725
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,492
What cops?

726
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:16,762
The cops that want to know
where the lead in Geiger came from.

727
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:19,035
Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

728
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,724
- I didn't know...
- The cops don't yet.

729
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:22,488
But he wasn't alone
when you shot him.

730
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:26,813
Either you didn't notice that
or you got scared and ran away.

731
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,894
But you had nerve enough
to take the film.

732
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:31,609
And you had nerve enough
to come back and hide the body.

733
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:33,143
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

734
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:35,483
So you could clean out the store...

735
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:37,947
...before the law knew
there was a murder.

736
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,361
You take chances. It's lucky
for you I didn't shoot Geiger.

737
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:44,882
But you can step off for it anyway.
You're made-to-order for the rap.

738
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,099
You think you've got me?

739
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,317
- Positive.
- How come?

740
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,604
I told you, there was a witness.
Now don't go simple on me.

741
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:54,107
You mean Carmen.
She'd say anything.

742
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,150
So you have got that picture.

743
00:48:56,352 --> 00:48:57,723
I guess you think I'm dumb.

744
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,861
Just average, for a grafter.

745
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:02,326
You see, either you were
there last night...

746
00:49:02,528 --> 00:49:05,079
...or you got the picture
from somebody who was.

747
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,709
You knew Carmen was there...

748
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,778
...because you had your girlfriend
threaten Mrs. Rutledge.

749
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,732
The only way you could have known
was by being there...

750
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:15,446
...and seeing what happened.
Or having the picture.

751
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:16,568
Make sense?

752
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,872
Who are you?

753
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:20,279
A guy who gets paid to do
people's laundry.

754
00:49:20,472 --> 00:49:22,812
And all I'll get out
of it is that picture.

755
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,199
How about some dough?
I'm down to nickels.

756
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:28,498
Not from my client.
Get the picture, Joe.

757
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,195
Stay right there.

758
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:39,451
Here. Watch him.

759
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:53,970
- Take it easy.
- I want my picture.

760
00:49:54,172 --> 00:49:55,581
- Now...
- I want my picture.

761
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:57,327
You shot Geiger.

762
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:00,338
Hold it!

763
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:05,498
Get up. You look like a Pekinese.
And since I'm collecting guns...

764
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,116
Sit down, sugar.
Now where were we?

765
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:10,801
Oh, yes, you were just about
to get something.

766
00:50:20,507 --> 00:50:22,137
There better not be
any more prints.

767
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:23,642
There won't be.

768
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:30,999
Can I have my picture now?

769
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,329
Can I have my gun?

770
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,326
Later.

771
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,476
You're cute. I like you.

772
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:43,984
This is nothing. I got a Balinese
dancing girl tattooed on my chest.

773
00:50:44,186 --> 00:50:45,979
You better take her home.

774
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,365
I suppose I should thank you.

775
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:51,934
No, just don't lie to me next time.

776
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:54,063
Come on, Carmen.

777
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:56,634
Hold it, Joe.

778
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,603
You got off easy, Joe.
What's the matter, sugar?

779
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:06,838
- He gives me a pain...
- Goes for me too.

780
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,152
You got your pictures.
Get out.

781
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:09,840
- Where's the pain?
- In my...

782
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:10,876
Get out!

783
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,398
Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

784
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,645
I told you to get out.

785
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:16,668
What difference does it make now?

786
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,864
Why'd you put the bee
on Mrs. Rutledge?

787
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:22,230
I tapped the old man six months ago.
I figured it might not work twice.

788
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:24,561
What made you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him?

789
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:27,064
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

790
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:31,255
I figured she might have a thing
or two she wouldn't want him to know.

791
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:33,748
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that too.

792
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,954
Say, Joe, how'd you get that picture?

793
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:38,227
You got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

794
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,596
I don't know anything about it.
Do I, Agnes?

795
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,061
- But you just gave it to me.
- A half-smart guy.

796
00:51:43,263 --> 00:51:44,720
That's what I always draw.

797
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:48,499
Never once a man who's smart all the way
around the course. Never once.

798
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,774
Did I hurt you much?

799
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,443
You and every other man.

800
00:51:51,644 --> 00:51:52,890
Where'd you get that picture?

801
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:54,550
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

802
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:57,590
- Got an alibi for last night?
- I was here with Agnes.

803
00:51:58,808 --> 00:52:00,304
That's a great witness.

804
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:03,220
You can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

805
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,562
A couple of murders?

806
00:52:04,764 --> 00:52:07,698
I mean two murders. Where were you
about 7:30 last night?

807
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,041
Where were you?

808
00:52:09,243 --> 00:52:11,132
All right, I was watching
Geiger's place.

809
00:52:11,324 --> 00:52:12,532
Why?

810
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:15,601
- To get something on him.
- Look at me while you're talking.

811
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:17,970
It was raining hard
and I was in my car.

812
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:21,815
There was a car out front and another
down the hill. I was in back.

813
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,667
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

814
00:52:23,868 --> 00:52:26,802
There was a big Packard near
where I was, so I took a look.

815
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:29,104
It was registered to the Sternwoods.

816
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:32,854
Nothing happened, so I got tired
of waiting and I went home.

817
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:34,964
I Know where that Packard is now?

818
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,055
It's in the sheriff's garage.

819
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,469
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier this morning.

820
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,194
There was a dead man in it.

821
00:52:42,397 --> 00:52:45,082
It was pointed toward the end of
the pier and the throttle pulled out.

822
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:47,383
- You can't pin that on me.
- I can try.

823
00:52:47,575 --> 00:52:49,071
Sit down, Joe.

824
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:54,163
The dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffeur.

825
00:52:54,365 --> 00:52:57,050
He went up to Geiger's
because he was sweet on Carmen.

826
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:59,669
He didn't like the games
Geiger was playing.

827
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,718
He let himself in the back
with a jimmy and he had a gun.

828
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:06,448
The gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

829
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,950
Owen ran with the film.
You went after him and got it.

830
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:12,146
All right, you're right.
I heard the shots...

831
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:15,195
...and saw him run out and
enter the Packard and away.

832
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:16,566
I followed him.

833
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:18,868
He turned west on Sunset.

834
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:21,074
And beyond Beverly...

835
00:53:21,276 --> 00:53:25,073
...he skidded off the road
and came to a stop.

836
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:27,509
So I came up and played copper.

837
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:30,971
He had a gun. He was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

838
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,878
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

839
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,834
That's the last I saw of him.

840
00:53:36,956 --> 00:53:40,466
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly.

841
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:43,036
And you want me to believe
somebody came along...

842
00:53:43,228 --> 00:53:45,913
...ran that car to the ocean,
pushed it off the pier...

843
00:53:46,105 --> 00:53:47,668
...then hid Geiger's body?

844
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,874
- Well, I didn't...
- Somebody did.

845
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,147
You wanted time to take over.

846
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:54,064
You can't prove I did it.

847
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:56,156
I don't particularly want to.

848
00:53:56,348 --> 00:54:00,021
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

849
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,023
Maybe you and I can make
a little deal.

850
00:54:03,934 --> 00:54:05,075
Go ahead.

851
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:12,277
Maybe she's back.

852
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,713
If she is, she hasn't got her gun.

853
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:32,845
You got a match, bud?

854
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:38,130
What will it be, kid?
Me or the cops?

855
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:39,607
What do you want?

856
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:45,333
Sit in that car,
back of the wheel. You drive.

857
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,810
As soon as this police car goes by,
we're going to Geiger's house.

858
00:55:55,192 --> 00:55:57,369
By the way, Carol,
you shot the wrong guy.

859
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,468
Brody didn't kill Geiger.

860
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:02,000
All right, let's go.

861
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:26,427
- You got a key. Let's go in.
- Who said I got a key?

862
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,593
All right, come on!

863
00:56:33,917 --> 00:56:35,566
Maybe you need this.

864
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:42,929
- Hello.
- Hello, Bernie?

865
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:44,780
Is this who I think it is?

866
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:47,283
It's Marlowe.
How are you fixed for red points?

867
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:48,856
I haven't got any.

868
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,160
Who has?

869
00:57:50,362 --> 00:57:53,593
I got some cold meat set out,
might interest you.

870
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:54,802
What are you talking about?

871
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,490
You boys find a gun on Owen Taylor...

872
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,484
...when they fished him out of
the drink last night?

873
00:57:58,677 --> 00:58:00,307
That's police business.

874
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:02,484
I know it's police business.

875
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:05,428
But if they did,
it had three empty shells in it.

876
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:07,989
You come up to
7244 Laverne Terrace...

877
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:10,262
...off Laurel Canyon Road, and
I'll show you where the slugs went.

878
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:12,947
- I'll be right out.
- I'll be waiting for you.

879
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:15,507
What did you hide Geiger's body for?

880
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:17,532
Do you admit shooting Brody?

881
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:18,518
Take a jump, Jack.

882
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:21,051
He doesn't have to admit it.
Here's his gun.

883
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:48,182
I'm late. I'm sorry.

884
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:49,553
How are you today?

885
00:58:49,755 --> 00:58:50,829
Better than last night.

886
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:52,277
I can agree on that.

887
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:54,646
- Hello, Max.
- Good afternoon.

888
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,772
- Got a table for us?
- Certainly, madam. This way, please.

889
00:59:01,149 --> 00:59:02,386
I'll have a scotch, mixed.

890
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,080
A scotch and plain water.

891
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,750
How'd you happen to
pick out this place?

892
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:11,698
Maybe I wanted to hold your hand.

893
00:59:11,899 --> 00:59:13,836
That can be arranged.

894
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:16,973
Why'd you want to see me?

895
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:21,201
My father was very pleased when
he saw the morning papers. So was I.

896
00:59:21,403 --> 00:59:25,047
We were lucky. I managed to keep
the Sternwoods out of it.

897
00:59:25,268 --> 00:59:27,953
He hopes you didn't
involve yourself too deeply.

898
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:30,609
You tell him it was
no fault of yours?

899
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,074
No. He asked me to give you a check.

900
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:34,484
I don't need any money yet.

901
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:36,757
He considers the case closed.

902
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,701
It is, isn't it?

903
00:59:39,894 --> 00:59:42,032
As far as Geiger is concerned, yes.

904
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,813
Then it's completely closed.

905
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,328
I hope this is satisfactory.

906
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,455
Five hundred!

907
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:52,524
It's a lot more than I expected,
but welcome just the same.

908
00:59:52,726 --> 00:59:54,548
We're very grateful to you,
Mr. Marlowe, and...

909
00:59:54,749 --> 00:59:56,983
...I'm very glad it's all over.

910
00:59:58,134 --> 01:00:02,133
Tell me, what do you do
when you're not working?

911
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,531
Play the horses, fool around.

912
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:06,190
No women?

913
01:00:06,392 --> 01:00:09,038
I'm generally working on
something, most of the time.

914
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,764
Could that be stretched to include me?

915
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:12,721
I like you.
I told you that before.

916
01:00:12,923 --> 01:00:14,543
I liked hearing you say it.

917
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:17,228
But you didn't do much about it.

918
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:18,993
Neither did you.

919
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:24,018
Speaking of horses, I like to
play them myself.

920
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,445
But I like to see them work out
a little first.

921
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:29,581
See if they're front-runners
or come from behind.

922
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:32,170
Find out what their whole card is.

923
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:33,657
What makes them run.

924
01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:34,798
Find out mine?

925
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,208
I think so.

926
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,551
Go ahead.

927
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,929
I'd say you don't like to be rated.

928
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:41,971
You like to get out in front...

929
01:00:42,164 --> 01:00:43,381
...open up a lead...

930
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:46,163
...take a little breather in
the backstretch...

931
01:00:46,364 --> 01:00:47,984
...and then come home free.

932
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,641
You don't like to be rated yourself.

933
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,451
I haven't met anyone yet
that could do it.

934
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:54,516
Any suggestions?

935
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:59,531
I can't tell till I've seen you
over a distance of ground.

936
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:03,789
You got a touch of class,
but I don't know how far you can go.

937
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,993
A lot depends on who's in the saddle.

938
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:10,254
Go ahead, Marlowe,
I like the way you work.

939
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:12,114
In case you don't know it,
you're doing all right.

940
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:14,713
There's one thing I can't figure out.

941
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:16,180
What makes me run?

942
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:19,959
I'll give you a little hint.
Sugar won't work. It's been tried.

943
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:22,193
What did you try it on me for?

944
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:24,236
Who told you to sugar me off this case?

945
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:26,221
Was it Eddie Mars?

946
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:29,645
All right, don't answer me.

947
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:33,107
But your father didn't tell you
to pay me off, did he?

948
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,985
No. He's not well.
I used my own judgment.

949
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:37,164
Are you sure?

950
01:01:37,366 --> 01:01:39,638
I know it hasn't worked so
well up till now.

951
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:41,777
What's Eddie Mars got to do
with this case?

952
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:45,421
Nothing. He runs a gambling house.
I play horses. I play the wheel.

953
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:49,075
You're playing something else too.
Never mind talking. Let me do it.

954
01:01:49,268 --> 01:01:52,269
Did you know Shawn Regan was
supposed to run off with Mars' wife?

955
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:54,839
Who doesn't?

956
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:58,291
Did you know he owned the house
and was mixed up in that racket too?

957
01:01:58,484 --> 01:02:01,006
- I don't believe...
- Then why does it bother you so much?

958
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:04,075
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

959
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:08,697
Come now, angel. Stop shaking.

960
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:11,257
I don't want to hurt you,
I'm trying to help you.

961
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:14,710
You better run along.

962
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:17,617
But you made a deal and you're going to
stick to it, right or wrong.

963
01:02:18,106 --> 01:02:20,043
We'll take up the question of
you and I when the race is over.

964
01:02:20,244 --> 01:02:22,631
- The only trouble is, we could've...
- Pardon me?

965
01:02:22,843 --> 01:02:25,739
The only trouble is, we could
have had a lot of fun...

966
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:27,849
...if you weren't a detective.

967
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:29,431
We still can.

968
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,407
So long, Marlowe.

969
01:02:37,593 --> 01:02:39,050
- Waiter?
- Sir?

970
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:41,553
- Have you got a phone?
- Over there.

971
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:49,591
Deposit 55 cents, sir.

972
01:02:49,783 --> 01:02:52,372
- How much is that?
- 55 cents.

973
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:01,204
Here's your party, sir.

974
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,314
Hello? Hello!

975
01:03:03,506 --> 01:03:05,395
May I speak with Mr. Mars,
please?

976
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:06,671
This is Mars.

977
01:03:06,873 --> 01:03:09,452
I didn't recognize your voice.
This is Marlowe.

978
01:03:09,654 --> 01:03:10,766
I want to see you.

979
01:03:10,968 --> 01:03:12,396
Sure. When?

980
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:14,640
I'd like to drive up this evening.

981
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:15,666
Come ahead.

982
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:35,087
Mr. Mars around? I'm Marlowe.
He's expecting me.

983
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:37,657
Wait here and I'll find out.

984
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:45,426
He would spend it on the ponies

985
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:49,233
He would spend it on the girls

986
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:53,519
Buy his mother lovely roses

987
01:03:54,968 --> 01:03:57,173
For her dear old hennaed curls

988
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:02,382
But when his wife said "Sweetie...

989
01:04:03,763 --> 01:04:06,323
...what did you get for me?"

990
01:04:08,788 --> 01:04:11,636
He socked her in the choppers

991
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:16,652
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

992
01:04:17,045 --> 01:04:19,346
And her tears flowed like wine

993
01:04:24,123 --> 01:04:26,453
She's a real sad tomato

994
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,809
She's a busted valentine

995
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,012
Knows her mama done told her

996
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:36,533
That a man is darned unkind

997
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:40,014
I'm a telling you, mister

998
01:04:41,395 --> 01:04:43,437
She was a sob, sob sister

999
01:04:45,145 --> 01:04:46,669
Lying on a pillow

1000
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:47,887
Weeping like a willow

1001
01:04:48,502 --> 01:04:51,120
My, oh my,
how that baby could cry

1002
01:04:53,652 --> 01:04:55,953
And her tears flowed like wine

1003
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,319
Yes, her tears flowed like wine

1004
01:05:03,223 --> 01:05:04,018
Hello, boys.

1005
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:06,637
Stop it!
He's waiting to see you.

1006
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:11,565
Thanks.

1007
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:16,850
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Marlowe. Glad you came.

1008
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:18,126
You never been here before?

1009
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,987
My first time.
I wouldn't be here now...

1010
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:23,564
...if you hadn't told me I could
come up here if I needed help.

1011
01:05:24,245 --> 01:05:25,395
Drink?

1012
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:32,271
I like the way you've
handled this whole thing.

1013
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:35,503
It made me sore at first, but I see now
you knew what you were doing.

1014
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:37,517
You and I could get along.

1015
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:40,337
I like to pay my bills as I go.

1016
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:43,090
- How much do I owe you?
- For what?

1017
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:45,420
Still careful, huh?

1018
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:48,844
All right, then.
I want some information...

1019
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,801
...about Shawn Regan.

1020
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,775
You got that already from
the Bureau of Missing Persons.

1021
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,127
- You get around.
- My boys do.

1022
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,112
- Where is he?
- I haven't any idea.

1023
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:02,030
You didn't bump him off, did you?

1024
01:06:02,232 --> 01:06:03,852
No. You think I did?

1025
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:05,992
- That's what I came here to ask you.
- You're kidding?

1026
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,947
All right, I'm kidding.

1027
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:11,861
You didn't do it and your boys
aren't good enough to.

1028
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:13,261
I used to know Regan.

1029
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:16,176
I thought you told me you weren't
looking for Regan.

1030
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:18,679
I wasn't then.
Maybe I just got curious.

1031
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:21,739
I finally got it through my skull
that the general was worried...

1032
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:24,213
...Regan might be mixed up
in this blackmail business.

1033
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,735
Sternwood can turn over now
and go back to sleep.

1034
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:30,351
It was Geiger's own racket.
I did some inquiring myself today.

1035
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,612
When Geiger and Brody got gunned,
that washed the whole thing up.

1036
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,268
- That, I'm sure of.
- It's finished then.

1037
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:41,361
The general thinks like you do.
He paid me off today.

1038
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:42,990
I'm sorry to hear that.

1039
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:46,041
I wish he'd hire you to keep
that daughter of his home.

1040
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:47,824
- She's out there now.
- I know, I heard her.

1041
01:06:48,026 --> 01:06:49,426
She's not very popular here.

1042
01:06:49,618 --> 01:06:52,495
When she loses, she doubles and
I wind up with a fistful of paper.

1043
01:06:52,697 --> 01:06:55,506
- If she wins, she takes my money home.
- Don't you get it back next time?

1044
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:58,672
- She spends it somewhere else.
- Oh, she goes on the cuff.

1045
01:06:58,873 --> 01:07:00,656
I'd keep her out of here then.

1046
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:04,655
- I took the trip for nothing.
- Sorry I can't help you.

1047
01:07:04,857 --> 01:07:06,544
You mind if I look the place over
before I go back?

1048
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:08,885
Go ahead. Take that door,
it comes out behind the tables.

1049
01:07:09,077 --> 01:07:11,244
No, thanks. I'll go out
with the other suckers.

1050
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:13,066
Maybe someday I can do you
a real favor.

1051
01:07:13,268 --> 01:07:14,063
Maybe.

1052
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:16,174
There's one thing that puzzles me.

1053
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:18,954
You don't seem in a hurry
to find that wife of yours.

1054
01:07:19,444 --> 01:07:22,378
I hear she's not the kind of wife
a guy wants to lose.

1055
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:25,878
Could it be you know where she is,
and maybe Regan too?

1056
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:29,264
Stop being curious. What's between
me and my wife is between us.

1057
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,182
Sorry.

1058
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:35,124
Oh, Eddie, you don't have
anybody watching me, do you?

1059
01:07:35,316 --> 01:07:37,205
Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe?

1060
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:38,192
No. Why should I?

1061
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:41,933
I can't imagine, unless you're
worried about where I am all the time.

1062
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:43,861
I don't like you that well.

1063
01:07:45,204 --> 01:07:46,450
So long, Eddie.

1064
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:54,670
- Mr. Marlowe?
- Mr. Marlowe?

1065
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,558
- Mrs. Rut...
- Mrs. Rut...

1066
01:07:57,815 --> 01:07:58,678
You better take it.

1067
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,353
Mrs. Rutledge asked if you'd
look her up before you went.

1068
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:02,965
She's at the center table.

1069
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:04,748
Thank you both.

1070
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,144
Mr. Marlowe? Mrs. Rutle...

1071
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:10,062
Mrs. Rutledge wants to see me.

1072
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:12,018
- How did you know?
- He told me.

1073
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,029
She sure is picking them tonight.
She won eight bets in a row.

1074
01:08:15,222 --> 01:08:18,003
- I didn't hear him tell you anything.
- He didn't.

1075
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:28,236
What kind of game is this?
Spin the wheel.

1076
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,250
I want another play.

1077
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:32,340
I'm sorry. You have
more than $ 14,000 there...

1078
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:33,960
...and the table cannot cover your bet!

1079
01:08:34,163 --> 01:08:35,659
It's your money.
Don't you want it back?

1080
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:36,876
I sent for Mr. Mars.

1081
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,449
- Look, lady, you know...
- Do you want to cover it?

1082
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:40,242
- Hello, Marlowe.
- Hello.

1083
01:08:42,804 --> 01:08:43,734
The lady.

1084
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:45,105
Something the matter,
Mrs. Rutledge?

1085
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:46,313
I'd like one more play.

1086
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:48,528
All this on the red.

1087
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:50,572
Cover her bet in even thousands.

1088
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,909
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone.

1089
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:55,692
Wish me luck, Marlowe.

1090
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,390
You wanted to see me.

1091
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,075
The people I came with want to stay...

1092
01:09:00,277 --> 01:09:02,991
...so I thought maybe you'd
like to drive me home.

1093
01:09:03,193 --> 01:09:05,072
- Sure.
- Are you ready, lady?

1094
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,470
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- So am I.

1095
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,246
Number five, red!

1096
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:29,748
You did all right.

1097
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,397
I'll get my car while you collect...

1098
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:32,846
...and meet you outside.

1099
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:42,289
Good night.

1100
01:11:01,912 --> 01:11:03,791
This is a gun, lady.
I want that money.

1101
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,095
Yell, and I'll cut you in half!

1102
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,543
Give me that bag!

1103
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:11,271
Hello, pal! Easy!

1104
01:11:12,049 --> 01:11:14,389
Somebody's always giving me guns.

1105
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:15,913
You can turn around now.

1106
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:20,469
I don't like people who play games.
Tell your boss...

1107
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,604
...when you wake up.

1108
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:29,004
I'm glad I asked you to take me home.

1109
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:30,615
So am I.

1110
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:32,265
Shall we go now?

1111
01:11:40,024 --> 01:11:42,872
Why are you trembling? Don't tell me
you were scared. I won't believe it.

1112
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:45,231
I'm not used to being hijacked.
Give me a little time.

1113
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,629
Hijacked? Is that what it was?

1114
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,134
What else?

1115
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:02,225
You're still shaking.
What's the matter?

1116
01:12:03,348 --> 01:12:05,994
You weren't worried about me?
Afraid I'd get hurt?

1117
01:12:06,608 --> 01:12:08,948
When did you begin to
feel that way about me?

1118
01:12:12,056 --> 01:12:13,609
Why are we stopping?

1119
01:12:13,811 --> 01:12:15,566
To settle something.

1120
01:12:16,592 --> 01:12:17,771
All right...

1121
01:12:18,328 --> 01:12:20,591
...let's begin with what
Eddie Mars has on you.

1122
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,892
If he had anything, would it be
any of your business?

1123
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:24,398
You've already been paid, haven't you?

1124
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,520
Yeah, by you.

1125
01:12:25,712 --> 01:12:28,943
- Are you after more money?
- I guess you've got a right to ask.

1126
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:33,039
No, I've already been well-paid.
I've got another reason.

1127
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,590
You like my father, don't you?

1128
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:36,913
Why don't you stop?

1129
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:40,529
Remember I said I was beginning
to like another Sternwood?

1130
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:43,722
- I wish you'd show it.
- That should be awful easy.

1131
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:54,214
I liked that.

1132
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,979
I'd like more.

1133
01:13:02,616 --> 01:13:04,140
That's even better.

1134
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,509
All right.

1135
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:09,741
Now that's settled.
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

1136
01:13:11,478 --> 01:13:13,098
- So that's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.

1137
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,081
I kissing you is all right.
I'd like to do more of it.

1138
01:13:16,273 --> 01:13:18,315
But first I want to find out
what Eddie Mars has on you.

1139
01:13:18,517 --> 01:13:20,521
- If you say that again...
- I'll keep saying it till I find out.

1140
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,656
I told Eddie Mars
I was coming up to see him.

1141
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:25,422
When I arrived, you were there.

1142
01:13:25,623 --> 01:13:27,627
You two staged an act.
He let you win a lot of money...

1143
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:29,718
...and then sent a man
to take it away from you...

1144
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,240
...to prove there was
nothing between you.

1145
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:33,995
You're shaking again.

1146
01:13:34,418 --> 01:13:35,348
Take me home.

1147
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,719
Sure I will.

1148
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:38,569
But first, open that bag.

1149
01:13:38,772 --> 01:13:41,840
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

1150
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:44,851
Open it and make a sap out of me
or else stop playing me for one.

1151
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:46,731
Take me home.

1152
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:49,004
All right, but that's as far
as I'll carry you.

1153
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:51,661
From now on, you can
take care of yourself.

1154
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:11,215
What does the hat check girl
get for a tip?

1155
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:14,256
I'm trying to think of something
appropriate. How'd you get in here?

1156
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:15,397
Bet you can't guess.

1157
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:16,710
I'll bet I can.

1158
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:18,610
You came in through the keyhole,
like Peter Pan.

1159
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:19,818
Who's he?

1160
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:22,023
A guy I used to know
around a poolroom.

1161
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:24,047
You're cute.

1162
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,417
I'm getting cuter every minute.
How did you get in?

1163
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:28,746
I showed the manager your card.
I stole it from Vivian.

1164
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:31,086
I told him you said
to come up and wait.

1165
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:32,429
I want...

1166
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,318
See, I remembered.

1167
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,754
What do you remember about Shawn Regan?

1168
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:38,797
- I didn't like him.
- Yeah, why?

1169
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:41,137
He didn't pay any more attention
to me than you do.

1170
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,854
Treated me like a baby all the time.

1171
01:14:43,727 --> 01:14:44,906
How's Eddie Mars treat you?

1172
01:14:45,329 --> 01:14:46,441
I don't know him.

1173
01:14:46,643 --> 01:14:48,810
You sure?
You know who he is, don't you?

1174
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:52,204
He's always calling Vivian up.
Why? Is he cute?

1175
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:55,628
I think you're telling the
truth, for a change.

1176
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:57,709
Is he as cute as you are?

1177
01:14:57,969 --> 01:14:59,148
Nobody is.

1178
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,354
I've had a long day.
You'd better be going.

1179
01:15:02,543 --> 01:15:04,403
- Come on, Carmen.
- I don't want to.

1180
01:15:10,513 --> 01:15:12,239
- You can't...
- Shut up!

1181
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:24,486
Hello, Phil?

1182
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,279
Hello, Bernie. What's up?

1183
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:27,862
I want to see you down here,
right away.

1184
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:29,837
I just woke up.
I haven't had breakfast.

1185
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:31,467
It's 2:00.

1186
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:34,383
If you're not here in 30 minutes
you'll be eating on the county.

1187
01:15:34,575 --> 01:15:38,257
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

1188
01:15:38,776 --> 01:15:40,943
All right, I'll be there.

1189
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:51,501
Don't you know better than to wake
a man at 2 p. m?

1190
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:53,459
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

1191
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:55,654
You're to lay off the Sternwood case.

1192
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:57,447
- Who says so?
- The DA

1193
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,758
The DA, huh?

1194
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,797
He must have changed his mind.

1195
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,223
Who changed it for him?

1196
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:08,716
- General Sternwood.
- Personally?

1197
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:11,785
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the general.

1198
01:16:11,987 --> 01:16:14,538
He talked to the daughter,
Mrs. Rutledge.

1199
01:16:15,699 --> 01:16:18,154
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

1200
01:16:18,355 --> 01:16:21,481
There's no law says a man can't
work on a case without a client.

1201
01:16:21,683 --> 01:16:22,862
You know, just to keep his hand in.

1202
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:24,943
I'm just supposed to
tell you to lay off.

1203
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:27,206
I know, you just work here.

1204
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,834
Put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

1205
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:32,970
A nice old guy has two daughters.
One of them is "wonderful. "

1206
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,696
The other is not so wonderful.

1207
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:36,625
As a result, somebody gets
something on her.

1208
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:38,198
The father hires me to pay off...

1209
01:16:38,389 --> 01:16:40,278
...but before I can,
the family chauffeur kills him.

1210
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:41,899
But that didn't stop things.

1211
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:43,338
It just starts them.

1212
01:16:43,539 --> 01:16:46,732
And two murders later, I find out
somebody's got something on "Wonderful. "

1213
01:16:46,934 --> 01:16:47,979
Who's somebody?

1214
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:50,070
- I think it's Eddie Mars.
- Why?

1215
01:16:50,262 --> 01:16:52,362
For one thing, he owns the house
Geiger was killed in.

1216
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:56,869
He did. The day after the murder,
he transfers the deed to a dummy.

1217
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,785
What have you got that hooks
Mars up with Mrs. Rutledge?

1218
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:01,579
Last night, the two of them...

1219
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,985
...I don't want to bore you
with the whole story...

1220
01:17:04,178 --> 01:17:06,633
...but they went to the moon to prove
there was nothing between them.

1221
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:09,317
I think there is, and it's got
something to do with Shawn Regan.

1222
01:17:09,903 --> 01:17:13,134
Who's missing and supposed to have
run off with Eddie Mars' wife?

1223
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:15,437
What does the general
think about all this?

1224
01:17:15,638 --> 01:17:18,793
I don't know.
"Wonderful" won't let me get to him.

1225
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:20,232
You still want me to lay off?

1226
01:17:21,038 --> 01:17:25,420
The DA does, but you do all
right following your own hunches.

1227
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:27,242
Thanks, Bernie.

1228
01:17:27,636 --> 01:17:29,841
I'm going out to get breakfast.
You want a cup of coffee?

1229
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:32,593
I can't afford to be seen with you.

1230
01:17:34,004 --> 01:17:35,413
So long, Bernie.

1231
01:18:02,574 --> 01:18:03,475
Sternwood residence.

1232
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:05,738
Hello, Norris? This is Marlowe.

1233
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:06,918
Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...

1234
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:09,574
I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

1235
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:11,684
I don't think it
would be possible tonight.

1236
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:14,504
- Why not?
- I've been trying to call you.

1237
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,160
Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.

1238
01:18:17,362 --> 01:18:20,181
If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.

1239
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:23,624
Hey, sugar, you got a match?

1240
01:18:23,826 --> 01:18:25,139
Sure thing.

1241
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:28,362
Hello, Marlowe?

1242
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:30,856
Thanks.

1243
01:18:33,493 --> 01:18:34,864
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

1244
01:18:35,056 --> 01:18:38,124
I wanted to tell you
you can stop worrying...

1245
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:40,838
...and call off your bloodhounds.
We found Shawn.

1246
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,085
What's that?
You've found Shawn?

1247
01:18:42,287 --> 01:18:43,850
Yes. He's been in Mexico.

1248
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,231
He hasn't been very well.

1249
01:18:45,423 --> 01:18:46,410
What happened?

1250
01:18:46,612 --> 01:18:49,163
An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.

1251
01:18:49,365 --> 01:18:51,052
I'm leaving at once to meet him.

1252
01:18:51,254 --> 01:18:52,328
I see.

1253
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,860
I suppose the general's quite pleased.

1254
01:18:55,215 --> 01:18:57,967
We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.

1255
01:18:58,294 --> 01:19:00,077
Thanks for telling me.

1256
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,487
Have a nice trip.

1257
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,501
I will. Goodbye.

1258
01:19:03,703 --> 01:19:05,074
Goodbye.

1259
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:38,956
Say, mister...

1260
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:40,097
...would you please...

1261
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,829
This is just our way
of saying, "Lay off. "

1262
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:29,325
You the guy that's been tailing me?

1263
01:20:29,517 --> 01:20:32,010
Yeah. My name's Jones.
Harry Jones.

1264
01:20:32,212 --> 01:20:33,286
I want to see you.

1265
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:34,829
Swell!

1266
01:20:35,693 --> 01:20:37,553
Did you want to see those guys jump me?

1267
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:39,913
I didn't care one way or the other.

1268
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,885
You could've yelled for help.

1269
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:46,568
A guy's playing a hand, I let him
play it. I'm no kibitzer.

1270
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,675
You got brains.

1271
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:51,526
Get my hat, will you?

1272
01:20:53,589 --> 01:20:55,439
Help me up to my office.

1273
01:21:12,213 --> 01:21:14,696
That working over they gave you
was the best I've seen.

1274
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:16,682
And I've been around too.

1275
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,763
Used to run a little liquor.

1276
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:21,381
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

1277
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:23,558
- Tough racket.
- Terrible!

1278
01:21:24,019 --> 01:21:25,476
Sit down. You make me nervous.

1279
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:27,106
Maybe you don't believe me.

1280
01:21:27,798 --> 01:21:29,006
What do you want?

1281
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:30,348
That's better.

1282
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,921
I've got something to sell, cheap.

1283
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,292
For a couple of C's.

1284
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:35,019
Don't let me stop you.

1285
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:38,213
- Don't you want to even know who I am?
- I already know.

1286
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:39,660
You're not a cop.

1287
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,097
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

1288
01:21:42,289 --> 01:21:44,590
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

1289
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:46,508
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

1290
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,234
How'd you know that?

1291
01:21:48,494 --> 01:21:51,371
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

1292
01:21:51,601 --> 01:21:52,972
She's too big for you.

1293
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:55,111
That's a dirty crack, brother.

1294
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:57,489
I suppose you're right.

1295
01:22:00,434 --> 01:22:02,889
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

1296
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,066
Cut the babble.
What do you want?

1297
01:22:05,363 --> 01:22:07,050
If you're looking for something,
will you pay for it?

1298
01:22:07,252 --> 01:22:08,872
- If it does what?
- Helps you find Regan.

1299
01:22:10,197 --> 01:22:11,175
This is getting funny.

1300
01:22:11,376 --> 01:22:14,723
I'm supposed to pay you two C's for
telling me I'm looking for Regan.

1301
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:16,651
People have been
telling me that for days.

1302
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:18,760
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

1303
01:22:19,029 --> 01:22:20,745
Do you want to know what I've got,
or don't you?

1304
01:22:20,947 --> 01:22:22,184
I don't know.

1305
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:25,253
200 buys a lot of
information in my circle.

1306
01:22:25,455 --> 01:22:27,756
Would you pay it to know
where Eddie Mars' wife is?

1307
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:30,220
Would you pay $ 200 for that, shamus?

1308
01:22:30,643 --> 01:22:31,947
I think I might.

1309
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:33,798
- Where?
- Agnes found her.

1310
01:22:34,192 --> 01:22:37,193
She'll tell you, when she has
the dough in her hand.

1311
01:22:37,615 --> 01:22:39,274
You might tell the cops for nothing.

1312
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:41,029
I ain't so brittle.

1313
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:42,986
Agnes must have something
I didn't notice.

1314
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:44,999
I ain't tried to pull anything.

1315
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:47,847
I came here with a straight
proposition. Take it or leave it.

1316
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,574
One right guy to another.

1317
01:22:49,776 --> 01:22:53,353
You start waving cops at me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1318
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:54,820
I am.

1319
01:22:55,089 --> 01:22:56,268
200 it is.

1320
01:22:56,691 --> 01:22:58,350
- Have you got the money?
- Where's Agnes?

1321
01:22:58,542 --> 01:23:01,035
You know Puss Walgreen's office?
Fulwider Building?

1322
01:23:01,236 --> 01:23:02,693
428 in the back?

1323
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:04,363
No, but I can find it.

1324
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:06,386
Will you be in shape to meet
me there in an hour?

1325
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:08,102
- I guess so.
- You bring the dough.

1326
01:23:08,305 --> 01:23:09,235
I'll take you to Agnes.

1327
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:54,510
Who are you?
What do you want?

1328
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,415
I wanted to see you.

1329
01:24:04,178 --> 01:24:05,002
Who are you?

1330
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:08,071
I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

1331
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:09,519
Canino?

1332
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:13,921
- Sure!
- I thought you would remember.

1333
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:14,957
What do you want?

1334
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:17,383
Why have you been following
that detective, Marlowe?

1335
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:18,630
- Who says I've been?
- I do!

1336
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:22,342
That was a mistake, your mistake.
Eddie Mars don't like it.

1337
01:24:22,543 --> 01:24:26,120
Sit down and quit stalling!
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

1338
01:24:26,322 --> 01:24:29,515
All right, there's no harm telling.
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

1339
01:24:29,707 --> 01:24:31,625
She's got to get out of town,
that takes dough.

1340
01:24:31,827 --> 01:24:33,284
She figured she could
get it through Marlowe.

1341
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:34,982
Why would he pay?

1342
01:24:35,184 --> 01:24:37,351
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody?

1343
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:39,527
The young Sternwood girl was there.

1344
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,186
Only Marlowe didn't tell the cops that.

1345
01:24:42,252 --> 01:24:44,841
Agnes figured it was railroad fare
as soon as she could get hold of him.

1346
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,662
- You get it?
- Sure I get it.

1347
01:24:46,865 --> 01:24:48,840
- Where's this Agnes?
- What do you care?

1348
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:51,055
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

1349
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:52,292
What's the matter, Jones?

1350
01:24:52,494 --> 01:24:54,920
Ain't you ever seen a gun before?
Where's the girl?

1351
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:57,874
You want me to count to three,
like a movie?

1352
01:24:58,124 --> 01:24:59,552
Where's Agnes?

1353
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:02,314
You win.

1354
01:25:02,545 --> 01:25:03,973
She's in an apartment...

1355
01:25:04,175 --> 01:25:05,997
...at 28 Court Street.

1356
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:09,287
Apartment 301.

1357
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:11,272
I guess I'm yellow, all right.

1358
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,611
You just got good sense.

1359
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:17,227
I ain't going to hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

1360
01:25:18,005 --> 01:25:18,944
You're nervous, ain't you?

1361
01:25:19,501 --> 01:25:21,802
- I think maybe you need a drink.
- I don't think so...

1362
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:23,461
You got a glass?

1363
01:25:25,936 --> 01:25:26,914
At the water cooler.

1364
01:25:41,616 --> 01:25:44,425
There you are, pal.
Drink her down.

1365
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:46,439
Well, drink it!

1366
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,655
What do you think it is, poison?

1367
01:25:48,972 --> 01:25:51,110
I bet that Agnes of yours
wouldn't turn it down.

1368
01:25:51,983 --> 01:25:53,709
No, I'll bet she wouldn't.

1369
01:26:01,075 --> 01:26:02,312
What's funny?

1370
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:05,505
Nothing's funny.

1371
01:26:07,059 --> 01:26:08,612
So long, Jonesy.

1372
01:26:41,556 --> 01:26:45,478
Information, give me the phone number
of apartment 301, 28 Court Street.

1373
01:26:45,804 --> 01:26:47,338
Thank you. One moment, please.

1374
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:49,966
Courtview Apartments.

1375
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:52,872
Office, this is Police Identification
Bureau, Wallace speaking.

1376
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:55,653
You got a girl living there
named Agnes Lowzier?

1377
01:26:55,855 --> 01:26:57,705
Nobody by that name here.

1378
01:26:57,965 --> 01:27:00,352
Have you got a brunette with
green eyes, kind of slanted...

1379
01:27:00,564 --> 01:27:04,169
...either alone or with a little guy,
weighs about 115 pounds...

1380
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:06,471
...wears a gray hat and gray suit?

1381
01:27:06,673 --> 01:27:08,523
Sorry. Nothing like that.

1382
01:27:09,742 --> 01:27:12,398
Somebody just gave out
the wrong address.

1383
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:13,836
Thanks.

1384
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,791
You did all right, Jonesy.

1385
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:37,487
But you left me high and dry.

1386
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:52,514
Who is this?

1387
01:27:52,716 --> 01:27:55,084
- What did you say?
- I said, "Who is this?"

1388
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,348
Hello, Agnes. This is Marlowe.

1389
01:27:57,741 --> 01:27:59,496
Marlowe, the man you want to see.

1390
01:27:59,698 --> 01:28:01,222
Is Harry there?

1391
01:28:02,096 --> 01:28:03,112
Yeah, he's here.

1392
01:28:03,313 --> 01:28:05,643
- Put him on, will you?
- He can't talk to you.

1393
01:28:05,836 --> 01:28:07,878
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

1394
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:11,532
Your little man died to keep
you out of trouble.

1395
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,026
I got your money for you.
Do you want it?

1396
01:28:14,227 --> 01:28:16,135
- Yeah, I want it.
- Have you got a car?

1397
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:17,507
Where can I meet you?

1398
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:19,041
Rampart and Oakwood.

1399
01:28:19,243 --> 01:28:21,151
I'll be there in half an hour.

1400
01:28:39,344 --> 01:28:41,070
What happened to Harry?

1401
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,322
There's no use going into that.
You don't really care anyway.

1402
01:28:44,523 --> 01:28:46,910
Just put it down your little man
deserved something better.

1403
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:48,579
Here you are. Here's your 200.

1404
01:28:50,795 --> 01:28:53,768
Joe and I were riding on Foothill
Boulevard a couple of weeks ago.

1405
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,425
We passed a brown coupe and I saw
the girl who was driving.

1406
01:28:56,626 --> 01:28:58,083
She was Eddie Mars' wife.

1407
01:28:58,285 --> 01:29:00,557
- There was a fellow with her. Canino.
- I know him.

1408
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:03,684
Some people you don't forget,
even if you've only seen them once.

1409
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:07,233
We got curious and Joe tailed them.
Do you know where Realito is?

1410
01:29:07,435 --> 01:29:09,736
About 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

1411
01:29:09,938 --> 01:29:12,105
Off the highway, there's
a garage and paint shop...

1412
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:13,381
...run by a guy named Art Huck.

1413
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:16,612
Hot-car drop, likely.
And a frame house right behind it.

1414
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:18,185
That's where Eddie Mars' wife
is holed up.

1415
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:20,170
- You sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

1416
01:29:20,362 --> 01:29:23,430
Art Huck's, 10 miles east of Realito.
Is that right?

1417
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:26,183
So long, copper. Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.

1418
01:29:26,385 --> 01:29:28,590
Hey, your kind always does.

1419
01:31:08,014 --> 01:31:08,963
What do you want?

1420
01:31:09,165 --> 01:31:11,620
Open up. I got a flat
back here on the highway.

1421
01:31:11,822 --> 01:31:13,413
Sorry, mister.
We're closed for the night.

1422
01:31:13,615 --> 01:31:15,552
Better try Realito.

1423
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:27,818
All right.

1424
01:31:28,106 --> 01:31:29,534
Come on in.

1425
01:31:32,009 --> 01:31:33,869
You'd scare off
a lot of trade with that.

1426
01:31:34,062 --> 01:31:36,066
You can get yourself hurt,
kicking on doors.

1427
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:37,254
Cut it out, Art.

1428
01:31:37,514 --> 01:31:38,664
The guy's right.

1429
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:40,141
You run a garage, don't you?

1430
01:31:40,717 --> 01:31:42,826
Go ahead. Give him a hand.

1431
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:45,387
Thanks, mister.

1432
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:48,428
I suppose you can fix flats?

1433
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,919
Good as you can make them, but
I'm busy working on a spray job.

1434
01:31:52,111 --> 01:31:53,837
It's too damp for a
good spray job, Art.

1435
01:31:54,249 --> 01:31:55,850
You got time to fix his tires.

1436
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,260
- But I don't...
- Get moving!

1437
01:31:58,066 --> 01:31:59,005
Sure.

1438
01:31:59,217 --> 01:32:00,770
Here's the key to the back.

1439
01:32:00,972 --> 01:32:03,206
Put the spare on.
That'll make it easier.

1440
01:32:07,887 --> 01:32:10,217
Yeah, I took a skid up at the corner.

1441
01:32:10,409 --> 01:32:13,573
A front tire went.
Lucky to find some help.

1442
01:32:14,284 --> 01:32:16,010
You live around here?

1443
01:32:16,528 --> 01:32:18,829
Just drove in from Reno
and Carson City.

1444
01:32:19,338 --> 01:32:21,994
Came the long way around, huh?
Business trip?

1445
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,046
Partly.

1446
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,539
Having your car painted?

1447
01:32:26,732 --> 01:32:28,295
Just a spray job.

1448
01:32:28,496 --> 01:32:31,238
Art's pretty slow.
He should've been finished by now.

1449
01:32:32,745 --> 01:32:33,761
All right, Art.

1450
01:32:34,289 --> 01:32:36,197
Take him in the house.

1451
01:33:05,036 --> 01:33:06,445
You'd be Mrs. Eddie Mars...

1452
01:33:06,637 --> 01:33:09,226
...the blonde Regan was
supposed to have run off with.

1453
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:10,760
That's right.

1454
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:14,309
Where is Shawn Regan?

1455
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:16,611
I'd like to know that myself.

1456
01:33:19,114 --> 01:33:20,542
Hello, angel!

1457
01:33:20,745 --> 01:33:23,017
I thought I'd find you here.

1458
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,798
But you don't seem to be
running in front today.

1459
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:31,371
Remove that light, will you,
or move me?

1460
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:41,152
I suppose we're in the house,
in back of the garage.

1461
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:42,629
That's right.

1462
01:33:44,433 --> 01:33:47,214
The boys don't take
any chances, do they?

1463
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:49,065
Where are they,
out digging a grave?

1464
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:51,108
You had to go on with this,
didn't you?

1465
01:33:51,434 --> 01:33:53,639
- Where are they?
- They've gone to telephone.

1466
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:57,063
To call up Eddie Mars, huh?
To find out what to do with me.

1467
01:33:57,322 --> 01:33:58,472
I could've told them that.

1468
01:33:58,895 --> 01:34:00,237
Why did you have to go on?

1469
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,530
Too many people told me to stop.

1470
01:34:02,894 --> 01:34:05,349
Light me a cigarette,
will you, angel?

1471
01:34:05,551 --> 01:34:07,210
Why did you have to make trouble?

1472
01:34:07,565 --> 01:34:09,358
Eddie never did you any harm.

1473
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,935
Besides, I was never in love with
Shawn. We were just good friends.

1474
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:14,853
If I hadn't hidden here
when Shawn disappeared...

1475
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:16,963
...the police would've been
certain he killed him.

1476
01:34:17,165 --> 01:34:18,536
Maybe he did kill him.

1477
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:20,291
Eddie's not that kind.

1478
01:34:20,493 --> 01:34:22,765
You mean, Eddie Mars
never kills anybody?

1479
01:34:23,696 --> 01:34:25,863
- You really believe that, don't you?
- Yes, I do!

1480
01:34:28,433 --> 01:34:29,708
How do you suppose
I found out you were here?

1481
01:34:29,901 --> 01:34:30,792
How did you?

1482
01:34:30,984 --> 01:34:33,410
A little man named
Harry Jones told me.

1483
01:34:33,612 --> 01:34:36,095
A funny little guy, harmless.
I liked him.

1484
01:34:36,298 --> 01:34:38,503
He sold me the information
because he found out...

1485
01:34:38,705 --> 01:34:40,191
...I was working for General Sternwood.

1486
01:34:40,393 --> 01:34:43,078
How he found out's a long story.

1487
01:34:43,337 --> 01:34:46,751
Anyway, Canino, your husband's
hired man, got to him first...

1488
01:34:46,952 --> 01:34:48,265
...while I stood around like a sap.

1489
01:34:48,592 --> 01:34:51,900
I was in the next room.
Now that little man is dead.

1490
01:34:52,112 --> 01:34:54,145
- But Eddie Mars didn't do that.
- You're lying.

1491
01:34:54,347 --> 01:34:57,281
Eddie Mars never kills anybody.
He just hires it done.

1492
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:59,142
You think he's just a gambler,
don't you?

1493
01:34:59,343 --> 01:35:01,510
I think he's a blackmailer,
a hot-car broker.

1494
01:35:01,712 --> 01:35:04,426
- Stop talking!
- A killer by remote control.

1495
01:35:04,618 --> 01:35:06,526
Anything with money pinned to it!
Anything rotten!

1496
01:35:08,617 --> 01:35:10,410
Ask him when you see him.

1497
01:35:12,328 --> 01:35:13,756
Well, that got rid of her.

1498
01:35:13,968 --> 01:35:15,790
She's okay. I like her.

1499
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:17,861
You like too many people.

1500
01:35:18,064 --> 01:35:20,394
Never mind, angel.
The water feels good.

1501
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,942
I wonder if you'd do
what she did for a man.

1502
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,157
I was wondering that myself.

1503
01:35:27,146 --> 01:35:29,994
There's nothing to do but
wait for Canino to come back.

1504
01:35:30,186 --> 01:35:32,132
He doesn't know
I was in the other room.

1505
01:35:32,334 --> 01:35:34,501
You know what he'll do
when he finds out?

1506
01:35:34,703 --> 01:35:37,867
He'll beat my teeth out and then
kick me in the stomach for mumbling.

1507
01:35:38,059 --> 01:35:39,718
That's just a start.
It won't be pretty.

1508
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,195
Please don't talk like that!

1509
01:35:41,387 --> 01:35:42,250
You should have gone to Mexico...

1510
01:35:42,442 --> 01:35:43,305
Stop! Please!

1511
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:45,319
Then, you couldn't have gone,
could you?

1512
01:35:45,521 --> 01:35:47,304
The border patrol would've
checked you through alone.

1513
01:35:48,043 --> 01:35:49,510
Too many people would've
seen you without Regan.

1514
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:52,675
It was much safer to come here with her,
especially for Eddie Mars.

1515
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,300
Will you get out of this
and stay out if I let you go?

1516
01:35:58,698 --> 01:36:00,194
Take this thing out of
my mouth, will you?

1517
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:17,543
That's better.

1518
01:36:18,157 --> 01:36:19,461
Get a knife and cut these ropes.

1519
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,376
Watch your fingers.

1520
01:36:38,795 --> 01:36:40,550
Don't cut toward your hand.

1521
01:36:44,108 --> 01:36:45,124
Who's got a key to these handcuffs?

1522
01:36:45,326 --> 01:36:46,534
Canino.

1523
01:36:46,736 --> 01:36:47,848
I don't suppose there's a gun
around here?

1524
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,862
None that I know of.

1525
01:36:59,472 --> 01:37:01,505
The boys made a fast trip.

1526
01:37:02,378 --> 01:37:03,874
What can you do?

1527
01:37:05,485 --> 01:37:08,103
Look, angel. I'm going to
leave you in a tough spot.

1528
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:09,244
That's all right with me.

1529
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,968
- How do I get out of here?
- That door leads onto a side porch.

1530
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,992
All right, as soon as I've gone,
you count to 20 slowly...

1531
01:37:14,184 --> 01:37:15,593
...and then scream your head off.
- I will!

1532
01:37:16,811 --> 01:37:18,815
All right. Start counting.

1533
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:50,665
Get going, Art.
You heard what I said!

1534
01:39:08,136 --> 01:39:09,699
There! Behind the wheel!

1535
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:13,248
Over here, Canino!

1536
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:33,829
That looks like the key.

1537
01:39:38,183 --> 01:39:40,455
We'll have to take his car.

1538
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:54,783
How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

1539
01:39:54,985 --> 01:39:57,162
About eight or 10 miles to Realito.
Why?

1540
01:39:57,613 --> 01:40:00,461
When Mars' wife gets my car fixed,
and he finds out what happened...

1541
01:40:00,682 --> 01:40:01,794
...there'll be plenty of trouble.

1542
01:40:02,255 --> 01:40:04,134
You'll be in it
just as much as I will.

1543
01:40:04,336 --> 01:40:06,119
I don't mind,
as long as you're around.

1544
01:40:08,488 --> 01:40:11,010
I didn't have a chance to thank you
for what you did back there.

1545
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:12,775
You looked good, awful good!

1546
01:40:13,389 --> 01:40:15,652
I didn't know they made them
like that anymore.

1547
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:17,378
I guess I'm in love with you.

1548
01:40:20,812 --> 01:40:22,634
Will you go to the police with me?

1549
01:40:22,893 --> 01:40:23,967
I can't.

1550
01:40:24,169 --> 01:40:25,415
Why not?

1551
01:40:26,087 --> 01:40:28,542
What if I told you
I killed Shawn Regan?

1552
01:40:28,743 --> 01:40:30,632
Would you tell the police that?

1553
01:40:31,534 --> 01:40:33,384
I will if you take me there.

1554
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:36,923
I'm not going to.

1555
01:40:37,135 --> 01:40:39,168
Look, angel, I'm tired.

1556
01:40:39,532 --> 01:40:41,987
My jaw hurts, my ribs ache,
I killed a man back there...

1557
01:40:42,189 --> 01:40:44,931
...and stood by while a
harmless guy was killed.

1558
01:40:45,133 --> 01:40:46,245
I can't say all that happened...

1559
01:40:46,447 --> 01:40:48,863
...because Geiger tried to throw
a loop over Carmen.

1560
01:40:49,065 --> 01:40:50,311
They'll swarm over your house...

1561
01:40:50,504 --> 01:40:52,517
...so fast that every closet
your family's been in...

1562
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:55,615
...for the last six years
will look like a police convention.

1563
01:40:56,392 --> 01:40:57,916
They'll all ask the same question:

1564
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,431
"Where's Shawn Regan?

1565
01:40:59,624 --> 01:41:02,309
Why did Mars hide his wife out to make
it look like she ran off with Regan?"

1566
01:41:02,511 --> 01:41:05,407
Why did you hide out there?
You're playing with dynamite.

1567
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:07,746
Don't ask any more questions.

1568
01:41:08,198 --> 01:41:10,566
I won't even ask you
how you got into this mess.

1569
01:41:10,758 --> 01:41:13,030
I'll ask Eddie Mars
if I can get there quick enough.

1570
01:41:13,223 --> 01:41:14,536
Why are you doing that?

1571
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:17,471
I guess I'm in love with you.

1572
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,021
Hello. Let me talk to Mr. Mars.

1573
01:42:01,702 --> 01:42:04,387
Hello, Eddie.
This is Marlowe.

1574
01:42:05,126 --> 01:42:06,890
Yeah, Marlowe,
or what's left of him.

1575
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:08,972
That Canino's a pretty good boy.

1576
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:11,551
You'll have trouble getting
another as good.

1577
01:42:12,261 --> 01:42:14,236
What's the matter, Eddie?
Can't you talk?

1578
01:42:14,985 --> 01:42:17,286
I'm in Realito, the same
place Canino called from.

1579
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:19,272
Only now, it's me that's calling.

1580
01:42:19,464 --> 01:42:20,892
I want to see you.

1581
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:25,725
Why don't you go to the police?
I just killed your best boy.

1582
01:42:25,966 --> 01:42:27,078
Do you want to see me
or don't you?

1583
01:42:28,843 --> 01:42:29,821
All right. Where?

1584
01:42:31,624 --> 01:42:34,654
Las Olindas is too far.
Not your apartment either.

1585
01:42:36,007 --> 01:42:36,870
Your house?

1586
01:42:37,062 --> 01:42:39,459
You mean the one that Geiger lived in?

1587
01:42:40,553 --> 01:42:41,866
All right. When?

1588
01:42:43,564 --> 01:42:45,453
How long will it take me
to get there?

1589
01:42:46,892 --> 01:42:48,992
I'll be there just as quick as I can.

1590
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:53,020
- That worked.
- You're taking an awful chance.

1591
01:42:53,222 --> 01:42:54,919
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

1592
01:42:56,396 --> 01:42:58,812
Go through there, and make sure that
back door is locked...

1593
01:42:59,014 --> 01:43:01,833
...and then close all these curtains.
I'll get rid of the car.

1594
01:43:12,968 --> 01:43:14,857
You're the one who's shaking now.

1595
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:17,600
I'm scared, angel.

1596
01:43:17,802 --> 01:43:19,461
I'm sore too.

1597
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:22,827
Mars has been ahead of me
all the way. Way ahead!

1598
01:43:23,086 --> 01:43:26,241
If I don't get the jump on him
this time, we're cooked.

1599
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:40,482
There they are.

1600
01:43:43,821 --> 01:43:45,163
Watch the back.

1601
01:43:45,355 --> 01:43:47,973
If you see anybody coming,
yell like you did before.

1602
01:44:01,352 --> 01:44:03,145
- What is it?
- The curtain! Stop it swinging.

1603
01:44:50,953 --> 01:44:53,225
I got here first, Eddie.
Put those scissors down.

1604
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:54,760
Put them down!

1605
01:44:58,347 --> 01:44:59,555
Turn around.

1606
01:45:07,429 --> 01:45:08,810
Over there.

1607
01:45:17,509 --> 01:45:18,937
Sit down.

1608
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,617
There's two men out in back,
behind some trees.

1609
01:45:23,819 --> 01:45:25,957
- Watch them.
- Hello, Mr. Mars.

1610
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:28,422
- You double-crossing...
- I told you to sit down.

1611
01:45:31,597 --> 01:45:34,080
And leave her out of it.
She's all right, Eddie.

1612
01:45:34,282 --> 01:45:36,650
She kept her deal with you.
She didn't tell me a thing...

1613
01:45:36,843 --> 01:45:39,230
...except that she killed Regan.
But I didn't believe that.

1614
01:45:39,461 --> 01:45:41,321
Regan's dead, all right,
but she didn't do it.

1615
01:45:41,513 --> 01:45:42,759
It was Carmen, wasn't it?

1616
01:45:43,144 --> 01:45:44,035
How'd it happen?

1617
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:46,500
- She didn't tell..?
- I asked you how it happened.

1618
01:45:46,692 --> 01:45:49,511
- Carmen liked Regan.
- But he liked your wife.

1619
01:45:49,704 --> 01:45:51,267
And he said no to Carmen.

1620
01:45:51,468 --> 01:45:54,978
She gets mad when anybody says that.
I've seen her that way. Go on.

1621
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:58,143
She was high. By the time it was over,
she couldn't remember much about it.

1622
01:45:58,344 --> 01:45:59,590
I've seen her that way too.

1623
01:46:00,138 --> 01:46:02,027
- Then you hid the body.
- You can't prove that.

1624
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:04,319
It'll be just as bad for you
if I prove it to myself.

1625
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:05,978
Then you started to blackmail
Mrs. Rutledge...

1626
01:46:06,189 --> 01:46:08,356
...by telling her what Carmen had done.

1627
01:46:08,549 --> 01:46:10,754
How did you prove to her
that Carmen had done it?

1628
01:46:10,956 --> 01:46:12,030
Prove it to me.

1629
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:13,602
You've seen Carmen when she's that way.

1630
01:46:13,804 --> 01:46:15,357
Sure I have. Have you?

1631
01:46:16,077 --> 01:46:18,464
Why didn't you know her
when you walked in that day?

1632
01:46:18,954 --> 01:46:21,735
You're pretty smart,
but I've been waiting for this one.

1633
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,449
What are you going to do?

1634
01:46:24,651 --> 01:46:26,818
I said you were smart.
You walked in without a gun.

1635
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:29,475
You were going to agree to everything,
just like you're doing now.

1636
01:46:29,676 --> 01:46:31,133
When I went out,
things would be different.

1637
01:46:31,335 --> 01:46:33,790
That's what those boys
are doing out there.

1638
01:46:33,992 --> 01:46:36,581
But everything's changed now,
because I got here first.

1639
01:46:36,773 --> 01:46:37,990
Angel, get on the floor!

1640
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:39,842
Don't get excited, Marlowe.

1641
01:46:40,043 --> 01:46:42,785
If anything happens,
if there's any shooting, you'll just...

1642
01:46:43,179 --> 01:46:45,988
What do you think will happen now?
What will your boys think?

1643
01:46:46,181 --> 01:46:48,607
What will they do to
the first one out that door?

1644
01:46:48,809 --> 01:46:49,988
Who's it going to be, you or me?

1645
01:46:50,315 --> 01:46:52,002
- Look, Marlowe...
- You look at this!

1646
01:46:52,204 --> 01:46:53,690
Haven't you ever seen a gun before?

1647
01:46:54,314 --> 01:46:56,040
You want me to count to three,
like they do in the movies?

1648
01:46:56,232 --> 01:46:57,756
That's what Canino said
to little Jonesy.

1649
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,780
- Don't go crazy!
- Jonesy took it better than you.

1650
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:02,216
- That's one, Eddie!
- Don't, Marlowe!

1651
01:47:03,204 --> 01:47:04,700
That's two, Eddie!

1652
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,270
Don't shoot, it's me! Mars!

1653
01:47:49,478 --> 01:47:52,230
Bernie? This is Marlowe.

1654
01:47:52,777 --> 01:47:54,627
I've got some more red points for you.

1655
01:47:54,829 --> 01:47:57,188
- Who is it this time?
- Eddie Mars.

1656
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,761
His boys got him.

1657
01:47:58,953 --> 01:48:01,283
There's more to it than that.
He killed Regan.

1658
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:02,760
I'll tell you about it when I see you.

1659
01:48:02,952 --> 01:48:03,930
Where are you?

1660
01:48:04,132 --> 01:48:07,555
The same place, Laverne Terrace.
Come up and get me out of here.

1661
01:48:07,757 --> 01:48:10,173
And watch yourself.
They may still be outside.

1662
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:11,583
Right away.

1663
01:48:19,783 --> 01:48:20,866
It won't take him long.

1664
01:48:21,068 --> 01:48:22,659
Wait, let me do the talking.

1665
01:48:23,753 --> 01:48:27,426
I don't know what I'll tell him,
but it'll be pretty close to the truth.

1666
01:48:28,549 --> 01:48:30,304
You'll have to send Carmen away...

1667
01:48:30,505 --> 01:48:32,096
...from a lot of things.

1668
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:34,081
They have places for that.

1669
01:48:34,284 --> 01:48:36,835
Maybe they can cure her.
It's been done before.

1670
01:48:37,832 --> 01:48:41,131
We'll have to tell your father
about Regan. I think he can take it.

1671
01:48:41,994 --> 01:48:43,816
You've forgotten one thing.

1672
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:45,763
Me.

1673
01:48:49,158 --> 01:48:50,654
What's wrong with you?

1674
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,858
Nothing you can't fix.
