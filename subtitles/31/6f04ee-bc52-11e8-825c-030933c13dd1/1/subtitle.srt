1
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,557
Hey, watch it.

2
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,413
Oh, come on.

3
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,717
Hey, Mike!

4
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,519
- Hey, Larry.
- How you doing?

5
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,888
Have you seen Nicky?

6
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,622
I'm pretty sure he went home with Erica.
It was half day today.

7
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,993
Parent Career Day.

8
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,364
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on in.

9
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,569
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

10
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,037
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

11
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,479
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

12
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,445
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

13
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,954
There he is. How are you, Larry?

14
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,149
Good. How are you doing, Don?

15
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,494
Good.

16
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,326
Can you believe this weather?

17
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:31,299
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

18
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,838
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

19
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,207
Great. Great, that's great.
Yeah, thanks.

20
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,013
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

21
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,515
- Stop it.
- What?

22
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,621
What? No, it's like he's the...

23
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,450
...Batman of stockbrokers.

24
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,593
- Bond trader.
- Bond trader. Sorry.

25
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,130
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

26
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,359
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up with the idea.

27
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,765
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

28
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,372
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

29
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,034
Oh, no, Larry.
You didn't get evicted again, did you?

30
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,308
I didn't...

31
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,473
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't...

32
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,677
- No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like...
- Larry, listen to me.

33
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,719
I don't know how much more
this Nicky can take.

34
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,518
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

35
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,958
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

36
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,825
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

37
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,523
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

38
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,796
You know...

39
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,469
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

40
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,206
- What?
- Just until you get really settled.

41
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,775
Hey, Dad.

42
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,011
- Hey, ready to carve it up?
- Cool.

43
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,489
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

44
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,225
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

45
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,765
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

46
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,375
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

47
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,376
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

48
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,707
- Cool, thanks.
- All right, man.

49
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:28,819
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

50
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,118
Game on!

51
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,849
I'm good.

52
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,290
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

53
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,953
Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility.

54
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,465
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

55
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,732
- All right. What do you wanna be?
- A bond trader.

56
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,836
A bond trader?

57
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,945
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

58
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,078
That's cool.

59
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,911
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

60
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,952
Like an automaton robot?

61
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,822
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

62
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,319
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

63
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,395
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

64
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,692
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

65
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,630
Your fallback?

66
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,567
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

67
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,674
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

68
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,902
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

69
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,443
She called them schemes?

70
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,514
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

71
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,184
Are you really moving again?

72
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,556
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

73
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,161
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

74
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,924
- Yeah.
- Hey.

75
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,795
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

76
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,467
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

77
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,869
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

78
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,805
...and that's been hard for you.

79
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,907
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

80
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,072
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,512
What if you're wrong...

82
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,280
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

83
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,292
All right, well...

84
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,700
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

85
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,834
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

86
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,578
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

87
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,480
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

88
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,782
All right.

89
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,555
That wasn't a compliment.

90
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,024
It says here you were the CEO...

91
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,720
...of Snaptime Industries.

92
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,422
Care to elaborate on that?

93
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,536
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

94
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,231
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

95
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,036
Didn't they already make that?

96
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,975
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

97
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,776
...stole a bit of our thunder.

98
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,352
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

99
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,921
You know, whatever, but...

100
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,392
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

101
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,555
...snapping.
- Clapping's easier.

102
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,492
Debatable.

103
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,665
I can't help you.

104
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,632
Debbie?

105
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,569
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

106
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,039
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

107
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,576
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

108
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,675
I didn't feel a connection.

109
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,649
Look.

110
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,519
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

111
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,557
If I don't have one...

112
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,525
Well, I just need it, okay?

113
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,061
Well, I don't know.

114
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,631
I might have one thing.

115
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,301
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but...

116
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,940
Great.

117
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,139
- Who knows?

118
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,142
You might get lucky.

119
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,475
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,314
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

121
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,915
- Right. He should still be in his office.
- Great.

122
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,549
- I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
- Hi.

123
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,993
- Let me point you in the right direction.
- Great.

124
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,562
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

125
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,398
- Yes, a great visionary.
- Yes, definitely.

126
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,631
He was our 4th president, right?

127
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,038
- Twenty-sixth.
- Twenty-sixth.

128
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,179
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean...

129
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,644
Riffraff.

130
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,108
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

131
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,482
I mean, this is a museum, not a...

132
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,788
Do you know what "museum" means?

133
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,457
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

134
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,258
Can I touch its leg? " No!

135
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,364
Work it out, please.

136
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,299
- Will do, sir.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,932
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

138
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,904
Seems like a fun guy.

139
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,102
Control your young, please. Can we?

140
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,987
Hello? Just kidding.

141
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,789
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

142
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,125
No, Mr. Fredricks was my father.

143
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,633
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

144
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,330
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

145
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,579
Let's talk turkey here.

146
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,111
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

147
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:38,586
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

148
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,755
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

149
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,896
...myself and the other two night guards.

150
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,357
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

151
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,060
- Oh, sorry.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

152
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,798
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

153
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,408
Reginald? Gus?

154
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,170
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

155
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,643
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

156
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,308
Night guard?

157
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,650
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

158
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,952
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

159
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,924
He looks like a weirdie.

160
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,096
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

161
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,599
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

162
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,966
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

163
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,936
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

164
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,703
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

165
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,403
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

166
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,947
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

167
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,178
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

168
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,619
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

169
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,895
- No, no, I want the job...
- Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

170
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,891
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

171
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,833
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

172
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,004
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

173
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,348
You really think he's the one?

174
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,513
Oh, yes.

175
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,621
He's the one.

176
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,794
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

177
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,136
This is the Diorama Room.

178
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,300
Oh, yeah.

179
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,513
I remember these little guys. Cute.

180
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,786
Cecil!

181
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,717
Hey, Cecil!

182
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,397
- Did I get you good?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,907
You got me.

184
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:20,380
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

185
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:25,580
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

186
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,485
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

187
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,992
And here we have our Easter Island head.

188
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,364
Hey, Cecil.

189
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,933
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

190
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,475
Ah, yes.

191
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,905
Oh, Monkeys. I love monkeys.

192
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,079
- Yeah.
- Guy's cute.

193
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,053
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

194
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,953
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

195
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,358
Moving on.

196
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:12,334
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

197
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,305
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

198
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,775
Neat.

199
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,141
And hanging on the wall behind him...

200
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:28,753
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

201
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,488
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

202
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,387
Very cool.

203
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,187
It is indeed, Larry.

204
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,196
Very cool.

205
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:47,432
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

206
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,471
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

207
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,541
Moving on.

208
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,106
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

209
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,613
Larry, that's great. What is it?

210
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,947
It's a job...

211
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,386
...at the Museum of Natural History.

212
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,185
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

213
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,588
Larry, this is good news.

214
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,424
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

215
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,066
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

216
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,809
Larry?

217
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,941
Your keys. Your torch.

218
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,912
- Right.
- You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

219
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,348
Now... It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

220
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,011
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

221
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,084
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for...?

222
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,593
The instruction manual.

223
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,026
Instructions.

224
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,430
You start with one, two, three...

225
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,933
Four?

226
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,901
Are you cracking wise?

227
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,974
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

228
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,134
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

229
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,439
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

230
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,014
- You better get it!
- Gus.

231
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,676
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

232
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:14,053
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

233
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,454
Out?

234
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,322
Good luck, son.

235
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,397
- Night, Gus.
- Young buck. Cracking wise.

236
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,193
Moving on.

237
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,660
Hello?

238
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,668
Hello!

239
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,568
Check!

240
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,403
Check.

241
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,103
I am Larry.

242
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,274
Check! Larry! Larry.

243
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,058
Monday! Monday! Monday!

244
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,786
Monster Truck Rally.

245
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,540
Cecil?

246
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,475
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

247
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,911
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

248
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,362
This is weird.

249
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,737
Cecil?

250
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:12,089
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

251
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,945
- Name, please?
- Cecil...

252
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,948
...Fredricks!
- One moment. Connecting.

253
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,176
- Hello.
- Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

254
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,344
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

255
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,149
The dinosaur... The dinosaur is alive!

256
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,451
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

257
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,923
Tequila.

258
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,892
The dinosaur's alive!

259
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,496
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

260
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,828
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

261
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,532
Okay, I got them!

262
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,598
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Wait! What...?

263
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,845
What bone?

264
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,440
Fetch?

265
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,745
Play fetch?

266
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,638
No way.

267
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,144
- Dum-dum.
- Yes?

268
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,348
- You give me gum-gum.
- I give you gum-gum?

269
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,517
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

270
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,362
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

271
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,397
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

272
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,195
No, your name dum-dum.

273
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,473
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

274
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,474
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

275
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,310
See you later, dum-dum.

276
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,411
What is happening?

277
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,625
Hey.

278
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,387
How you doing?

279
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,160
Are you...?

280
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,233
You're...

281
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,267
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

282
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,909
You're "Sakagawaya"?

283
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,908
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

284
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,175
The glass. I can't...

285
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,908
...hear you.

286
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,645
You can't...? You can't hear me?

287
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,290
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark..."

288
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,788
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're... Right.

289
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,088
You seem... I'm Larry.

290
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,164
What's going on? What's...?
Do you know what's going on here?

291
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,094
Huns. I gotta...

292
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,915
Hey. Hi.

293
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,486
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

294
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,818
I'm new here. And it says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

295
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,524
You're Galileo? No?

296
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,851
Okay...

297
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,850
Hey, I'm the...

298
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,960
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so...

299
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,388
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork and...

300
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,732
...dbe out of your hair, okay?

301
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,759
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

302
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,625
Monkey.

303
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,370
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is...

304
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,369
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

305
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,510
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

306
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,636
No, no, no. What's...? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

307
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,010
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

308
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,414
I just want to lock up.

309
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,713
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

310
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:28,552
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

311
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,660
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

312
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,663
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

313
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,552
Bad monkey. Stop that.

314
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,817
That's not right. Are you done?

315
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,655
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

316
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,890
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

317
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,366
And also... Let me tell you something.
These keys?

318
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,669
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

319
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,671
Dexter. Give...

320
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,875
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

321
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,606
Not... Dexter, I need those.

322
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,512
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

323
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,747
You three guys... What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

324
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,619
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

325
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,419
Lookit... You!

326
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh, this is not happening.

327
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,253
Oh, man.

328
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,242
What are you guys doing?

329
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,810
I can't feel my lip.

330
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,846
Oh, shit.

331
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,249
Man.

332
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,640
Hey. Hey.

333
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,345
Hey, stop that.

334
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,158
Hog-tie him, boys.

335
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,391
- Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
- Hey, what are you doing?

336
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,900
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

337
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,061
Hey. Hey, stop that.

338
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,403
Every night, year after year...

339
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,071
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

340
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,480
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

341
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,384
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

342
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,160
- Hey, blondie?
- Name's Jedediah.

343
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,325
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

344
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:02,098
- That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
- What's going on here, huh?

345
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,503
- Somebody's gotta pay.
- Pay for what?

346
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:09,510
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

347
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,712
Seriously, stop the train.

348
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,720
- All right, stop the train.
- Thank you.

349
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,948
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

350
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,922
Split his head like a watermelon!

351
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,790
For crying out loud.

352
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,454
All right, that's enough.

353
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,431
We got a breach.

354
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,504
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him...

355
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,710
- Oh, my...
- Prepare the catapults.

356
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,451
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

357
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,118
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

358
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,232
Sorry, look. I just... I'm not a giant, ok?
I'm just an average-sized...

359
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,095
Don't talk down to me.

360
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,294
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

361
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,770
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

362
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,934
...metaphorically speaking.

363
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,444
Don't take that the wrong way.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

364
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,515
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

365
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,278
- Don't you do it, son.
- Do what?

366
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,852
- Octavius.
- Don't do what?

367
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,479
- Unleash hell!
- Don't...

368
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,031
Climb aboard, boy.

369
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,297
Take the hand, son.

370
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,873
Onboard.

371
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,380
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

372
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,009
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

373
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,548
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

374
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,590
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

375
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,126
...of these United States of America
at your service.

376
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,193
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

377
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,201
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

378
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,905
The hunt is afoot.

379
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,743
Hunt's afoot.

380
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,813
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

381
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,042
- Yes, but just one question.
- All right.

382
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,416
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or...?

383
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,456
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

384
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,825
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

385
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,525
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

386
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,260
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

387
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,997
...dead?
- Dead?

388
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,007
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

389
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,472
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

390
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,608
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

391
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,684
There's the source of all this commotion.

392
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,087
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

393
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,855
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

394
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:20,234
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

395
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,895
And every night since.

396
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,847
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

397
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,505
Exactly.

398
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,712
And I'm supposed to do what?

399
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:40,983
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

400
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,056
- Come on, lad.
- All right. Okay. This is impossible.

401
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,062
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

402
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,225
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

403
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,770
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

404
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,568
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

405
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,802
...we turn to dust.

406
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,745
- You turn to dust?
- Dust.

407
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,677
- Really?
- Really.

408
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,285
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

409
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,014
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

410
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,623
Yeah. I mean... I mean, I guess. I don't...

411
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,764
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

412
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,592
- Yes.
- Good.

413
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,758
Let's ride.

414
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,312
All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

415
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,622
What are you looking at?

416
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,361
I'm tracking, dear boy.

417
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,364
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

418
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,395
See you tomorrow night.

419
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,335
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

420
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,771
What? You've only just begun.

421
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,377
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l...

422
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,740
- Lawrence?
- Yeah?

423
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,041
What did you do
before you took this post?

424
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:16,312
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

425
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,079
Did you give up on that as well?

426
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,486
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

427
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,853
- Lawrence.
- Yes, sir?

428
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:28,465
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

429
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,666
For you, this is that very moment.

430
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,028
Bully. Got you, boy.

431
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,632
Yeah. You got me.

432
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,804
Say hello to your little friend.

433
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,305
- What are you doing?
- Put me down.

434
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,638
I don't like to be manhandled.

435
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,010
- Just calm down, Jed.
- It doesn't feel good.

436
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,778
- It makes me feel small and powerless.
- You done?

437
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,413
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

438
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,458
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

439
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,096
Now you know my shame.

440
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:38,759
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

441
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,497
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

442
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,731
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

443
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,466
Duck!

444
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,307
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

445
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,972
This is not worth 11.50 an hour.

446
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,348
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

447
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,121
Hello.

448
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,851
Larry?

449
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,264
Larry?

450
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,903
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

451
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,043
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

452
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,111
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

453
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,747
That little sweetheart.

454
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,475
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

455
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,812
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- What?

456
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,219
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

457
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,986
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

458
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:15,188
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

459
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,063
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

460
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,602
...and I will be seeing you.
- Larry!

461
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,979
- Dad?
- Hey.

462
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,445
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

463
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:36,450
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

464
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,918
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

465
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,384
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

466
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,651
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

467
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,797
Maybe your dad will give you a VIP tour.

468
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,399
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

469
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,096
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

470
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,933
- Deal.
- All right.

471
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,098
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

472
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,937
- Love you.
- Love you too, buddy.

473
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,908
Bye, now. All right.

474
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,437
Hey, Larry.

475
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,080
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

476
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,238
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

477
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,510
You. New night guard, here, now.

478
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,889
- What's up?
- "What's up?"

479
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,590
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up?"

480
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,200
Come on.

481
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:04,333
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

482
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,639
Okay. I'm guessing...

483
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:15,478
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

484
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,484
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

485
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,783
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

486
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,449
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

487
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,894
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

488
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,857
"No" is the answer.

489
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,493
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

490
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,205
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

491
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,810
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

492
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,411
Do you?

493
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,380
No.

494
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,710
I don't want...
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

495
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,821
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

496
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,414
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

497
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:01,393
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

498
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:07,129
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant...

499
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,097
If I'm not clear, tell me.

500
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,841
Am I clear?

501
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,509
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

502
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,983
Hey, Cecil?

503
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,018
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

504
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:31,287
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

505
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,022
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

506
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,462
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

507
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,936
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

508
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,630
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

509
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,868
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

510
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,946
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

511
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,044
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

512
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,620
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

513
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,622
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

514
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,322
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

515
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:11,457
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

516
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,736
Excuse me?

517
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,899
I just thought that was...

518
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,773
I just was laughing in agreement.

519
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,745
Happy monkey.

520
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,281
All right, kids. This way.

521
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,719
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

522
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,387
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

523
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,966
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

524
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,625
There's a storm coming.

525
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,770
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

526
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:56,207
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

527
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:59,644
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

528
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,841
And yet they wrote...

529
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:04,748
- Yes, Mr. Daley?
- Yes. Was she deaf?

530
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:09,856
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she...

531
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:15,328
Yeah, because... Just... She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

532
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,125
That's because she's a statue.

533
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:23,068
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

534
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,542
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna be here every night.

535
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,543
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

536
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,704
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

537
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:35,783
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

538
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,283
A cup of coffee?

539
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:39,683
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

540
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:44,350
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

541
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,452
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

542
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

543
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,097
- And have a good rest of your...
- All right. Okay, kids.

544
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,697
It was incredible what she did.

545
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:58,068
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

546
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:01,802
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

547
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:04,310
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

548
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,539
- Sakagawean.
- Sakagawean?

549
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:10,982
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

550
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:15,090
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

551
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:19,354
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

552
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,922
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

553
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:27,964
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- No, no, no.

554
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:31,971
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 10-year-old son...

555
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:35,941
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

556
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:39,138
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

557
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:42,341
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

558
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:45,578
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

559
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,022
"Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

560
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,788
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

561
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,164
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

562
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:02,395
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

563
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,803
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

564
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,984
Larry?

565
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:01,957
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

566
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:04,723
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

567
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,493
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

568
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:09,866
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

569
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,564
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

570
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:17,270
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

571
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,314
You fellas go ahead.

572
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,178
I need a moment.

573
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:28,016
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

574
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,374
Go crazy, big guy.

575
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:33,215
Hey, guys.

576
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,357
Quest for fire...

577
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:39,055
...over. Knock yourselves out.

578
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,228
Morning, dum-dum.

579
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:46,095
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

580
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:50,330
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

581
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:15,257
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

582
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,758
Sorry.

583
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,063
Heave.

584
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:24,472
Heave. Heave.

585
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
Hey, what's going on over here?

586
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:29,708
We expand or we die.

587
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:32,173
Heave.

588
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,872
- Heave.
- On the count of three...

589
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,486
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

590
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,455
- And a one and a two...
- Hey, Jed. Stop that.

591
00:52:41,624 --> 00:52:45,458
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

592
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:49,962
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

593
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:53,465
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

594
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:57,402
- I'm just trying to close up shop.
- We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

595
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,470
Yeah. What are you doing?

596
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:05,906
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

597
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:09,882
You can't fight it and neither can I.
Go! More dynamite.

598
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,554
- Yeah, use it all.
- All right. Okay.

599
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,384
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

600
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:17,492
It's Octavius, mary.

601
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,323
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

602
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:23,727
- You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
- Sorry.

603
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,162
- I have rights.
- And you.

604
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:27,825
- Hey, no! Put me down!
- Keep heaving, men.

605
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,301
You can't stop progress!

606
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,667
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

607
00:53:32,408 --> 00:53:34,842
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

608
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,606
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

609
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,341
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

610
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:43,916
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

611
00:53:44,086 --> 00:53:45,678
It's kind of how we pass the time.

612
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:50,222
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

613
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,056
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

614
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:58,361
- What, you mean...?
- You're gonna let us out?

615
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,267
What, and just roam free?

616
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:04,564
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

617
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,868
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

618
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,272
You have my word, my liege.

619
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:12,107
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

620
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:16,183
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

621
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:19,082
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

622
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,813
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,587
- "Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
- I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

624
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:29,492
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so...

625
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:32,133
I don't. I just call you Larry.

626
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,292
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

627
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,301
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

628
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:39,908
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

629
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,168
Locked up. Take a look.

630
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,542
- Do they look happy?
- No.

631
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:48,147
They look sad.

632
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:51,377
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

633
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:54,785
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

634
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:59,121
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

635
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,093
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

636
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:04,596
Good.

637
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,802
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

638
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,067
Yeah?

639
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:17,270
All right.

640
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,152
What's that? You got my keys?

641
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,156
I don't think so.

642
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:35,587
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

643
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,756
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

644
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,128
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

645
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:43,738
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

646
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:46,238
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

647
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:51,210
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

648
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,705
I told you there was a storm coming.

649
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,353
- Hey, Teddy.
- Lawrence.

650
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,120
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

651
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:10,025
- You look like a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

652
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,534
- You...?
- What?

653
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:24,008
- You checking her out?
- The nerve.

654
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,172
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

655
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:31,285
No, no, no. I'm just... I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

656
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,183
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

657
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:39,853
- Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
- Yeah.

658
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,856
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

659
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,626
- Indeed. Bless you, lad.
- Yeah. All right.

660
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:48,668
- Carry on.
- Good. See you.

661
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,551
I...

662
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,932
Hey, hi.

663
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,235
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

664
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,770
No?

665
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:07,276
Right. I don't know what that means...

666
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:11,545
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

667
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:18,119
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

668
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:20,189
...magic.

669
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:23,297
- Magic?
- Magic.

670
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,828
Sorcery.

671
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,534
Ah, sorcer...

672
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:30,137
Yes. Illusion.

673
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,962
Everybody likes magic.

674
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:36,100
And flowers. People like flowers.

675
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:37,802
There you go. Those are for you.

676
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,540
You know what else people like?
Money.

677
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:45,085
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

678
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:47,319
...disappear.

679
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,150
At least that's what I...

680
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:54,089
...hear.

681
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,429
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

682
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:05,500
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

683
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:10,175
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

684
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:13,011
...of vanishing...

685
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,085
...into thin air!

686
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,352
No, no. Don't. That defeats the... Don't!

687
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:42,541
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

688
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:00,892
Cortes, right?

689
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,140
How?

690
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:23,449
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you...

691
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,787
Dexter!

692
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,755
Come on, guys!

693
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,750
Hey, guys!

694
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:11,455
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

695
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,503
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

696
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:17,002
I thought we had a deal.

697
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:19,402
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

698
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:21,509
We're past words, Laredo.

699
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:24,737
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

700
01:01:24,913 --> 01:01:26,210
Those guns don't even work.

701
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,646
They don't? Take a look at this.

702
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,982
Dexter!

703
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:23,666
Why?

704
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,639
Ho! Dexter.

705
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,248
End of the line, cool breeze.

706
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,259
End of the line.

707
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,376
I am not playing games here.

708
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,246
Just hand them over.

709
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,756
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

710
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:21,088
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

711
01:03:43,285 --> 01:03:45,845
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

712
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,754
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

713
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,984
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

714
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:54,958
Without him, there's no us.

715
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:56,794
Are you rabid?

716
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,626
Wipe that off.

717
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,996
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

718
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,001
May I have the keys, dear friend?

719
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,874
Thank you. Lawrence?

720
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:11,172
Well, you know what?

721
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:14,440
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

722
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:17,676
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

723
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:19,844
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

724
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,751
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't I?

725
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,291
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

726
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,657
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

727
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,388
Some men are born great, Lawrence...

728
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

729
01:04:33,268 --> 01:04:35,099
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

730
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,795
The thing is, not everyone is great.

731
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:40,567
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

732
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,404
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

733
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,274
Every journey begins with a footstep.

734
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:48,712
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

735
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:51,944
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

736
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,384
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

737
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:58,182
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

738
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:00,858
I'm done, all right?

739
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,431
No, Rexy! No!

740
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:42,161
Oh, no.

741
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,298
All right.

742
01:06:56,378 --> 01:07:00,178
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

743
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:02,748
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

744
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,349
- Mr. Daley?
- Yeah?

745
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,722
- Foam.
- Yes, I know.

746
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,221
In the Neanderthal display.

747
01:07:10,392 --> 01:07:13,361
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

748
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:15,155
I was on my way to go clean it up.

749
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,798
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

750
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,796
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

751
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,995
Your dad just got canned, dude.

752
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:27,532
Excuse me?

753
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:29,501
Mr. McPhee?

754
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:31,811
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

755
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,312
Can I talk to you about this, please?

756
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,609
- Sir?
- What?

757
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,685
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

758
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,982
- You obviously don't.
- No, I didn't, but now I do.

759
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:44,921
- Really, Mr. McPhee...
- Doctor.

760
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:47,524
Dr. McPhee.

761
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:50,363
Can you please give me one more night?

762
01:07:53,101 --> 01:07:55,296
- One more night.
- Okay, thank you.

763
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:58,803
And if anything is the tiniest...

764
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,736
...after your shift:

765
01:08:03,745 --> 01:08:05,042
Because...

766
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:09,744
- Got it.
- Okay?

767
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:13,649
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

768
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,791
Shame on me. Fool me...
Shame on me.

769
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:24,431
- You.
- Fool me twice... Got it.

770
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,362
- Take it or leave it.
- Okay. Thank you.

771
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,401
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
01:08:33,575 --> 01:08:36,703
- What's wrong?
- Maybe you should ask Nicky.

773
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:41,977
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

774
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,142
You got fired.

775
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:46,747
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

776
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:51,990
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

777
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,624
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

778
01:08:55,797 --> 01:08:57,856
We just had a little misunderstanding.

779
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,432
Why?

780
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:03,794
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel...

781
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:08,065
You know what? Let me show you.

782
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:10,740
- Show me what?
- Come to work with me tonight.

783
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:12,243
Larry?

784
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,110
Can I talk to you for a second?

785
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,550
Am I in trouble?

786
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:21,484
Larry, what are you doing?

787
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,022
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

788
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:27,218
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

789
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:30,922
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

790
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,892
He won't be disappointed.

791
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:35,933
Larry.

792
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,472
He won't be disappointed.

793
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,480
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

794
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:49,378
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

795
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:12,601
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

796
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:14,071
- Hey there.
- Hey.

797
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,872
- Good place to think, huh?
- Yeah. Definitely.

798
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,506
So no big plans tonight?

799
01:10:22,684 --> 01:10:25,517
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

800
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,618
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

801
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,417
It's the live ones that throw me.

802
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:34,426
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

803
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:36,688
- Seriously?
- Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

804
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,493
We're sort of locking everything up.

805
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,865
You're really taking your job seriously.

806
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,439
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

807
01:10:46,608 --> 01:10:47,802
- I get it.
- Yeah.

808
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:49,807
How's that dissertation coming?

809
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:54,478
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

810
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:56,549
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

811
01:10:57,218 --> 01:11:01,382
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

812
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,685
I'll let you get back to work.

813
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:08,920
- Good night, Larry.
- Yeah, okay.

814
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,961
Night.

815
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,472
Hey.

816
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,703
Rebecca!

817
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:27,476
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hey.

818
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,880
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

819
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,883
Okay. Why?

820
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:35,818
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

821
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,585
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

822
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,456
- Okay.
- No, I mean insanely crazy.

823
01:11:41,629 --> 01:11:43,256
- I can handle it.
- Okay.

824
01:11:44,265 --> 01:11:47,996
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

825
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:51,036
- Yeah.
- In this museum...

826
01:11:51,906 --> 01:11:53,430
...it actually does.

827
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:56,870
What are you talking about?

828
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:05,786
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

829
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:12,418
- Really?
- Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

830
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,721
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

831
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:17,865
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

832
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,763
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

833
01:12:20,935 --> 01:12:26,032
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little...

834
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:27,674
- What is he?
- Capuchin.

835
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:31,141
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

836
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,016
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

837
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:38,379
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

838
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:40,987
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

839
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,255
...I can hook that up.

840
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,056
That's cool.

841
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:50,356
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

842
01:12:53,735 --> 01:12:55,669
Make fun of the history geek.

843
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,505
- No. Rebecca!
- Good night, Larry.

844
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,341
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

845
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:17,791
- Here you go. Best seat in the house.
- What's going on?

846
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,519
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

847
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:24,222
- What?
- You'll see in about 20 seconds.

848
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,230
- Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
- Yeah.

849
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,869
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

850
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:33,531
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

851
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:40,904
...five, four, three, two...

852
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,524
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec.

853
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:54,092
Say hello to Rexy!

854
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:56,355
Dad, are you okay?

855
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:00,257
This is weird.

856
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,562
Guys! Come on!

857
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,935
Sundown!

858
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:10,511
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

859
01:14:10,678 --> 01:14:12,771
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

860
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:16,075
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

861
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:18,146
Get on, Texas! Get up.

862
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,446
Just stop, okay?

863
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:24,080
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

864
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,352
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night...

865
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,190
- Now there's a tablet?
- Yeah, there is.

866
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,922
Come on, Dad.

867
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:33,994
Come on.

868
01:14:38,506 --> 01:14:40,440
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

869
01:14:40,608 --> 01:14:44,066
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

870
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:46,140
Yeah, right.

871
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:48,142
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

872
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:53,151
Nicky?

873
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:57,057
Hey, Nicky!

874
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:01,257
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

875
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:04,364
- Home.
- What? Wait a minute.

876
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:10,303
Come on.

877
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,578
You guys shouldn't be here.

878
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:22,977
Give us the tablet, son.

879
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,142
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

880
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,550
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

881
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:30,691
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

882
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,918
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

883
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:37,030
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

884
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,564
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

885
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:42,396
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

886
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:44,435
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

887
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,540
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

888
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:48,868
- Give us the tablet!
- Nicky?

889
01:15:49,577 --> 01:15:51,010
Trust me.

890
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:14,901
Nick? Run. Now.

891
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,970
Get back here, kid!

892
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:22,370
Bad idea, Larry.

893
01:16:22,777 --> 01:16:25,302
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

894
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,607
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

895
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:33,682
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

896
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:37,985
...like everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

897
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,390
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

898
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:45,155
Okay. Did not see that coming.

899
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:46,994
Gave us an energy boost.

900
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:49,432
We love the nightlife, Larry.

901
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:51,765
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

902
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:53,406
...we had to steal the tablet.

903
01:16:53,574 --> 01:16:55,599
Everyone knows you need the money.

904
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,642
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

905
01:16:57,812 --> 01:16:59,939
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

906
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:02,014
Take care of that cut.

907
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:04,151
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

908
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,145
- Sweet dreams, cupcake!
- No!

909
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:09,756
Pile driver!

910
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,491
Let's get our tablet.

911
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,618
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

912
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,346
Nicky!

913
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,157
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

914
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:50,756
Sleep tight, hotshot.

915
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,467
Let's grab everything we can fence.

916
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:58,935
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

917
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:10,372
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

918
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,114
Someone call my name?

919
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:18,356
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

920
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:20,391
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

921
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:22,825
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

922
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,521
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

923
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,158
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

924
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:30,531
I need some help. Come on.

925
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,468
Actually...

926
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:38,468
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

927
01:18:38,646 --> 01:18:41,513
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

928
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,547
I never shot a wild beast.

929
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,949
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

930
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:48,753
But you...

931
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:53,051
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

932
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:57,831
I'm made of wax, Larry.

933
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,296
What are you made of?

934
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:07,538
- Wait! That's all you got for me?
- That's it!

935
01:19:19,887 --> 01:19:21,878
That's it. Come on.

936
01:19:22,723 --> 01:19:24,054
Duck!

937
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:27,216
Go over there!

938
01:19:47,081 --> 01:19:50,676
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

939
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,150
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

940
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,619
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

941
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:59,089
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

942
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:07,426
Thank you. Nicky.

943
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:09,431
Thank you.

944
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:18,777
Dad?

945
01:20:30,124 --> 01:20:32,649
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

946
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,755
- How come you speak English?
- I went to Cambridge University.

947
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:39,024
You went to Cambridge?

948
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,794
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

949
01:20:42,937 --> 01:20:45,497
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

950
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:48,198
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

951
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:50,970
I am Larry...

952
01:20:52,446 --> 01:20:54,277
...son of Milton...

953
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:57,815
...and this is my son, Nick.

954
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:00,476
And we hail from Brooklyn.

955
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:04,086
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

956
01:21:04,258 --> 01:21:05,520
...and every other weekend.

957
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:10,494
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

958
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:14,662
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

959
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:16,700
...I am forever in your debt.

960
01:21:16,871 --> 01:21:19,465
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

961
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,165
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

962
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,979
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

963
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:29,514
...Iove to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

964
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,382
...have it.

965
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,291
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

966
01:21:42,463 --> 01:21:43,828
Thank you.

967
01:21:58,846 --> 01:22:00,541
What is that?

968
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:03,577
Huns.

969
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,349
I gotta deal with this guy.

970
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:45,287
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

971
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,134
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

972
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:57,827
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

973
01:22:58,005 --> 01:23:01,497
I get it. Ripping for you...
You want to rip things, okay?

974
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:05,635
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

975
01:23:06,113 --> 01:23:07,603
In here.

976
01:23:08,282 --> 01:23:10,477
Somebody ripped little...

977
01:23:10,651 --> 01:23:13,620
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

978
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:18,190
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

979
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,621
They ripped the love.

980
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,762
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

981
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:29,194
A little baby all alone in a tent...

982
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:32,269
...whose daddy went off...

983
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:36,076
...to pillage some town...

984
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:38,973
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

985
01:23:39,146 --> 01:23:41,273
But who was left alone?

986
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:46,517
You.

987
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:55,390
Let it out. Let it go. Let it go.

988
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:19,611
It's okay. It's okay.

989
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:23,450
You're next.

990
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:30,195
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

991
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:35,566
- Larry Daley.
- Yeah.

992
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,071
Good. Yes.

993
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:43,507
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

994
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:48,212
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

995
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,353
Guys! Come on!

996
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:03,461
Quiet!

997
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,832
My dum-dum want to speak.

998
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,806
Thank you.

999
01:25:17,678 --> 01:25:20,010
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

1000
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:23,014
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

1001
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,982
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

1002
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,049
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1003
01:25:29,223 --> 01:25:31,123
...and we need to do it before morning.

1004
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,455
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

1005
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:39,463
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

1006
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:43,000
- It's Columbus.
- Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

1007
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,968
There's no nameplate, so...
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

1008
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,075
...and do a sweep from Invertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

1009
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:52,235
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

1010
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:55,507
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

1011
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,344
Romans work alone.

1012
01:25:58,118 --> 01:26:00,245
- That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
- Yes, it did.

1013
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,649
Come on.

1014
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:03,884
That was much harder!

1015
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:05,525
Guys, come on!

1016
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,453
Jed, Octavius.

1017
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:10,927
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1018
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:12,622
...you guys aren't that different.

1019
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,395
You're both great leaders.

1020
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:17,799
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1021
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,371
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1022
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,064
Civil War dudes.

1023
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:27,611
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

1024
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:32,349
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1025
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:37,980
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1026
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:41,784
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

1027
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:47,329
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1028
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:51,232
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

1029
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:54,499
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

1030
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:57,007
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

1031
01:26:58,178 --> 01:26:59,372
So who's with me?

1032
01:27:00,781 --> 01:27:02,442
Yeah.

1033
01:27:02,616 --> 01:27:04,550
- Who's with me?
- Yeah!

1034
01:27:04,718 --> 01:27:07,209
- Yeah!
- Charge!

1035
01:27:08,622 --> 01:27:11,523
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1036
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:14,924
And animals!

1037
01:27:16,797 --> 01:27:20,528
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1038
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:45,491
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1039
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:47,354
Geronimo!

1040
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:00,938
Oh, jeez.

1041
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:19,187
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1042
01:28:24,598 --> 01:28:26,862
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1043
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:34,504
Right, men, we're almost there.

1044
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:57,057
Save yourself!

1045
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,165
I ain't quitting you!

1046
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:02,659
Gus?

1047
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,166
Reginald?

1048
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:08,336
Fellas, where are you?

1049
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,343
Guys?

1050
01:29:21,855 --> 01:29:25,347
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1051
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:26,993
Loving the teamwork!

1052
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:50,539
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1053
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,578
I know someone who can help. Come on.

1054
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,519
Watch out!

1055
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:07,065
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1056
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,725
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1057
01:30:10,404 --> 01:30:14,568
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

1058
01:30:15,175 --> 01:30:18,201
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1059
01:30:22,349 --> 01:30:24,340
He left the wagon...

1060
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:26,349
...and went back.

1061
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,351
He went back?

1062
01:30:29,656 --> 01:30:31,089
Why would he go back?

1063
01:30:33,827 --> 01:30:35,260
Get out of the way!

1064
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:44,961
You saved me.

1065
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:47,397
You're worth saving, my dear.

1066
01:30:49,843 --> 01:30:52,471
- That's problematic.
- Teddy. Oh, man.

1067
01:30:52,646 --> 01:30:54,841
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1068
01:30:55,015 --> 01:30:56,880
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

1069
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:00,315
- Half the museum's running amuck outside.
- He's got my tablet.

1070
01:31:03,023 --> 01:31:05,116
Come on, Ockie!

1071
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,065
At your service, Gigantor!

1072
01:31:13,233 --> 01:31:15,463
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1073
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,831
Just give me a second, guys.

1074
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:23,637
Rexy?

1075
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,274
Here, boy.

1076
01:31:26,446 --> 01:31:28,676
Teddy, I need a horse.

1077
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:30,510
Do it, man.

1078
01:31:45,632 --> 01:31:49,193
- Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
- Yeah!

1079
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:51,234
Just living the dream, baby!

1080
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,032
I'm loving this!

1081
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,804
Pull the stagecoach over now!

1082
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:03,307
Can I make this turn up here?

1083
01:32:05,385 --> 01:32:08,548
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1084
01:32:14,895 --> 01:32:16,726
I can't hold it!

1085
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,905
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

1086
01:32:33,313 --> 01:32:35,008
Come on!

1087
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:41,515
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

1088
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:43,178
Can't do it, son.

1089
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,127
Pull over!

1090
01:32:48,295 --> 01:32:51,423
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

1091
01:32:52,132 --> 01:32:54,794
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1092
01:32:55,068 --> 01:32:56,933
They can't be stopped, Larry.

1093
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:58,765
Don't you know your history?

1094
01:32:58,939 --> 01:33:03,967
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1095
01:33:04,144 --> 01:33:06,044
Really? You mean a word like...

1096
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:09,041
..."Dakota"?

1097
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,051
Come on, Tex.

1098
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:21,625
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1099
01:33:22,062 --> 01:33:23,290
Oh, and by the way...

1100
01:33:23,463 --> 01:33:25,954
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

1101
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:29,930
Moving on.

1102
01:33:34,007 --> 01:33:35,941
- Hey, Huns.
- Tell Attila to have his boys...

1103
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:38,100
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

1104
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:44,045
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1105
01:33:57,831 --> 01:33:59,492
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

1106
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:03,693
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1107
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:09,441
The year was 1909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

1108
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:12,669
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1109
01:34:20,754 --> 01:34:22,119
There we are.

1110
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,760
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

1111
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,055
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1112
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:32,994
How?

1113
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:38,136
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

1114
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,536
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

1115
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:12,538
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1116
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:18,240
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1117
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:21,609
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

1118
01:35:22,115 --> 01:35:23,844
You know what I mean?

1119
01:35:42,302 --> 01:35:44,862
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1120
01:35:45,038 --> 01:35:46,232
- Inuit.
- Yeah.

1121
01:35:46,406 --> 01:35:48,101
One terracotta soldier.

1122
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:49,503
- Vikings.
- Right.

1123
01:35:49,676 --> 01:35:51,667
- Alpaca.
- Welcome back, ladies.

1124
01:35:51,845 --> 01:35:53,437
- Llama.
- Hey.

1125
01:35:53,613 --> 01:35:54,944
Viking guys.

1126
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:57,583
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

1127
01:35:57,751 --> 01:35:59,878
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

1128
01:36:00,053 --> 01:36:01,418
Okay? Thank you.

1129
01:36:02,856 --> 01:36:05,518
- He's back.
- All right, I'll deal with this joker.

1130
01:36:05,692 --> 01:36:08,820
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1131
01:36:08,995 --> 01:36:11,429
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

1132
01:36:11,598 --> 01:36:14,624
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1133
01:36:14,801 --> 01:36:17,497
- Lawrence!
- Hey, Teddy.

1134
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:19,832
Great to see you in one piece.

1135
01:36:20,006 --> 01:36:22,406
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1136
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:24,271
Larry?

1137
01:36:28,748 --> 01:36:31,012
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

1138
01:36:31,184 --> 01:36:33,846
- I know.
- Teddy?

1139
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:38,687
Oh, my God.

1140
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:41,121
Wanna meet her?

1141
01:36:42,896 --> 01:36:44,090
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:45,424
Okay, come on.

1143
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:48,796
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1144
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,596
- An honor.
- Hi.

1145
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,601
And this is Sakagawea.

1146
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:54,000
- Wea.
- Wea.

1147
01:36:54,174 --> 01:36:55,664
Wea.

1148
01:36:55,842 --> 01:36:58,777
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1149
01:37:00,547 --> 01:37:02,777
You rock. I am a big fan.

1150
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,843
What would you like to know?

1151
01:37:06,686 --> 01:37:09,484
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but...

1152
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:23,392
- One Buddha.
- Check.

1153
01:37:24,971 --> 01:37:27,303
Two zebras.

1154
01:37:27,974 --> 01:37:31,307
- Right. Check.
- Dexter! Welcome back.

1155
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:34,345
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1156
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:37,407
- Lawrence!
- You saw!

1157
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,848
- You saw what he did just then!
- Who's evolved?

1158
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,817
- I am.
- Who's evolved?

1159
01:37:41,988 --> 01:37:43,353
I am!

1160
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:45,756
Good.

1161
01:37:46,526 --> 01:37:48,016
Well, they're all here.

1162
01:37:48,194 --> 01:37:49,661
Well done. Everyone's in.

1163
01:37:49,829 --> 01:37:51,490
Yeah, well...

1164
01:37:51,731 --> 01:37:53,460
...not everyone.

1165
01:37:54,634 --> 01:37:57,728
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

1166
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:02,006
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

1167
01:38:03,009 --> 01:38:04,533
Yeah.

1168
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:09,345
Dad, look.

1169
01:38:15,188 --> 01:38:17,122
Bully!

1170
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:40,377
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

1171
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,395
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1172
01:39:03,036 --> 01:39:05,334
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

1173
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:08,336
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1174
01:39:08,508 --> 01:39:10,567
Well, if that's indeed the case...

1175
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:12,644
...then it's farewell, my friend.

1176
01:39:14,614 --> 01:39:16,275
Nick?

1177
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:19,317
Your father's a great man.

1178
01:39:19,819 --> 01:39:21,411
I know.

1179
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:28,854
Told you.

1180
01:39:32,332 --> 01:39:34,300
All right. Good night.

1181
01:39:34,467 --> 01:39:37,368
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1182
01:39:42,442 --> 01:39:44,342
Hey, Teddy?

1183
01:39:57,557 --> 01:39:59,149
Thanks.

1184
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:16,037
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

1185
01:40:17,377 --> 01:40:19,902
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

1186
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,480
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1187
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:26,881
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

1188
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,853
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

1189
01:40:31,024 --> 01:40:34,084
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

1190
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:38,657
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

1191
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:41,960
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1192
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:45,401
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1193
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:49,201
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them...

1194
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:53,741
Any explanation at all?

1195
01:40:58,051 --> 01:40:59,712
No. Got nothing.

1196
01:40:59,886 --> 01:41:01,114
Good.

1197
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:04,383
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

1198
01:41:22,408 --> 01:41:24,501
Folks, this way.

1199
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:26,161
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1200
01:42:26,339 --> 01:42:29,467
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1201
01:42:34,514 --> 01:42:36,414
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

1202
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:39,051
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1203
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:43,178
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

1204
01:42:44,457 --> 01:42:47,051
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1205
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:11,348
Goal!

1206
01:43:38,278 --> 01:43:40,712
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1207
01:43:41,247 --> 01:43:42,236
Nope.

1208
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:50,383
Let's ride.

1209
01:44:27,927 --> 01:44:31,192
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1210
01:44:31,364 --> 01:44:34,390
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

1211
01:44:34,567 --> 01:44:36,364
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

1212
01:44:36,536 --> 01:44:38,003
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

1213
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:39,638
You ain't going nowhere.

1214
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:42,468
Start mopping, hot dog.

1215
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:48,574
Over here.
