<i>U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.</i>

3
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,779
<i>Starfleet Base, we've sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?</i>

4
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,281
<i>Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?</i>

5
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:28,251
<i>Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.</i>

6
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,582
<i>It looks like a lightning storm.</i>

7
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,121
<i>What you've sent us
doesn't seem possible.</i>

8
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,484
<i>Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.</i>

9
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,649
- Report.
- It's still out of visual range.

10
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,592
<i>- Give me 20 seconds.
- Alert Captain Robau</i>

11
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,859
<i>that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.</i>

12
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,331
Polarize the viewscreen.

13
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:43,867
<i>Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?</i>

14
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,300
Captain, we have visual.

15
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:48,396
<i>- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, Lieutenant.</i>

16
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:49,940
<i>You're 75,000 kilometers from...</i>

17
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,907
Captain, are you seeing this?

18
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,570
My God.

19
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,999
I have a reading.

20
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,968
- They've locked weapons on us!
- Red alert!

21
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,131
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

22
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,265
- mark 2.
- Arm weapons!

23
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:27,006
Evasive pattern Delta-five!

24
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,208
Incoming fast!

25
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,217
Fire all phasers! Damage report.

26
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:42,487
<i>Warp drive's been knocked out!
Never seen anything like it.</i>

27
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:45,688
Weapons are off-line. Main power 38%.

28
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,663
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

29
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:57,940
Lieutenant!

30
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,709
Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.

31
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,785
- Were our shields even up?
- Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

32
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,785
- We have confirmed casualties, sir.
- Shields 11% and dropping.

33
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,354
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

34
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,825
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

35
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,088
<i>Hello.</i>

36
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,994
<i>My commander requests
the presence of your Captain</i>

37
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,433
<i>in order to negotiate a cease-fire.</i>

38
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:27,471
<i>You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.</i>

39
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,201
<i>Your refusal would be unwise.</i>

40
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,321
Walk with me.

41
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,560
If I don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

42
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,361
- Sir, we could issue...
- There is no help for us out here.

43
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:57,901
Use autopilot.

44
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,603
- And get off this ship.
- Aye, Captain.

45
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,902
You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk.

46
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:19,006
His heart rate's elevated.

47
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,067
Look at this ship.

48
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:48,472
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

49
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,711
- Is it him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

50
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:57,448
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

51
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,905
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

52
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,769
I'm unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

53
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,176
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

54
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,978
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

55
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,551
Where are you from?

56
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,896
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again!

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,490
Bravo-six maneuver! Fire full spread!

58
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,608
- Seventeen more out!
- I'm initiating General Order 13!

59
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,444
- We're evacuating!
- Yes, sir!

60
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,989
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

61
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,026
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

62
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,924
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

63
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,462
You'll deliver in the shuttle. Go!

64
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,067
Move! This one's closed!
Let's go! Get him up!

65
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,635
I'm on my way!

66
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,009
<i>- George.
- You're okay. Thank God.</i>

67
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:30,114
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

68
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,041
<i>- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

69
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,211
<i>- Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.</i>

70
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,484
<i>- Our baby, it's coming now.
- I'm on my way.</i>

71
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,794
<i>Autopilot function has been destroyed.</i>

72
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,058
<i>Manual operation only.</i>

73
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,627
Clear those decks now!
Get to the shuttles! Move, move, move!

74
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,936
Get to the hangar deck!
Get to the hangar deck! Let's move it!

75
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,338
- That was a big one.
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

76
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,210
- And the baby, too, right?
- And the baby, too.

77
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,820
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

78
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,528
<i>Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?</i>

79
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,258
- Yes, sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

80
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,926
- We're waiting on you, sir.
- No, just go. Take off immediately.

81
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,234
<i>- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.</i>

82
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,132
No, wait! We can't go yet!

83
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,533
Please stop! Stop!

84
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,279
George? The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

85
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,911
Sweetheart, listen to me.

86
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,650
<i>I'm not gonna be there.</i>

87
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,915
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

88
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,651
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here!

89
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,852
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

90
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,987
George, I can't do this without you.

91
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:55,464
Okay, I need you to push now.

92
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,636
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

93
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,207
A boy?

94
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,946
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

95
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,579
<i>He's beautiful.</i>

96
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,247
George, you should be here.

97
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,358
<i>Impact alert.</i>

98
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,987
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

99
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,492
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

100
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,396
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

101
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,910
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

102
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,816
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?
- I hear you!

103
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,549
I love you so much. I love you...

104
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,869
<i>Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.</i>

105
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,530
<i>You think you can get away with this
just 'cause your mother's off planet?</i>

106
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,006
<i>You get your ass back home now!</i>

107
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:27,738
<i>You live in my house, buddy.
You live in my house, and that's my car.</i>

108
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,712
<i>You get one scratch on that car,
and I'm gonna whip your...</i>

109
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,428
Yeah!

110
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,337
Hey, Johnny!

111
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,587
Citizen! Pull over.

112
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,121
No!

113
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,178
Is there a problem, Officer?

114
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,847
Citizen, what is your name?

115
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,619
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

116
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,570
<i>What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?</i>

117
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,273
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

118
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:45,649
One-point-two-six.

119
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,739
An ellipse.

120
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,648
<i>What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?</i>

121
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,583
Positive two-thirds.

122
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:55,523
<i>What is the square root of 2,396,324?</i>

123
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,492
<i>- 1,548.
- What is the dimensionality...</i>

124
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,291
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

125
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:04,129
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

126
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,898
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

127
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,202
Spock!

128
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,371
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today.

129
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,147
Affirmative.

130
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:30,987
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

131
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:34,087
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and
therefore have no place in this universe.

132
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,066
Look. He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

133
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:40,660
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

134
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:47,370
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

135
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,031
They called you a traitor.

136
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,247
Emotions run deep within our race.

137
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,784
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

138
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,414
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

139
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:37,623
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

140
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,926
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan,

141
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,628
and yet, you married a human.

142
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,865
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty

143
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:51,669
to observe
and understand human behavior.

144
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,040
Marrying your mother was

145
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:56,808
logical.

146
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,185
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

147
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:10,357
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

148
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,491
This is something only you can decide.

149
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,768
Spock, come here, let me see you.

150
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,444
- No.
- Spock.

151
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:39,653
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

152
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,119
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

153
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:45,957
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

154
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:47,922
Okay.

155
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,803
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

156
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:05,346
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

157
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,884
and purge all emotion,

158
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:13,253
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

159
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,589
Spock.

160
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,399
As always, whatever you choose to be,

161
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,699
you will have a proud mother.

162
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:35,144
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

163
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,113
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

164
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,247
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

165
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,720
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

166
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:47,848
Logical, but unnecessary.

167
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:51,019
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

168
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,596
It is truly remarkable, Spock,

169
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:55,996
that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

170
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:57,996
All rise!

171
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,071
If you would clarify, Minister,

172
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,467
- to what disadvantage are you referring?
- Your human mother.

173
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,754
Council. Ministers, I must decline.

174
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,550
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

175
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,353
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

176
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,157
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

177
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,562
Why did you come
before this council today?

178
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,191
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

179
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:34,362
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

180
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:38,967
Thank you, Ministers,
for your consideration.

181
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,709
Live long and prosper.

182
00:19:58,696 --> 00:19:59,924
- How are you?
- Hey.

183
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,063
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:17,005
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics,

185
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:21,017
- two Cardassian Sunrises and...
- Gotta try the Slusho. It's good.

186
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,710
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

187
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,482
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

188
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,686
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

189
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,989
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

190
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,825
Don't you want to at least
know my name

191
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,421
before you completely reject me?

192
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,559
- I'm fine without it.
- You are fine without it.

193
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,801
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

194
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,235
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

195
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,738
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way!

196
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,314
That's the name
I was gonna make up for you.

197
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,747
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

198
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,443
They don't have last names
in your world?

199
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,918
Uhura is my last name.

200
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:00,184
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

201
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,918
Excuse me, buddy.

202
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:06,087
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

203
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,665
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

204
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:13,465
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

205
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:16,866
It means you've got a talented tongue.

206
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,902
I'm impressed.

207
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,001
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

208
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:26,015
- who only has sex with farm animals.
- Well, not only.

209
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:29,580
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

210
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,212
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

211
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,314
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

212
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:38,691
- Hey, you better mind your manners.
- Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

213
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:43,460
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

214
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:47,129
So get some more guys,
and then it'll be an even fight.

215
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:51,933
Guys, stop it.

216
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,740
Stop it!

217
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,493
Enough!

218
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,574
Guys, he's had enough!

219
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,814
Outside, all of you.

220
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:37,311
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

221
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,516
- He wouldn't even listen!
- I just bought a drink.

222
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,489
- Can you believe this?
- It's not really fair.

223
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,152
- Come on.
- You all right, son?

224
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,095
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

225
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,599
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

226
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,761
- And who am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

227
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:58,935
Can I get another one?

228
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:01,773
<i>For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.</i>

229
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:06,009
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

230
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,584
He sure learned his lesson.

231
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,275
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

232
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,617
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

233
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:14,748
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

234
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,157
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

235
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:20,162
- Why are you talking to me, man?
- 'Cause I looked up your file

236
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,858
while you were drooling on the floor.

237
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,698
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

238
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,602
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

239
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:31,402
Maybe I love it.

240
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:35,206
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

241
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,805
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

242
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,844
Something special?

243
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,184
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

244
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,323
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

245
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,625
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

246
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:58,602
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

247
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,306
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

248
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,340
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada...

249
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,343
- Are we done?
- I'm done.

250
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,443
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

251
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,053
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

252
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:29,328
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

253
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,535
I dare you to do better.

254
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:58,920
Nice ride, man.

255
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,125
It's yours.

256
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,457
Four years? I'll do it in three.

257
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,909
At ease, gentlemen.

258
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,103
- Never did get that first name.
- You need a doctor.

259
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,331
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor!

260
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,429
You need to get back to your seat.

261
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,599
I had one in the bathroom
with no windows.

262
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,802
- You need to get back to your seat now.
- I suffer from aviaphobia.

263
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,378
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

264
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:59,575
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I'll make you sit down!

265
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:04,119
- Fine.
- Thank you.

266
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,222
<i>This is Captain Pike.
We've been cleared for takeoff.</i>

267
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,118
I may throw up on you.

268
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:12,491
I think these things are pretty safe.

269
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,962
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

270
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:17,363
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

271
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,301
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

272
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:23,339
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

273
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,739
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

274
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:30,405
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

275
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:34,314
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

276
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,477
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

277
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:39,920
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

278
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,083
All I got left is my bones.

279
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,331
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

280
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:42,312
Captain Nero! You've been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

281
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,216
Ayel says it's time.

282
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,662
Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

283
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:57,029
- What are your orders?
- We wait.

284
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:01,498
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

285
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,971
as we've been doing for 25 years.

286
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:08,039
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

287
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:12,006
I'm not gonna kill him.
I'm gonna make him watch.

288
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:27,794
Capture that ship!

289
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,195
Welcome back, Spock.

290
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,499
Why are you so happy?

291
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,939
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, I don't suppose you do.

292
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,533
Hello, ladies!

293
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,772
- I'm taking the test again.
- You gotta be kidding.

294
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,609
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

295
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:45,875
You know, I've got better things to do

296
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:48,042
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

297
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,551
I'm a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

298
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,917
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

299
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,684
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

300
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,852
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

301
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,428
I gotta study.

302
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,789
Study, my ass.

303
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:09,529
- Jim, I think I love you.
- That is so weird.

304
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:11,902
<i>- Lights.
- Lights on.</i>

305
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,266
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

306
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:16,437
- Yeah, I did, but...
- You don't love me, too?

307
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,878
Oh, my God, my roommate!

308
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,175
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

309
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,114
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

310
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,810
- Under...
- Look, just get under the bed.

311
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,581
- Come on!
- She can't see you here.

312
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,087
- Why not?
- Because I promised her

313
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,418
- I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
- Really?

314
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:30,220
- Well, how many guys have you...
- Just down! Just down!

315
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,553
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,097
- How are you?
- Good.

317
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:38,259
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

318
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,131
Yeah, I thought all night.

319
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:44,606
I was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

320
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:48,337
- Really?
- Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

321
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,971
- No.
- Yeah.

322
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,605
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

323
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:55,685
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

324
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,350
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

325
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,756
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

326
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,385
You could hear me breathing?

327
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,020
- You!
- Big day tomorrow.

328
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,827
- You're gonna fail. Get out.
- Gaila, see you around.

329
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,366
If I pass,
will you tell me your first name?

330
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,197
- No! Good night.
- I think the fact

331
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:16,067
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

332
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,340
<i>We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.</i>

333
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:23,413
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

334
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,379
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

335
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:28,508
"Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

336
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:30,981
"Captain."

337
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,786
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

338
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,655
- and are locking weapons on us.
- That's okay.

339
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:39,461
<i>- That's okay?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.</i>

340
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,990
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?

341
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,896
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

342
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:47,135
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

343
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,831
- I don't suppose this is a problem either.
- They're firing, Captain.

344
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:52,902
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members

345
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,136
from the damaged ship.

346
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,973
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

347
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,775
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

348
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,349
Alert Medical.

349
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:05,177
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

350
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,348
- I understand.
- Well, should we, I don't know,

351
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:08,924
fire back?

352
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,024
- No.
- Of course not.

353
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,597
What is this? What's going on?

354
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,438
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

355
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,704
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

356
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,040
Are they?

357
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,443
No. They're not.

358
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:35,541
Fire on all enemy ships.

359
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,280
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

360
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:41,289
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

361
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,830
- All ships destroyed, Captain.
- Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

362
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:52,595
So! We've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

363
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,295
no one onboard was injured,

364
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:59,774
<i>and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.</i>

365
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:07,112
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

366
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,287
I do not know.

367
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,517
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

368
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:18,019
James T. Kirk, step forward.

369
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,694
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

370
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,529
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

371
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,094
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

372
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,676
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

373
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:38,277
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

374
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:44,445
Step forward, please.

375
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:48,684
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

376
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:52,751
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

377
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:57,490
- Commander?
- Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

378
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,967
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

379
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,937
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

380
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,267
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular, you cheated.

381
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:12,843
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

382
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,884
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

383
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,886
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

384
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:20,548
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

385
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:24,218
- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
- Then not only did you violate the rules,

386
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,296
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

387
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:27,886
Please, enlighten me.

388
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,193
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

389
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,461
a captain cannot cheat death.

390
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:36,900
I of all people?

391
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:40,306
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel

392
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,071
before being killed in action, did he not?

393
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,942
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

394
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,174
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

395
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:49,775
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose is to experience fear,

396
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,655
fear in the face of certain death.

397
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:56,886
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

398
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,395
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

399
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,430
Excuse me, sir.

400
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,533
We've received a distress call
from Vulcan.

401
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:16,703
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

402
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:21,216
I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

403
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:31,752
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I don't know, but I like him.

404
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:39,263
<i>Fugeman, Regula One!
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut!</i>

405
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,634
<i>McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise!
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott!</i>

406
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:46,231
<i>Rader, U.S.S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.</i>

407
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,570
He didn't call my name.

408
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:55,978
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

409
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:57,618
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

410
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,588
That means you're grounded
until the Academy Board rules.

411
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,454
All right, listen up! I'm gonna read
this list one time, and one time only!

412
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:08,388
Jim, the Board will rule in your favor.
Most likely.

413
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,658
- Look, Jim, I gotta go.
- Yeah.

414
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,870
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

415
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,642
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

416
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:31,748
Damn it.

417
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,825
<i>- Come with me.
- U.S.S. Newton! Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut!</i>

418
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:41,659
<i>Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares!
Go to your stations and good luck.</i>

419
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,831
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

420
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,665
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

421
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:54,141
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

422
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:56,371
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate

423
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,608
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

424
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,980
"an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies"

425
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:05,452
- in subspace transmissions tests?
- Consistently, yes.

426
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:07,523
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

427
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:10,650
<i>is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,
I'm assigned to the Farragut?</i>

428
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:13,922
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

429
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,498
<i>No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.</i>

430
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:22,796
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

431
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,968
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

432
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:27,703
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

433
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,076
Take a seat. I'm gonna give you
a vaccine against viral infection

434
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:35,015
- from Melvaran mud fleas.
- What for?

435
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:37,313
- To give you the symptoms.
- What are you talking about?

436
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,650
You're gonna start to lose vision
in your left eye.

437
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:40,916
Yeah, I already have.

438
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:43,719
Oh, and you're gonna get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

439
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,954
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah. You owe me one.

440
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:52,927
<i>Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.</i>

441
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,526
Medical code states the treatment

442
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,629
and transport of a patient is
to be determined

443
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,800
at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

444
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,775
So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

445
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:04,244
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

446
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,178
<i>why the Enterprise warped into a crisis</i>

447
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:09,116
without one of its senior
medical officers?

448
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,677
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

449
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,271
- I might throw up on you.
- Jim, you've got to look at this.

450
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:36,640
- Jim, look.
- What?

451
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:37,713
Look.

452
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:38,370
- We need to get you changed.
- I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

453
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:41,137
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

454
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:00,858
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

455
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,966
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

456
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,365
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

457
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:09,870
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

458
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:13,875
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

459
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:17,142
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

460
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,544
Helm, thrusters.

461
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:20,980
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

462
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,245
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

463
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:36,326
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

464
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:40,494
- Set a course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

465
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,205
Maximum warp. Punch it.

466
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,021
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

467
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:06,186
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

468
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,763
I'm Hikaru Sulu.

469
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:11,197
- And you are a pilot, right?
- Very much so, sir.

470
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:14,668
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

471
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,707
- Is the parking brake on?
- No. I'll figure it out. I'm just...

472
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:22,073
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

473
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:28,175
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

474
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,249
- Where are we?
- Medical Bay.

475
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,191
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

476
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:40,990
- Hi! How are you?
- Come here.

477
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:44,624
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

478
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:47,828
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- I wish I didn't know you.

479
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:49,734
Don't be such an infant.

480
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,699
How long is it supposed to...

481
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:54,741
Unbelievable.

482
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,545
- Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
- Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

483
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:02,448
- Chanko? Cherpov?
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

484
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:06,079
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

485
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,884
Yes, sir. Happy to.

486
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:12,422
Ensign authorization code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

487
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,497
<i>Authorization not recognized.</i>

488
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,758
Ensign authorization code

489
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:21,132
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

490
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:26,006
May I have your attention, please?

491
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:32,042
At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.

492
00:42:32,348 --> 00:42:35,613
What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

493
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:40,649
<i>Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command</i>

494
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,382
<i>that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.</i>

495
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,694
<i>Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan</i>

496
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:52,063
<i>and assist in evacuations if necessary.</i>

497
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:57,368
<i>We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.</i>

498
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:03,741
- Lightning storm.
- Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

499
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,378
- Good God, man.
- What?

500
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:12,553
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine, damn it!

501
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:14,816
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone!

502
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:16,623
Yes, sir!

503
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:21,728
<i>... appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.</i>

504
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:24,026
- Hey!
- We gotta stop the ship.

505
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:28,298
Jim! I'm not kidding!
We need to keep your heart rate down!

506
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:30,004
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

507
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,233
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

508
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:35,470
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim, stand still!

509
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:38,345
Stop it!

510
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:48,987
- Uhura! Uhura...
- Kirk! What are you doing here?

511
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:51,026
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

512
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:53,061
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

513
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:55,096
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

514
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:56,688
- What?
- And was the ship...

515
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,857
Was the ship what?

516
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,367
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

517
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,438
- Numb tongue?
- I can fix that.

518
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,473
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

519
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:06,371
- What? I...
- Romulan.

520
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:07,602
- Romulan?
- Yeah!

521
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,007
- Yes.
- Yes?

522
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,079
Damn it!

523
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,245
<i>Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.</i>

524
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:50,543
- Jim!
- What's going on?

525
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:51,677
- Jim, come back!
- Kirk!

526
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,585
- Captain! Captain Pike, sir...
- Jim, come back here!

527
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,123
...we have to stop the ship!
- Kirk, how the hell

528
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,748
<i>did you get onboard the Enterprise?</i>

529
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:58,588
Captain, this man's under the influence

530
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,185
- of a severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, please...

531
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:01,991
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

532
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:03,531
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

533
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:04,964
It's being attacked by Romulans.

534
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:08,401
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day.

535
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:09,801
McCoy, take him back to medical.

536
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:11,464
- We'll have words later.
- Aye, Captain.

537
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:13,041
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

538
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:14,871
Mr. Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

539
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,240
- I get it. You're a great arguer.
- By Regulations...

540
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,041
- I'd love to do it again.
...that makes him a stowaway.

541
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:19,409
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

542
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:21,005
- Kirk...
- This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

543
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:24,086
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

544
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:25,848
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

545
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:27,684
Based on what facts?

546
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:32,526
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

547
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,563
also occurred on the day of my birth,

548
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:37,497
<i>before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.</i>

549
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,625
You know that, sir,
I read your dissertation.

550
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,330
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

551
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,133
was never seen or heard from again.

552
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,208
<i>The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,</i>

553
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:49,073
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

554
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:52,613
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

555
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:56,014
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

556
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,917
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

557
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,623
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

558
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:07,361
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

559
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:10,523
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

560
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:13,461
The cadet's logic is sound.

561
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,028
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

562
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,004
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

563
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:21,042
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

564
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:24,477
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

565
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,548
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

566
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:28,207
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

567
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:31,377
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,178
<i>Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.</i>

569
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,757
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

570
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:38,053
but we seem to have lost all contact.

571
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:40,857
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission,

572
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:45,400
- or transmission of any kind in the area.
- It's because they're being attacked.

573
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:49,739
Shields up. Red alert.

574
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,104
Shields up. Red alert.

575
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,110
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

576
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,610
Four, three, two...

577
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:01,815
- Emergency evasive!
- On it, sir.

578
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:12,085
- Damage report!
- Deflector shields are holding.

579
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:14,254
All stations! Engineer Olson, report!

580
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,169
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

581
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,742
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

582
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:49,021
Sir, there's another Federation ship!

583
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,191
- Destroy it, too.
- Fire torpedoes.

584
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,494
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

585
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:55,036
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

586
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:05,403
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

587
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,915
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

588
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,075
Get me Starfleet Command.

589
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:12,313
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

590
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:13,649
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

591
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:15,280
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

592
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:17,484
- and transporter abilities.
- All power to forward shields.

593
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:18,958
Prepare to fire all weapons.

594
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,124
- Weapons ready.
- Wait!

595
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:29,196
- The hull. Magnify.
- Yes, sir.

596
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:36,236
Captain, we're being hailed.

597
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:38,473
<i>Hello.</i>

598
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:43,283
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

599
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:45,445
<i>Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero.</i>

600
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,386
You've declared war
against the Federation.

601
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,550
Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

602
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,959
<i>- at a neutral location.
- I do not speak for the Empire.</i>

603
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,553
<i>We stand apart.</i>

604
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,830
<i>As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?</i>

605
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,303
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

606
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,105
<i>No, we're not. Not yet.</i>

607
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,343
<i>Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.</i>

608
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:18,411
<i>Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.</i>

609
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,923
<i>As you can see by the rest
of your armada, you have no choice.</i>

610
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:27,488
<i>You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.</i>

611
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,529
<i>That is all.</i>

612
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,473
- He'll kill you. You know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

613
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:43,545
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

614
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:45,375
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

615
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:47,141
I understand that.

616
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:51,181
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

617
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:54,518
- I have training, sir.
- Come with me.

618
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:57,722
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

619
00:49:57,827 --> 00:50:00,523
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

620
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,585
Prepare the red matter.

621
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:26,351
Yes, sir.

622
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:07,088
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

623
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:09,221
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

624
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:14,235
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

625
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,332
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

626
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,568
that's scrambling our gear.
You'll get inside, you'll disable it,

627
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:21,973
then you'll beam back to the ship.

628
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,570
<i>Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.</i>

629
00:51:25,781 --> 00:51:28,181
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

630
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:31,185
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

631
00:51:31,287 --> 00:51:33,084
And if all else fails, fall back

632
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,248
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

633
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,757
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

634
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:38,224
- What?
- Captain?

635
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:41,319
Please, I apologize, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

636
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,992
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I'm not the Captain, you are.

637
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,400
Let's go.

638
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,738
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

639
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,175
Well, I guess you'll have to come
and get me.

640
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:58,746
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

641
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,716
Dr. Puri, report.

642
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,694
It's McCoy.
Dr. Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

643
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:19,864
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

644
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,436
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

645
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:24,573
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!

646
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:28,439
<i>Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.</i>

647
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:30,944
<i>Interval check shows
positive and steady.</i>

648
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:33,639
- You got the charges, right?
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:36,547
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

650
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:38,517
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

651
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:45,918
<i>Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.</i>

652
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,174
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

653
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:01,641
Fencing.

654
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:06,142
Pre-jump.

655
00:53:10,486 --> 00:53:13,978
<i>Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.</i>

656
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,397
<i>Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.</i>

657
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:25,490
<i>We have one shot
to land on that platform.</i>

658
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:28,797
<i>They may have defenses,
so pull your chute as late as possible.</i>

659
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:31,839
Three, two, one.

660
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:35,771
<i>Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back</i>

661
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:37,345
<i>until you turn off that drill.</i>

662
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:40,405
Good luck.

663
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:04,929
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

664
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,439
Twenty thousand meters.

665
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,295
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 meters.

666
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:37,395
<i>Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 meters.</i>

667
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:42,109
Forty-six hundred meters
from the platform.

668
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:43,610
Forty-five hundred meters to target.

669
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:47,081
Four thousand meters.

670
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,310
- Three thousand meters.
- Three thousand meters.

671
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,511
- Two thousand meters.
- Pulling chute.

672
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,658
- Two thousand meters!
- Come on, pull your chute, Olson!

673
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,863
No, not yet! Not yet! 1,500 meters!

674
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:07,527
- Olson, open your chute!
- Olson, pull your chute!

675
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:09,331
One thousand meters!

676
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:15,767
No!

677
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:23,011
Olson!

678
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:25,652
Olson is gone, sir!

679
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,536
Kirk has landed, sir.

680
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,928
Give me your hand! Come on.

681
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,006
Olson had the charges.

682
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:04,072
I know.

683
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:08,543
- What do we do?
- This.

684
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:24,662
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are reestablished.

685
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,168
- Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
- Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

686
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,703
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

687
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:32,000
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

688
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:40,679
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

689
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:41,977
Launch the red matter.

690
00:58:57,032 --> 00:59:00,126
<i>Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched
something at the planet</i>

691
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:01,566
through the hole they just drilled.

692
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:04,030
<i>- Do you copy, Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.</i>

693
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:05,629
- Analyzing data now.
- Transporter is now operational.

694
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:08,539
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

695
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,703
If my calculations are correct,

696
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:15,876
they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

697
00:59:18,287 --> 00:59:21,654
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

698
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,419
- Yes, sir.
- How long does the planet have?

699
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:28,393
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

700
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:31,959
Alert Vulcan Command Center
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

701
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,432
- all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, wait!

702
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:35,298
- Maintain standard orbit.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:37,463
- Where are you going?
- To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

704
00:59:37,573 --> 00:59:39,564
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

705
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:41,768
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

706
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,311
<i>It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.</i>

707
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:46,108
I must get them myself.

708
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,410
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye.

709
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,720
<i>- Kirk to Enterprise! Beam us out of here!
- Stand by. Locking on your signal.</i>

710
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:59,990
- Retract the drill. Let's move out.
- Yes, sir. Pull it up!

711
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:06,093
<i>I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move!</i>

712
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:07,862
- Kirk!
- Sulu!

713
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:16,669
Sulu!

714
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,213
Hold on!

715
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,380
I got you! Now pull my chute!

716
01:00:32,494 --> 01:00:37,625
<i>Kirk to Enterprise! We're falling
without a chute! Beam us up!</i>

717
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,598
<i>- I'm trying. I can't lock on to your signal.
- Beam us up!</i>

718
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:41,328
<i>- You're moving too fast.
- Beam us up!</i>

719
01:00:41,503 --> 01:00:43,698
I can do that. I can do that!

720
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,201
- Take the conn!
- Aye, sir.

721
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,366
The black hole's expanding.

722
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:49,774
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

723
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,138
Move, move, move, move, move!

724
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:55,079
I can do that! I can do that!
Move, move, move, move!

725
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:57,844
Quick, give me manual control!
I can lock on!

726
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:59,284
<i>Beam us up!</i>

727
01:01:01,423 --> 01:01:02,856
<i>Enterprise, where are you?</i>

728
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,653
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

729
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,059
Now, now, now! Do it now!
Now, now, now, now!

730
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:13,624
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on! Hold on!
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

731
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,164
Gotcha!

732
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:32,453
- Thanks.
- No problem.

733
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:37,387
Clear the pad.
I'm beaming to the surface.

734
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:39,888
The surface of what?

735
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:42,492
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

736
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,663
Spock, you can't do that!

737
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:46,358
- Energize.
- Spock!

738
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:26,904
- Spock!
- The planet has only seconds left.

739
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,169
We must evacuate.

740
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:30,475
Mother, now!

741
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:55,475
<i>- Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
- Locking volume.</i>

742
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:57,636
<i>Don't move. Stay right where you are.</i>

743
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:08,146
Transport in five, four, three, two...

744
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:12,788
- Mother!
- I'm losing her!

745
01:03:13,028 --> 01:03:14,893
I'm losing her! I'm losing her!

746
01:03:14,997 --> 01:03:17,090
No! I lost her. I lost her.

747
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:17,653
<i>Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 2258.42.</i>

748
01:04:18,861 --> 01:04:20,988
<i>We have had no word
from Captain Pike.</i>

749
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:23,892
<i>I have therefore classified him</i>

750
01:04:23,999 --> 01:04:26,866
<i>a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.</i>

751
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,200
<i>Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet</i>

752
01:04:29,304 --> 01:04:31,966
<i>and most of its six billion inhabitants.</i>

753
01:04:33,642 --> 01:04:35,974
<i>While the essence of our culture
has been saved</i>

754
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:39,138
<i>in the elders
who now reside upon this ship,</i>

755
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:43,410
<i>I estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.</i>

756
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:50,087
<i>I am now a member
of an endangered species.</i>

757
01:05:17,753 --> 01:05:19,050
I'm sorry.

758
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:22,820
I'm sorry.

759
01:05:24,693 --> 01:05:26,160
I'm so sorry.

760
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,234
What do you need? Tell me.

761
01:05:43,212 --> 01:05:44,440
Tell me.

762
01:05:52,988 --> 01:05:58,016
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

763
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:07,026
Okay.

764
01:06:25,954 --> 01:06:28,616
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

765
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,259
I only have one for you.

766
01:06:32,928 --> 01:06:37,262
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

767
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:39,926
specifically those surrounding Earth.

768
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:44,901
Christopher, answer my question.

769
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:47,066
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

770
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:49,974
- against a peaceful planet.
- No, I prevented genocide.

771
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:58,846
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

772
01:06:58,954 --> 01:07:01,855
I chose a life of honest labor

773
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:06,155
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

774
01:07:06,261 --> 01:07:10,925
I was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing

775
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:14,400
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

776
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,403
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us!

777
01:07:17,506 --> 01:07:19,371
No, you're confused.

778
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:21,635
You've been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

779
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,176
It's out there right now.

780
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:25,269
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

781
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,245
It has happened! I watched it happen!

782
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:30,409
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

783
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:38,823
And when I lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

784
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:43,858
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

785
01:07:43,966 --> 01:07:46,730
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

786
01:07:47,703 --> 01:07:49,898
But I did not forget the pain.

787
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:54,809
It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

788
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:58,743
My purpose, Christopher,

789
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:02,476
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

790
01:08:04,186 --> 01:08:08,680
but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

791
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,354
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

792
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:20,200
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

793
01:08:20,302 --> 01:08:22,202
starting with yours.

794
01:08:23,038 --> 01:08:25,632
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

795
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:32,908
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defenses.

796
01:08:35,784 --> 01:08:37,376
Centaurian slugs.

797
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:40,783
They latch on to your brain stem

798
01:08:41,957 --> 01:08:45,120
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

799
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:47,996
Frequencies, please, sir.

800
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:50,924
<i>Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...</i>

801
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:52,432
As you wish.

802
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:01,940
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

803
01:09:02,044 --> 01:09:05,138
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

804
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,909
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Earth may be his next stop,

805
01:09:08,016 --> 01:09:10,849
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

806
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:12,419
Out of the chair.

807
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:16,719
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

808
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:19,487
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

809
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:21,186
That is not it.

810
01:09:21,296 --> 01:09:22,729
He said he wanted me
to see something,

811
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:24,230
the destruction of my home planet.

812
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,392
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

813
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:28,469
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

814
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,367
The engineering comprehension
necessary

815
01:09:30,472 --> 01:09:33,930
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

816
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,340
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

817
01:09:36,445 --> 01:09:38,572
to create a tunnel through space-time.

818
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,705
Damn it, man,
I'm a doctor, not a physicist.

819
01:09:40,816 --> 01:09:42,443
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

820
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:45,543
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable,

821
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:47,747
- must be the truth.
- How poetic.

822
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:51,622
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

823
01:09:51,727 --> 01:09:54,218
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

824
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:55,990
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

825
01:09:56,098 --> 01:09:58,066
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

826
01:09:58,166 --> 01:10:00,259
We are technologically outmatched
in every way.

827
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:02,496
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

828
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:05,368
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

829
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:07,567
Then what about
assigning engineering crews

830
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:10,042
- to try and boost our warp yield?
- Remaining crew are repairing

831
01:10:10,145 --> 01:10:12,010
- radiation leaks on the lower decks...
- Okay! All right!

832
01:10:12,114 --> 01:10:13,843
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which

833
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:15,678
- we cannot contact Starfleet.
- There's got to be some way...

834
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:18,116
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet

835
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,949
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

836
01:10:20,055 --> 01:10:21,579
There won't be a next engagement.

837
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:24,591
By the time we've gathered,
it'll be too late.

838
01:10:24,693 --> 01:10:27,093
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's gonna happen?

839
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:29,322
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

840
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:32,992
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

841
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:35,831
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

842
01:10:35,971 --> 01:10:37,563
<i>beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin,</i>

843
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:38,661
culminating in the events of today,

844
01:10:38,774 --> 01:10:41,208
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

845
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:44,039
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

846
01:10:44,146 --> 01:10:45,670
An alternate reality.

847
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:47,783
Precisely.

848
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:52,443
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

849
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:55,113
our destinies have changed.

850
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:57,691
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

851
01:10:57,793 --> 01:10:59,055
Spock, don't do that.

852
01:10:59,161 --> 01:11:02,927
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive waste of time.

853
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:05,192
These are the orders issued
by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

854
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,097
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

855
01:11:07,202 --> 01:11:08,669
Spock, you are Captain now.
You have to make...

856
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,203
I am aware of my responsibilities,
Mr. Kirk.

857
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,671
Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

858
01:11:12,774 --> 01:11:14,742
That is correct, and why
I'm instructing you to accept the fact

859
01:11:14,843 --> 01:11:17,368
- that I alone am in command.
- I will not allow us to go backwards...

860
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:19,071
- Jim, he's the Captain!
...away from the problem,

861
01:11:19,181 --> 01:11:22,708
- instead of hunting Nero down!
- Security, escort him out.

862
01:11:29,224 --> 01:11:32,387
- Hey!
- Enough, Jim!

863
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,995
Get him off this ship.

864
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,289
<i>- Computer, where am I?
- Location, Delta Vega.</i>

865
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:05,488
<i>Class-M planet. Unsafe.</i>

866
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:08,862
<i>There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometers to the northwest.</i>

867
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,156
<i>Remain in your pod</i>

868
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:12,862
<i>- until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.
- You gotta be kidding me.</i>

869
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:58,712
Stardate 2258.42.

870
01:12:59,451 --> 01:13:03,319
Or 44. Whatever.

871
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:07,050
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

872
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:11,721
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

873
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,060
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

874
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,397
James T. Kirk.

875
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:31,199
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

876
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:35,206
How do you know my name?

877
01:15:36,308 --> 01:15:39,937
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

878
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:48,308
- Look, I don't know you.
- I am Spock.

879
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:54,247
Bullshit.

880
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:58,157
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

881
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,823
Especially after the events of today.

882
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:04,793
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today,

883
01:16:04,903 --> 01:16:08,737
but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

884
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,331
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

885
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,343
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

886
01:16:13,445 --> 01:16:15,379
You are not the captain?

887
01:16:18,216 --> 01:16:23,813
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

888
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,484
By Nero.

889
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:34,557
What do you know about him?

890
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,560
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

891
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:44,341
- Please, allow me. It will be easier.
- What are you doing?

892
01:16:44,442 --> 01:16:47,036
Our minds, one and together.

893
01:16:49,848 --> 01:16:52,248
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

894
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:56,377
a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

895
01:16:57,555 --> 01:17:01,150
<i>That is where I'm from, Jim, the future.</i>

896
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:11,728
<i>A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.</i>

897
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,906
<i>I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.</i>

898
01:17:21,246 --> 01:17:23,441
<i>We outfitted our fastest ship.</i>

899
01:17:24,883 --> 01:17:27,317
<i>Using red matter,
I would create a black hole</i>

900
01:17:27,419 --> 01:17:29,353
<i>which would absorb the exploding star.</i>

901
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:33,987
<i>I was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.</i>

902
01:17:35,493 --> 01:17:38,519
<i>The supernova destroyed Romulus.</i>

903
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,996
<i>I had little time.</i>

904
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:52,574
<i>I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.</i>

905
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:11,828
<i>As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.</i>

906
01:18:12,197 --> 01:18:16,065
<i>He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.</i>

907
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:20,730
<i>In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.</i>

908
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,138
<i>Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.</i>

909
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:42,819
<i>Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.</i>

910
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,986
<i>But what was years for Nero</i>

911
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:48,465
<i>was only seconds for me.</i>

912
01:18:49,534 --> 01:18:51,661
<i>I went through the black hole.</i>

913
01:18:53,872 --> 01:18:56,204
<i>Nero was waiting for me.</i>

914
01:19:02,046 --> 01:19:05,174
<i>He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.</i>

915
01:19:07,051 --> 01:19:09,747
<i>He captured my vessel
and spared my life,</i>

916
01:19:11,055 --> 01:19:12,545
<i>for one reason.</i>

917
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,923
<i>So that I would know his pain.</i>

918
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:21,830
<i>He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.</i>

919
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:26,163
<i>As he was helpless to save his planet,</i>

920
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:29,568
<i>I would be helpless to save mine.</i>

921
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:36,703
<i>Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.</i>

922
01:19:37,549 --> 01:19:39,676
<i>Because I failed.</i>

923
01:19:42,253 --> 01:19:46,212
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

924
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,425
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

925
01:19:57,268 --> 01:20:00,294
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

926
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:03,505
Jim, we must go.

927
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:07,267
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

928
01:20:08,213 --> 01:20:12,081
Wait. Where you came from,

929
01:20:14,752 --> 01:20:16,481
did I know my father?

930
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:18,713
Yes.

931
01:20:19,557 --> 01:20:23,687
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

932
01:20:23,828 --> 01:20:27,525
<i>He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.</i>

933
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,461
Captain?

934
01:20:29,567 --> 01:20:32,695
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

935
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:43,345
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

936
01:20:43,448 --> 01:20:46,076
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

937
01:20:46,184 --> 01:20:49,585
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor.

938
01:20:50,989 --> 01:20:53,287
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

939
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,258
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

940
01:20:56,427 --> 01:20:57,985
Is that a thank-you?

941
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:00,758
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

942
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:02,628
Permission to speak freely, sir.

943
01:21:04,135 --> 01:21:07,571
- I welcome it.
- Do you? Okay, then.

944
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,305
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

945
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,876
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

946
01:21:12,977 --> 01:21:14,740
Probably. But the right one?

947
01:21:14,846 --> 01:21:16,279
You know, back home we got a saying,

948
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:17,780
"If you're gonna ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

949
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:20,180
"you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable."

950
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:21,547
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

951
01:21:21,653 --> 01:21:25,987
as a stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

952
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,388
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision!

953
01:21:28,493 --> 01:21:29,755
I intend to assist in the effort

954
01:21:29,861 --> 01:21:32,421
to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

955
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:36,397
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

956
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:39,470
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

957
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:42,035
Excuse me.

958
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:47,910
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

959
01:22:25,516 --> 01:22:26,676
Hello!

960
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,452
What?

961
01:23:14,599 --> 01:23:16,430
You realize how unacceptable this is?

962
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,933
- Fascinating.
- What?

963
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,468
Okay, I'm sure you're just
doing your job,

964
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,367
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

965
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,700
Six months I've been here,

966
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:25,901
living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal!

967
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,704
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

968
01:23:28,813 --> 01:23:30,678
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

969
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:32,647
For something
that was clearly an accident.

970
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:35,548
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

971
01:23:35,653 --> 01:23:37,712
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

972
01:23:37,822 --> 01:23:40,950
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

973
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:43,686
- Me.
- Get aff! Shut up!

974
01:23:43,795 --> 01:23:46,161
You don't eat anything!
You can eat, like, a bean,

975
01:23:46,264 --> 01:23:49,722
and you're done.
I'm talking about food. Real food.

976
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:52,234
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

977
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:54,236
You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott

978
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:56,533
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

979
01:23:56,641 --> 01:23:59,906
That's what I'm talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

980
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:01,478
I had a little debate with my instructor

981
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:05,675
on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

982
01:24:05,783 --> 01:24:09,685
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

983
01:24:09,787 --> 01:24:11,277
was limited to about 100 miles.

984
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:14,085
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

985
01:24:14,192 --> 01:24:16,160
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

986
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,921
which is easy, by the way,

987
01:24:18,029 --> 01:24:19,428
I could do it with a life-form.

988
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:22,693
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

989
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,429
- I know that dog. What happened to it?
- I'll tell you when it reappears.

990
01:24:26,537 --> 01:24:28,402
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

991
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:31,373
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

992
01:24:31,476 --> 01:24:34,707
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is traveling at warp speed?

993
01:24:34,812 --> 01:24:37,303
I think if that equation had been
discovered, I'd have heard about it.

994
01:24:37,415 --> 01:24:39,280
The reason you haven't heard of it,
Mr. Scott,

995
01:24:39,383 --> 01:24:42,181
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

996
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:50,524
- Are you from the future?
- Yeah, he is. I'm not.

997
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:53,923
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

998
01:24:54,098 --> 01:24:55,725
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

999
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:59,701
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

1000
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:00,896
On youse go.

1001
01:25:01,005 --> 01:25:04,031
<i>So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?</i>

1002
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:05,802
She is one well-endowed lady.

1003
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,901
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1004
01:25:08,012 --> 01:25:10,776
if you'll pardon
the engineering parlance.

1005
01:25:11,782 --> 01:25:14,444
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right,

1006
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:18,044
where you're from, what I've done,
which I don't, by the way,

1007
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,623
<i>you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise</i>

1008
01:25:20,725 --> 01:25:23,558
while she's traveling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1009
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:26,459
Get off there! It's not a climbing frame.

1010
01:25:26,564 --> 01:25:31,194
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1011
01:25:31,302 --> 01:25:34,169
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1012
01:25:34,272 --> 01:25:35,261
What's that?

1013
01:25:35,373 --> 01:25:38,433
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1014
01:25:40,745 --> 01:25:42,235
Get out of it.

1015
01:25:46,217 --> 01:25:47,309
Imagine that!

1016
01:25:47,418 --> 01:25:50,581
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1017
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,986
You're coming with us, right?

1018
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:58,254
- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
- Your...

1019
01:25:59,297 --> 01:26:01,424
He... The other Spock
is not gonna believe me.

1020
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:02,624
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened.

1021
01:26:02,733 --> 01:26:05,463
Under no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1022
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,628
You must promise me this.

1023
01:26:06,737 --> 01:26:09,865
You're telling me I can't tell you
that I'm following your own orders?

1024
01:26:09,974 --> 01:26:13,535
- Why not? What happens?
- Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1025
01:26:13,644 --> 01:26:17,136
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

1026
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:20,307
- How? Over your dead body?
- Preferably not.

1027
01:26:20,418 --> 01:26:23,410
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1028
01:26:23,521 --> 01:26:26,684
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer

1029
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:29,851
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand

1030
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:31,929
must resign said command.

1031
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:38,261
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1032
01:26:38,369 --> 01:26:41,361
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1033
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:45,474
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

1034
01:26:46,444 --> 01:26:49,208
What you must do is get me to show it.

1035
01:26:49,313 --> 01:26:52,805
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1036
01:26:57,288 --> 01:27:00,280
No, go. You cannae come with me.
Go on.

1037
01:27:02,059 --> 01:27:04,823
You know, coming back in time,
changing history,

1038
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:06,796
that's cheating.

1039
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:11,297
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1040
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:22,907
Live long and prosper.

1041
01:27:43,067 --> 01:27:44,500
Mr. Scott!

1042
01:27:49,674 --> 01:27:51,904
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

1043
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,177
Hold on a second!

1044
01:28:02,053 --> 01:28:03,042
Oh, no.

1045
01:28:06,691 --> 01:28:08,283
Don't worry, I...

1046
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,127
No. No!

1047
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,481
<i>Turbine release valve activated.</i>

1048
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,634
You all right? You all right?

1049
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:56,205
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1050
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:02,310
Captain Spock! Detecting unauthorized
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

1051
01:29:02,413 --> 01:29:03,573
Bring up the video.

1052
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,445
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1053
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,420
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1054
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:13,648
Set phasers to stun.

1055
01:29:25,703 --> 01:29:27,193
- Halt!
- No, no!

1056
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:33,940
Come with me, cupcake!

1057
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:43,277
- Who are you?
- I'm with him.

1058
01:29:43,387 --> 01:29:45,719
- He's with me.
- We are traveling at warp speed.

1059
01:29:45,823 --> 01:29:47,381
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1060
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:48,685
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1061
01:29:48,793 --> 01:29:51,921
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

1062
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:55,021
Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain.

1063
01:29:55,566 --> 01:29:56,590
What, did...

1064
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,760
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1065
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,430
- That doesn't make you angry.
- Are you a member of Starfleet?

1066
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,906
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1067
01:30:05,009 --> 01:30:07,170
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me

1068
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,610
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1069
01:30:09,713 --> 01:30:11,146
- Well...
- Don't answer him.

1070
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:12,943
You will answer me.

1071
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:18,176
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1072
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:22,490
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered,

1073
01:30:22,593 --> 01:30:25,687
- and you're not even upset.
- Lf you are presuming

1074
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:28,765
that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship,

1075
01:30:28,866 --> 01:30:30,595
- you are mistaken.
- And yet, you are the one

1076
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,499
who said fear was necessary
for command.

1077
01:30:33,604 --> 01:30:37,005
I mean, did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1078
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,600
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1079
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,940
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1080
01:30:42,046 --> 01:30:44,207
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

1081
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,614
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1082
01:30:48,252 --> 01:30:49,378
Or the need to stop at nothing

1083
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,477
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1084
01:30:51,622 --> 01:30:53,522
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1085
01:30:53,624 --> 01:30:55,785
It must not even compute for you.

1086
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,618
You never loved her!

1087
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:23,812
Spock!

1088
01:32:01,325 --> 01:32:03,850
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1089
01:32:04,261 --> 01:32:05,785
I hereby relinquish my command,

1090
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:09,923
based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

1091
01:32:10,034 --> 01:32:13,094
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1092
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:42,590
I like this ship! You know, it's exciting!

1093
01:32:45,369 --> 01:32:46,836
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1094
01:32:46,971 --> 01:32:51,271
Now we've got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1095
01:32:52,343 --> 01:32:53,469
Yeah, we do.

1096
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:56,636
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1097
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,840
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1098
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:06,278
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1099
01:33:08,092 --> 01:33:09,491
So do I.

1100
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:16,497
<i>Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.</i>

1101
01:33:18,168 --> 01:33:22,298
<i>Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.</i>

1102
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:26,139
<i>I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,</i>

1103
01:33:26,243 --> 01:33:28,609
<i>but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.</i>

1104
01:33:28,712 --> 01:33:31,943
<i>I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.</i>

1105
01:33:32,383 --> 01:33:36,080
Either we're going down or they are.

1106
01:33:37,688 --> 01:33:38,916
Kirk out.

1107
01:33:46,397 --> 01:33:48,262
Speak your mind, Spock.

1108
01:33:51,201 --> 01:33:52,862
That would be unwise.

1109
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:56,971
What is necessary is never unwise.

1110
01:33:58,308 --> 01:34:01,505
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1111
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:06,245
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1112
01:34:08,052 --> 01:34:09,952
I am grateful for this.

1113
01:34:11,955 --> 01:34:12,956
And for you.

1114
01:34:12,956 --> 01:34:13,320
And for you.

1115
01:34:15,292 --> 01:34:18,523
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

1116
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,091
An anger I cannot control.

1117
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:31,330
I believe that she would say,

1118
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:34,434
"Do not try to."

1119
01:34:35,846 --> 01:34:40,715
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1120
01:34:44,755 --> 01:34:46,916
I married her because I loved her.

1121
01:34:55,132 --> 01:34:57,862
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1122
01:34:57,968 --> 01:35:00,368
We can't just go in there guns blazing,
Jim, not with their technology.

1123
01:35:00,471 --> 01:35:02,598
I'm telling you, the math doesn't support
what you're suggesting.

1124
01:35:02,706 --> 01:35:04,833
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!
- Yes, Mr. Chekov. What is it?

1125
01:35:04,942 --> 01:35:07,035
<i>Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan,</i>

1126
01:35:07,144 --> 01:35:10,375
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1127
01:35:10,481 --> 01:35:13,746
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1128
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:16,183
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1129
01:35:16,286 --> 01:35:20,916
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

1130
01:35:21,024 --> 01:35:23,618
the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings

1131
01:35:23,727 --> 01:35:25,922
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1132
01:35:26,063 --> 01:35:28,395
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated,

1133
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:31,662
- we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
- Aye, that might work.

1134
01:35:32,402 --> 01:35:33,960
Wait a minute, kid. How old are you?

1135
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:36,767
- Seventeen, sir.
- Oh, good, he's 17.

1136
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:38,501
Doctor.

1137
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:42,010
Mr. Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

1138
01:35:42,412 --> 01:35:44,346
If Mr. Sulu is able
to maneuver us into position,

1139
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:47,178
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1140
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:50,048
and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

1141
01:35:50,154 --> 01:35:52,816
I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock.

1142
01:35:52,923 --> 01:35:55,949
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1143
01:35:56,059 --> 01:35:58,084
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1144
01:35:58,195 --> 01:36:01,323
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1145
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:04,667
Also, my mother was human,

1146
01:36:04,768 --> 01:36:07,760
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1147
01:36:14,011 --> 01:36:16,104
Then I'm coming with you.

1148
01:36:16,213 --> 01:36:20,240
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1149
01:36:22,019 --> 01:36:24,783
See? We are
getting to know each other.

1150
01:36:40,804 --> 01:36:41,896
Prepare the drill.

1151
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:03,683
All stop in three, two, one.

1152
01:37:09,266 --> 01:37:11,826
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1153
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:13,800
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1154
01:37:13,904 --> 01:37:16,099
- Aye.
- Fire.

1155
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,096
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

1156
01:37:46,203 --> 01:37:48,637
Really? Fine job, Mr. Sulu. Well done.

1157
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,606
- How are we, Scotty?
- Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

1158
01:37:56,813 --> 01:37:58,906
Whatever happens, Mr. Sulu,

1159
01:37:59,016 --> 01:38:00,711
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1160
01:38:00,817 --> 01:38:04,378
you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

1161
01:38:05,956 --> 01:38:07,082
Yes, sir.

1162
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:11,183
<i>Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.</i>

1163
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,488
Good luck.

1164
01:38:25,475 --> 01:38:28,376
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1165
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:33,149
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1166
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,764
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1167
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:54,734
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense

1168
01:38:54,838 --> 01:38:56,100
in the design of the enemy ship,

1169
01:38:56,206 --> 01:38:58,140
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1170
01:38:58,241 --> 01:39:00,937
- Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
- Energize.

1171
01:39:44,254 --> 01:39:46,620
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1172
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,082
<i>- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.</i>

1173
01:39:53,897 --> 01:39:54,955
Ayel!

1174
01:40:09,746 --> 01:40:10,906
I'll cover you.

1175
01:40:11,415 --> 01:40:13,315
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, I got you.

1176
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:36,435
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

1177
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:39,967
And Captain Pike.

1178
01:41:02,732 --> 01:41:03,926
Move!

1179
01:41:04,468 --> 01:41:06,527
They have activated the drill.

1180
01:41:07,737 --> 01:41:09,329
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1181
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:10,906
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1182
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:12,634
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1183
01:41:12,742 --> 01:41:14,300
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1184
01:41:33,563 --> 01:41:34,928
I foresee a complication.

1185
01:41:35,031 --> 01:41:37,625
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1186
01:41:37,734 --> 01:41:40,726
<i>Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.</i>

1187
01:41:40,837 --> 01:41:42,930
<i>Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.</i>

1188
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:44,529
Wow, that's weird.

1189
01:41:45,675 --> 01:41:48,508
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1190
01:41:48,612 --> 01:41:53,049
<i>Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.</i>

1191
01:41:56,019 --> 01:41:58,579
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1192
01:41:58,688 --> 01:42:00,679
You're gonna be able
to fly this thing, right?

1193
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:03,224
Something tells me I already have.

1194
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:05,384
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1195
01:42:06,596 --> 01:42:09,929
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1196
01:42:10,033 --> 01:42:12,058
- It'll work.
- In the event that I do not return,

1197
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:14,159
- please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
- Spock!

1198
01:42:14,271 --> 01:42:15,966
Lt'll work.

1199
01:42:25,782 --> 01:42:27,249
Fascinating.

1200
01:42:35,892 --> 01:42:37,883
<i>Start-up sequence initiated.</i>

1201
01:43:22,205 --> 01:43:24,230
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1202
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:37,887
I know your face from Earth's history.

1203
01:44:22,999 --> 01:44:26,491
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1204
01:44:26,603 --> 01:44:28,969
<i>He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

1205
01:44:29,072 --> 01:44:30,403
But that was another life.

1206
01:44:31,274 --> 01:44:34,334
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1207
01:45:06,943 --> 01:45:11,141
<i>Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship has been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.</i>

1208
01:45:11,581 --> 01:45:12,548
Spock!

1209
01:45:14,384 --> 01:45:15,908
Spock!

1210
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:34,969
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir!

1211
01:45:36,773 --> 01:45:39,708
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1212
01:45:39,976 --> 01:45:42,035
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1213
01:45:42,145 --> 01:45:43,271
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1214
01:45:43,513 --> 01:45:45,481
<i>- No terms. No deals.
- That ship, take it out.</i>

1215
01:45:45,582 --> 01:45:46,776
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1216
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:48,316
- you'll destroy...
- I want Spock dead now!

1217
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,097
- He went to warp, sir.
- Go after him!

1218
01:46:06,202 --> 01:46:07,430
Yes, sir!

1219
01:46:37,634 --> 01:46:40,660
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1220
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:44,130
- I can't...
- You can't what?

1221
01:46:44,307 --> 01:46:45,831
You can't even speak.

1222
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:51,174
- What?
- I got your gun.

1223
01:47:17,907 --> 01:47:18,965
What's he doing?

1224
01:47:19,442 --> 01:47:22,309
<i>Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.</i>

1225
01:47:23,112 --> 01:47:24,101
Fire everything!

1226
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:35,685
<i>Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.</i>

1227
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:37,190
Understood.

1228
01:47:43,533 --> 01:47:45,023
Captain, I've picked up another ship!

1229
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,984
- What are you doing here?
- Just following orders.

1230
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:30,971
<i>Enterprise, now!</i>

1231
01:48:54,404 --> 01:48:56,133
Nice timing, Scotty!

1232
01:48:57,073 --> 01:49:01,009
I've never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before!

1233
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:02,941
- Jim!
- Bones!

1234
01:49:03,046 --> 01:49:04,673
I got him.

1235
01:49:06,883 --> 01:49:07,907
That was pretty good!

1236
01:49:09,252 --> 01:49:12,449
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power! Their shields are down, sir.

1237
01:49:12,555 --> 01:49:13,954
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1238
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:51,991
<i>This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

1239
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:53,793
Your ship is compromised.

1240
01:49:53,896 --> 01:49:56,387
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1241
01:49:56,499 --> 01:49:58,296
which we are willing to provide.

1242
01:50:01,671 --> 01:50:04,071
- Captain, what are you doing?
- Showing them compassion

1243
01:50:04,173 --> 01:50:05,868
may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

1244
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:08,967
It's logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

1245
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:11,774
No, not really. Not this time.

1246
01:50:11,881 --> 01:50:16,341
<i>I would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.</i>

1247
01:50:16,452 --> 01:50:20,684
<i>I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.</i>

1248
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:22,587
You got it.

1249
01:50:22,692 --> 01:50:25,525
- Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.
- Yes, sir.

1250
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:13,004
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir!

1251
01:51:24,387 --> 01:51:26,378
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1252
01:51:26,489 --> 01:51:28,684
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1253
01:51:28,791 --> 01:51:30,122
You bet your ass, Captain!

1254
01:51:33,796 --> 01:51:35,821
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!
It's got us!

1255
01:51:35,932 --> 01:51:39,390
- Go to maximum warp! Push it!
- I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!

1256
01:51:48,778 --> 01:51:50,211
All she's got isn't good enough!

1257
01:51:50,313 --> 01:51:53,680
<i>- What else you got?
- Okay, if we eject the core and detonate,</i>

1258
01:51:53,783 --> 01:51:55,045
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1259
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:56,311
I cannae promise anything, though!

1260
01:51:59,956 --> 01:52:01,389
Do it, do it, do it!

1261
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:04,422
- Clear the area! Go!
- Yes, sir!

1262
01:53:32,014 --> 01:53:33,572
Father!

1263
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:43,687
I am not our father.

1264
01:53:51,367 --> 01:53:55,997
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1265
01:53:59,175 --> 01:54:00,301
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1266
01:54:00,409 --> 01:54:02,309
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1267
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:05,847
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you

1268
01:54:05,948 --> 01:54:08,576
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1269
01:54:08,684 --> 01:54:13,849
of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realize.

1270
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:17,884
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1271
01:54:17,994 --> 01:54:21,361
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1272
01:54:21,464 --> 01:54:23,864
- should he break his promise.
- You lied.

1273
01:54:25,334 --> 01:54:27,427
I... I implied.

1274
01:54:28,004 --> 01:54:29,995
- A gamble.
- An act of faith.

1275
01:54:31,107 --> 01:54:34,270
One I hope that you'll repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1276
01:54:34,377 --> 01:54:36,004
In the face of extinction, it is only logical

1277
01:54:36,112 --> 01:54:38,808
I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1278
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:41,178
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

1279
01:54:42,518 --> 01:54:45,214
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1280
01:54:45,688 --> 01:54:49,988
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1281
01:54:50,092 --> 01:54:53,789
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor.

1282
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:58,562
Put aside logic. Do what feels right.

1283
01:55:04,473 --> 01:55:08,136
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1284
01:55:08,244 --> 01:55:09,472
I shall simply say

1285
01:55:10,579 --> 01:55:11,978
good luck.

1286
01:55:22,925 --> 01:55:26,588
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1287
01:55:27,263 --> 01:55:30,630
Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1288
01:55:30,733 --> 01:55:33,395
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1289
01:55:33,502 --> 01:55:38,303
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1290
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:42,310
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1291
01:55:47,016 --> 01:55:48,984
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1292
01:55:49,085 --> 01:55:53,146
<i>you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1293
01:55:53,255 --> 01:55:54,950
for duty as his relief.

1294
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:05,594
I relieve you, sir.

1295
01:56:06,035 --> 01:56:07,832
I am relieved.

1296
01:56:09,672 --> 01:56:12,197
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

1297
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:16,007
Your father would be proud.

1298
01:56:45,508 --> 01:56:47,135
Thrusters on full.

1299
01:56:47,743 --> 01:56:50,507
Maneuvering thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1300
01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:53,273
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1301
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:55,976
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1302
01:57:00,523 --> 01:57:03,321
Bones! Buckle up.

1303
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:09,364
Scotty, how we doing?

1304
01:57:09,465 --> 01:57:12,127
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1305
01:57:13,202 --> 01:57:14,601
Get down!

1306
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,540
Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

1307
01:57:22,578 --> 01:57:24,978
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1308
01:57:25,381 --> 01:57:27,110
Permission granted.

1309
01:57:27,883 --> 01:57:29,942
As you have yet to select a first officer,

1310
01:57:30,052 --> 01:57:33,078
respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

1311
01:57:33,689 --> 01:57:37,056
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1312
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,824
It would be my honor, Commander.

1313
01:57:43,532 --> 01:57:45,932
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

1314
01:57:47,703 --> 01:57:49,568
Thrusters on standby.

1315
01:57:49,672 --> 01:57:51,970
- Take us out.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

1316
01:57:56,946 --> 01:58:00,177
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1317
01:58:02,017 --> 01:58:05,475
<i>These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.</i>

1318
01:58:06,522 --> 01:58:10,322
<i>Her ongoing mission,
