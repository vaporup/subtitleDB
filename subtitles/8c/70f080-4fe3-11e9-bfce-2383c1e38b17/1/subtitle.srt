Come over here.

18
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,269
- What are you good at?
- Kung fu and acrobatics.

19
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,068
Those are useless.
Can you handle math?

20
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,403
I can.

21
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:15,703
You have any references?

22
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,938
- What about money?
- I sure do.

23
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,912
Good. Thirty dollars.
Your name?

24
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,749
Cheng Wah Kuo, from Canton.
Do I have to pay right now?

25
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:26,184
Of course.
And the job is yours.

26
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:30,020
- Say, do you want the job or not?
- I do, but I only have 25.

27
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,615
You can pay me the rest later.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,093
Hold on to this paper and
report to the factory tomorrow.

29
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:37,325
Hurry! Gong Saang Textile
has 250 job openings.

30
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:40,424
Hurry before your chance is gone.
See how lucky you are?

31
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,664
Line up over there.

32
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,831
- Thanks.
- Two dollars to apply.

33
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:51,836
What are you guys doing here?
This is not Gong Saang Textile.

34
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,847
Each of us paid $2
to work here.

35
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,974
Two dollars? We're not hiring.

36
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,508
The address is correct,
but there's no such company.

37
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,147
It's hard to find a job
in Hong Kong.

38
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,317
Please leave.
You were conned.

39
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,891
You'd better leave now
or I'll call the police.

40
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,092
Help! Thief!

41
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,229
- Now what?
- He took us for a ride.

42
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:21,707
We're lucky.
One fool paid $30 to be a cashier.

43
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:24,836
- That poor guy.
- Pays to be cautious.

44
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,175
Hong Kong!

45
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:33,913
Everything is ready.

46
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,013
- Be careful.
- I know.

47
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,397
Are you all right, boss?
You don't look well.

48
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:55,567
- I can't find his stomach medication.
- What?

49
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:59,044
How could you forget to bring it?

50
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,546
Morons, all of you!

51
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,045
Who the hell
does he think he is?

52
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,053
Those jerks forgot to bring it.
Let's postpone the meeting.

53
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,386
- No, we can't back down.
- But, boss, the situation--

54
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,733
Maybe we can talk sense with him
if he's a reasonable man.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,363
You talk like an old lady.

56
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,929
In our business,
only the toughest survive.

57
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,171
That's why I like Fei.
He's tough.

58
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,247
My sunglasses.

59
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,222
You're late.

60
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,692
No, you're early.

61
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,365
You don't look well.
Are you okay?

62
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,095
Just get to the point.

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,637
Why did you want
to meet with me?

64
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,401
Good! Let's get to the point.

65
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:04,934
- Pai, remember your old partner Yang?
- Yes, but he's dead.

66
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,513
He owed me some money...

67
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,574
so he promised to give me
his partnership in the Ritz.

68
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,518
He might have, but I didn't.

69
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,216
Calm down.
No need to get angry.

70
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,259
Are you here to talk or not?

71
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:23,126
I came to tell you...

72
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,861
no one makes bargains with me!

73
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,530
You set me up?

74
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,905
Screw you!

75
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,071
Fire!

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,218
- Are you all right, boss?
- We'll cover you.

77
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,491
Buy your hot dumplings here!

78
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:04,800
Care to buy a flower, sir?

79
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,066
No, thanks.

80
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,132
Don't be too quick
to turn me away.

81
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,234
I'm not buying.

82
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,077
My rose will bring you luck.

83
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,316
First time here?

84
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,684
Yes.

85
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,054
- Be careful.
- After yesterday, I sure will.

86
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:28,587
Obviously, you're not careful enough.
Look at your luggage.

87
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:39,670
You need to be more careful, sir.

88
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,039
Wait a minute.

89
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,439
I'll buy a rose.

90
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,585
It will bring you good luck
from now on.

91
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:54,916
I hope so.

92
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,359
Thank you.

93
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:10,060
Watch out!
Let me help you.

94
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,529
Go away.

95
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:22,078
What do we do now?

96
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,002
Hold it right there!

97
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,542
- Don't shoot! I'm here to help.
- Thank you, young man.

98
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,941
Don't move.

99
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,079
Let's get going.

100
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:04,921
Boss, are you all right?

101
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,795
- What happened?
- Young man, give us a hand.

102
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,490
Who are you guys?

103
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,825
- I'll give you $100. Do it.
- One hundred dollars?

104
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,433
Hurry! This way.

105
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,500
- Where should I take him?
- Just get him out of here.

106
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,008
Go now.

107
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:33,484
Which way?

108
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,421
You're killing me.
Put me down.

109
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,185
Put him down.

110
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,053
Put me down.

111
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,924
Boss, are you okay?

112
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,469
My stomach! You're not helping.

113
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,969
- Over here.
- Keep a lookout.

114
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,532
Boss, how's your stomach?

115
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,809
Boss, are you all right?

116
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:03,714
Who should be your successor
if anything happens?

117
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:09,153
He-- Oh, my stomach--

118
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:10,789
Him?

119
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:15,591
- What?
- Boss, you really choose him?

120
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,188
I meant he--

121
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,798
Boss!

122
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,599
You all heard him.

123
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:32,942
We must obey his order.
It's not safe to stay here.

124
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,140
Boss, we'd better get going.

125
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:39,319
- From now on, you're the new boss.
- Me?

126
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:46,586
You're really fortunate
to be named boss.

127
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,027
I've spent all night trying to explain,
but you still don't get it.

128
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:52,292
See, you have fancy clothes now.

129
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:55,062
The way you make your living
is quite dangerous.

130
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,570
If it were safe,
I would take the job.

131
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:02,769
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Just do as I tell you.

132
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,246
Fei, the boss always called you
his right-hand man.

133
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,846
You could be the new boss.

134
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:20,189
If he didn't name me
his successor...

135
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,286
that means I'm disqualified.

136
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:26,993
Fei, you're the man.
But he's a nobody, isn't he?

137
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,627
- Right. Let's wait and see.
- Sure.

138
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,331
Sir, can you spare some change?

139
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,567
Take the money and leave.

140
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:40,273
Thank you, sir.

141
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,882
Make sure the coast is clear.
We'll enter from the back.

142
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,943
What if there's nothing happening?

143
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,046
Then you can polish the car.

144
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,648
How about buying a rose, sir?

145
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,955
- Beat it. Leave us alone.
- Let's go.

146
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,053
I'd like to buy a rose.

147
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,154
Wait.

148
00:10:57,231 --> 00:10:59,062
I'll buy a rose.

149
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:01,928
Good luck to you.

150
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,976
- Thank you for your kindness.
- Go now.

151
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,070
We'd better get going, boss.

152
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,550
Why isn't Fei the new leader?

153
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:22,055
- You want to work for him?
- What about you?

154
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:25,421
Anyone is okaywith me,
except him.

155
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:29,087
Even you could be
the new boss.

156
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:32,929
We're in the majority.
That gives us the upper hand.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,525
Fists are more powerful than words.
Let's fight it out.

158
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:41,868
I can't do this.
Don't make me do this.

159
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:46,038
We can't make you do it.
Take the back door and leave.

160
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:50,942
- Thank you.
- But you must be careful.

161
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,144
Why?

162
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:56,019
We won't protect you
if you're not our boss.

163
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,548
And if Tiger gets you,
you'll be in big trouble.

164
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,891
Why does Tiger have to pick on me?
I helped your boss--

165
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,953
Just why did you want
to help him?

166
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:07,364
I don't want to know
what there was between you two.

167
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,335
But I must obey his orders.

168
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,032
So whether I agree to be boss or not,
I'll be dead anyway.

169
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,905
Don't worry.
I'll help you.

170
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,942
See, you look like our late boss.

171
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,477
Just read this paper.

172
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,417
Let's go.

173
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:28,716
Teach him a lesson.

174
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,017
Don't be scared.

175
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:38,724
Guys, you all know that
Cheng Wah Kuo is our new boss.

176
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,357
Say something.

177
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:43,335
My dear brothers.

178
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,638
My dear brothers--

179
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,176
Can't you speak
without looking at the paper?

180
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:56,011
Honestly, I really don't know
how to be your boss.

181
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,416
If you ask me, I'll tell you no more
robberies or other crimes.

182
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,546
No shady deals,
no illegal operations.

183
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,652
Our new boss has
quite a sense of humor.

184
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,059
You need more than a sense of humor
to be our boss.

185
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:13,395
He has to really have something.

186
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,332
That's right.

187
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,633
Go arm wrestle with him, Tung.

188
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,833
- Me?
- Yeah. Arm wrestle with him.

189
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,968
- No problem. Ken, go with him.
- Sure.

190
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,777
Go.

191
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,223
Fatty, you'll be the referee.

192
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,022
Give us some room.

193
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,256
Ready? One, two, three.

194
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,511
Who burned me?

195
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:09,087
Gosh!
He's even stronger than Tung.

196
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:11,556
Great job, boss.
You're the best.

197
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,458
Seriously, someone
played a trick on me.

198
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:18,624
If it was about arm wresting, then Tung
should have been boss years ago.

199
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,224
Our business requires
fighting skills.

200
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:22,859
Yes.

201
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,961
Then you fight him.

202
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,574
You're on your own this time.

203
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:32,806
Let's both take him at once.

204
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
I believe you can handle
both of us at the same time.

205
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:03,973
Help!

206
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,656
Get him up.

207
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:26,926
Boss.

208
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,497
Our boss is the best.

209
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,376
He's the best.

210
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:52,689
Where's my letter?
And the hotel stationery?

211
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,954
Here.
Be careful with it.

212
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:58,464
The manager is watching.
He'll fire me if he finds out.

213
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:01,763
He won't. Take this rose.
It'll bring you luck.

214
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,899
At the gardenparty today...

215
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,877
Mr. Chow, the host,
asked about you.

216
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,914
Then I received your letter.

217
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:18,816
You said
Yen treats you very well.

218
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:23,550
I'm so happy for you.
He must be a handsome young man.

219
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,524
When your stepfather has time...

220
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:29,722
heand I wouldlike
to visit you and Yen in Shanghai.

221
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:34,165
We have to go to the dinner banquet
at the Indian consulate tonight.

222
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,294
I'm sure the main dish
will be chicken curry.

223
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,898
I'm sending you more money
this month.

224
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:44,740
I know you need more
because you're a big girl now.

225
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:49,510
The weather is getting cooler.
Take good care of yourself.

226
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,677
The chauffeur is waiting.
We have to go now.

227
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,813
I'll stop writing now.
"Mother"

228
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,227
This balance sheet is a mess.

229
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,252
This balance sheet is a mess.

230
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,695
The figures have been doctored.
What's going on?

231
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,666
You don't know Tiger.
Yang was framed by his plan.

232
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:11,500
I was trying to stop him
and protect our rights to the Ritz.

233
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,200
Can't we stay out
of such business?

234
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,538
You're the boss.
I'll do whatever you say.

235
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,908
Our guys will agree
as long as they can make a living.

236
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:21,140
Do you know some way to make
the restaurant more profitable?

237
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,182
I'll never run a casino.

238
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,343
How about a strip club?

239
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,858
Uncle Hai, a Miss Yang
wants to see you.

240
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,462
Miss Yang, this is Uncle Hai.

241
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:44,003
I'm Luming.

242
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:47,040
My father was the co-owner
of this restaurant.

243
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,076
You are Miss Yang?
I heard your father died in Shanghai.

244
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:55,276
Yes. That's why I've come:
because of my father's debt to you.

245
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:00,614
This is our new manager, Wah.

246
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:07,418
Before my father passed away,
he said he lost all the Ritz's shares...

247
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,793
and I should pay the money
back to you.

248
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,855
It's okay. Don't worry.

249
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:16,869
He meant you can pay us back
whenever you have the money.

250
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,702
I have a couple dollars on me.

251
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:25,006
Your father owed us
a couple thousand dollars.

252
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,514
- I could work for you for free.
- What can you do?

253
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,714
I was a performer
in a Shanghai nightclub.

254
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,219
Why did you quit the job?

255
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:38,155
The nightclub was closed down,
but it wasn't my fault.

256
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:42,017
Let me sing for you.

257
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:44,928
Hong Kong at night
The city that never sleeps

258
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,398
Pearl of the Orient

259
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:52,234
Listen to the symphony
of waves and tides

260
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,071
- That should be enough.
- Right.

261
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,239
We can open a nightclub
and make her our next hit.

262
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,043
Great idea.

263
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,826
One, two, three, four--

264
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,026
- Hurry up.
- No problem.

265
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,169
Be careful.

266
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,840
How much altogether?

267
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,708
- I am not an accountant.
- Bullshit!

268
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,839
Not here. Over there.
Take it back.

269
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,543
Someone is looking for you,
Uncle Hai.

270
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:42,452
Mr.Geung. Nice to see you.
I need to talk to you.

271
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:47,822
Are you remodeling the restaurant,
Mr. Kuo?

272
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,657
- Yes.
- Good luck to you.

273
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,391
Thank you.

274
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,937
Be careful!

275
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,873
- Boss.
- What's your problem?

276
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,538
Why does it take you so long?
Do you know how to write?

277
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,673
I'd be a teacher
if I was good at it.

278
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,944
Are you ready?
Look at the camera.

279
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,010
Okay.

280
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,265
Move it over here.

281
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,361
- Welcome, welcome.
- Step aside.

282
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:37,038
- Right here.
- Any reservations?

283
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,011
Tiger needs no reservations.
This way, please.

284
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:47,110
Thank you for coming.

285
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,485
This place looks nice.

286
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:52,889
This is Cheng Wah Kuo,
our new boss.

287
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,723
Kuo? What was your relationship
with Pai?

288
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,162
I was sure you were
one of his bastard sons.

289
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,371
Luming, hurry up.

290
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,775
What brings you here, Tiger?

291
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:17,681
I'm not trying to take over
this time.

292
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,151
You spent a lot on this place.

293
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,383
Let's consider what Yang owed me
to have been reinvested.

294
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:27,187
I am therefore entitled
to half of the Ritz.

295
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,251
Tiger, I think--

296
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,593
- Are you the manager?
- No, he is.

297
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,328
Then you'd better shut up.

298
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,768
We have no responsibility
for Yang's debts.

299
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,072
It cost us a lot, but we're not looking
for outside investors.

300
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:51,114
Gentlemen, allow me introduce
Miss Yang...

301
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,482
direct from Broadway
in New York City.

302
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,612
Don't test my patience.

303
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,381
Step back. Make way.

304
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:04,422
Turn on the lights.
This is a search.

305
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,897
Stop the music.
Remain in your seats.

306
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,731
- Turn off the spotlight.
- Bring up the house lights.

307
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,974
My name is Ho, chief inspector
for Hong Kong.

308
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,567
- We're here to check IDs.
- Check them out.

309
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,307
You are disturbing my customers,
Mr. Ho.

310
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,975
- Call me "Inspector"
- We have a business license, Inspector.

311
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,484
And we have a search warrant.

312
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,578
I didn't bring my ID.
Don't bother me.

313
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:31,351
What did you say?
No identification?

314
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,484
- What's the big deal?
- Prison-- that's the big deal.

315
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,825
How are you, sir?

316
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,834
- How's your supervisor, Mr. Laughton?
- He's fine, thank you.

317
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,497
You don't need to check their ID.
Go check other people.

318
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,268
What are you looking at?

319
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:50,400
Inspector,
we have a business to run.

320
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:52,468
I can come to your nightclub
whenever I want...

321
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:57,209
today, tomorrow,
or the day after tomorrow.

322
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:59,275
- Are you the owner?
- No. He is.

323
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:04,549
I'm Cheng Wah Kuo, the manager.

324
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,182
So you're the new boss.

325
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,194
Today is our grand opening.
I apologize for the inconvenience.

326
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,729
You look like a decent businessman.
I'll let you off this time.

327
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,894
But I would like
to have a word with you.

328
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,064
Sure. No problem.

329
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:22,801
Now what?

330
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:25,668
That's it for now.

331
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:29,407
This way, Inspector.

332
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:36,484
Please, have a seat.

333
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,889
I didn't come here
to have a seat.

334
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,896
- I am here because I found something.
- You found something?

335
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,829
Yes, something
that doesn't belong here.

336
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,135
I think there must be a mistake.
Everything you see here is paid for.

337
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,228
- I'm talking about you.
- Me? I don't belong here?

338
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,537
Look at those people downstairs.

339
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:02,878
They're nothing but a bunch
of thugs, thiefs and gangsters.

340
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:10,017
Don't you argue with me.

341
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,787
I think you are
the only one here...

342
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:18,355
who is a man of his word.

343
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:28,133
I want to save you
from this den of iniquity.

344
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,267
I want to give you
a special mission.

345
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,106
- Special mission?
- Yes.

346
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:33,668
From now on--

347
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:42,354
If you inform me
of all their criminal activities...

348
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:45,255
then I can put them behind bars.

349
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:51,321
You and I could become the greatest
crime fighters in Hong Kong's history.

350
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:54,793
I'm going to catch
every last one of them.

351
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,393
I do hope
you won't be among them.

352
00:24:58,271 --> 00:25:01,729
- Actually, I've been thinking about--
- You don't have to answer me now.

353
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:05,107
Think it over
and give me a call.

354
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:11,075
I have confidence in you.
Don't let me down.

355
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,619
I brought you two some tea, boss.

356
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:17,216
Thank you,
but I was about to leave.

357
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,155
What did he tell you?

358
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:21,216
Excuse me. I forgot my hat.

359
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:25,754
Carry on.

360
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:30,463
- What did he tell you?
- He said I'd better watch out.

361
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:35,736
No way. He thinks you are the only one
here who is a man of his word.

362
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,243
Did he give you
a special mission?

363
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,404
- No.
- I don't believe it.

364
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,883
Did he ask you to be his partner
and fight crime with him?

365
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:48,887
Did he say he has confidence in you
and you shouldn't let him down?

366
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:53,085
- How do you know everything he said?
- It's not just me. Everybody knows.

367
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,286
Even the doorman knows.

368
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:58,656
Let's go.

369
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,328
Sorry for the interruption.
The show will begin right away.

370
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:12,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Miss Yang.

371
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:30,693
Rose, Rose, I love you
with an aching heart

372
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,762
What is your future
Now we have to part

373
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:44,073
Standing on the jetty
as the steamer moves away

374
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:49,582
Flower of Malaya
I cannot stay

375
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:56,313
With an acting heart

376
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,483
Make way, oh, make way

377
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,460
For my eastern Rose

378
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,589
Men crowded in dozens

379
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,725
Everywhere she goes

380
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:11,599
In her rickshaw on the street

381
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,765
or in the cabaret

382
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,867
Please make way for Rose

383
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:21,107
You can hear them say

384
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,275
All my life I shall remember

385
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,841
Oriental music
and you in my arms

386
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,450
Perfumed flowers in your traces

387
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:38,759
Lotus-scented breezes
and swaying palms

388
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:45,771
With your almonde yes

389
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,329
Fragrant and slender

390
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:51,969
Beneath tropical skies

391
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,139
I must cross the seas again

392
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,150
And never see you more

393
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:04,088
Way back to my home
on a distant shore

394
00:28:57,043 --> 00:29:00,103
My ship is in the bay

395
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,841
Kiss me farewell now

396
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:06,373
There's nothing to say

397
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:11,947
East is East and West is West
Our worlds are far apart

398
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,287
I must leave you now

399
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:18,888
But with you

400
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:23,197
I leave my heart

401
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,976
Good.

402
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:37,278
Tell your boss that
I want to meet with him.

403
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,375
We should each mind
his own business.

404
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,579
Then we can forget about the past
and start all over.

405
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:45,115
No one is more open-minded
than you, Tiger.

406
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:48,319
I would take your offer
if I were him.

407
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:51,830
Kuo is young and impetuous.
Uncle Hai is the real trouble.

408
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,061
- Just bring the message to him.
- I'd better get going.

409
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:01,432
You've paid off all your debts.
Here's your note.

410
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:03,270
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

411
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,074
- I'm waiting for Tong to bring my rose.
- You won't use it to propose, right?

412
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,410
- Cheng Wah.
- What?

413
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,849
- Do you ever think about the future?
- Of course I do.

414
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,854
Everybody is waiting for you.

415
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:19,414
We'll talk when I get back.
Anyway, I need three more years.

416
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:23,894
Three more years?

417
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:26,488
Don't you know this gang has had
seven bosses in two years?

418
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,770
I can't find Madam Rose.

419
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,307
- Can't you go without the rose?
- That's not exactly it.

420
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,004
- Good. Let's go.
- Get in the car.

421
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,716
Good luck to you.

422
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:49,277
Thank you, miss.

423
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,255
- It's a beautiful rose.
- Yes, it is.

424
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:57,692
You guys cover the back alley.

425
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,733
- Rush in as soon as I drop the cup.
- Got it.

426
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,701
- Second floor, please.
- Just a minute.

427
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,979
Please sit down.

428
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:29,591
Not bad, young man.
Sit, please.

429
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,465
Waiter!

430
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:39,266
I have no time for your stories.

431
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:42,466
Since you're here,
I'm determined to get my share.

432
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,975
Young man...

433
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:50,014
sign here and you can go home
in one piece.

434
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,340
Half of the Ritz?

435
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:56,946
I don't care
what you think of us.

436
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:59,651
Just sign here
and we'll be partners.

437
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,124
We'll work together.
Okay?

438
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:03,492
- But we--
- Who the hell are you?

439
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:08,791
Do you sign the contracts?
If not, shut up!

440
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,729
I'll sign.

441
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,171
Now you finally get it.

442
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:17,266
But one more clause
needs to be added in.

443
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:20,904
We're entitled to half of your income
from casinos and banks too.

444
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,377
What did you just say,
young man?

445
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,886
Say that again.

446
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:33,723
Say it.

447
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,256
You want half of the Ritz,
and we want half of your income.

448
00:32:52,378 --> 00:32:53,538
Damn you!

449
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,439
Don't move!

450
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,161
Don't move!

451
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:40,589
Morons. We outnumber them
ten to one...

452
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,756
and you guys can't catch him
without your guns.

453
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,425
Put your guns away
or I'll kill you.

454
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,842
I'll see you outside, young man--
if you make it!

455
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:16,624
Kill me if you dare.

456
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:20,355
You old bastard.

457
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,468
Our boss is in trouble.

458
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,773
You're good, young man.

459
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,977
Pick him up.

460
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,175
Don't push me.

461
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:22,011
Let's go.

462
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:25,422
Don't push.
I'll go myself.

463
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,019
Hurry up. Move it!

464
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:33,728
Hurry!

465
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:39,263
Sign the paper
and I'll let him go.

466
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,999
Let's go.

467
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,603
Police.

468
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,982
Is the fight over already?

469
00:36:58,057 --> 00:37:00,321
Too bad I missed it.

470
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,326
What did you say, Inspector?

471
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:07,990
So it's you, Mr. Tiger.
Was there a fight here?

472
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,433
I don't understand your Mandarin.
Speak Cantonese.

473
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:13,070
Cantonese?

474
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,472
I heard there was a fight here.
Were you involved?

475
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,705
A fight?
I didn't see anything.

476
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,679
- Nothing happened?
- No.

477
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,475
And you saw nothing either?
Do you have anything to say?

478
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,256
We were having lunch together.

479
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:35,983
Now lunch is over.

480
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:38,586
- See you some other day.
- No problem.

481
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:48,270
If you admitted he threatened you,
I could arrest him.

482
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,104
I don't know what
you are talking about, Inspector.

483
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:55,973
Your luck may run out.
I may show up too late next time.

484
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:59,814
Now I understand.
Good-bye.

485
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,749
Lunch is over.
Let's get going.

486
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:15,058
They did fight.
Do you really believe what he said?

487
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:18,331
I'm not stupid.
Dismiss the men.

488
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,599
Dismissed.

489
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,642
It's because of that inspector,
not the rose.

490
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,700
I'm not going anywhere
without the rose.

491
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,109
Superstition!

492
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,917
Uncle Hai, do we need
to take the car to a body shop?

493
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:37,149
- Yes, you take care of it.
- That'll be quite expensive.

494
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,292
I suspect Fei is
behind the whole thing.

495
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,490
- You suspect him?
- Don't you?

496
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:50,524
He's an experienced hand,
and he messed up with no good excuse.

497
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:52,093
You mean he's up to something.

498
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:54,639
To stay in this business,
you must remember:

499
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,933
Trust nobody.

500
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,541
I don't like that.

501
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:02,843
You don't have much choice.

502
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:05,406
- Do you need this?
- No, I don't.

503
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:09,076
- Where are you going?
- To America.

504
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:12,355
- Without telling me?
- Tell you?

505
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:16,087
We never have time to talk.
You only have time for business.

506
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,857
A vacation there
will do you good.

507
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:21,297
I'm not coming back.

508
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,493
How come?

509
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:28,205
- I'm going to get married.
- I told you the time isn't right.

510
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:31,866
Married? To whom?

511
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:36,938
To Mr. Lu. His parents are
very excited about this marriage.

512
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,574
Ask someone else to wait
another three years.

513
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:44,020
- You can't go like this.
- Why should I care?

514
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:47,058
Don't go.
Listen to me!

515
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,321
- You ruined my dress.
- Help me!

516
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,621
It's none of my business.
Carry on.

517
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:58,126
- You can't go. What about us?
- You never have time for me.

518
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:01,536
What do you think I am,
a money tree?

519
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,804
No, of course not.
Say, what do you think she is?

520
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:07,937
- What do I think who is?
- She was asking us a question.

521
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,744
- A money tree, of course.
- See? Don't deny it.

522
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:14,115
He's lying.
Don't believe him.

523
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:17,178
Yeah, I lied.
What exactly do you want me to say?

524
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,523
Keep your mouth shut.
You know how much I care about you.

525
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,288
- How much you care about me?
- You know how much I care for her.

526
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:27,696
I really don't know.
My hearing is bad.

527
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,098
You're not helping at all.

528
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:32,262
Don't go, please.

529
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:34,363
Are you really giving up
everything and leaving, Luming?

530
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,103
It's now or never.
I don't want to see you get killed.

531
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:40,475
- God forbid!
- Aren't I right?

532
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:43,709
No, I heard it wrong.
It's none of my business. Go on.

533
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:46,342
None of your business?
She wants to leave.

534
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:49,512
Then that'll become my business.
Talk her out of it.

535
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:53,046
- Luming, how about two more years?
- Do you think I'm gonna buy that?

536
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,855
- I really mean it. I swear.
- Save it. Don't stop me.

537
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,193
Let go!

538
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,927
I'm begging you to stay, Luming.

539
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,165
You deceived me.

540
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:07,500
No, that's not true.

541
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:11,441
I paid off my father's debts, and he
didn't really even owe you anything!

542
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,011
How can you do this to me?
I worked so hard for you.

543
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:19,050
- I told him not to cheat you.
- I don't remember you saying that.

544
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,779
See, he's telling the truth.

545
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,083
We did deceive you at first
when you were a stranger to us.

546
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,146
Later, I didn't know
how to tell you the truth.

547
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:27,454
I never touched that money.
It's yours.

548
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,495
So you cheated me
because he told you to.

549
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:34,293
- I didn't know you then.
- But you know how to shift the blame.

550
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,924
Shut up, you!

551
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:39,402
Forget about the money.
I just want to leave.

552
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:42,304
- Listen to me.
- Let me go!

553
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,040
Listen to me.

554
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:51,807
Boss.

555
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:56,479
Mr. Lu would like to know
when you are leaving, Miss Yang.

556
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,852
What business is that of yours?

557
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,858
- The car battery is dead.
- Ask him to leave.

558
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:03,554
- But the battery is dead.
- Right.

559
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:06,996
- We might have to do a push start.
- Tell Lu to get lost.

560
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:12,265
- Tell that guy to leave!
- Tell him to leave! Sure, sure.

561
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,869
- Can't you make your own decisions?
- If someone gives me a hint, yeah.

562
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:21,208
- Luming!
- Let go of me.

563
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,510
I won't let you go, Luming.

564
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,072
Please don't go.

565
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,552
Give me one good reason.

566
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,850
Reason? What's a good reason?

567
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,914
We don't act based on reason.

568
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,425
Would you stop drinking?

569
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:39,896
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

570
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,324
I'm really sorry.

571
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:46,769
He won't leave
without saying good-bye to her.

572
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,238
What should I do now?

573
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:49,569
Gun him down.

574
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:51,165
Run him off.

575
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:54,041
- Help me get up.
- Please don't leave.

576
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,547
You can't hold her here
like a thief.

577
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,413
Kiss her and she'll stay.

578
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:01,885
- Kiss her?
- Why don't you take his advice now?

579
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,218
I will, I will.

580
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,220
Now leave!

581
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:15,557
I'll go polish the car.

582
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:20,328
Don't touch me!

583
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:23,970
I am sorry, Luming.

584
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:37,416
Why are you carrying luggage?
Are you going on vacation?

585
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,320
My manager fired me.

586
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,916
He thought I was stealing guests'
letters and giving them to you.

587
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,292
- Where's the letter?
- The manager took it.

588
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:54,865
- Excuse me.
- She wants to see you.

589
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,840
How may I help you?

590
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:00,072
There's a letter from Shanghai
addressed to Madam Kao. It's for me.

591
00:44:00,145 --> 00:44:01,908
For you?

592
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:06,214
But you're not a guest here.
How come there's a letter for you?

593
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:07,980
I used your letterhead and envelope.

594
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:11,214
Throw her out.

595
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,622
That letter
is very important to me.

596
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,752
I must have it.
Please give it to me.

597
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,591
Please give it to me.

598
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:21,394
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have used your letterhead.

599
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:23,934
I'll never do it again.

600
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,470
Calm down, calm down.
Is there a letter for her?

601
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,529
There was,
but I returned it.

602
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,703
No, that letter
mustn't be returned.

603
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:34,143
The boy is about to send them out.

604
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:41,382
- Madam!
- My letter!

605
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:46,852
What's going on here?

606
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,457
Go back to your work.

607
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:53,054
- Everything is okay.
- I found it.

608
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,656
Thank you.

609
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,861
- Everything is fine.
- Thank you.

610
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:31,902
I'll let you take care of it.

611
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,939
I am going out for dim sum.

612
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:38,408
We'll meet at the restaurant
with some local businessmen.

613
00:45:38,477 --> 00:45:42,174
No problem,
but I can't speak for my boss.

614
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,340
He doesn't seem to be
a bad guy to me.

615
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:47,283
Trust me.
I know him better than you do.

616
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:50,082
The Cantonese are too cunning
to be trusted.

617
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:52,281
And where are you from?

618
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:57,127
Well, Canton.
But I'm very trustworthy.

619
00:45:57,195 --> 00:46:00,255
Remember,
dim sum in the morning.

620
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,357
I'd better go now.

621
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:09,266
People like him can never be trusted,
no matter where they come from.

622
00:46:11,476 --> 00:46:15,071
I'll say it once more:

623
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:19,513
The big shot you're about to meet
used to be a coolie.

624
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:24,453
Now he has hundreds of coolies himself,
and he has influence over the pier.

625
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:29,183
But don't be humble
before him.

626
00:46:29,261 --> 00:46:32,856
I know.
The coolies work for us too.

627
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:36,824
Are you going out for business?

628
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:44,772
The Black Dragon gang is powerful.
They've invited me over for dinner.

629
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,573
Don't look at him
when I'm talking to him.

630
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:53,517
- Boss, I got your chrysanthe mum.
- Are you new here or what?

631
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:57,681
- But a chrysanthe mum is a flower too.
- Get out and polish the car.

632
00:46:57,756 --> 00:46:59,747
But a chrysanthe mum
is a flower too.

633
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:04,785
Hurry up. We're out of time.
Forget about the rose.

634
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:08,822
Don't be so superstitious.
Let's go.

635
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,336
No. I'm not going
without my rose.

636
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:17,235
I know you're looking at her.

637
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,611
It's good you can make
your own decisions.

638
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:29,948
- We can't find Madam Rose.
- I was told she was sick.

639
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:31,989
Sick?

640
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,386
Mr. Kuo, this way please.

641
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,862
Hey, he's here!

642
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,195
Mr. Kuo.

643
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:48,963
This way.

644
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:58,645
Okay, here's the flower.
Let's get going.

645
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:03,879
I'm here for your flower.
Are you all right?

646
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:05,684
Drink this.

647
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:12,797
- Does she have a fever?
- No, she's cool to the touch.

648
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,960
She doesn't have the flu.
That's not the right remedy.

649
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:22,029
Who cares? Just get the rose.
He needs it for luck.

650
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,603
Do you ever think of others?
She needs help.

651
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:28,237
How can you be so coldhearted?

652
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:31,441
Go get a doctor. Hurry!

653
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:36,078
Even a doctor couldn't help her now.
She's in shock.

654
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:39,749
Tell me who did it
and he's dead.

655
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:44,255
Tell me what's going on.
Maybe I can help.

656
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,938
- Is it because of her?
- Who is she?

657
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:55,267
It's her daughter.

658
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,503
I don't believe it.
They don't look alike.

659
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:06,541
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

660
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:09,418
It's okay.

661
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,482
Don't cry.

662
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:18,856
I got it.
Her daughter's dead!

663
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,124
Shut your mouth!

664
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,066
Go polish the car.

665
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:29,265
- We're out of time.
- How can we leave now?

666
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,434
They'll be offended
if we show up late.

667
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,570
- Let me buy the rose first.
- Then what are you waiting for?

668
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:39,276
Mr. Kuo, this is for you.
Good luck to you.

669
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,420
And good luck to everybody.

670
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,685
You should be proud
to have such a beautiful daughter.

671
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:54,561
Did she do something wrong?
Where is she?

672
00:49:55,567 --> 00:50:00,095
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- She goes to school in Shanghai.

673
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:02,469
All of a sudden, she's decided
to come visit her mother.

674
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,068
- Does she need money for the ticket?
- I'll pay for her.

675
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:11,482
Her boyfriend and his father
are coming with her.

676
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,917
She's planning to marry
her boyfriend.

677
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:18,217
Madam Rose never told her daughter
how she makes her living.

678
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,782
She used the flower money
to send her to college.

679
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,058
Madam Rose didn't want her
to worry about money...

680
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:29,828
so she told her that she is
wealthy and famous in Hong Kong.

681
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:34,429
So if the daughter finds out the truth,
she will be very disappointed.

682
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:38,602
And if the father and son find out,
there will be no marriage.

683
00:50:43,715 --> 00:50:46,912
- Why are you looking at me?
- You're the only one who can help.

684
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:49,545
The only one.

685
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:52,522
Of course you should help her.
Her rose always brings you good luck.

686
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,856
- How can I help?
- It's simple.

687
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,361
Move her to the best hotel
and dress her up.

688
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,126
Easier said than done.
That takes money.

689
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:06,000
We raised some money for her.

690
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:08,938
Here it is,
but it may not be enough.

691
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:12,135
It's okay.
Don't worry about the money.

692
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:16,338
Just do whatever you think is right.
I'm behind you all the way.

693
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:18,439
Wonderful!

694
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,009
I have to leave.

695
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:27,149
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- I can't thank you enough.

696
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,721
- I'll leave it to you.
- Thank you.

697
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:36,698
See you.

698
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:39,498
- It's gonna be trouble.
- It'll be easy. I'm glad we can help.

699
00:51:39,571 --> 00:51:41,061
Easy?

700
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:46,006
This way.

701
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:49,046
- Miss Yang, everything's ready.
- Take care of Madam Kao.

702
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:50,604
Madam Kao, please.

703
00:51:56,354 --> 00:51:58,379
This is nice.

704
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:14,962
Turn on the lights.

705
00:52:18,443 --> 00:52:20,968
How do you like it, Miss Yang?

706
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:23,412
Say "yes" if asked
If it's Madam's suite...

707
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:26,541
but say "I don't know"
if asked anything about her.

708
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:31,178
This will be your home,
Madam Kao.

709
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:40,157
Cheng Wah, over here.

710
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:46,628
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful.

711
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,265
Money talks.

712
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,004
I really don't know how to thank you
for your kindness and generosity.

713
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,775
- He loves to help people. Right?
- Right.

714
00:52:56,848 --> 00:52:59,646
- They're here.
- Come on in.

715
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,709
This way.

716
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:04,346
- Who are they?
- Makeup artist, tailor, hairdresser.

717
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:08,153
They're all here for you.
We have to give you a makeover.

718
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,353
The tea is ready.

719
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:17,731
- Who is he?
- The housekeeper.

720
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:20,327
- Housekeeper?
- Mr. Kuo.

721
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,238
Madam Kao has to have
a housekeeper.

722
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,775
- Uncle Hai, we're leaving.
- Thank you.

723
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:32,172
- I'll let you take care of everything.
- No problem.

724
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:36,177
- Now what?
- She needs a husband.

725
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,280
- A what?
- The one she mentions in her letters.

726
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:41,325
- So what?
- Get her a husband.

727
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,223
You want me to get her
a husband?

728
00:53:43,294 --> 00:53:46,058
- Where? How?
- How should I know?

729
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:47,860
And you said it would be easy.

730
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:53,198
A husband!

731
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:57,865
Don't even think about it.

732
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:01,238
Where do you want me
to find a husband for her?

733
00:54:01,312 --> 00:54:04,145
I have the perfect candidate.

734
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:06,308
- Who?
- A friend of mine.

735
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:09,785
- What does he look like?
- Who cares? Just bring him over.

736
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:11,583
Okay.

737
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:12,987
Don't you go anywhere.

738
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,096
I don't care what the job is,
as long as they pay me.

739
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:25,429
Follow me.

740
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:29,139
I'll sign anything
if I can just live here.

741
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:32,574
Mr. Kuo,
this is my friend Tung.

742
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,875
From now on,
he's your boss.

743
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:37,312
Mr. Cheng Wah Kuo.

744
00:54:38,683 --> 00:54:40,480
Have we met before?

745
00:54:40,552 --> 00:54:42,213
I don't think so.

746
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:44,585
Say hello to Mr. Kuo.

747
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:48,057
Mr. Kuo, how do you do?

748
00:54:48,126 --> 00:54:50,219
I believe I've seen you before.

749
00:54:50,295 --> 00:54:52,889
That's impossible.

750
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:56,024
Thanks for your help.
Gentlemen, Madam Kao.

751
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:01,629
This is the bride-to-be.

752
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:04,072
Don't be afraid. Relax.

753
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,384
Mr. Kuo.

754
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,619
Aren't you going
to introduce me?

755
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:27,424
Miss Yang,
this is Tung, the groom-to-be.

756
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:29,864
You? Come over here
and stand next to her.

757
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,498
- Yeah, you look all right.
- I'll look even better in a nice suit.

758
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:37,939
Are you done with your part?

759
00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:39,601
Luming, may I go now?

760
00:55:40,645 --> 00:55:42,135
- Yes, you may.
- Finally.

761
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,942
You go on ahead.

762
00:55:47,919 --> 00:55:49,181
Let's go.

763
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,782
- Wait! Hold it right there.
- There's more?

764
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:55,849
We're going to pick up
her daughter tomorrow.

765
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:58,122
I don't have to be there.
You can go without me.

766
00:55:58,196 --> 00:56:00,824
Let's not do things halfway.

767
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,628
All right.

768
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,295
- Okay, you can go now.
- Let's talk over here.

769
00:56:06,371 --> 00:56:08,965
What are you staring at?
That's Madam Rose.

770
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,770
I remember now!

771
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,208
I know who you are.

772
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,742
Let bygones be bygones.
I am the groom-to-be.

773
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:18,975
- What's the deal?
- Nothing.

774
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,041
What's the matter?

775
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,644
I saved him once.
It was a long time ago.

776
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:26,189
Let's have some tea.

777
00:56:31,462 --> 00:56:33,054
The ship has docked, boss.

778
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:34,996
Hurry up.

779
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,069
We found a really good spot.

780
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,991
What will Belle think
when she sees me?

781
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:04,995
She'll be delighted.

782
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:07,190
- Thank you for everything.
- Don't mention it.

783
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:09,096
The ship has arrived.

784
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,197
The ship is here?

785
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:18,903
How about our sign?

786
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,675
- Why is it so small?
- Easier to carry it in my pocket.

787
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,275
- How about not bringing it at all?
- You are late!

788
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:31,447
- I was busy with work.
- There's a bigger banner there.

789
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:37,551
- Someone else is here for them too.
- We're here to pick up the same group.

790
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:41,064
We can't let them pick up
Belle's boyfriend and his father.

791
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:43,999
They'll discover Madam Kao doesn't
exist, and our plan will be ruined.

792
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:46,662
- What should we do now?
- What do you think?

793
00:57:46,738 --> 00:57:49,104
- You have to stop them.
- Get rid of them.

794
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,447
Hey, you bumped into me.

795
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:03,218
Remember,
he's an old friend of my teacher.

796
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,152
You'd better behave yourself.

797
00:58:07,392 --> 00:58:08,689
- I couldn't make him leave.
- Why?

798
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,352
It's that inspector.

799
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:12,362
You take care of it.

800
00:58:17,468 --> 00:58:20,460
Inspector, I've got something
to tell you.

801
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,938
Don't you want to know
what Tiger's up to?

802
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:25,635
- What is he up to?
- Not here. Let's go some place else.

803
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:30,238
- No, I'm here to pick up my friends.
- This information can't wait.

804
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:32,739
Then tell me now.

805
00:58:32,817 --> 00:58:36,753
- I told you: not here.
- Keep your voice down.

806
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:38,254
All right, then.

807
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,457
- Did you take care of it?
- Don't worry. Leave it to me.

808
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,631
You two, come with me.

809
00:58:57,508 --> 00:58:59,976
Thief!

810
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:02,979
Help!

811
00:59:03,047 --> 00:59:06,778
Ignore them.
Hold the banner.

812
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:07,977
It's none of our business.

813
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,927
What a coincidence!
How's your kid?

814
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:23,558
- Fine. What are you doing here?
- Looking for a fight.

815
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,568
- Did you send the money to Mom?
- I did.

816
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:27,797
She insisted she didn't get it!

817
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:34,938
- Go over there and kill him.
- It's ridiculous.

818
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:38,072
It's not our business.
Hold the banner. Higher.

819
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,347
Who's Inspector Ho?

820
00:59:44,422 --> 00:59:47,118
- That's me.
- So it's you.

821
00:59:47,191 --> 00:59:49,091
You piece of shit!

822
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,388
- Why are you standing here?
- To pick up your friends.

823
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,023
Pick up your brains!
Go and get him!

824
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,862
You're not getting away.

825
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,244
- Do you see her?
- No.

826
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,678
Can you identify her?

827
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:17,785
There are so many people.

828
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:19,345
Can you identify her?

829
01:00:19,423 --> 01:00:21,357
I can't.
I've only seen her picture once.

830
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:25,384
- Do you see her?
- Not yet.

831
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:34,037
Do you see her?

832
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:36,430
Belle.

833
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:41,910
- Belle!
- Ma!

834
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:50,648
That's my Belle!

835
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,279
Belle.

836
01:00:52,356 --> 01:00:54,756
I see my mother.
She's down there.

837
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:00,487
Let's get off the ship.

838
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,396
- Which one is she?
- I'm not sure.

839
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:06,732
My daughter is back.
Belle!

840
01:01:06,804 --> 01:01:08,533
- Which one is she?
- I'm not sure.

841
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:14,406
- Do you know which one she is?
- No.

842
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,210
Do you see her?

843
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:19,272
Mr. Ku is one of the richest men
in the country.

844
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,147
Take more pictures.

845
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,848
- Who are they?
- Reporters.

846
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,782
What's going on?

847
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,919
Two reporters are here
to interview Ku.

848
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:34,089
Reporters?

849
01:01:34,165 --> 01:01:35,598
Tie them up.

850
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,868
It's against the law.

851
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:43,301
Let's get moving.

852
01:01:43,374 --> 01:01:46,502
- We're detectives.
- What are you doing here?

853
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,876
We're reporters,
here to interview Mr. Ku.

854
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:53,075
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- But the passengers are arriving.

855
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,483
Or maybe you prefer
a nice long vacation?

856
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:58,954
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

857
01:02:00,224 --> 01:02:03,284
- Do I look all right?
- Sure. You look great.

858
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,681
You've done a good thing.

859
01:02:29,754 --> 01:02:31,745
It's not over yet.

860
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,723
This is your stepfather.

861
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,357
Dad.

862
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,228
- Why don't you introduce your friends?
- Of course.

863
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,997
Mr. Hsin Chuan Ku.

864
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:48,701
- Mr. Ku, I've heard so much about you.
- My son.

865
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:50,764
How are you?

866
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:53,332
Thank you
for taking care of Belle.

867
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:56,812
Actually, it's she
who takes care of me.

868
01:02:58,249 --> 01:03:00,843
It's so noisy here.
Why don't we get back to the hotel?

869
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:03,512
This is--

870
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:05,316
This is her cousin.

871
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:07,619
- Right, right.
- An uncle on her mother's side.

872
01:03:07,692 --> 01:03:08,920
Uncle.

873
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,087
- This is my wife.
- Auntie.

874
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:17,058
Ma, you never mentioned
this cousin.

875
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:21,094
His business dealings
are a little shady...

876
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,299
so the family doesn't talk
about him too much.

877
01:03:26,077 --> 01:03:28,739
Let's go to the hotel, Mr. Ku.

878
01:03:28,813 --> 01:03:31,111
My other friends
have come to see me too.

879
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,879
Don't worry. I've told ever yone
to meet you at the hotel.

880
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:36,943
How's that sound?
Let's get going.

881
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:43,789
- Uncle?
- How come they didn't introduce me?

882
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,351
I'll go get the car.

883
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:52,164
Not getting a raise
could make an employee depressed.

884
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:58,105
Depression could lead to suicide.

885
01:03:58,175 --> 01:04:01,269
Suicide means disappearance.
It's all connected.

886
01:04:01,345 --> 01:04:04,143
The two missing reporters
are my assistants.

887
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,809
I am a good friend
of your boss, Mr. Laughton.

888
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:10,342
Your stupid questions may also lead
to your unemployment.

889
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:15,624
Sorry. I was only asking
routine questions.

890
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:20,822
Trying to put pressure on me!
I've got work to do.

891
01:04:27,304 --> 01:04:28,862
Miss Yang.

892
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:32,772
You're going to meet the fishermen
who sell their fish on the pier.

893
01:04:32,843 --> 01:04:35,437
It's so hot!

894
01:04:35,513 --> 01:04:40,075
Let me tell you something.
You should see how happy they are.

895
01:04:40,151 --> 01:04:41,482
- They tell us--
- By the way...

896
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:44,146
can you ask Tong
to drive us around tomorrow?

897
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:48,248
- You can ask him yourself.
- He's your man. You ask him.

898
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:49,815
Have you finished?

899
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:54,160
- They hope we'll go easy on them.
- But we've never been hard on them.

900
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,960
Tong, I don't need you tomorrow.
You take Mr. Ku sightseeing.

901
01:04:59,036 --> 01:05:02,233
And sit in traffic all day?
Can't I do something else with them?

902
01:05:02,306 --> 01:05:05,002
Whatever you want.
Just keep them out of sight.

903
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:09,603
Have you finished or not?
Let's get down to business.

904
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:17,746
- Call Inspector Ho for me.
- Certainly.

905
01:05:20,424 --> 01:05:23,154
Tomorrow we'll go
to the park first.

906
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,855
Then the government house.
Bring the camera.

907
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,921
We'll have seafood for lunch,
then go to the shrine after that.

908
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:31,229
Could you please stand in one place?
You're making me dizzy.

909
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,633
I'll do as I please!

910
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:34,068
Do you remember what I said?

911
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:38,865
The fishermen have invited us over
for lunch to show their appreciation.

912
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:40,808
Mr. Kuo, please.

913
01:05:40,878 --> 01:05:42,243
Boss, telephone for you.

914
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:50,785
My shoe is not an ashtray!

915
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:54,985
This is Chow. Mr. Ku wants me
to get Inspector Ho for him.

916
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:59,359
The inspector? Now I have to find
a stand-in for the inspector too?

917
01:06:02,032 --> 01:06:03,966
What's the matter?

918
01:06:04,034 --> 01:06:07,128
You were gonna take care of everything.
Now we need to find an inspector too!

919
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:09,172
Did the call go through?

920
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,537
Yes.

921
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,139
- Hello.
- Hello.

922
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,240
What?

923
01:07:05,796 --> 01:07:07,286
All taken care of.

924
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,142
I'll go polish the car.

925
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,770
Is it in fashion now
to hire a Philippine maid?

926
01:07:22,846 --> 01:07:24,746
- It's a new fad.
- Bring us some tea.

927
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:27,045
It's hard to find
a Philippine maid.

928
01:07:32,823 --> 01:07:36,520
- This cut isn't big enough.
- How come they get a bigger share?

929
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,256
Fei, you put up with it out of loyalty,
but we can't.

930
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,491
You've been good to us
for so many years.

931
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:44,193
- We won't forget it, right?
- Right.

932
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,293
You have our full support.
Just say the word.

933
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,804
Thank you for having faith in me.

934
01:07:48,872 --> 01:07:51,705
Trust me and be patient.
Good days are yet to come.

935
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:53,265
Let's go.

936
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,572
Where's Ming?

937
01:07:57,648 --> 01:08:00,310
He left early
without saying a word.

938
01:08:00,384 --> 01:08:02,352
- Have you found Mr. Ku?
- Still looking.

939
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:05,320
- Who are you calling?
- My cousin at the shipping company.

940
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:08,415
I asked him to check
the passenger list for me.

941
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,549
Inspector?

942
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,620
- Where have you been?
- Five Continents Hotel, Luk Kwok Hotel--

943
01:08:13,697 --> 01:08:17,064
I told you to look for Mr. Ku.
Is he at Five Continents or Luk Kwok?

944
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,728
- Neither.
- Then why did you go there?

945
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:22,328
But I found out
he's at King's Hotel.

946
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:25,136
Then why did you go
to those other places?

947
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:27,871
- I found it! I found it!
- Found what?

948
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:30,607
Ku is in Hong Kong.
I'll check the hotel.

949
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:34,276
Who told you to check on Ku?
Check on the two missing reporters.

950
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,382
Why do I have to do everything?

951
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:59,935
I never tell a lie.
Now I'm so afraid.

952
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:08,912
We must not disappoint them.

953
01:09:16,827 --> 01:09:21,764
We're more than an hour late.
Tiger says it's a firm date.

954
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:25,063
- Is this going to be a trick?
- We'll keep our eyes open.

955
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:27,831
All right.
I'll go buy a rose.

956
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:30,400
Let's go.

957
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:32,442
Boss, we've kept Tiger waiting
the whole morning.

958
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:35,205
I know.
Invite him for lunch.

959
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:39,211
He won't accept.
He wants to see you right away.

960
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:41,911
But I must buy a rose first.

961
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:44,677
- Let's get going.
- Boss.

962
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:48,452
- Tiger's men are here.
- Who the hell do they think they are?

963
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:55,693
- What's up?
- Our boss has been waiting for you.

964
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:58,257
- Tell him I invite him to dinner.
- Don't move!

965
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:02,861
- Don't move!
- You have to come with me.

966
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:06,303
Come on, this is our turf.

967
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,606
Uncle Hai.

968
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:11,614
I'll go with them.
Tell our men to--

969
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,583
How dare you threaten us with a gun!
Tie them up.

970
01:10:16,653 --> 01:10:18,018
Let me go!

971
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,546
I'll go see your boss
after I get my rose. Let's go.

972
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:25,025
My boss won't let you go
that easy!

973
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:29,295
Mr. Ku, do you plan
to issue stock here?

974
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:31,266
Yes.

975
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,132
- When will that be?
- It will be soon.

976
01:10:36,907 --> 01:10:38,033
You are--

977
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:42,272
We're here to see Mr. Ku.
We're his friends.

978
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:44,177
He's not here right now.

979
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:47,911
Not here? But the front desk
told us he hasn't gone out.

980
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:50,681
He doesn't want to be interrupted
while having breakfast.

981
01:10:50,754 --> 01:10:53,655
- We're not just his friends.
- We're his business associates.

982
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:58,155
Mr. Kuo,
they are here to see Mr. Ku.

983
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,590
- What should I do?
- You got yourself in this mess.

984
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:07,131
Come with me.

985
01:11:09,006 --> 01:11:11,338
- That's kidnapping.
- Just close the door.

986
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:13,933
Do you have any idea
how many people you've kidnapped?

987
01:11:15,746 --> 01:11:18,078
So you have a steel plant too?

988
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:20,548
- Morning.
- Morning.

989
01:11:20,617 --> 01:11:22,517
You're up early.

990
01:11:22,586 --> 01:11:26,955
- How's everything, Mr. Ku?
- How should it be? This place is great!

991
01:11:27,024 --> 01:11:30,755
- Mr. Ku says he's having a good time.
- Is everything all right, cousins?

992
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,352
Everything is great!

993
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:34,930
The flowers are beautiful.

994
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,660
Good luck to you.

995
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:39,292
What's that for?

996
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,365
This is our family tradition.

997
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:45,636
- Yes, tradition.
- Family tradition?

998
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:47,540
Wait for me!

999
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:51,238
The inspector
is here with two men.

1000
01:11:51,315 --> 01:11:53,977
There's an important phone call
for you, Mr. Kuo.

1001
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:55,450
Excuse me for a moment.

1002
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:01,655
Inspector Ho is here.

1003
01:12:02,793 --> 01:12:04,454
He's coming up.

1004
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:07,127
Now what?

1005
01:12:08,932 --> 01:12:11,025
Cousin!

1006
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,294
That's you.

1007
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,202
You forgot we have
a business appointment.

1008
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:18,366
- Business appointment?
- They called to remind you.

1009
01:12:19,476 --> 01:12:22,411
I totally forgot.
Make yourselves at home.

1010
01:12:24,948 --> 01:12:27,940
He's always busy like this.

1011
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,043
Get a suit for him.

1012
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,021
- The inspector is here.
- Inspector Ho?

1013
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,387
Over there.

1014
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,016
Take this.

1015
01:12:36,093 --> 01:12:37,492
Hold this.

1016
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,260
Go with him. Hurry!

1017
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,731
Mr. Ku.

1018
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:55,710
I'll be back very soon.

1019
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:59,715
You must be Mr. Ku.

1020
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:02,581
And you must be
Inspector Ho.

1021
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:05,121
Your humble servant, Mr. Ku.

1022
01:13:05,188 --> 01:13:08,749
Why didn't you meet me at the boat?
You must have been really busy.

1023
01:13:08,825 --> 01:13:11,293
I went, but something came up.
I'll explain later.

1024
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:13,795
I'm leaving.
Let's talk outside.

1025
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:16,594
- I'll be back later.
- Very good.

1026
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,093
Who are these men?

1027
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:22,399
My assistants.

1028
01:13:23,907 --> 01:13:25,966
You two keep an eye
on the door.

1029
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:38,980
That was close.

1030
01:13:39,056 --> 01:13:43,720
Tiger is up to something
and you're busy with this nonsense.

1031
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,785
I'm tired of this farce.

1032
01:13:48,265 --> 01:13:52,998
You teach me how to dress,
how to walk, how to talk...

1033
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,504
how to deal with other bosses,
how to get the job done.

1034
01:13:55,572 --> 01:13:57,597
I'm nothing but your puppet.
I'm tired of it!

1035
01:13:57,674 --> 01:13:58,902
I'll go polish the car.

1036
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,002
- All those things are part of your job.
- That's what you say!

1037
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,810
- Then what do you want to do?
- What I'm doing right now.

1038
01:14:05,882 --> 01:14:09,477
- Are you happy with what you're doing?
- Yes, I'm very happy!

1039
01:14:09,553 --> 01:14:11,544
All right, then-- keep doing it.

1040
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,555
I will! I certainly will!

1041
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:16,859
But I don't really know
what I'm doing right now!

1042
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:19,225
The imported goods here
are great.

1043
01:14:19,296 --> 01:14:21,287
Do you have
any Hong Kong dollars?

1044
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:24,027
- I'm waiting for money to be wired.
- I can lend you some money.

1045
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:26,399
When will your stock be issued?

1046
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,165
Very soon.

1047
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:30,297
Backed by a gold mine.
The stock is strong.

1048
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:32,399
And a shipyard and a steel plant.

1049
01:14:32,476 --> 01:14:36,242
Why don't you do your jobs
and go find the missing reporters?

1050
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:40,407
How much a share?

1051
01:14:40,484 --> 01:14:42,975
One dollar.
$2.80 after it goes public.

1052
01:14:43,053 --> 01:14:45,988
- More than double?
- Outsiders are not allowed to buy.

1053
01:14:46,056 --> 01:14:48,889
Will I be able to buy, Mr. Ku?

1054
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,826
Aren't you an outsider?

1055
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,420
We have mutual friends.

1056
01:14:56,366 --> 01:15:00,735
Ho, Chairman of the Police Club
Organizing Committee.

1057
01:15:02,839 --> 01:15:07,276
That's the police clubhouse.
I'm the fund-raiser.

1058
01:15:07,344 --> 01:15:09,574
You not only have
to enforce the law...

1059
01:15:09,646 --> 01:15:11,739
but you also have
to run the police benefit.

1060
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:13,749
Good man!

1061
01:15:13,817 --> 01:15:14,806
Thank you.

1062
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:28,430
- Are you all right?
- Just heaving a sigh.

1063
01:15:28,498 --> 01:15:32,867
Sighing won't change things.

1064
01:15:32,936 --> 01:15:35,928
I'm sighing because the clubhouse
needs $80,000...

1065
01:15:36,006 --> 01:15:39,100
but I've only raised $15,000
in three years.

1066
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:42,475
You're only $65,000
short of your target.

1067
01:15:42,546 --> 01:15:46,607
After the stock public offering,
I'll try to help.

1068
01:15:46,683 --> 01:15:49,311
Mr. Ku-- Sorry.

1069
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:53,117
I was sure I'd found the right person.
Your word is all I need.

1070
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:57,488
Careful, don't get too excited.

1071
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:07,494
My son will treat Belle well.

1072
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:10,836
How could I say no to you?

1073
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:14,866
Thank you for your time.

1074
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,310
It's nothing.

1075
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:20,338
Write down how much I owe you.
I'll pay you back.

1076
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:22,351
Consider it a deposit.

1077
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:24,011
Deposit?

1078
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:26,612
You promised
to sell me the stock.

1079
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:30,285
Of course.
Take these to my room.

1080
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,158
Should we sign the contract
in your room?

1081
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:36,028
No, I'll meet you at your office
tomorrow. I'll have the stock then.

1082
01:16:36,099 --> 01:16:38,897
- You should go now.
- Okay.

1083
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,631
I'll walk you back
to your room, Mr. Ku.

1084
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:43,639
- You don't have to.
- I insist.

1085
01:16:43,707 --> 01:16:46,403
I feel like having
a cup of coffee.

1086
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,910
I'll buy.

1087
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,207
Fine.

1088
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:58,249
- Don't you want some coffee?
- I feel like going back to my room.

1089
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:05,056
- Why don't you call your office?
- Call the office?

1090
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:08,161
To see if anything has happened.

1091
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:11,359
- Don't worry. Nothing ever happens.
- Call or I'll feel guilty.

1092
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:16,364
- Don't feel guilty. I'll call.
- I'll wait here.

1093
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:18,600
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- Shall I go with you?

1094
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,802
It's okay.
Your mother is waiting for you.

1095
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,970
- Why did you bring him here?
- He doesn't want to leave.

1096
01:17:24,047 --> 01:17:26,641
- Get rid of him.
- I'll do my best.

1097
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:30,945
Are you leaving, Luming?

1098
01:17:35,058 --> 01:17:37,788
- What's up?
- Inspector Ho is here. Get rid of him.

1099
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:43,256
I'll be back soon.

1100
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:46,166
Kwong On Bank, please.

1101
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:51,540
- Sir, what are you doing here?
- Just looking at the lights.

1102
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:53,599
Inspector.

1103
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:56,305
- Why are you here?
- Two gangs are up to something outside.

1104
01:17:56,379 --> 01:17:59,473
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- You're a detective-- do something.

1105
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,881
I don't need you to remind me
of my duty.

1106
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,819
Is this Kwong On Bank-- Go away!
Sorry, I didn't mean you.

1107
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,519
Are you waiting for someone?
Why don't you join us?

1108
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:15,491
- Did you finish your business?
- Why did you bring them here?

1109
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,829
Try to come up with something.

1110
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,598
I have something to tell you.
Where's Cheng Wah?

1111
01:18:23,673 --> 01:18:26,141
- He went to the rest room.
- What is it?

1112
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:27,938
I can't leave yet.

1113
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:30,946
- Sit down and we'll talk about it.
- I don't have time to sit.

1114
01:18:31,014 --> 01:18:34,609
It will go public within three months?
Not many people will be able to buy it?

1115
01:18:34,684 --> 01:18:36,709
Thank you for the information.
Good-bye.

1116
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:38,946
Excuse me.

1117
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:40,580
Just a second.
What is it?

1118
01:18:40,657 --> 01:18:43,592
- Is Mr. Ku staying here?
- Yes.

1119
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,651
- Is he--
- Over there.

1120
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,769
- Is that your friend?
- Yes, he's a business client.

1121
01:18:58,642 --> 01:18:59,734
I'm gonna be rich!

1122
01:18:59,809 --> 01:19:02,334
Mr. Kao has such a short workday--
he must be doing well!

1123
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:06,639
- Sit down and have some coffee.
- I think I have another appointment.

1124
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:12,513
- How's your eye, Inspector?
- Who are you?

1125
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:15,023
- I gave you the black eye.
- Are you turning yourself in?

1126
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:17,389
Not exactly. I've come
to take care of your other eye!

1127
01:19:18,328 --> 01:19:21,388
I'll get you!

1128
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:25,459
Stop! I'll get you!

1129
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:28,868
- What's the matter?
- It's over. Don't worry.

1130
01:19:28,938 --> 01:19:32,999
I think there was a fight.
I have to go.

1131
01:19:33,076 --> 01:19:37,513
- Come over for dinner tonight.
- We'll be there. Bye!

1132
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,414
Forget about the business.
I'll stay for some coffee. Sit down.

1133
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:45,284
- Be careful. Don't take them out.
- I can't keep them in all day.

1134
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:47,585
You'd better stay here
and keep an eye on them.

1135
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:50,217
- Me again?
- Take them back to their room.

1136
01:19:51,494 --> 01:19:55,362
I prefer to stay here
and have lunch with you.

1137
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:57,161
All right.

1138
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,433
The press, Mr. Kuo.

1139
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:04,735
- How did they get in?
- Bribed their way in, I guess.

1140
01:20:04,808 --> 01:20:07,140
That's why I came to Hong Kong.

1141
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,337
- May we take a picture, please?
- No problem.

1142
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:15,882
Cheng Wah, I'm glad you're here.
Come over for a group picture.

1143
01:20:16,753 --> 01:20:19,051
Everybody, come over here.

1144
01:20:19,122 --> 01:20:21,488
- Dad, let's go take a picture.
- This way, Madam Kao.

1145
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:23,685
Okay.
All together.

1146
01:20:24,894 --> 01:20:27,454
Ready. Smile.

1147
01:20:28,665 --> 01:20:30,724
Thank you.

1148
01:20:33,336 --> 01:20:34,928
It's time for dinner.

1149
01:20:36,573 --> 01:20:39,064
- Where are you two from?
- The Daily Sun.

1150
01:20:39,142 --> 01:20:42,578
- When will it be published?
- Tomorrow. We'll send a copy over.

1151
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:51,815
Get your rose and go.

1152
01:20:54,257 --> 01:20:56,817
- Good luck to you.
- Are you always this busy, Cheng Wah?

1153
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,487
- Why do you have to wear a rose?
- It's not superstition.

1154
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,826
Aren't you going
to introduce your friend?

1155
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:04,797
Why does he hide behind you?

1156
01:21:04,868 --> 01:21:08,065
He's shy. Doesn't talk much.
Excuse me.

1157
01:21:08,138 --> 01:21:10,902
Wait a minute, Cheng Wah.
I have something to say.

1158
01:21:10,974 --> 01:21:12,066
About what?

1159
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:15,009
Madam Kao has consented
to Belle's wedding.

1160
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,569
The ceremonywill take place
in Shanghai.

1161
01:21:18,314 --> 01:21:21,215
In Shanghai! Congratulations.

1162
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:24,617
Madam Kao, thank you
for your hospitality...

1163
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:27,417
and your consent
to this marriage.

1164
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:28,457
Don't mention it.

1165
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:31,858
My trip is so short that
I can't meet all the family.

1166
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,987
I suggest
an engagement ceremony.

1167
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:38,523
Invite your friends and all
the upper class in Hong Kong.

1168
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:41,399
What do you think, Cheng Wah?

1169
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:43,735
Me? I have no objection.

1170
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:46,435
Then it's settled.

1171
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:48,374
We'll kill two birds
with one ceremony.

1172
01:21:49,646 --> 01:21:52,410
Please excuse me, Mr. Ku.

1173
01:21:52,482 --> 01:21:55,508
They want to invite all the upper class
in Hong Kong for the ceremony.

1174
01:21:55,585 --> 01:21:57,382
I know. You take of it.

1175
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:00,521
You understand
what this means?

1176
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,421
A Chinese- or Western-style
ceremony?

1177
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:06,326
The Western is more formal.
The Chinese is more relaxed.

1178
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:08,796
Do you have more Chinese friends
or foreign friends?

1179
01:22:08,865 --> 01:22:11,698
About the same number.
I have a lot of friends.

1180
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:14,961
- Let's combine the best of both styles.
- Cousin--

1181
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:18,337
- Cousin.
- That's you.

1182
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:23,038
Excuse me.
Shall we discuss the guest list?

1183
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:26,240
- You too, Luming.
- We'll talk about it later.

1184
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:29,251
- Excuse us.
- It's okay.

1185
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,150
We'll be right back.

1186
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:35,015
Madam Kao,
any other ideas?

1187
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:35,158
How many foreign friends
do you have?

1188
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,456
How many foreign friends
do you have?

1189
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:40,963
Listen, the two of you:
How are we going to do this?

1190
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:44,966
How can we get all the notables
in Hong Kong to attend the ceremony?

1191
01:22:45,034 --> 01:22:48,333
You seem to be able
to do anything!

1192
01:22:48,404 --> 01:22:50,497
I'm touched
by your profound faith in me!

1193
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:53,974
Why don't they have it in Shanghai?
Why does he have to throw a party here?

1194
01:22:54,043 --> 01:22:57,570
It's all your fault!
You said it would be easy.

1195
01:22:57,647 --> 01:23:01,276
A few clothes, some makeup,
a hotel suite -- that's all!

1196
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,444
But it's one thing after another!

1197
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,648
Kidnapping reporters and businessmen.
Beating up police.

1198
01:23:06,723 --> 01:23:10,682
- Getting me into trouble.
- But you said you were happy.

1199
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,387
Shut up!

1200
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:15,625
It was your idea--
you take care of it!

1201
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:20,825
Isn't it a little late to blame me?
You wanted to help her too.

1202
01:23:20,904 --> 01:23:24,237
- Helping people is a pleasure.
- That's right.

1203
01:23:24,307 --> 01:23:26,002
But one must act
according to one's ability.

1204
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:30,512
- Don't you dare insult me.
- It's not your fault. It's mine.

1205
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,276
- It doesn't matter whose fault it is.
- Wrong!

1206
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:36,546
I have too much compassion,
but no ability.

1207
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:39,315
Trying to work a miracle
for Madam Rose.

1208
01:23:40,089 --> 01:23:43,718
You're right.
I don't measure up.

1209
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:48,457
Please tell her
we've done our best.

1210
01:23:48,531 --> 01:23:50,863
Now there's nothing I can do.

1211
01:23:50,934 --> 01:23:52,026
Right now?

1212
01:23:52,101 --> 01:23:54,160
- Do you have a better time in mind?
- The marriage will be ruined.

1213
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,535
- Let's pretend we never tried to help!
- You can't back down now.

1214
01:23:56,606 --> 01:23:59,575
Yes, I'm backing down.

1215
01:23:59,642 --> 01:24:03,408
I won't tell her that.
I can't do it.

1216
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:05,071
- Are you going to tell her or not?
- No.

1217
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:07,139
I'll do it myself!

1218
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:10,685
Uncle.

1219
01:24:12,855 --> 01:24:14,686
Auntie, Dad.

1220
01:24:16,192 --> 01:24:20,526
- I hope we're not interrupting.
- Not at all.

1221
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:26,325
- What's up?
- Ma says you always help people.

1222
01:24:26,402 --> 01:24:29,064
You have a big heart, so--

1223
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:32,369
We decided to make you
godfather of our first baby.

1224
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,909
Godfather?

1225
01:24:33,977 --> 01:24:36,571
You won't refuse, will you?

1226
01:24:38,247 --> 01:24:39,976
Don't let us hold you up.

1227
01:24:40,049 --> 01:24:42,313
Bye-bye.

1228
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:45,450
Bye-bye, Uncle.

1229
01:24:58,701 --> 01:25:01,295
Godfather! What an idea!

1230
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:05,034
Get all our men and their girlfriends
to pose as celebrities.

1231
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,507
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is that a bad idea?

1232
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:14,243
No, it's a good idea,
but they won't look like celebrities.

1233
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,717
- Get them fancy clothes.
- I'll teach them some manners.

1234
01:25:16,786 --> 01:25:19,414
- I'll help the ladies with their makeup.
- Let's get to it. I'll make some calls.

1235
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,588
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Of course I know.

1236
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:24,685
What is it?

1237
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,059
- He tried to give us the slip.
- Why?

1238
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:31,260
I can't handle it.
I want to go back to my hometown.

1239
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:35,196
And just how would you go?

1240
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:37,102
By boat or train.

1241
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:39,832
How about in a wheelchair?

1242
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:46,776
I'm not going.
I have work to do.

1243
01:25:47,984 --> 01:25:49,451
Let's get to work.

1244
01:25:50,153 --> 01:25:52,246
Read the card first.
It states your role.

1245
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:54,915
This is yours. Remember it.
This is yours.

1246
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:57,323
Be gentle.

1247
01:25:57,393 --> 01:26:00,487
I may be pregnant.
I have to be careful with the baby.

1248
01:26:00,563 --> 01:26:03,259
You don't even know
who the father is.

1249
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:05,630
- Don't move.
- Watch your language.

1250
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:07,465
You are supposed to be ladies.
Keep that in mind.

1251
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:10,506
She's got a filthy mouth.

1252
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:13,041
You ate too much.
Look at your waist.

1253
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:14,974
Take a deep breath.

1254
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,944
What are you looking at?
Never seen a woman before?

1255
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:19,538
Remember your lines.

1256
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:25,748
Everybody--

1257
01:26:28,825 --> 01:26:31,953
Tong gave each of you
a card....

1258
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:36,362
stating your name
and the lines you are to say.

1259
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:40,266
You must speak Mandarin,
because Mr. Ku is from Shanghai.

1260
01:26:42,705 --> 01:26:45,435
You don't need
to say your lines right now...

1261
01:26:46,943 --> 01:26:49,639
but you must remember
your role...

1262
01:26:49,712 --> 01:26:51,805
and act like
ladies and gentlemen.

1263
01:26:51,881 --> 01:26:54,679
Why? He could be ruder
than any of us.

1264
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,243
- What role are you playing?
- The secretary of education.

1265
01:26:58,321 --> 01:27:00,289
What? You can't be
the secretary of education.

1266
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:01,948
Why not?

1267
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:04,322
Just because.

1268
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:06,554
One look at you
and people will know you're a fraud.

1269
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:08,494
Who's the chiefwarden?

1270
01:27:09,732 --> 01:27:12,030
Who's got that card?

1271
01:27:12,902 --> 01:27:16,303
You're the warden.
Why didn't you answer?

1272
01:27:16,372 --> 01:27:18,033
I didn't know.
I can't read.

1273
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,166
You can't read? Jeez!

1274
01:27:20,977 --> 01:27:24,777
All right, you be the warden
and you be the secretary.

1275
01:27:26,816 --> 01:27:28,875
- You must be crazy.
- What's your problem?

1276
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:30,851
He's bothering me.

1277
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,047
Can you behave yourself?
Be a gentleman.

1278
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,886
- It was a mistake.
- Bastard! That's my girlfriend.

1279
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,983
Keep your hands off her
or I'll kill you.

1280
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,221
How dare you hit me!

1281
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:48,195
Stop fighting!

1282
01:27:54,544 --> 01:27:56,739
Stop acting like this!

1283
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,279
Listen to me carefully.

1284
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:08,889
Look at yourselves.

1285
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,654
Aren't you tired
of fighting and killing?

1286
01:28:11,727 --> 01:28:15,720
This may be the one time
you can actually do a good deed.

1287
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:21,933
You may not know
why you should help Madam Rose.

1288
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:23,232
Just think about it.

1289
01:28:23,306 --> 01:28:27,436
One day your grandchildren
may ask you to name...

1290
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,478
one thing you're proud of.

1291
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:31,410
What would your answer be?

1292
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:34,674
You want to tell them
you make your living...

1293
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:38,413
off of extortion, prostitution
and gambling?

1294
01:28:40,623 --> 01:28:44,150
This could be the only thing
you'd be proud to tell them about.

1295
01:28:45,628 --> 01:28:48,961
- Do you understand?
- No.

1296
01:28:50,233 --> 01:28:51,461
Tong.

1297
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:53,525
I'm right here.

1298
01:28:53,603 --> 01:28:55,969
I asked you to tell them
not to carry their guns.

1299
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:57,767
I did tell them.

1300
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,775
Could you please ask again
and see who's armed?

1301
01:29:00,843 --> 01:29:02,640
Who else is carrying a gun?

1302
01:29:06,482 --> 01:29:09,713
Could you please
get these guns out of here?

1303
01:29:09,785 --> 01:29:11,878
I told you guys
not to bring guns.

1304
01:29:12,588 --> 01:29:13,782
Give it to me.

1305
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:36,205
20,000 shares for Ho's clan,
and 10,000 shares for me.

1306
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:40,477
You're a good investor.
Let me give you the stock.

1307
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:42,676
- Don't you want to count the money?
- I trust you.

1308
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,151
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1309
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,653
When did the two reporters leave?

1310
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:47,484
I showed them the way
and then went back to work.

1311
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:49,649
- I didn't notice when they left.
- Sign here, please.

1312
01:29:49,725 --> 01:29:52,285
Is there anything else, Mr. Ku?

1313
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:54,192
How about the party tonight?

1314
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:55,662
Everything is ready.

1315
01:29:55,731 --> 01:29:56,959
Who is he?

1316
01:29:57,033 --> 01:29:58,864
Mr. Ku, the Shanghai magnate.

1317
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,631
- That's really him?
- Yes.

1318
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:04,700
Thank you.

1319
01:30:05,808 --> 01:30:07,298
Thank you, Mr. Ku.

1320
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:09,344
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

1321
01:30:09,412 --> 01:30:11,778
You've shown me around for days
since I came to Hong Kong.

1322
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:15,840
I must repay your hospitality.
How much do I owe you?

1323
01:30:15,918 --> 01:30:17,647
It was nothing.

1324
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:21,679
No, no. Here's $2,000 for you.

1325
01:30:21,757 --> 01:30:26,751
- So much money.
- Keep it. It's chicken feed to me.

1326
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:29,764
- But it's quite a bundle to you.
- That's right.

1327
01:30:29,832 --> 01:30:34,326
Remember, sell the shares
when they've doubled in price.

1328
01:30:34,403 --> 01:30:36,200
Don't be too greedy.

1329
01:30:37,106 --> 01:30:41,907
Amazing! I can't believe this stack
of paper could be so valuable.

1330
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,673
It's only paper.

1331
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:47,382
This is a very popular stock.

1332
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:49,782
Don't tell anyone that
I gave it to you.

1333
01:30:49,852 --> 01:30:52,582
Remember, sell the stock
when it's doubled in price.

1334
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:55,715
- I'm leaving.
- All right.

1335
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:57,918
Thirty thousand shares.

1336
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,621
Mr. Ku.

1337
01:31:01,864 --> 01:31:04,560
The police clubhouse--

1338
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:08,295
No problem.

1339
01:31:10,172 --> 01:31:12,970
Fortunately, there's one check left.

1340
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,010
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1341
01:31:15,077 --> 01:31:16,908
It's very generous of you.

1342
01:31:19,048 --> 01:31:20,777
$80,000.

1343
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,080
That's too much.
Just $65,000.

1344
01:31:23,152 --> 01:31:26,087
This is my last check.

1345
01:31:26,155 --> 01:31:28,749
How about if I send you another check
when I get back to Shanghai?

1346
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:32,225
- Tear this one up.
- Don't. I'll make up the difference.

1347
01:31:32,294 --> 01:31:33,761
What?

1348
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:36,491
Where can you find the cash?

1349
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:39,835
There's some cash here
that was seized as evidence.

1350
01:31:39,902 --> 01:31:41,665
It's in the evidence room.

1351
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:46,266
I'll get it for you.

1352
01:31:52,114 --> 01:31:54,844
Mr. Ku, here's $13,000.

1353
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:57,010
With my $2,000, that's $15,000.

1354
01:31:57,086 --> 01:31:59,111
You are so thoughtful.

1355
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:04,154
Thank you on behalf
of the Hos, the police and myself.

1356
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:05,784
Thank you.

1357
01:32:08,864 --> 01:32:11,526
It's nothing.
Don't mention it.

1358
01:32:13,102 --> 01:32:14,899
Let go.

1359
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:16,631
Until we meet again.

1360
01:32:18,007 --> 01:32:20,066
Let me see you off.

1361
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:24,078
You don't have to.
Be careful with the stock.

1362
01:32:25,848 --> 01:32:28,681
- Remember: Sell when the price doubles.
- Doubles.

1363
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:35,418
Bye-bye.

1364
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:39,525
How lucky can you get?

1365
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,297
Hey, you. Don't go.

1366
01:32:53,576 --> 01:32:54,508
Me? What's the matter?

1367
01:32:55,845 --> 01:32:58,075
- Don't go.
- Me? What's up?

1368
01:32:58,147 --> 01:33:01,708
- Watch him and don't let him go.
- Inspector Ho is my friend.

1369
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:04,548
Friend? Right.
Keep an eye on him.

1370
01:33:05,387 --> 01:33:07,582
- Gotta go.
- Inspector Ho.

1371
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:12,223
What have you been doing?

1372
01:33:12,294 --> 01:33:14,387
People are still missing,
and you have no clue.

1373
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,522
We do have a clue.

1374
01:33:16,599 --> 01:33:21,002
We now know no ransom is involved
in the case of the missing reporters.

1375
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:23,265
- How do you know that?
- Because their families--

1376
01:33:23,339 --> 01:33:25,773
Inspector. Superintendent.

1377
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:29,273
- Why don't you knock first?
- It's very important.

1378
01:33:29,345 --> 01:33:32,212
Our conversation is important too.

1379
01:33:32,281 --> 01:33:34,545
We have received
no ransom note.

1380
01:33:34,617 --> 01:33:36,551
You idiot! Even the governor
has heard about it!

1381
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:38,746
Find those missing persons
within three days.

1382
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:42,313
Otherwise, one of us gets fired.
Understand?

1383
01:33:48,731 --> 01:33:49,823
And damn you, sir.

1384
01:33:51,033 --> 01:33:52,967
Have you sent people
to the police commissioner's party?

1385
01:33:53,035 --> 01:33:55,128
I took care of it, sir.

1386
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:59,702
You are responsible
for the party's security. Moron!

1387
01:34:01,143 --> 01:34:03,077
Why do I have to do everything?

1388
01:34:03,145 --> 01:34:06,046
- It's me.
- Why don't you knock?

1389
01:34:06,115 --> 01:34:08,743
- I've got something very urgent.
- Urgent?

1390
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:11,217
- Where have you been?
- I went to King's Hotel.

1391
01:34:11,287 --> 01:34:13,016
What did I tell you?

1392
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:15,784
To check out the missing persons.
But I found out something about Mr. Ku.

1393
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:19,885
Didn't I tell you to follow my orders?
You never listen.

1394
01:34:19,962 --> 01:34:23,363
- Hear me out first.
- You don't respect authority.

1395
01:34:23,432 --> 01:34:25,957
- But--
- Why didn't you do as you were told?

1396
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:28,765
- They're jumping all over me.
- I know.

1397
01:34:28,837 --> 01:34:33,274
Then why don't you work on that case?
I am about to be fired.

1398
01:34:33,342 --> 01:34:36,470
All of you. Nobody respects
my authority around here.

1399
01:34:37,313 --> 01:34:39,406
What crime did you commit?

1400
01:34:39,481 --> 01:34:41,210
He's charging me
with obstructing traffic.

1401
01:34:41,283 --> 01:34:43,217
Obstruction is a capital offense.
Come into my office.

1402
01:34:44,119 --> 01:34:46,349
- A capital offense?
- He's crazy.

1403
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:48,447
Any clues
on the missing persons?

1404
01:34:48,524 --> 01:34:50,583
None, but I found Mr. Ku--

1405
01:34:50,659 --> 01:34:54,254
No clues!
After all this time, no clues?

1406
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:56,264
You're not doing your job.

1407
01:34:56,332 --> 01:35:00,166
And your mother expects me
to kick you upstairs!

1408
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:02,136
I'll kick you upstairs, all right!

1409
01:35:02,204 --> 01:35:04,502
Speak up.
What about Mr. Ku?

1410
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,337
We discovered he is not
one of Shanghai's ten richest men.

1411
01:35:08,344 --> 01:35:11,905
He's not one of the richest?
And I suppose you're gonna say you are!

1412
01:35:12,615 --> 01:35:14,981
Just tell me who he is.

1413
01:35:16,619 --> 01:35:18,712
Bastard!

1414
01:35:18,787 --> 01:35:21,688
He's not only
one of Shanghai's richest men...

1415
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:24,089
but also one of the ten
richest men in China.

1416
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,923
Good job!

1417
01:35:29,798 --> 01:35:32,096
I don't need you to tell me that!
Get out.

1418
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:35,503
I've gotta get out of this job.

1419
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:37,664
- Inspector.
- Can't you knock?

1420
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,868
- I need to take a leave.
- Take a leave?

1421
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:42,740
- My mother is sick.
- Is your father sick too?

1422
01:35:42,811 --> 01:35:43,937
No.

1423
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:47,312
Get out.
Don't ever come back!

1424
01:35:50,853 --> 01:35:53,151
Why the long face? The inspector
gave you a hard time, right?

1425
01:35:53,222 --> 01:35:57,181
- I'm going home.
- Be smart like me. Your day will come.

1426
01:35:58,494 --> 01:36:01,088
Work harder.
You'll be promoted.

1427
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,524
Mr. Ku, you're still here?

1428
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,465
Let me see him off.

1429
01:36:06,535 --> 01:36:10,301
Escort Mr. Ku back to his hotel.
Be careful.

1430
01:36:10,372 --> 01:36:14,172
I'll take him
all the way to his hotel.

1431
01:36:14,243 --> 01:36:16,871
Bye-bye, Mr. Ku.

1432
01:36:18,714 --> 01:36:20,705
Where are you taking me?

1433
01:36:20,783 --> 01:36:23,183
That depends on where
you want to end up.

1434
01:36:25,721 --> 01:36:27,655
Inspector.

1435
01:36:30,559 --> 01:36:33,585
- Why does nobody bother to knock?
- Sorry, Inspector.

1436
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:37,359
I saw Kuo's men at the Ritz.
They were armed.

1437
01:36:37,433 --> 01:36:38,798
Who are they?

1438
01:36:38,867 --> 01:36:43,395
They're all on our
"most wanted" list.

1439
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,472
Then why did you leave?

1440
01:36:47,543 --> 01:36:50,034
Get our men there to arrest them.

1441
01:36:50,112 --> 01:36:52,979
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get the warrant.

1442
01:36:54,249 --> 01:36:56,683
Why are you standing there?
My hat.

1443
01:37:01,123 --> 01:37:03,921
Why isn't anybody moving?
We're going to the Ritz.

1444
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:08,052
- Did he tell the truth?
- Yes.

1445
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,655
I've heard their people
are at the Ritz.

1446
01:37:10,733 --> 01:37:13,668
- What about those two guys I sent?
- Haven't heard from them.

1447
01:37:13,736 --> 01:37:17,638
You should trust me.
Kuo took two of your men.

1448
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:19,435
Why did you do this?

1449
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:22,435
I want to stop the killings.

1450
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:28,046
One, two, three, bow.

1451
01:37:28,617 --> 01:37:29,811
Good job.

1452
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:32,979
Let's rehearse.
Luming will be Ku.

1453
01:37:33,522 --> 01:37:36,582
Can't you do a better job?

1454
01:37:36,658 --> 01:37:39,058
I'm Mr. Ku. And you are?

1455
01:37:39,128 --> 01:37:42,689
I'm Foxy,
chairman of the Rotarians.

1456
01:37:46,769 --> 01:37:48,862
That's "Folksy,
chairman of the Rotarians."

1457
01:37:48,937 --> 01:37:51,167
Foxy.
What language are you speaking?

1458
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,266
- Mandarin.
- Stick with Cantonese.

1459
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:57,670
I'm Mr. Ku. And you are?

1460
01:37:57,746 --> 01:37:59,441
I am the governor of Hong Kong.

1461
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:06,047
You're not the governor.
You're the minister of transportation.

1462
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:08,055
I want to be the governor.

1463
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:09,750
Why?

1464
01:38:09,825 --> 01:38:12,350
That bastard
is police commissioner.

1465
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:15,090
So I have to be governor.
I've got to be governor.

1466
01:38:15,164 --> 01:38:17,758
Don't take it so seriously.

1467
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:20,267
I must outrank him.
I'm the governor.

1468
01:38:22,604 --> 01:38:26,734
- He demands to be the governor.
- Let him be governor if he wants.

1469
01:38:30,312 --> 01:38:32,212
Rehearse them for me
a few more times.

1470
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,181
One more time.
Cooperate, please.

1471
01:38:34,249 --> 01:38:38,208
Boss, Miss Shun
wants to see you.

1472
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,619
One more time.
One, two, three, bow.

1473
01:38:40,689 --> 01:38:44,318
This place is surrounded
by police.

1474
01:38:44,393 --> 01:38:46,486
- Surrounded?
- Yes.

1475
01:38:57,072 --> 01:38:59,165
What is it?

1476
01:38:59,908 --> 01:39:03,537
- We're surrounded by the police.
- Police? Why?

1477
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:07,446
I overheard that they're waiting
for a warrant.

1478
01:39:07,516 --> 01:39:10,610
That inspector must think
we're having a gang fight.

1479
01:39:10,686 --> 01:39:14,144
We can't leave and Madam Rose
is waiting. Time is running out.

1480
01:39:14,223 --> 01:39:16,214
They'll find out the whole thing
is made up.

1481
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,419
- Oh, no!
- That poor lady.

1482
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,020
- What do we do now?
- How should I know?

1483
01:39:22,097 --> 01:39:25,589
- What can we do?
- He's the one who makes the decisions.

1484
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:29,364
- You have to come up with something.
- What to do now?

1485
01:39:29,438 --> 01:39:32,464
- I'll find Inspector Ho.
- You can't go off without a plan.

1486
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:34,634
I know. But we don't have
much choice here.

1487
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,439
I'll go out the back.

1488
01:39:45,621 --> 01:39:47,452
Someone is coming.

1489
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:51,857
Why are you two down here?
Get up to the rehearsal.

1490
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:57,430
Tell Uncle Hai I'm going to the station.
I'll contact him when I find Ho.

1491
01:39:57,499 --> 01:39:59,797
- Tell him not to go anywhere.
- Okay.

1492
01:40:12,915 --> 01:40:14,780
How come you guys
are still here?

1493
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:22,354
- What should we do now?
- Call Fei.

1494
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:26,016
Harder. Push me up there.

1495
01:40:27,629 --> 01:40:29,824
My men may be looking for me.
Thanks.

1496
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:33,330
He said he went to get
Inspector Ho.

1497
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,199
Is everything ready?

1498
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,636
Don't worry.
We know what to do.

1499
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:43,169
Yes? What's up?

1500
01:40:44,646 --> 01:40:47,274
They found the bodies
of your men.

1501
01:40:47,349 --> 01:40:49,112
Kuo killed them.

1502
01:40:50,552 --> 01:40:52,486
He killed my men?

1503
01:40:52,554 --> 01:40:54,522
Where is he?
What's he up to?

1504
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,854
He went to look
for Inspector Ho.

1505
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,358
Why is he looking for him?

1506
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:02,624
He may be working
with the police.

1507
01:41:03,632 --> 01:41:06,965
Damn it! Let's go.

1508
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,005
I can't take care of you two
right now.

1509
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:19,343
I'm gonna be talking
to your boss soon.

1510
01:41:20,716 --> 01:41:23,651
The street is closed.
Go around.

1511
01:41:24,853 --> 01:41:26,343
What now?

1512
01:41:26,421 --> 01:41:29,857
- I'm hungry. I want something to eat.
- Me too. Let's go.

1513
01:41:29,925 --> 01:41:31,790
I can't find him anywhere.

1514
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:41,168
He's coming.
Let's go get him.

1515
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,407
Freeze!

1516
01:41:53,782 --> 01:41:56,216
You can't escape now.

1517
01:42:11,933 --> 01:42:13,798
My legs!

1518
01:42:13,869 --> 01:42:15,632
My hands!

1519
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:28,005
- You broke my pots. Pay for the damage.
- Pay for your pots, my ass!

1520
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:36,381
Hold it. Don't try to run!

1521
01:44:21,329 --> 01:44:22,887
Hurry!

1522
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:30,603
You've got nowhere to run.
Come on.

1523
01:44:30,672 --> 01:44:33,197
Prepare yourselves.
Guests are arriving.

1524
01:44:33,275 --> 01:44:35,243
- See if everything is ready.
- Yes.

1525
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,801
I'll figure out what to do.
Don't worry.

1526
01:44:39,915 --> 01:44:41,439
Is there a problem?

1527
01:44:41,516 --> 01:44:43,711
They're rehearsing
how the guests are going to enter.

1528
01:44:43,785 --> 01:44:46,276
We have enough time.
Don't be nervous.

1529
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:53,794
Where is he?

1530
01:44:53,862 --> 01:44:55,955
Up there.

1531
01:45:01,937 --> 01:45:03,131
Bring him down.

1532
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:08,538
Tiger, I'm sorry I missed
our appointment.

1533
01:45:13,882 --> 01:45:16,715
Damn it. I really liked you.

1534
01:45:17,519 --> 01:45:20,147
I promise to have dim sum
with you.

1535
01:45:20,222 --> 01:45:22,782
But I have something urgent
to take care of. Please let me go.

1536
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:25,122
Let you go?

1537
01:45:25,193 --> 01:45:28,594
I sent two of my men
to invite you for dim sum.

1538
01:45:28,663 --> 01:45:33,225
- You killed them. Why?
- No, I didn't. I set them free.

1539
01:45:36,104 --> 01:45:38,038
- I'm telling the truth.
- Give me the gun.

1540
01:45:38,106 --> 01:45:40,267
You don't understand
what I'm saying?

1541
01:45:40,342 --> 01:45:43,539
I didn't kill them.
They'll come back soon.

1542
01:45:44,246 --> 01:45:47,579
Fei, tell him I didn't kill them.

1543
01:45:47,649 --> 01:45:50,675
You did.
The bodies have been found.

1544
01:45:51,953 --> 01:45:53,511
That's impossible.

1545
01:45:53,588 --> 01:45:56,819
Tiger, don't believe him.
He's a scoundrel.

1546
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,759
You're a good man, and so am I.
He didn't like being under me.

1547
01:45:59,828 --> 01:46:02,023
They'll be back soon.
Believe me.

1548
01:46:02,097 --> 01:46:04,497
You said you didn't kill them.
Where are they?

1549
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,393
I'm sure they'll be back
any minute.

1550
01:46:07,469 --> 01:46:11,428
- It's time you paid for their lives.
- Damn it, I'm not a fool.

1551
01:46:11,506 --> 01:46:15,203
Tiger, believe me.
I didn't kill them.

1552
01:46:15,277 --> 01:46:17,472
Tiger! Tiger!

1553
01:46:17,545 --> 01:46:21,481
Don't kill me now. There's something
I must do and then I'll come back.

1554
01:46:21,549 --> 01:46:26,316
- Bullshit! I'll kill you now.
- They're back.

1555
01:46:31,192 --> 01:46:33,160
I told you I didn't kill them.

1556
01:46:33,228 --> 01:46:34,923
Aren't you two
supposed to be dead?

1557
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:36,691
Not really. He tied us up.

1558
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:39,256
- But he set us free.
- Damn it, I was worried about you.

1559
01:46:39,334 --> 01:46:42,269
Tiger, I told you
I didn't cheat you.

1560
01:46:43,071 --> 01:46:45,471
You thug! So you're the one
who wants to be the boss!

1561
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,906
Tiger, I did it for you.

1562
01:46:47,976 --> 01:46:50,035
I'd make a better boss.

1563
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:52,739
Shit! You wouldn't be better!

1564
01:46:52,814 --> 01:46:55,612
- Release him.
- Hurry!

1565
01:46:55,684 --> 01:46:57,652
Tiger, I did it for both of us.

1566
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:00,381
Keep that in mind.

1567
01:47:00,455 --> 01:47:03,856
It's between him and me now,
so you stay out of it.

1568
01:47:03,925 --> 01:47:07,361
Between you and him?
Okay, I'll stay out of it.

1569
01:47:07,429 --> 01:47:09,897
I caught him,
but you're gonna have to hold him.

1570
01:47:13,268 --> 01:47:16,465
Tiger, I promise to have
dim sum with you some other time.

1571
01:47:16,538 --> 01:47:18,062
Good.

1572
01:47:18,139 --> 01:47:20,733
Fei, as you said,
it's between you and me.

1573
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:22,970
Why don't we resolve it
at home?

1574
01:47:23,044 --> 01:47:24,909
I've got something urgent to do.
Excuse me.

1575
01:47:27,415 --> 01:47:29,315
I'm not gonna let you go
so easily.

1576
01:47:34,022 --> 01:47:35,421
Tiger.

1577
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:38,050
I won't meddle in your business,
but rules are rules.

1578
01:47:38,126 --> 01:47:40,151
I'll keep the guns for you.

1579
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,864
Don't worry, young man.

1580
01:47:45,934 --> 01:47:48,368
I'll take care of any snipers.

1581
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:51,706
If you promise,
that means I'm dead meat!

1582
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:53,867
If you promise,
that means I'm dead meat!

1583
01:47:55,777 --> 01:47:58,439
If you get him,
you can have the factory.

1584
01:48:16,631 --> 01:48:18,861
Great! Good job.

1585
01:48:18,933 --> 01:48:21,128
Stop fighting, please.
We have an urgent matter here.

1586
01:48:21,202 --> 01:48:23,295
- We'll resume the fight after that.
- Get him.

1587
01:50:54,489 --> 01:50:56,582
Where is he?

1588
01:51:35,129 --> 01:51:36,721
Pull the rope.

1589
01:51:54,949 --> 01:51:56,541
Lord help me.

1590
01:52:27,315 --> 01:52:29,374
Don't jump!

1591
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,515
I told you not to jump.

1592
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:48,660
Stop fighting.

1593
01:53:57,705 --> 01:54:01,072
Fei, don't run away.
It's your turn now.

1594
01:54:08,316 --> 01:54:09,783
You're great.

1595
01:54:12,487 --> 01:54:14,614
You've done
at least one good thing.

1596
01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:16,418
All the factory workers
are behind you.

1597
01:54:16,491 --> 01:54:19,551
When you repossess the plant,
we'll be brothers again.

1598
01:54:19,627 --> 01:54:22,152
Thank you, Cheng Wah.

1599
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,993
I've got to go.
Time is running out.

1600
01:54:24,065 --> 01:54:26,727
Young man,
I admire you more than ever.

1601
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:29,964
Your dispute is settled,
and our misunderstanding is cleared up.

1602
01:54:30,037 --> 01:54:30,833
Let's be friends.

1603
01:54:30,905 --> 01:54:32,930
I don't have time to make friends
with you now.

1604
01:54:33,007 --> 01:54:36,340
Because I beat you up?

1605
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,675
You can hit me back.

1606
01:54:40,214 --> 01:54:42,307
Go ahead, hit me.
Don't be afraid.

1607
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,479
- Get him.
- Stop!

1608
01:54:47,555 --> 01:54:49,420
That was great.

1609
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:52,624
Young man, you fought well.

1610
01:54:52,693 --> 01:54:55,287
Here, I still owe you a slap.

1611
01:55:08,576 --> 01:55:10,373
We will be good friends
from now on.

1612
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,777
I really have to go now,
my friend.

1613
01:55:13,481 --> 01:55:15,972
If anything happens,
count on me to help.

1614
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:18,041
With friends like you...!

1615
01:55:18,119 --> 01:55:21,384
- What's the hurry?
- Tiger, lend me your car.

1616
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:25,358
- What?
- I need to use your car.

1617
01:55:27,495 --> 01:55:30,328
- Did I say that right?
- Yes, perfectly.

1618
01:55:32,934 --> 01:55:35,061
Inspector Ho,
someone is here to see you.

1619
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:37,601
Inspector Ho.

1620
01:55:37,672 --> 01:55:40,106
- Go out and keep watch.
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:55:40,174 --> 01:55:42,768
Please call off your men,
Inspector Ho.

1622
01:55:42,844 --> 01:55:46,075
How did you get out?
Stand up.

1623
01:55:46,147 --> 01:55:49,878
Please call off your men.
We're doing a good thing at the Ritz.

1624
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:51,851
I'm sure catching you all
will be a good thing.

1625
01:55:54,021 --> 01:55:56,387
You didn't search
for the missing persons like I told you.

1626
01:55:56,457 --> 01:55:58,448
Why did you send your men
to the Ritz?

1627
01:55:58,526 --> 01:55:59,550
Sir--

1628
01:55:59,627 --> 01:56:02,619
Don't "sir" me. The attorney general
just told me everything.

1629
01:56:02,697 --> 01:56:03,789
I'm telling you...

1630
01:56:03,865 --> 01:56:07,096
from now on, your only job
will be to find the missing persons.

1631
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:09,159
Or turn up missing yourself.

1632
01:56:09,237 --> 01:56:11,728
I know the whereabouts
of those missing persons.

1633
01:56:14,008 --> 01:56:15,441
- Who's he?
- The owner of the Ritz.

1634
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:19,173
- Do you really know?
- Four reporters, two businessmen?

1635
01:56:19,247 --> 01:56:22,273
- That's why I brought him to you.
- Follow me.

1636
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:28,079
- You too.
- Yes, sir.

1637
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:33,182
You must solve the case
of the missing persons first.

1638
01:56:33,261 --> 01:56:35,286
The Ritz owner knows
their whereabouts.

1639
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:37,058
Search the Ritz.

1640
01:56:37,131 --> 01:56:40,225
No, they're preparing a party
for Madam Rose.

1641
01:56:40,301 --> 01:56:43,464
- An order is an order.
- But they're not at the Ritz.

1642
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:47,497
- Where are they?
- Free my friends and I'll tell.

1643
01:56:47,575 --> 01:56:49,907
- First, let me make a call.
- I can't promise you that.

1644
01:56:49,977 --> 01:56:52,502
My men won't free them
without my call.

1645
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:56,175
- And things will get worse.
- All right, make the call.

1646
01:56:57,885 --> 01:56:59,580
Thank you.

1647
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:04,350
- Luming.
- Yes?

1648
01:57:04,425 --> 01:57:07,417
- Tell Uncle Hai to release them.
- Free the reporters.

1649
01:57:07,495 --> 01:57:11,932
Tell Madam Rose we can't come.
Tell our men the party is cancelled.

1650
01:57:15,403 --> 01:57:17,371
What now?

1651
01:57:18,339 --> 01:57:20,569
One more time.
Make it better.

1652
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:26,141
No need to practice.
The party is cancelled.

1653
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:31,643
Why did you kidnap them?

1654
01:57:31,719 --> 01:57:34,051
- To keep the secret.
- A secret about your crimes?

1655
01:57:34,121 --> 01:57:35,645
It's not your turn to speak.

1656
01:57:35,723 --> 01:57:38,248
- What secret?
- A woman's secret.

1657
01:57:38,326 --> 01:57:40,487
Does she have anything
to do with you?

1658
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:43,462
Nothing. I just buy a rose
from her every day.

1659
01:57:45,132 --> 01:57:47,794
I know no one will believe me.

1660
01:57:47,868 --> 01:57:51,429
We do believe you.
We just can't figure out the kidnapping.

1661
01:57:51,505 --> 01:57:54,736
That's why I had to kidnap those people.
Oh, you wouldn't understand!

1662
01:57:54,809 --> 01:57:57,209
Let me put it this way.
Her daughter has a rich boyfriend.

1663
01:57:57,278 --> 01:57:59,246
They came back to Hong Kong
and want to get married.

1664
01:57:59,313 --> 01:58:03,374
The mother has panicked, because
she had pretended she was rich too.

1665
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:06,511
She didn't want to lie to her daughter.
She's got a heart of gold.

1666
01:58:06,587 --> 01:58:08,782
The first day I came here,
she told me to be careful...

1667
01:58:08,856 --> 01:58:10,847
because it's easy to get conned
in Hong Kong.

1668
01:58:10,925 --> 01:58:12,984
A con man had taken
my last penny.

1669
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:15,961
I depended on her roses for luck.

1670
01:58:16,030 --> 01:58:18,692
You ladies will understand,
I'm sure...

1671
01:58:18,766 --> 01:58:21,599
a mother's love
for her daughter.

1672
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:24,297
So I kidnapped those reporters.
But I didn't hurt them.

1673
01:58:24,372 --> 01:58:27,341
I did it out of good will...

1674
01:58:27,408 --> 01:58:29,808
because I wanted
to help her keep her secret.

1675
01:58:32,346 --> 01:58:34,974
- Do you understand?
- Could you put it more clearly?

1676
01:58:35,049 --> 01:58:37,745
We don't yet understand.

1677
01:58:37,818 --> 01:58:40,446
All right, I'll speak slowly.

1678
01:58:41,355 --> 01:58:43,516
Once there was a flower girl.

1679
01:58:43,591 --> 01:58:45,559
No, a flowerwoman.

1680
01:58:45,626 --> 01:58:47,685
She had a daughter and--

1681
01:58:51,666 --> 01:58:53,759
Dad, the guests--

1682
01:58:57,038 --> 01:59:00,201
- Sorry. I must see Madam Kao.
- Stop the music.

1683
01:59:01,676 --> 01:59:04,474
Why aren't the guests here yet?

1684
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:10,608
A car broke down
and blocked the street...

1685
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:12,585
and all the guests
are stuck in traffic.

1686
01:59:12,653 --> 01:59:14,211
But they're coming.

1687
01:59:18,059 --> 01:59:20,493
I'm sorry.

1688
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:22,756
We did our best.

1689
01:59:28,836 --> 01:59:30,929
I know what I must do.

1690
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:37,076
- We tried so hard. Why can't it work?
- Are you talking to me?

1691
01:59:41,382 --> 01:59:43,816
Mr. and Mrs. Kao...

1692
01:59:44,118 --> 01:59:46,279
what's this all about?

1693
01:59:46,353 --> 01:59:48,981
I think by now...

1694
01:59:50,725 --> 01:59:53,626
you must have realized
there's something wrong.

1695
01:59:53,694 --> 01:59:55,127
What's happened?

1696
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:58,259
Don't worry.
There's a solution to every problem.

1697
01:59:58,866 --> 02:00:01,858
I know you came to Hong Kong...

1698
02:00:01,936 --> 02:00:03,870
to look into Belle's
family background.

1699
02:00:03,938 --> 02:00:05,667
You have sound reasons
to do so.

1700
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:08,835
Whether the guests
come or not...

1701
02:00:08,909 --> 02:00:11,343
we can still enjoy ourselves.

1702
02:00:11,412 --> 02:00:13,380
Let's have something
to eat first.

1703
02:00:14,949 --> 02:00:16,940
Let me finish.

1704
02:00:18,519 --> 02:00:23,149
Mr. Ku, I hope you appreciate
the fact...

1705
02:00:25,793 --> 02:00:28,660
that Belle
is very important to me.

1706
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:30,720
For her happiness...

1707
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:35,528
I would do anything.

1708
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:39,032
Ma, I don't want
to see you like this.

1709
02:00:39,106 --> 02:00:41,973
Tell me what has upset you.

1710
02:00:45,913 --> 02:00:50,612
Now I realize no matter
how hard you try...

1711
02:00:51,986 --> 02:00:54,887
you can't have something
you don't deserve.

1712
02:00:54,955 --> 02:00:58,322
I'm sorry I insisted
on having the engagement dinner.

1713
02:00:58,392 --> 02:01:01,691
I didn't realize
you didn't want to do it.

1714
02:01:01,762 --> 02:01:03,457
It's not that.

1715
02:01:04,732 --> 02:01:06,859
I was saying...

1716
02:01:11,205 --> 02:01:13,867
my identity as Madam Kao--

1717
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:15,602
All right, Madam Kao.

1718
02:01:15,676 --> 02:01:18,406
If it's nothing to do
with the wedding...

1719
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:20,777
you don't have to say it.

1720
02:01:20,848 --> 02:01:22,748
Madam, I want you to know...

1721
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,614
I love Belle too.

1722
02:01:24,685 --> 02:01:28,985
That's why
I have to speak the truth now.

1723
02:01:29,924 --> 02:01:33,985
I want you all to know
that I am--

1724
02:01:40,534 --> 02:01:42,092
Music, music!

1725
02:01:44,338 --> 02:01:47,501
- I am not--
- The guests have arrived.

1740
02:02:45,666 --> 02:02:47,896
Why are you dressed like that?

1741
02:02:47,968 --> 02:02:50,402
The attorney general
lent it to me.

1742
02:02:50,471 --> 02:02:52,132
How did you get them here?

1743
02:02:52,206 --> 02:02:54,265
I told them their presence
was mandatory.

You finally did something good
on your own.

1749
02:03:26,774 --> 02:03:29,743
I wish I could do
something good like that...

1750
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:32,643
but I don't have the courage.

1751
02:03:32,713 --> 02:03:34,647
Why are you crying?

1752
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:37,884
I'm going to the rest room.

1753
02:03:44,792 --> 02:03:47,727
Stop crying.
You'll look awful.

1754
02:03:49,596 --> 02:03:52,030
Do I really look that awful?

1755
02:04:07,648 --> 02:04:09,081
Ma.

1756
02:04:10,351 --> 02:04:12,285
Bye-bye.
