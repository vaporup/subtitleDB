1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,201
There are 666 portals that connect
this world to the other side.

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,437
These are concealed from
all human beings.

3
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,672
Somewhere in Japan exists
the 444th portal.

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,010
The Forest of Resurrection.

5
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,771
This way.

6
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,876
Better be right.

7
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,680
Just follow me.

8
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,123
Where are they?

9
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,999
Don't worry, they are coming.

10
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:09,634
I'm not worried. I just don't trust you.

11
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,602
Do as you please then.

12
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,380
It's a quite a big deal
for a pick up, isn't it.

13
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,099
Where's the other car?

14
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,348
We gotta wait for him.

15
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:01,842
Are you serious?

16
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,884
It's not safe here.

17
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,519
We have specific orders from him.

18
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:13,564
Look, the roads could be
blocked by now.

19
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,600
We gotta go!

20
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,396
What's the matter? You afraid?

21
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,802
Shut up.

22
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,204
What the hell we doing here anyway?

23
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,435
You shut up.
An order is an order.

24
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,079
Stop whining.

25
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,239
Orders?

26
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,410
Do you know what we had to
go through for this?

27
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,822
Besides, this place gives me the creeps.

28
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,455
Don't bother.

29
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,729
These assholes will only follow orders.

30
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:48,757
What?

31
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,494
Is there any party?

32
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,968
Or you trying to promote hoodlums?

33
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,007
You... Better watch your mouth.

34
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,802
After all this running around,

35
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,478
all we get is a useless
bunch of punks. Forget it.

36
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,884
I see. So shall I give you a rest?

37
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,014
Forever.

38
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,491
Stop!

39
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,824
We gotta keep him alive.
It's an order.

40
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,224
Shut up!

41
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,801
I do not get the point
why he is so special.

42
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,607
But you have to follow orders, too, right?

43
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,539
Calm down! Both of you.

44
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,273
Back off.

45
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,844
Don't be so choosy.

46
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:47,859
We gonna let you get out of here
when he comes, all right?

47
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:52,822
I hate waiting.

48
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,029
Stop it for now.

49
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,807
Okay,

50
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,877
we'll wait for him.

51
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,617
We better hurry up.

52
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:21,456
I hate this place.

53
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,624
A forest to the southwest is
an ominous feng shui sign.

54
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,359
Oh, really?

55
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,204
To meet with you guys is
an ominous enough.

56
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,207
Stop it. Don't start again!

57
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,176
Bring the girl.

58
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,878
What's with this girl?

59
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,980
Just following orders.

60
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,147
One girl and one asshole.

61
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,226
What good are they?

62
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,556
What the hell is he doing?

63
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,864
Come on, he should have some plan.

64
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,297
Hey wait.

65
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,207
I'm taking no part in kidnapping.

66
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,666
What?

67
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,509
5 men on one girl,
you must be proud of yourself.

68
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,844
Hey, let her go and take off your wig.

69
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,885
Shut the fuck up!

70
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:03,861
Do you know who you're talking to?

71
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:11,336
We are the ones set you free
from the jail where you belonged.

72
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,932
I'm a feminist.

73
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,245
So, what you gonna do?

74
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,649
I said let her go.

75
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,879
Watch it.

76
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,519
Just let her go.

77
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,492
Are you crazy or what?

78
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,556
Don't let me tell you again.

79
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,161
This would be your last chance.

80
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,767
What now, tough guy?

81
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,331
Where did they go?

82
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,297
This place is wrong.

83
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,534
I'll kill him.

84
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,975
Better not.

85
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,381
He'll become a monster, too.

86
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,814
I don't get it...

87
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,315
Oh Yes. I can kill him twice.

88
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,016
Nonsense.

89
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,094
Let's get out of here.

90
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,688
No, we'll go after them!

91
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,701
You don't understand.

92
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,361
Look, this is your fault...

93
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,166
It's not just that. Think about it.

94
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,366
Thinking isn't going to do a bit of good.

95
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:31,614
Nonsense. They were not dead.

96
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,524
Let's get them before he gets here.

97
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,692
Yeah,

98
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,924
you're right.

99
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,170
You didn't have to kill him!

100
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,671
What's your problem?

101
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,977
You're no different from those men.

102
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,375
They're bastards, I'm not.

103
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,987
I'm sorry...

104
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,392
Thanks for helping me.

105
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,867
I didn't mean to help you.

106
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,230
They just piss me off.

107
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,364
What are we gonna do?

108
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,711
Didn't you have any plans?

109
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,206
Plans are always changed.

110
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,218
Great. They're going to kill us.

111
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,629
They were...

112
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,799
Surely dead.

113
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:13,617
Hey.

114
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,529
Why were you in jail...?

115
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,635
Shut up.

116
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,785
Something's not right with this place.

117
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,014
About what?

118
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,819
People are everywhere...

119
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,051
but it's too quiet.

120
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,632
Nobody's here.

121
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,733
I feel them.

122
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,839
What makes you feel that?

123
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,779
I have a strong sixth sense...

124
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:54,906
Hey,

125
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,610
wait.

126
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,418
What's wrong with you?

127
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,058
Where the fuck you think
you are going?

128
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,768
Stay back.

129
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,042
This man...

130
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,535
What are you doing?

131
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,513
Stop!

132
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,246
Let him rest in peace!

133
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,320
I don't believe this...

134
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,763
You're crazy.

135
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,966
Let's go. We'll take their car.

136
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,339
Stop it! Let's get out of here.

137
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,654
They must be around here.

138
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,231
Something's wrong here.

139
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:41,764
Again?

140
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:43,457
I can feel it!

141
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,069
They were...

142
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,332
Something is wrong!

143
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,008
Hey...

144
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:58,508
What?

145
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,178
They were dead...

146
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,346
and they came back to life.

147
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,683
So what?

148
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,283
The dead could be back to life here.

149
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,223
So what?

150
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:15,859
We've been here over and over...

151
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:23,574
We always buried the ones we killed...

152
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,046
Dead bodies are everywhere...

153
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,308
Where the fuck are they?

154
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,120
No, I didn't mean to...

155
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:00,246
Come!

156
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,585
Let go of me!

157
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,246
Game is over.

158
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,881
What are those monsters?

159
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,054
Who knows, they are your playmates.

160
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,689
Then you die, and play with me!

161
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,365
Remember your orders!

162
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,702
Don't kill him!

163
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:59,008
Hey, you got wrong man.

164
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,007
Just let him go.

165
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,449
Don't be a fool, punk.

166
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,490
Wow.

167
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,124
This is complicated.

168
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,827
Hey, she's been taken away.

169
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:26,332
What?

170
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:30,370
That runt shot my arm
and took the girl.

171
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:36,440
Jesus, the both of you!
You're both crazy!

172
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:39,942
You turning back?

173
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,589
Well, I'll play with you later.

174
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,952
OK?

175
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:59,658
Good job shithead, now he's gone.

176
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:08,010
Don't you get it?
I let him find the girl for us.

177
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:09,039
Huh?

178
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,413
We'll get them both after he finds her.

179
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:20,188
Pretty smart...

180
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:24,856
Orders are to get both of them alive.

181
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,334
Oh... too bad.

182
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,830
It doesn't matter anymore.

183
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,210
You...

184
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,305
I'll be in charge from now on and
he will die.

185
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,184
What?

186
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,488
It's all been planned.
He comes here to be killed.

187
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,617
Don't fool with me!

188
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:02,596
What the fuck?

189
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:29,287
Die slowly.
We don't want you back alive.

190
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,654
Are you okay?

191
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,032
Yeah... But this place is fucked up.

192
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:43,700
Nothing can stop me...
Not even those monsters.

193
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,003
Don't worry.

194
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,247
Hurry up!

195
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,103
Bastards...

196
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,501
Ouch!

197
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,571
You okay?

198
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,300
Shit...

199
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,012
Your hand!

200
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:28,646
He took it... That bastard!

201
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:31,219
Damn it! We'll make them pay for this.

202
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,983
Shouldn't we report back?

203
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,091
No...

204
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:39,719
We'll search for them...
and destroy them!

205
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,229
Yeah... But where are they?

206
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,126
I know what they're thinking.

207
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:49,598
They took the mountain paths.

208
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,110
I was trained at FBI HQ at Langley.

209
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,041
I'm an expert in profiling.

210
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,339
An expert?...

211
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,742
Expert, so where in the mountains?

212
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,580
Don't worry. I'll track them down.

213
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,454
I grew up in
Yellow Stone National park,

214
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:10,886
a natural born hunter!

215
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,052
A hunter?

216
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,990
Which way?

217
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:16,394
No!

218
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,898
Shut the fuck up!

219
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,430
What's wrong here...

220
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,096
He'll come after us.
Let me go!

221
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,605
This is so insane.

222
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:33,013
You... You did all this?

223
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,349
It's all your fault!

224
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,156
Stop... You're crazy...

225
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:41,852
Hey.

226
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,289
No!

227
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,993
What?

228
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,966
You don't have to kill him.

229
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,102
Shut up. Don't preach at me.

230
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:01,109
You can't hurt people for no reason.

231
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,674
A lot of people are better dead.

232
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,814
That's not for you to judge.

233
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,585
What are you? A preacher?

234
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,449
Let's go.

235
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,958
Look, no more killing, okay!

236
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:33,570
We've been waiting.

237
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,014
Finally... This is going to end soon.

238
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:00,661
My gun.

239
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:39,807
Who are you?

240
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,209
How did you get here?

241
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,007
I was kidnapped...

242
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,019
um...

243
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,485
What?

244
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,481
I can't remember.

245
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,720
Huh?

246
00:44:56,893 --> 00:45:02,729
I can't remember anything what
happened before I got here.

247
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,598
Yeah, right.

248
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,969
How about you?

249
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:12,866
What got you in prison?

250
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:13,907
I was...

251
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,840
What? You don't remember either?

252
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,443
I forget things easily.

253
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,480
So... You too.

254
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:17,663
When did you get here?

255
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:19,807
Now.

256
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,911
What's going on? What are those
monsters... those two weirdos?

257
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,883
What are you up to?

258
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,052
Something bad.

259
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:40,428
Where are others?

260
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:45,032
Where? They're all dead.

261
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,326
Oh,

262
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,168
and why are you alive?

263
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,572
Gotta problem?

264
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,306
Yeah. You.

265
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,159
A scumbag like you should be dead.

266
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:43,184
Oooh, who are these scary people?

267
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:48,160
You're dead.

268
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:08,574
No, let's get away from here.

269
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,541
That was pretty good.

270
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,384
But not good enough...

271
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:04,931
Hey, babe.

272
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,461
What are you?

273
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,967
You'll need an army to kill me.

274
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,441
You.

275
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,406
I'll give you power...

276
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:52,415
in death.

277
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:11,366
Him!

278
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,455
No, we have to go!

279
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,124
No, not him! Let's go! Now!

280
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,122
Hurts?

281
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,158
Human life is only an instant.

282
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:20,859
Your body will eventually rot.

283
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,605
Do you wanna be dead?

284
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,440
or wanna have eternal life?

285
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:47,962
Eternal...

286
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,373
Any trouble?

287
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,143
Yes, a little accident.

288
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:09,979
Are you okay officer?

289
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,754
Don't call me officer.

290
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,004
Did you do it again?

291
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:36,569
You better behave yourself,

292
00:53:36,946 --> 00:53:38,311
officer...

293
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:45,353
You want to fight me, the master of
all martial arts? The Fighter!

294
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,721
Okay, Fighter.

295
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:49,215
Fighter?

296
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,061
We don't have time.

297
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,960
Let's kill them!

298
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,824
Right, Fighter.

299
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,265
Your heart!

300
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,626
Here. Help yourself.

301
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,007
What?

302
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,908
Mother fucker!!!

303
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,894
I'll show you the world beyond death...

304
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,005
Come on.

305
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,581
Let's go.

306
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,240
Why?

307
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,379
We have to hurry.

308
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:32,352
No. I never turn my back.

309
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,790
We don't have time for this.

310
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,683
That man is dangerous...

311
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,525
Who is he? You know him.

312
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,959
He's...

313
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,690
That's enough.

314
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,664
Who is he?
