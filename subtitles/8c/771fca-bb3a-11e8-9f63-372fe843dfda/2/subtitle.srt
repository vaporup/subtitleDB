1
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:03,945
Who are you?

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,649
What does this have to do with me?

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,456
Because...

4
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:11,688
Say it!

5
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:23,701
...It's your destiny.

6
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:26,238
What?

7
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:32,615
You're destined to fight him.

8
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,255
Destiny? I've never met him before.

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,890
...You have.

10
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:43,461
What?

11
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,607
The Resurrection...

12
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,843
We'll talk later.

13
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,636
It's time.

14
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:47,496
You said something about Resurrection...

15
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,338
The power of getting the dead
soul back to the body.

16
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:58,044
It can be used only in
the Forest of Resurrection...

17
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,384
Now what?

18
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,892
Here is the Forest of Resurrection.

19
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,420
I don't understand.

20
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:24,498
He is resurrecting the dead
with the power.

21
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:28,737
Resurrection?

22
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:35,251
I have killed them.

23
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,055
That's because...

24
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,147
Who's that?

25
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,133
Another one. Is she dead too?

26
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:52,431
No, she's alive.

27
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,787
What are you?

28
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:38,204
Don't kill her!

29
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,541
I was only trying to help.

30
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,116
Help? I never lose.

31
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:38,606
What the hell...?

32
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,719
Stop.

33
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,989
Huh?

34
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,628
They're around here...

35
00:07:59,064 --> 00:07:59,928
What?

36
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,825
I can smell...

37
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,036
Smell?

38
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,069
I smell...

39
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,172
Like a top dog breeder.

40
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,802
Smell? Like a dog breeder?

41
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,075
I smell...

42
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:25,655
Look.

43
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,082
An escapee.

44
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,285
Here is the death warrant!

45
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,630
Go!

46
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:40,403
Die!

47
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:57,020
Shit...

48
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:01,881
This way...

49
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,094
No.

50
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,075
Wait!

51
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,441
You're not...

52
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,778
You're not...

53
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:31,948
Let me talk, bitch!

54
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,057
Speak.

55
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,721
You're not a monster yet, right?

56
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,287
You neither, aren't you.

57
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:48,032
Hold it! I was just taken here...

58
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:48,969
Bitch!!!

59
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,882
It seems we are the only survivors.

60
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,379
...Baby.

61
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,356
What's going on?

62
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:12,960
I don't know, let's get out of here.

63
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,932
With you?

64
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:21,767
Come on, I know this place!

65
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,474
Okay.

66
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,335
One wrong move

67
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:31,913
and you're dead.

68
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:34,079
Okay.

69
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,374
You changed.

70
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,646
Get up.

71
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,025
Don't you remember?

72
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,951
Remember what?

73
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:22,164
About me...

74
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,267
Never seen you before.

75
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:30,105
Why did you help me then?

76
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,944
I didn't mean to help.

77
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,843
You came after me... and saved me.

78
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:44,614
What did you mean by destiny?

79
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:47,687
I will tell you.

80
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,888
You...

81
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,626
Good... You're still alive.

82
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:00,032
So you caused all of these.

83
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:03,674
I knew you could survive.

84
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,240
I don't know you.

85
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,005
Fuck off.

86
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:12,610
Your soul does...

87
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:16,646
Whatever. What do you want?

88
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,214
Time has come.

89
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,847
Give me the girl and come with me.

90
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:22,386
No.

91
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:28,062
What are you both talking about?

92
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:32,228
He really doesn't remember
anything at all?

93
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,265
Leave us alone.

94
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,642
No, I've waited...

95
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:43,174
What do you want?

96
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,476
He wants me dead.

97
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,251
What?

98
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:57,894
Come, I'll grant you a power.

99
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:24,321
Let's talk between us.

100
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,586
What's going on?

101
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,725
The girl's blood gives me a power.

102
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,266
This is the Forest of Resurrection.

103
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:43,433
The gate.

104
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,905
Portal to the other side.

105
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:54,850
Where the dead become zombies...
that's about it.

106
00:13:56,387 --> 00:14:03,657
The real power of the forest is
much greater.

107
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:15,295
There are two keys to open
the gate to the other side.

108
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,404
One is human sacrifice,

109
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:27,574
the other is the Blood of Resurrection.

110
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,682
I found them...

111
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:33,685
500 years ago.

112
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,055
You're totally insane.

113
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:44,161
Come with me. I'll show you
the power of darkness.

114
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:48,669
Don't tell me what to do!

115
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:04,184
Just listen.

116
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,019
You can't kill me.

117
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:09,855
Shut up.

118
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:20,426
You made me wait 500 years for
the girl to reincarnate.

119
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,732
But I forgive you.

120
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:43,755
I've waited for her to
reincarnate and mature.

121
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:50,891
Today, the forest and her blood will open
the gate to the other side.

122
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:11,653
I found you in jail. I never expected you
to be serving a life term in prison.

123
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:15,721
Why did you want me?

124
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:21,324
I like you better as a criminal now.

125
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,230
You use to be an awful man of justice.

126
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,369
You really made me suffer.

127
00:16:55,767 --> 00:17:00,534
But you've changed.
That's why I brought you here.

128
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,306
Don't let me down this time.

129
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,881
Get lost...

130
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,613
Your instinct changed you.

131
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,378
So far, you've killed 43 people.

132
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:21,887
You are just like me,

133
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,993
little brother.

134
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,122
Brother?

135
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:31,869
Feel the power of the forest?

136
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:37,598
People are born...

137
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:39,807
live...

138
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:43,709
and die.

139
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:56,593
The darkness after death is what's real...

140
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,159
Come, I'll guide you.

141
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,346
Let your evil instinct overcome you.

142
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,051
I'd rather die than live with you.

143
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:38,831
Then die.

144
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,278
As I planned.

145
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,623
Get the girl.

146
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:32,529
Don't you dare touch me.

147
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:35,133
Huh?

148
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,538
Kill me.

149
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:42,341
Still a bitch.

150
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,787
He could never save you,

151
00:27:56,026 --> 00:28:01,328
and never will.

152
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,429
You finished with your roll.

153
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:10,229
You never grow up...

154
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,908
I've waited...

155
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:27,542
I have returned after years.

156
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:33,222
And I offered you blood.

157
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,517
Open the gate, and grant me a power.

158
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:44,066
Power!

159
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,796
Why? This can't be...

160
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,596
Why?

161
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:54,899
My blood works only once.

162
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:58,504
I've already used it.

163
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:08,043
Can you wait till I reincarnate again?

164
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:15,756
I'll kill you!

165
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:29,868
Well, did you think I'd really kill you?

166
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,941
You can't fool me.

167
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,745
You can't stop me.

168
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:49,783
Your blood is not enough to
open the gate.

169
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:54,455
You know why?

170
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,728
Do you understand this?

171
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,597
Why did I bring him?

172
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:13,473
Yes... You resurrected him...

173
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,509
His resurrected blood is the true key.

174
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,995
Cry in despair!

175
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:43,177
Cry...

176
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:45,977
Hey.

177
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,322
You talk too much.

178
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,966
Here is the last key...

179
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:13,003
Now I remember...

180
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:16,909
Here I am.

181
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,191
Don't touch my girl, fuckin asshole!

182
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:46,307
So you wanna play a little
before we start?

183
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,091
Wait for me...

184
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:49,736
Don't worry. I never lose.

185
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,040
Stay there.

186
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:49,815
Wait here for one of us to return.

187
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,120
He's different now.

188
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,298
You might lose this time.

189
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:02,566
Maybe...

190
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,776
We'll see what happens...

191
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:18,844
No pain, no gain.

192
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,017
Right?

193
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:42,669
Freeze...

194
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:46,043
Freeze...

195
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:50,182
I said freeze!

196
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,779
Leave the car.

197
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,251
What! What! What! You runt!!!

198
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:01,722
We're taking your car!

199
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,164
Out of my way! Bugger off!

200
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:10,095
So... You are a Fighter.

201
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:18,805
Quiet, I'm sick of this place!

202
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,809
You short ass bitch!

203
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,660
Come on! Get in!

204
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:00,422
Let's go!

205
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,979
Not my fault!!!

206
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:58,089
You! Prisoner number KSC2-303!

207
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:00,461
Give me my right hand back!

208
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,149
I'm not left-handed!

209
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:36,423
You can't hit me!

210
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:44,870
I have 500times faster reflexes
than Mike Tyson!

211
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,237
Come on!

212
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,385
No chance.

213
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:30,451
Your power is not enough.

214
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:39,732
The darkside has chosen me.

215
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:07,661
I told you,

216
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,393
I never lose.

217
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:49,260
Listen...

218
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,296
What?

219
00:55:54,370 --> 00:56:02,175
You came back because of
the forest and my blood.

220
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:11,717
You might die if you leave here.

221
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,416
Maybe...

222
00:56:19,895 --> 00:56:27,631
We'll see what happens...

223
00:58:30,893 --> 00:58:33,088
I should have been on your side.

224
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:46,138
There's nothing left to destroy
in this world.

225
00:58:49,478 --> 00:58:52,174
Take me to the other side,

226
00:58:53,815 --> 00:58:55,305
brother.
