1
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:50,324
I believe in America.

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,490
America has made my fortune...

3
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,997
and I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

4
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,563
I give her freedom, but I taught her...

5
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,393
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,161
She found a boyfriend. Not an Italian.

7
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,458
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:13,793
She stayed out late. I didn't protest.

9
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,364
Two months ago, he took her for a drive...

10
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,397
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,596
They made her drink whiskey...

12
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:26,932
and then they tried to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,525
She resisted.

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,893
She kept her honor.

15
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:31,693
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,095
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken...

17
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,426
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,089
held together by wire.

19
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,131
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

20
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,489
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,999
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,923
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,662
Now she will never be beautiful again.

24
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,659
Sorry.

25
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,726
I went to the police like a good American.

26
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,559
These two boys were brought to trial.

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,228
A judge sentence them to three years in prison...

28
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,060
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,258
Suspended sentence.

30
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,193
They went free that very day.

31
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:55,432
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

32
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,426
And those two bastard, they smiled at me.

33
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:03,463
Then I said to my wife, For justice...

34
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,029
we must go to don Corleone.

35
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:15,464
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,395
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:21,727
Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,092
What is that?

39
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,532
That I cannot do.

40
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,257
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,432
We've known each other many
years, but this is the first time...

42
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:02,197
you ever came to me for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,361
I can't remember the last time that you invited me...

44
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:08,261
to your house for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:12,697
even though my wife is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,891
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,589
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,793
and you were afraid to be in my debt.

49
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,331
I didn't want to get into trouble.

50
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,656
I understand.

51
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,498
You found paradise in America.

52
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,433
You had a good trade, made a good living.

53
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:38,293
Police protected you, and there were courts of law.

54
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:41,727
So you didn't need a friend like me.

55
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:46,294
But now you come to me and you say...

56
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:49,661
don Corleone, give me justice.

57
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,465
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,260
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,366
You don't even think to call me Godfather.

60
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,593
Instead, you come into my house...

61
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,265
on the day my daughter is to be married...

62
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,932
and you ask me to do murder for money.

63
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,565
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,598
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:18,030
They must suffer then as she suffers.

66
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,965
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,396
Bonier.

68
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:44,364
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,890
If you'd come to me in friendship...

70
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,724
then the scum that ruined your daughter...

71
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,423
would be suffering this very day.

72
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:54,463
And if, by chance...

73
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,725
an honest man like yourself should make enemies...

74
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,765
then they would become my enemies.

75
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,565
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,760
Be my friend?

77
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,165
Godfather.

78
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,330
Good.

79
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,629
Someday, and that day may never come...

80
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:29,096
I'll call upon you to do a service for me.

81
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:32,800
But until that day...

82
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:38,167
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,699
Grazie, Godfather.

84
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:51,494
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,166
I want reliable people...

86
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,391
people that aren't going to be carried away.

87
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,965
I mean, we're not murderers...

88
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,328
in spite of what this undertaker says.

89
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,359
- Where's Michael? - What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,467
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:30,566
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,462
We're not taking the picture without Michael.

93
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,325
- What's the matter, Sonny? - It's Michael.

94
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,598
Don Barzini.

95
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,230
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

96
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:55,731
Paulie! More wine.

97
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,501
Scusi, please.

98
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,101
You look terrific on the floor.

99
00:08:59,236 --> 00:08:59,792
What are you, a dance judge or something?

100
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:04,999
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

101
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:15,432
Sandra, come on. Do me a favor. Watch the kids.

102
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,501
- Don't let 'em run wild.
- You watch yourself, all right?

103
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:42,098
Twenty or thirty grand.

104
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:44,201
In small bills, cash.

105
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,357
In that little silk purse.

106
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,559
If this was somebody else's wedding.

107
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,795
Hey, Paulie! I got two gobbagool...

108
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,060
gabagol and a prosciutto.

109
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,428
Stupid jerk!

110
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,567
Hey, what's the matter?

111
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,691
Have to go back to work.

112
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:23,897
It's part of the wedding.

113
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:27,466
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

114
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,833
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

115
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,660
that you have invited me to your home...

116
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:44,564
Get outta here.

117
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,429
This is a private party. Go on.

118
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:49,830
What is it? Hey, my sister's wedding.

119
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:59,659
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.

120
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:05,562
Hey, come here, come here. Come here!

121
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,363
There.

122
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,393
But towards the end he was paroled...

123
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,000
to help with the American war effort.

124
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,192
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

125
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,857
Nazorine, my friend, what can I do for you?

126
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,899
Now that the war is over...

127
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,365
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

128
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:39,262
Godfather, I have a daughter.

129
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:42,963
See, she and Enzo...

130
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,203
You want Enzo to stay in this country...

131
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,335
and you want your daughter to be married.

132
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,994
You understand everything.

133
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,898
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

134
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,167
And wait till you see the beautiful wedding cake...

135
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:00,494
I made for your daughter.

136
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,465
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

137
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:13,060
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

138
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,600
Give it to a Jew congressman in another district.

139
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,593
Who else is on the list?

140
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:29,360
Hey, Michael. How are you?

141
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,161
Hello.

142
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:51,493
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

143
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,166
Is this necessary?

144
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,393
He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding...

145
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,228
so he wanted to thank you.

146
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,335
All right.

147
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,363
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

148
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:10,900
that you have invited me to your home...

149
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,761
on the wedding day of your daughter.

150
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:16,561
And may their first child be a masculine child.

151
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:19,065
- Don...
- Michael?

152
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,792
Don Corleone...

153
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,528
That man over there is talking to himself.

154
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,498
See that scary guy over there?

155
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:28,933
He's a very scary guy.

156
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,898
Who is he? What's his name?

157
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,035
His name is Luca Brasi...

158
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,530
and he helps my father out sometimes.

159
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:40,097
Wait a minute. He's coming over here.

160
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,367
You look terrific!

161
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,594
My brother Tom Hagen. This is Kay Adams.

162
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,927
How do you do? Nice to meet you.

163
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,894
Your father's been asking for you.

164
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:54,999
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,862
I'll be there.

166
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,029
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

167
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,327
When my brother Sonny was a kid...

168
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,831
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

169
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,870
So my father took him in...

170
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:13,599
and he's been with us ever since.

171
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,164
He's a good lawyer.

172
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:19,192
Not a Sicilian, but...

173
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,392
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

174
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,694
- What's that? - That's...

175
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,029
like a counselor, an advisor.

176
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:29,033
Very important to the family.

177
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,725
You like your lasagna?

178
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:40,535
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

179
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,635
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

180
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:52,865
on the day of your daughter's wedding.

181
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,799
And I hope that their first child...

182
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,800
be a masculine child.

183
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:04,703
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

184
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,566
For your daughter's bridal purse.

185
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,669
Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend.

186
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,893
Don Corleone, I'm gonna leave you now...

187
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,432
because I know you are busy.

188
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,762
Thank you.

189
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,337
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

190
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,797
but said you'd understand.

191
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,368
Also some of the judges.

192
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,633
They've all sent gifts.

193
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,361
What is that outside?

194
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,169
Johnny!

195
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,794
I love you.

196
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:03,334
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

197
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:06,329
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

198
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,298
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

199
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,437
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

200
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,234
Sing a song.

201
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:35,135
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

202
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:39,166
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

203
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:40,894
My father helped him with his career.

204
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:44,203
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

205
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,637
I have but one

206
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:49,599
- Let's listen to the song.
- No.

207
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,127
Heart

208
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:54,465
This heart I bring you

209
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:58,429
I have but one heart

210
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,500
To share with you

211
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:07,796
I have but one dream

212
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:12,568
That I can cling to

213
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:17,567
You are the one dream

214
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:22,003
I'll pray comes true

215
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,103
Please, Michael. Tell me.

216
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:28,704
My darling, until I saw you

217
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,099
When Johnny was first starting out...

218
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:33,463
he was signed to this personal service contract...

219
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,830
with a big bandleader.

220
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,765
And as his career got better and better...

221
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,097
he wanted to get out of it.

222
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:44,496
Now, Johnny is my father's godson...

223
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,793
and my father went to see this bandleader...

224
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:51,071
and he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go.

225
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,229
But the bandleader said no.

226
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:57,995
So the next day my father went to see him...

227
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,997
only this time with Luca Brasi.

228
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:05,663
And within an hour, he signed a release...

229
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:10,799
for a certified check of $1,000.

230
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,699
How'd he do that?

231
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:16,393
My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

232
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,633
What was that?

233
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,237
Luca Brasi held a gun to his head...

234
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,696
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

235
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:28,269
or his signature would be on the contract.

236
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:35,133
That's a true story.

237
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,835
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

238
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,833
Beautiful!

239
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,331
My godson comes all the way from California.

240
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,797
Give him a glass of wine.

241
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,167
I'll take care of it.

242
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,604
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

243
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,068
How are you, Fredo?

244
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,466
My brother Fredo. This is Kay Adams.

245
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:57,598
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

246
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,864
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

247
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,103
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

248
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:12,067
I don't know what to do. My voice is weak.

249
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,361
It's weak.

250
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:17,329
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture...

251
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,171
it puts me right back up on top again.

252
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,270
But this...

253
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,800
this man out there, he won't give it to me.

254
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,732
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

255
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:30,804
Woltz. He won't give it to me...

256
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,028
and he says there's no chance, no chance.

257
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:50,598
Sonny?

258
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,900
Sonny, you in there?

259
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,799
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

260
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,005
Yeah, one minute.

261
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:16,170
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

262
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,135
A best-seller.

263
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,465
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

264
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:23,105
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

265
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,000
Just be myself.

266
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,199
Oh, Godfather,
I don't know what to do.

267
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:33,605
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

268
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,164
Is this how you turned out?

269
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:38,863
A Hollywood finocchio that cries like a woman?

270
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:41,336
What can I do?

271
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:44,029
What is that nonsense?

272
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,395
Ridiculous!

273
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,205
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

274
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,231
Good.

275
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,337
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

276
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,562
can never be a real man.

277
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,329
Come here.

278
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:09,037
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

279
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,965
I want you to rest well, and a month from now...

280
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:14,503
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

281
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:17,332
Too late. They start shooting in a week.

282
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,861
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

283
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,634
Now just go outside, enjoy yourself...

284
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:29,805
and forget about all this nonsense.

285
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:33,505
Listen. I want you to leave it all to me.

286
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,262
All right.

287
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,965
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

288
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,401
In a few minutes, right after they cut the cake.

289
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:08,036
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

290
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,466
Never. Give him a living...

291
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,298
but never discuss the family business with him.

292
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,800
What else?

293
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,405
Virgil Sollozzo called.

294
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,629
We have to give him a day sometime next week.

295
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:21,568
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

296
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:24,238
When am I going to California?

297
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,871
I want you to go tonight.

298
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,029
I want you to talk to this movie big shot...

299
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,434
and settle this business for Johnny.

300
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,566
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

301
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,404
Carlo, we're gonna take the picture.

302
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,399
Wait a minute.

303
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,596
No, Michael, not me.

304
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:51,404
Just a little closer.

305
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:54,072
Okay, that's it. Just like that now. Hold it.

306
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:40,965
Isn't that nice?

307
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,869
All right, start talking.

308
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:50,639
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.

309
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:54,001
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

310
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,673
to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

311
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,770
Woltz is listening.

312
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:03,368
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

313
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:13,101
And what favor would your friend...

314
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,067
grant Mr. Woltz?

315
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,433
You're gonna have some union problems.

316
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,538
My client could make them disappear.

317
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:20,400
Also, one of your top stars has just moved...

318
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:22,664
from marijuana to heroin.

319
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,633
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

320
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,102
Listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

321
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,772
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

322
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:31,905
Johnny Fontane will never get that movie.

323
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:33,969
I don't care how many dago, guinea, wop...

324
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,368
grease ball goombahs come outta the woodwork.

325
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:37,766
I'm German-lrish.

326
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,428
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

327
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:43,073
I'll make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

328
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:44,967
I'm a lawyer. I have not threatened...

329
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,732
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who are you?

330
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,396
I have a special practice. I handle one client.

331
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,563
Now, you have my number. I'll wait for your call.

332
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:58,332
By the way, I admire your pictures very much.

333
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,471
Check him out.

334
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,167
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

335
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:32,239
Used to decorate the palace of a king.

336
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:34,736
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

337
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,303
Why didn't you say you worked for Corleone, Tom?

338
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,440
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

339
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,572
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

340
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,968
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

341
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,732
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

342
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:48,566
Come with me. I want to show you
something really beautiful.

343
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,707
You do appreciate beauty, don't you, Tom?

344
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,272
There you are. $600,000 on four hooves.

345
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,463
I'll bet Russian czars...

346
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,266
never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.

347
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,530
Khartoum.

348
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:10,601
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

349
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,205
Beautiful.

350
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,101
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

351
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:16,706
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

352
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,036
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

353
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:23,434
To the Italian people, that's a very religious...

354
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,699
sacred, close relationship.

355
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,204
I respect that.

356
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,600
Just tell him he should ask me anything else.

357
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,900
This is one favor I can't give him.

358
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,699
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

359
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,032
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

360
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,434
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

361
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:45,138
That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star.

362
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,267
I'm gonna run him out of the business.

363
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,202
Let me tell you why.

364
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,334
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

365
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:56,371
most valuable proteges.

366
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,598
For five years, we had her under training.

367
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,797
Singing lessons, acting lessons, dancing lessons.

368
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,996
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her.

369
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,504
I was gonna make her a big star.

370
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:09,266
And let me be even more frank.

371
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,805
Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man...

372
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:14,406
that it's not all dollars and cents.

373
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,099
She was beautiful.
She was young, she was innocent!

374
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:20,331
She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had...

375
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,097
and I've had 'em all over the world!

376
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,864
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

377
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:29,065
with his olive oil voice
and guinea charm.

378
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:32,338
And she runs off.

379
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,897
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

380
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,503
and a man in my position can't afford...

381
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:42,402
to be made to look ridiculous!

382
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,800
Now you get the hell outta here!

383
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,701
And if that goombah tries any rough stuff...

384
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,702
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

385
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,905
Yeah. I heard that story.

386
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,168
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

387
00:31:58,341 --> 00:32:01,000
If your car could take me
to the airport...

388
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:05,068
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

389
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:01,074
- You're not too tired, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

390
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,800
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

391
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,167
Now...

392
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,800
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

393
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,734
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

394
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,306
but only in matters of business...

395
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:18,066
with some sort of reasonable complaint.

396
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,137
His business is narcotics.

397
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:24,836
He has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy...

398
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:28,736
and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.

399
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:32,564
Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...

400
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,674
for which he gives apiece of the action.

401
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,602
I couldn't find out how much.

402
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,569
The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York.

403
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:41,639
Now, they have to be in it for something.

404
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,206
Santino Corleone.

405
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,898
What about his prison record?

406
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,700
Two terms, one in Italy, one here.

407
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,569
He's known as a top narcotics man.

408
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,765
Santino, what do you think?

409
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,301
There's a lot of money in that white powder.

410
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:59,173
Tom?

411
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:01,672
I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...

412
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:03,501
than anything else we're looking at.

413
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:06,004
If we don't get into it, somebody else will.

414
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:08,140
Maybe one of the five families, maybe all of them.

415
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,932
With the money they earn...

416
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,640
they can buy more police and political power.

417
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,842
Then they come after us.

418
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:17,338
Now we have the unions, we have the gambling...

419
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,103
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

420
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:21,434
is a thing of the future.

421
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:23,267
If we don't get a piece of that action...

422
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:24,408
we risk everything we have.

423
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:27,507
Not now, but ten years from now.

424
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:35,207
So? What's your answer gonna be, Pop?

425
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,703
I need a man who has powerful friends.

426
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,205
I need a million dollars in cash.

427
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:51,199
I need, don Corleone, those politicians...

428
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:55,432
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

429
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:57,101
What is the interest for my family?

430
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,307
Thirty percent.

431
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:03,669
In the first year, your end
should be 3, 4 million dollars.

432
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,667
And then it would go up.

433
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,233
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

434
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:15,474
My compliments.

435
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,905
I'll take care of the Tattaglias outta my share.

436
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:25,233
So, I receive 30% for finance...

437
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,806
political influence and legal protection.

438
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,965
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

439
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:37,002
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

440
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:39,868
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

441
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,167
just finance...

442
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,836
I said that I would see you because...

443
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,166
I heard that you were a serious man...

444
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,433
to be treated with respect.

445
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,037
But I must say no to you.

446
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,972
And I'll give you my reason.

447
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,571
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

448
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:20,336
But they wouldn't be friendly very long...

449
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:23,031
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

450
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:26,333
which they regard as a harmless vice.

451
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:28,905
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, don Corleone...

452
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:30,837
It doesn't make any difference to me...

453
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:33,873
what a man does for a living, you understand...

454
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,600
but your business is...

455
00:37:37,575 --> 00:37:39,303
a little dangerous.

456
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:41,999
If you're worried about security for your million...

457
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,903
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

458
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,337
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

459
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:49,008
Wait a minute.

460
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:55,606
I have a sentimental weakness for my children...

461
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,271
and I spoil them, as you can see.

462
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,341
They talk when they should listen.

463
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,806
But anyway...

464
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,568
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final...

465
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:08,367
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

466
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:11,770
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

467
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:15,375
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

468
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,873
Thank you.

469
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:41,008
Come here.

470
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,408
What's the matter with you?

471
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,269
I think your brain is going soft...

472
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:50,101
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

473
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,073
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

474
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,233
Go on.

475
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,704
Tom, what... What is this nonsense?

476
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:06,408
It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.

477
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:10,299
Well, take it away.

478
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:12,902
Take it over there.

479
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,002
And...

480
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:18,398
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

481
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,535
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

482
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:30,107
I want you to find out what
he's got under his fingernails.

483
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:33,537
Go to the Tattaglias...

484
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,266
and make them think...

485
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,601
that you're not too happy with our family...

486
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,974
and find out what you can.

487
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,376
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

488
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:06,407
and a tie for Freddy...

489
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:09,007
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

490
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,304
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

491
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,374
Oh, just you.

492
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,300
Tell Paulie to get the car. We're going.

493
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:49,702
Okay, Pa.

494
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,636
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

495
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,971
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

496
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:50,576
Luca, I am Bruno Tattaglia.

497
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,104
I know.

498
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,174
Scotch? Prewar.

499
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:03,205
You know who I am?

500
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:45,272
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

501
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:48,372
I'm glad I run into you. I wanna talk to you.

502
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,202
I haven't got time.

503
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:53,500
Oh, make time, consigliere. Get in the car.

504
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:56,709
What are you worried about?

505
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:01,569
Get in.

506
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:16,240
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

507
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:24,137
Hi. Merry Christmas.

508
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,343
I want some fruit over there.

509
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:31,906
Gimme three of them.

510
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,801
No, that one.

511
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,600
Fredo!

512
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,208
Papa.

513
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:47,510
Papa!

514
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:54,108
Would you like me better if I were a nun...

515
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:57,744
like in the story, you know?

516
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:04,443
Then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

517
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:06,702
Now that's a thought.

518
00:46:10,445 --> 00:46:12,968
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

519
00:46:13,345 --> 00:46:15,368
- Mike...
- What's the matter?

520
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:34,073
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

521
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,706
- Sonny, Michael.
- Michael, where you been?

522
00:46:59,812 --> 00:47:01,402
Is he all right?

523
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:04,170
We don't know yet. There's all kinds of stories.

524
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:07,940
He wash it bad, Mikey.

525
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:11,043
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

526
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:13,842
Where you been? I was worried.

527
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,471
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

528
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:20,577
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

529
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,209
All right.

530
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,338
Oh, my God.

531
00:47:47,046 --> 00:47:47,739
Go. Who is it?

532
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:49,935
Open up. It's Clemenza.

533
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:51,906
What?

534
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,067
There's more news about your old man.

535
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:57,007
The word is out on the street he's already dead.

536
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:59,007
Shut your mouth. What's the matter with you?

537
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:01,412
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.

538
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,810
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

539
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,411
- He's been sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

540
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:07,804
Only maybe three, four times.

541
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:09,672
I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

542
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:11,209
- He said no.
- Pick him up now.

543
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:12,640
I don't care how sick he is.

544
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:15,505
If he's breathing', I want you to
bring him to my father's house now.

545
00:48:16,745 --> 00:48:19,472
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

546
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:20,474
All right.

547
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:30,272
I'm havin' a couple of our people come to the house.

548
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:37,836
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

549
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:40,443
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

550
00:48:41,478 --> 00:48:44,206
In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.

551
00:48:44,712 --> 00:48:47,611
Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.

552
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:49,974
What's done is done.

553
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:52,374
And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?

554
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:54,609
No, I'll wait.

555
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,740
Your boss is dead.

556
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,702
I know you're not in
the muscle end of the family...

557
00:49:16,046 --> 00:49:18,604
so I don't want you to be scared.

558
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:21,404
I want you to help the Corleones...

559
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:23,877
and I want you to help me.

560
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,544
We got him outside his office...

561
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:31,178
about an hour after we picked you up.

562
00:49:31,445 --> 00:49:33,105
Drink it.

563
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,806
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

564
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:49,201
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

565
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,177
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

566
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:57,638
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

567
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:01,075
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

568
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:03,774
That's why you gotta talk some sense into him.

569
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,911
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

570
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:10,169
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

571
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:12,605
that will prevent a full-scale war.

572
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,711
Let's face it, in all due respect...

573
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,843
the don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

574
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:23,808
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

575
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:29,743
Well, now he's dead.

576
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:32,504
He's dead, and nothing can bring him back.

577
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:36,203
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

578
00:50:36,379 --> 00:50:37,538
You gotta talk to the caporegimes...

579
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,910
that Tessio, that fat Clemenza.

580
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:47,275
It's good business, Tom.

581
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:50,412
I'll try.

582
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,638
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

583
00:50:56,313 --> 00:50:58,337
Yeah. Well...

584
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:02,039
Let me worry about Luca.

585
00:51:07,446 --> 00:51:09,275
You just talk to Sonny.

586
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,875
And the other two kids.

587
00:51:15,046 --> 00:51:16,910
I'll do my best.

588
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,568
Good.

589
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:22,604
Now, you can go.

590
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:32,946
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

591
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,405
Blood is a big expense.

592
00:51:57,913 --> 00:51:59,470
He's still alive.

593
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,439
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!

594
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,474
Well, that's bad luck for me...

595
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:08,339
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

596
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:55,213
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

597
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:57,606
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

598
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:02,075
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

599
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,906
It's too far. I think it's too personal.

600
00:53:05,746 --> 00:53:07,906
- The don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

601
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:10,341
- Stay out of it, Mickey.
- Sollozzo's the key.

602
00:53:10,514 --> 00:53:12,537
You get rid of him, everything falls into line.

603
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:15,475
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

604
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,079
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

605
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,874
Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca?

606
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:24,776
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

607
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:26,207
Mick, try him again.

608
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:27,208
Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

609
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:28,969
He always goes home when he's through.

610
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:33,703
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

611
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,713
What do we do if the old man dies, God forbid?

612
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,972
If we lose the old man...

613
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:43,403
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

614
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,341
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

615
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,072
just to avoid a long destructive war.

616
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:52,941
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

617
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:55,578
If your father dies...

618
00:53:57,881 --> 00:53:59,608
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

619
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:02,278
That's easy for you to say. He's not your father.

620
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,911
I was as much a son to him as you or Mike.

621
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:10,904
What is it?

622
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,909
Hey, Paulie, I thought I told you to stay put.

623
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:16,704
The guy at the gates, they say they got a package.

624
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:19,073
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

625
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:24,503
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

626
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:26,111
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

627
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,076
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry?

628
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:30,770
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a little brandy?

629
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,804
- That's good to sweat it out.
- Sure.

630
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:34,673
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

631
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:39,508
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

632
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:40,907
Paulie sold out the old man.

633
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:44,739
I don't wanna see him again.
Make that first thing on your list.

634
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:45,709
Understood.

635
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,974
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow
you get a couple of guys.

636
00:54:49,147 --> 00:54:51,410
Go to Luca's apartment.
Wait for him to show up.

637
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,478
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

638
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:57,409
Yeah.

639
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,705
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

640
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,612
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

641
00:55:13,213 --> 00:55:15,873
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

642
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:19,171
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

643
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:34,504
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home?

644
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:36,975
I don't know. Probably late.

645
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:41,936
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah.

646
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:49,142
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

647
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,507
Sonny's runnin' wild.

648
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,374
He's thinkin' of goin' to the mattresses already.

649
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:57,070
We gotta find a spot over on the West Side.

650
00:55:57,248 --> 00:56:00,179
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

651
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,608
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

652
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:05,009
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Think while you're drivin'.

653
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:07,644
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

654
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:10,142
And watch out for the kids when you're backin' out.

655
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,878
Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

656
00:56:23,081 --> 00:56:26,241
Pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep. Bring me the bill.

657
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:29,245
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean.

658
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:31,913
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time.

659
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:34,377
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

660
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:36,570
Exterminate? That's a bad word to use.

661
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:39,805
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

662
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:41,604
- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie?

663
00:56:42,114 --> 00:56:46,206
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. It wasn't me.

664
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:48,313
- It's gotta be him.
- Pull over.

665
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:50,038
I gotta take a leak.

666
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,313
Leave the gun.

667
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,376
Take the cannoli.

668
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:00,409
- Yeah?
- You're wanted on the telephone.

669
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:08,511
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

670
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:13,670
Hello, Kay?

671
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:15,006
How's your father?

672
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:17,579
He's good. He's gonna make it.

673
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,236
I love you.

674
00:58:19,648 --> 00:58:22,307
I love you!

675
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:25,846
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

676
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,605
Tell me you love me.

677
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:30,277
- I can't talk.
- Can't you say it?

678
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:33,913
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

679
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:37,814
Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?

680
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,673
I love you with all o' my heart!

681
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:42,473
If I don't see you again a-soon, I'm-a gonna die!

682
00:58:43,782 --> 00:58:45,577
Come over here, kid. Learn somethin'.

683
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:48,373
You might have to cook for 20 guys someday.

684
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:50,873
You see? You start out with a little bit of oil.

685
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:52,639
Then you fry some garlic.

686
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:55,313
Then you throw in some
tomatoes, some tomato paste.

687
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:57,743
You fry it. You make sure it doesn't stick.

688
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:01,343
When you got it to a boil, shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

689
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,178
And a little bit of wine.

690
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:12,414
And a little bit of sugar.

691
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,215
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

692
00:59:15,415 --> 00:59:17,278
I got more important things for you to do.

693
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,811
- How's Paulie?
- Won't see him no more.

694
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:24,311
- Where you going?
- To the city.

695
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:25,671
Send some bodyguards with him.

696
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,178
- I'm just going to see Pop.
- Send somebody with him.

697
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:30,575
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

698
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,771
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

699
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,814
Send somebody with him anyway.

700
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:09,180
I have to go.

701
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:10,971
Can I go with you?

702
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:14,305
No, Kay. There's gonna be detectives there.

703
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,645
People from the press.

704
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:18,607
I'll ride in a cab.

705
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:23,144
I don't want you to get involved.

706
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,910
When will I see you again?

707
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:37,115
Go back to New Hampshire...

708
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:40,006
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

709
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:43,208
When will I see you again, Michael?

710
01:00:45,015 --> 01:00:47,106
I don't know.

711
01:02:58,382 --> 01:02:59,609
What are you doing here?

712
01:02:59,816 --> 01:03:01,748
You're not supposed to be here now.

713
01:03:01,983 --> 01:03:04,574
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

714
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:08,014
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

715
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:10,373
Your father just had too many visitors.

716
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,878
They interfered with hospital service.

717
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:16,075
The police made them leave about ten minutes ago.

718
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:25,612
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

719
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:30,406
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

720
01:03:34,149 --> 01:03:36,342
Sonny, Michael. I'm at the hospital.

721
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:38,710
Listen. I got here late. There's nobody here.

722
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:42,208
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

723
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:44,939
- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.

724
01:03:45,115 --> 01:03:46,547
I won't panic.

725
01:03:47,582 --> 01:03:50,139
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

726
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:55,981
You and I are gonna move
my father to another room.

727
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,047
Can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

728
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,640
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

729
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:04,482
Men are coming here to kill him.

730
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,806
You understand?

731
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:08,777
Now, help me, please.

732
01:05:26,116 --> 01:05:29,310
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

733
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:32,083
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

734
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,772
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

735
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:35,938
There's gonna be trouble.

736
01:05:36,116 --> 01:05:38,344
If there is trouble, I stay here to help you...

737
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:39,379
For your father.

738
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,013
All right, listen.

739
01:05:44,216 --> 01:05:46,011
Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital.

740
01:05:46,183 --> 01:05:48,705
All right? I'll be out in a minute. Go ahead.

741
01:06:02,884 --> 01:06:06,782
Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now.

742
01:06:08,383 --> 01:06:10,611
I'm with you now.

743
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,949
I'm with you.

744
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:51,113
Get rid of these. Come here.

745
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,610
Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.

746
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,844
You'll be all right.

747
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,207
You'll be okay.

748
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:49,448
You did good.

749
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,540
Here he is.

750
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:27,911
All right, hold still.

751
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,408
I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.

752
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,515
What are you doing here?

753
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,240
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

754
01:08:44,717 --> 01:08:46,115
Why, you little punk.

755
01:08:46,284 --> 01:08:48,216
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

756
01:08:48,384 --> 01:08:50,077
I pulled them guys off of here.

757
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,615
You get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

758
01:08:53,284 --> 01:08:56,079
I'm not moving until you put some
guards around my father's room.

759
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:58,612
Phil, take him in.

760
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:01,249
The kid's clean, Captain. He's a war hero.

761
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:04,212
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

762
01:09:06,384 --> 01:09:09,578
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

763
01:09:10,118 --> 01:09:12,743
Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

764
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:15,180
Stand him up straight.

765
01:09:36,717 --> 01:09:38,650
I'm the attorney for the Corleone family.

766
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:41,350
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

767
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:44,712
They're licensed to carry firearms.

768
01:09:44,885 --> 01:09:46,543
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

769
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:49,183
in the morning and show cause.

770
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,144
All right, let him go.

771
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:54,406
Come on.

772
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:25,813
What's with all the new faces?

773
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:27,745
Gonna need 'em now.

774
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:30,108
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

775
01:10:30,918 --> 01:10:33,815
We hit Bruno Tattaglia at 4:00 this morning.

776
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:36,745
Jesus Christ.

777
01:10:44,051 --> 01:10:45,984
Looks like a fortress around here.

778
01:10:51,018 --> 01:10:53,609
A hundred button men on the street, 24 hours a day.

779
01:10:53,984 --> 01:10:56,610
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

780
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:02,015
Hey, Michael, come here.
Let me look at you.

781
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:07,379
You look beautiful. Just beautiful.

782
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:08,812
You're gorgeous.

783
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:11,780
Hey, listen to this. The Turk, he wants to talk.

784
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,117
Imagine the nerve on this son of a bitch.

785
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:16,642
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

786
01:11:16,851 --> 01:11:18,408
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

787
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:22,109
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

788
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,216
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

789
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:27,410
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

790
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:29,107
That's part of the deal.

791
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,147
Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

792
01:11:31,318 --> 01:11:32,875
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

793
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:36,517
No more. Not this time, Consigliere.

794
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:40,083
No more meetings, no discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

795
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:42,115
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

796
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:43,580
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

797
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:45,274
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

798
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:47,416
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't like this.

799
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:49,585
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

800
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:53,251
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

801
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:55,479
Well, then business will have to suffer.

802
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:57,617
And do me a favor, Tom...

803
01:11:57,985 --> 01:11:59,679
No more advice on how to patch things up.

804
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:02,148
Just help me win, please. All right?

805
01:12:08,419 --> 01:12:11,011
I found out about this McCluskey
who broke Mike'sjaw.

806
01:12:11,184 --> 01:12:12,514
What about him?

807
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:15,709
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

808
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:18,540
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

809
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,650
What you have to understand, Sonny...

810
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:22,714
is that while Sollozzo's being guarded like this...

811
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,611
he is invulnerable.

812
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:28,315
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

813
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:31,007
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you.

814
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:34,047
The Corleone family would be outcast.

815
01:12:34,352 --> 01:12:37,715
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

816
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:41,508
So do me a favor.

817
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:44,649
Take this into consideration.

818
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,080
All right, we'll wait.

819
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,016
We can't wait.

820
01:12:56,619 --> 01:12:58,584
Can't wait.

821
01:12:58,985 --> 01:13:00,417
I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal.

822
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:02,517
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

823
01:13:02,752 --> 01:13:04,308
That's the key for him.

824
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:06,584
Got to get Sollozzo.

825
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:08,240
Mike is right.

826
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,547
Let me ask you something first.

827
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:12,712
What about this McCluskey?

828
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:15,679
What do we do with this cop?

829
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,251
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

830
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,277
It will be me...

831
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:29,713
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

832
01:13:30,985 --> 01:13:33,281
Let's set the meeting.

833
01:13:35,218 --> 01:13:38,446
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

834
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:44,542
We insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

835
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:48,878
Someplace where there's people, so I feel safe.

836
01:13:51,118 --> 01:13:53,983
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

837
01:13:54,186 --> 01:13:56,583
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

838
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:02,440
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

839
01:14:02,652 --> 01:14:04,743
to have a weapon planted there for me...

840
01:14:09,786 --> 01:14:12,081
then I'll kill them both.

841
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:26,915
What are you gonna do? Nice college boy, huh?

842
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:28,881
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

843
01:14:29,086 --> 01:14:30,177
Now you want to gun down a police captain?

844
01:14:30,386 --> 01:14:32,647
Why? 'Cause he slapped you in the face a little bit?

845
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:34,943
Do you think this is the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

846
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:36,641
You gotta get up close, like this and...

847
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,114
You blow their brains all over your
nice lvy League suit. Come here.

848
01:14:40,786 --> 01:14:42,547
You're taking this very personal.

849
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,049
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

850
01:14:46,253 --> 01:14:48,343
Where does it say you can't kill a cop?

851
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,379
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

852
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:53,484
I'm talking about a cop that's mixed up in drugs.

853
01:14:53,652 --> 01:14:57,379
I'm talking about a dishonest cop, a crooked cop...

854
01:14:57,552 --> 01:15:00,485
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

855
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:02,780
That's a terrific story.

856
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:05,611
We have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

857
01:15:06,952 --> 01:15:09,214
They might like a story like that.

858
01:15:09,419 --> 01:15:11,477
They might. They just might.

859
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:15,778
It's not personal, Sonny.

860
01:15:16,886 --> 01:15:18,749
It's strictly business.

861
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:22,876
It's as cold as they come.

862
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:26,019
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints, Mike.

863
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,278
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt.

864
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:31,243
Here. Try it.

865
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,077
What's the matter, the trigger too tight?

866
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,714
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

867
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:54,215
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

868
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,482
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

869
01:16:00,385 --> 01:16:02,147
Sit down, finish my dinner.

870
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:04,411
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

871
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:07,575
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

872
01:16:08,019 --> 01:16:09,882
Everybody will still think you got it.

873
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:11,808
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

874
01:16:12,453 --> 01:16:15,146
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

875
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:18,246
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but don't look away, either.

876
01:16:19,386 --> 01:16:21,113
They're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

877
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,013
so don't worry about nothing.

878
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,379
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

879
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:28,678
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

880
01:16:28,953 --> 01:16:30,884
and we're gonna catch the hell.

881
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:33,585
How bad do you think it's gonna be?

882
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:35,479
Pretty goddamn bad.

883
01:16:35,652 --> 01:16:37,948
Probably all the other families will line up against us.

884
01:16:38,753 --> 01:16:41,684
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

885
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:44,352
Ten years. Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

886
01:16:44,553 --> 01:16:46,518
Been ten years since the last one.

887
01:16:47,253 --> 01:16:49,014
You gotta stop them
at the beginning...

888
01:16:49,253 --> 01:16:51,219
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

889
01:16:51,485 --> 01:16:52,951
They should have never let him
get away with that.

890
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:55,515
They was just asking for big trouble.

891
01:16:56,053 --> 01:16:58,781
You know, Mike, we was all proud of you...

892
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:00,543
being a hero and all.

893
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,583
Your father too.

894
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,111
Nothing. Not a hint.

895
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:43,911
Absolutely nothing.

896
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,612
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

897
01:17:49,153 --> 01:17:51,211
How much time do we have?

898
01:17:52,387 --> 01:17:53,908
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

899
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,279
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

900
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:01,019
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

901
01:18:01,253 --> 01:18:04,048
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

902
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,318
What about the negotiator?

903
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,145
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

904
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,343
He's happy. They're letting him win.

905
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,679
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off.

906
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:17,819
The negotiator keeps playing cards
until Mike's back safe and sound.

907
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,247
Why doesn't he blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

908
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,818
Too dangerous. They'll be looking for that.

909
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,918
Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny.

910
01:18:25,253 --> 01:18:27,220
I got it.

911
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:38,979
Yeah.

912
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:55,575
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Is it reliable?

913
01:18:55,787 --> 01:18:57,753
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

914
01:18:57,953 --> 01:19:00,214
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

915
01:19:00,386 --> 01:19:03,114
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

916
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:04,646
Anybody know this joint?

917
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:08,411
Yeah, sure. I do. It's perfect for us.

918
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:10,619
A small family place, good food.

919
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:13,513
Everyone minds his business. It's perfect.

920
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:16,312
Pete, they got an old-fashioned toilet...

921
01:19:16,553 --> 01:19:19,611
You know, the box and the chain thing.

922
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:24,376
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

923
01:19:24,554 --> 01:19:25,577
All right.

924
01:19:25,753 --> 01:19:28,651
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

925
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:30,717
You eat, you talk for a while, you relax.

926
01:19:31,153 --> 01:19:32,710
You make them relax.

927
01:19:32,953 --> 01:19:34,748
Then you get up and go take a leak.

928
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:38,118
No, better still, you ask for permission to go.

929
01:19:38,354 --> 01:19:40,081
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

930
01:19:40,321 --> 01:19:42,718
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

931
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:45,120
Now, listen. I want somebody good...

932
01:19:45,354 --> 01:19:47,115
and I mean very good... to plant that gun.

933
01:19:47,286 --> 01:19:49,583
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick in his hands.

934
01:19:50,587 --> 01:19:51,779
The gun will be there.

935
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:55,509
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

936
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:58,217
Come on. Let's move.

937
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:01,076
Thank you, Tom.

938
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,610
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?

939
01:20:06,788 --> 01:20:08,753
Yeah, a million times.

940
01:20:13,453 --> 01:20:15,716
Don't forget... two shots apiece in the head...

941
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,012
as soon as you come out the door.

942
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:18,880
Let's go.

943
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:26,947
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

944
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,777
At least a year, Mike.

945
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,350
Listen, I'll square with Mom you
not seeing her before you leave...

946
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:39,111
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

947
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:42,212
when I think the time is right.

948
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:49,010
Take care.

949
01:20:51,454 --> 01:20:53,646
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

950
01:21:25,687 --> 01:21:27,711
I'm glad you came, Mike.

951
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:30,316
I hope we can straighten everything out.

952
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:34,216
This is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

953
01:21:34,454 --> 01:21:35,885
It should have never happened.

954
01:21:36,054 --> 01:21:37,816
I want to straighten everything out tonight.

955
01:21:37,988 --> 01:21:40,180
I don't want my father bothered anymore.

956
01:21:40,387 --> 01:21:43,410
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

957
01:21:44,654 --> 01:21:47,085
But you got to keep an open mind when we talk.

958
01:21:48,021 --> 01:21:49,987
I hope you're not a hothead
like your brother Sonny.

959
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:52,345
You can't talk business with him.

960
01:21:54,221 --> 01:21:56,311
He's a good kid.

961
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:02,647
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

962
01:22:03,554 --> 01:22:05,986
I gotta frisk you, so turn around, huh?

963
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:07,916
On your knees, facing me.

964
01:22:12,788 --> 01:22:15,311
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.

965
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:17,984
Too grouchy.

966
01:22:18,587 --> 01:22:20,883
Can't stand the aggravation.

967
01:22:21,255 --> 01:22:23,220
You know how it is.

968
01:22:24,821 --> 01:22:27,116
He's clean.

969
01:22:52,987 --> 01:22:54,544
We're going to Jersey?

970
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,414
Maybe.

971
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:26,020
Nice work, Lou.

972
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:05,520
How's the Italian food in this restaurant?

973
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:07,686
Good. Try the veal.

974
01:24:07,921 --> 01:24:10,352
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

975
01:24:46,256 --> 01:24:48,153
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

976
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:50,618
Go ahead.

977
01:26:09,322 --> 01:26:10,948
What I want...

978
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:13,914
what's most important to me...

979
01:26:16,722 --> 01:26:18,654
is that I have a guarantee:

980
01:26:18,889 --> 01:26:20,821
No more attempts on my father's life.

981
01:26:21,055 --> 01:26:24,953
What guarantees could I give you?
I am the hunted one.

982
01:26:25,855 --> 01:26:28,878
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

983
01:26:29,323 --> 01:26:30,982
I'm not that clever.

984
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:35,212
All I want is a truce.

985
01:26:41,555 --> 01:26:45,647
I have to go to the bathroom. Is that all right?

986
01:26:46,755 --> 01:26:48,914
You gotta go, you gotta go.

987
01:26:54,922 --> 01:26:56,820
I frisked him. He's clean.

988
01:26:57,056 --> 01:26:58,783
Don't take too long.

989
01:27:02,288 --> 01:27:04,448
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

990
01:30:55,057 --> 01:30:55,886
Hey, come on.

991
01:30:56,257 --> 01:30:57,745
Come on. Let's go.

992
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:56,588
Joe, you take over.

993
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,553
Hi, Grandpa.

994
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:15,521
I love you, Grandpa.

995
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:20,780
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

996
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,714
Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.

997
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:27,683
I hope you get well, Grandpa...

998
01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:29,914
and I wish I would see you soon.

999
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:32,113
Love, your grandson, Frank.

1000
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,854
Go with your mother.

1001
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:39,479
Go ahead. Take 'em downstairs.

1002
01:32:45,957 --> 01:32:48,115
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1003
01:32:49,424 --> 01:32:51,515
Go on.

1004
01:32:55,157 --> 01:32:57,283
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1005
01:32:57,856 --> 01:33:00,015
- That's enough bread.
- I love bread.

1006
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:00,688
But how much can you eat?

1007
01:33:11,724 --> 01:33:13,553
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1008
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:15,655
Shut up and set the table.

1009
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:33,687
Since McCluskey's killing...

1010
01:33:33,956 --> 01:33:37,616
the police have been cracking down
on most of our operations.

1011
01:33:39,058 --> 01:33:41,216
And also the other families'.

1012
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:44,119
Been a lot of bad blood.

1013
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:47,279
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1014
01:33:48,358 --> 01:33:50,414
Through our contacts in the newspapers...

1015
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,681
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1016
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:56,514
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1017
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:59,689
See, things are starting to loosen up.

1018
01:34:02,757 --> 01:34:05,450
Dad, I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas...

1019
01:34:05,691 --> 01:34:08,214
under the protection of don Francesco of L.A.

1020
01:34:08,424 --> 01:34:10,015
I want him to rest.

1021
01:34:10,257 --> 01:34:12,450
I'm going to learn the casino business.

1022
01:34:12,657 --> 01:34:14,089
Yeah.

1023
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,783
Where is Michael?

1024
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:38,579
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1025
01:34:40,058 --> 01:34:44,115
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1026
01:35:05,757 --> 01:35:07,689
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1027
01:35:07,857 --> 01:35:09,550
I want his ass now... right now.

1028
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,450
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1029
01:35:11,658 --> 01:35:13,247
Things are starting to loosen up a little bit.

1030
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,116
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1031
01:35:16,325 --> 01:35:17,984
Let the smoke clear. Pop can negotiate.

1032
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:20,215
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide...

1033
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,685
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1034
01:35:22,857 --> 01:35:24,289
Nothing's coming in. We can't do business.

1035
01:35:24,457 --> 01:35:25,651
Neither can they. Don't worry about it.

1036
01:35:25,824 --> 01:35:29,222
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Then there ain't no more stalemate.

1037
01:35:29,425 --> 01:35:31,220
I'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard.

1038
01:35:31,558 --> 01:35:33,819
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1039
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:35,220
Do what I tell you to do!

1040
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:37,448
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere... a Sicilian...

1041
01:35:37,658 --> 01:35:39,452
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1042
01:35:39,657 --> 01:35:42,021
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1043
01:35:45,358 --> 01:35:47,381
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1044
01:35:48,891 --> 01:35:51,187
Mom made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1045
01:35:52,892 --> 01:35:53,879
Niggers are having a good time...

1046
01:35:54,091 --> 01:35:57,216
with our policy banks up there in Harlem.

1047
01:35:57,425 --> 01:36:00,323
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1048
01:36:01,391 --> 01:36:04,050
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1049
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:07,580
Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1050
01:36:08,358 --> 01:36:11,153
- Shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1051
01:36:11,325 --> 01:36:14,291
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1052
01:36:16,325 --> 01:36:18,951
Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1053
01:36:19,192 --> 01:36:20,350
I could be doing more for the family.

1054
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:22,955
We don't discuss business at the table.

1055
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:52,254
Corleone.

1056
01:39:01,658 --> 01:39:03,851
Hey, American! Take me to America! G.I.!

1057
01:39:05,925 --> 01:39:08,721
Take me to America, G.I. Clark Gable.

1058
01:42:10,026 --> 01:42:11,855
I apologize if I offended you.

1059
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,384
I'm a stranger in this country...

1060
01:42:15,293 --> 01:42:18,225
and I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.

1061
01:42:23,959 --> 01:42:26,391
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1062
01:42:28,326 --> 01:42:30,691
My name is Michael Corleone.

1063
01:42:32,826 --> 01:42:35,724
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1064
01:42:38,859 --> 01:42:41,325
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1065
01:42:43,693 --> 01:42:45,818
instead of gaining a husband.

1066
01:42:53,993 --> 01:42:54,959
I want to meet your daughter...

1067
01:42:56,959 --> 01:42:58,720
with your permission...

1068
01:42:58,959 --> 01:43:01,118
and under the supervision of your family...

1069
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,557
with all respect.

1070
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,287
Apollonia.

1071
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,154
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1072
01:46:24,194 --> 01:46:25,989
Save it for the library.

1073
01:46:29,927 --> 01:46:31,324
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1074
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:51,983
What's the matter?

1075
01:46:58,361 --> 01:46:59,827
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1076
01:46:59,994 --> 01:47:03,222
Sonny, please. It was my fault. I hit him.

1077
01:47:03,494 --> 01:47:05,153
I started a fight with him. Please, Sonny.

1078
01:47:05,328 --> 01:47:07,089
I'm sorry.

1079
01:47:12,527 --> 01:47:15,653
I'm just gonna get a doctor
to come and take a look at you.

1080
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:17,690
Sonny, please don't do anything.

1081
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:22,218
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1082
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:24,654
Am I gonna make that baby an
orphan before he's born?

1083
01:47:28,561 --> 01:47:29,890
All right?

1084
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:32,523
Still betting the Yankees pretty heavy?

1085
01:47:33,428 --> 01:47:35,394
Tell him to stop taking action, all right?

1086
01:47:36,661 --> 01:47:38,888
You lost enough money last weekend to me.

1087
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:46,850
Carlo, come here.

1088
01:48:44,528 --> 01:48:47,460
You touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

1089
01:52:42,462 --> 01:52:45,054
Weren't expecting you. You should call.

1090
01:52:45,262 --> 01:52:49,661
Yes, well, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

1091
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:51,988
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1092
01:52:52,196 --> 01:52:55,889
Nobody knows where he is. We
know he's all right, but that's all.

1093
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:00,885
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1094
01:53:01,129 --> 01:53:02,889
But nobody was hurt.

1095
01:53:05,096 --> 01:53:08,721
Would you give this letter to Michael, please?

1096
01:53:09,228 --> 01:53:11,195
Well, if I accepted that...

1097
01:53:11,395 --> 01:53:14,452
in a court of law they could prove I have
knowledge of his whereabouts.

1098
01:53:14,962 --> 01:53:17,292
Just be patient. He'll get in touch with you.

1099
01:53:17,463 --> 01:53:20,587
I let my cab go. Can I come in to call another one?

1100
01:53:21,096 --> 01:53:23,221
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1101
01:53:40,362 --> 01:53:41,828
Hello?

1102
01:53:43,996 --> 01:53:45,552
Is Carlo there?

1103
01:53:45,696 --> 01:53:48,026
- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.

1104
01:53:48,129 --> 01:53:51,652
Would you tell him that
can't make it tonight until later?

1105
01:53:56,529 --> 01:53:58,462
Bitch.

1106
01:54:00,662 --> 01:54:03,128
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1107
01:54:03,463 --> 01:54:04,895
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1108
01:54:05,128 --> 01:54:08,095
- I'll eat out later.
- You told me to make you dinner.

1109
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:10,324
Hey, vafifiancolo, eh?

1110
01:54:10,495 --> 01:54:12,586
I'll vafifianculo you!

1111
01:54:18,762 --> 01:54:21,092
This little guinea brat.

1112
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:27,218
That's it. Break it all, you spoiled guinea brat.

1113
01:54:27,395 --> 01:54:28,884
Break it all!

1114
01:54:29,063 --> 01:54:31,153
That's it. Break it all.

1115
01:54:38,662 --> 01:54:40,925
Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?

1116
01:54:42,896 --> 01:54:44,828
Maybe I will. Why not?

1117
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:53,893
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1118
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:59,023
Clean it up, you guinea spoiled brat!

1119
01:54:59,829 --> 01:55:02,193
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1120
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:04,489
You son of a bitch!

1121
01:55:14,463 --> 01:55:17,224
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1122
01:55:17,429 --> 01:55:19,328
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1123
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:20,894
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1124
01:55:21,063 --> 01:55:22,995
Kill me! Get up!

1125
01:55:23,562 --> 01:55:25,119
Get out of here!

1126
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:28,057
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

1127
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,624
You guinea brat, you.

1128
01:55:30,797 --> 01:55:32,024
Get out here!

1129
01:55:42,463 --> 01:55:45,588
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1130
01:55:46,363 --> 01:55:49,193
Talk louder. The baby's crying.

1131
01:55:49,363 --> 01:55:51,022
Santino, I can't understand... I don't know.

1132
01:55:51,263 --> 01:55:52,320
I don't understand.

1133
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,519
Yeah, Connie.

1134
01:56:00,396 --> 01:56:02,022
Listen, you wait there.

1135
01:56:04,662 --> 01:56:07,027
No, you just wait there.

1136
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:11,856
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1137
01:56:12,063 --> 01:56:14,053
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1138
01:56:14,264 --> 01:56:15,661
Damn it!

1139
01:56:18,863 --> 01:56:21,294
Open the goddamn gate. Get off your ass.

1140
01:56:37,730 --> 01:56:39,719
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1141
01:56:40,829 --> 01:56:42,693
Go after him. Go on.

1142
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,853
Son of a bitch.

1143
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:15,655
Come on! Come on!

1144
01:59:03,197 --> 01:59:04,754
Give me a drop.

1145
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:15,692
My wife is crying upstairs.

1146
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:21,252
I hear cars coming to the house.

1147
01:59:25,131 --> 01:59:28,028
Consigliore of mine...

1148
01:59:28,464 --> 01:59:32,021
I think you should tell your don
what everyone seems to know.

1149
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:34,492
I didn't tell Mama anything.

1150
01:59:35,264 --> 01:59:38,560
I was about to come up and wake
you just now and tell you.

1151
01:59:41,963 --> 01:59:44,191
But you needed a drink first.

1152
01:59:50,931 --> 01:59:53,953
Now you've had your drink.

1153
01:59:58,997 --> 02:00:03,191
They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead.

1154
02:00:20,597 --> 02:00:23,188
I want all inquiries made.

1155
02:00:27,231 --> 02:00:29,696
I want no acts of vengeance.

1156
02:00:31,364 --> 02:00:33,557
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1157
02:00:35,097 --> 02:00:37,462
with the heads of the five families.

1158
02:00:39,764 --> 02:00:41,992
This war stops now.

1159
02:01:03,831 --> 02:01:05,694
Call Bonasera.

1160
02:01:06,331 --> 02:01:08,423
We need him now.

1161
02:01:21,098 --> 02:01:23,723
This is Tom Hagen calling for Vito Corleone...

1162
02:01:23,898 --> 02:01:25,295
at his request.

1163
02:01:26,065 --> 02:01:27,997
Now, you owe your don a service.

1164
02:01:28,565 --> 02:01:31,826
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

1165
02:01:33,131 --> 02:01:35,028
Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.

1166
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:36,958
Be there to greet him.

1167
02:01:57,831 --> 02:01:59,127
Well, my friend...

1168
02:02:00,131 --> 02:02:02,460
are you ready to do me this service?

1169
02:02:02,631 --> 02:02:03,858
Yes.

1170
02:02:04,831 --> 02:02:06,797
What do you want me to do?

1171
02:02:14,165 --> 02:02:16,687
I want you to use all your powers...

1172
02:02:17,231 --> 02:02:19,129
and all your skills.

1173
02:02:22,764 --> 02:02:25,322
I don't want his mother to see him this way.

1174
02:02:41,799 --> 02:02:44,992
Look how they massacred my boy.

1175
02:03:19,332 --> 02:03:20,559
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1176
02:03:20,799 --> 02:03:24,094
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

1177
02:04:56,099 --> 02:04:58,360
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1178
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:01,222
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1179
02:05:01,399 --> 02:05:04,126
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1180
02:05:04,398 --> 02:05:07,421
Take her to her father's house
till I know things are safe.

1181
02:05:07,865 --> 02:05:09,490
Anything you say, boss.

1182
02:06:19,032 --> 02:06:20,657
Don Barzini, I want to thank you...

1183
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:24,491
for helping me organize this meeting here today.

1184
02:06:24,899 --> 02:06:27,888
And also the other heads of the five families...

1185
02:06:28,099 --> 02:06:30,428
from New York and New Jersey.

1186
02:06:31,399 --> 02:06:34,092
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1187
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:38,257
From Brooklyn...

1188
02:06:38,499 --> 02:06:41,192
Philip Tattaglia.

1189
02:06:43,466 --> 02:06:45,863
And from Staten Island...

1190
02:06:46,433 --> 02:06:49,661
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1191
02:06:49,866 --> 02:06:52,127
And all the other associates that came as far...

1192
02:06:52,266 --> 02:06:55,426
as from California and Kansas City...

1193
02:06:55,665 --> 02:06:58,291
and all the other territories of the country.

1194
02:06:58,466 --> 02:06:59,932
Thank you.

1195
02:07:06,099 --> 02:07:08,327
How did things ever get so far?

1196
02:07:09,666 --> 02:07:11,359
I don't know.

1197
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:17,163
It was so unfortunate and so unnecessary.

1198
02:07:19,866 --> 02:07:22,127
Tattaglia lost a son...

1199
02:07:22,366 --> 02:07:24,161
and I lost a son.

1200
02:07:25,866 --> 02:07:28,559
We're quits, and ifTattaglia agrees...

1201
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:33,729
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1202
02:07:34,866 --> 02:07:37,763
We are all grateful to don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1203
02:07:38,499 --> 02:07:40,727
We all know him as a man of his word.

1204
02:07:41,299 --> 02:07:43,856
A modest man. He'll always listen to reason.

1205
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:45,862
Yes, don Barzini.

1206
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:47,930
He's too modest.

1207
02:07:48,199 --> 02:07:51,393
He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.

1208
02:07:52,565 --> 02:07:54,862
He refused to share them.

1209
02:07:55,466 --> 02:07:58,432
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

1210
02:07:59,266 --> 02:08:01,630
All of you know me here.

1211
02:08:02,566 --> 02:08:05,794
When did I ever refuse, except one time?

1212
02:08:06,833 --> 02:08:08,526
And why?

1213
02:08:09,333 --> 02:08:11,925
Because I believe this drug business...

1214
02:08:12,167 --> 02:08:14,894
is gonna destroy us in the years to come.

1215
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:19,561
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1216
02:08:19,766 --> 02:08:21,891
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1217
02:08:22,067 --> 02:08:25,396
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1218
02:08:25,733 --> 02:08:28,393
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1219
02:08:28,666 --> 02:08:30,291
with gambling and other things...

1220
02:08:30,566 --> 02:08:33,590
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1221
02:08:34,899 --> 02:08:37,627
And I believed that then...

1222
02:08:37,933 --> 02:08:39,989
and I believe that now.

1223
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:42,132
Times have changed.

1224
02:08:42,334 --> 02:08:44,492
It's not like the old days...

1225
02:08:44,666 --> 02:08:46,996
when we could do anything we want.

1226
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,825
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1227
02:08:50,132 --> 02:08:53,656
If don Corleone had all the judges
and politicians in New York...

1228
02:08:54,167 --> 02:08:57,099
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1229
02:08:57,267 --> 02:09:00,232
He must let us draw the water from the well.

1230
02:09:01,266 --> 02:09:04,290
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1231
02:09:05,032 --> 02:09:08,227
After all, we are not Communists.

1232
02:09:10,766 --> 02:09:13,324
I also don't believe in drugs.

1233
02:09:13,866 --> 02:09:16,127
For years, I paid my people extra...

1234
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,822
so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1235
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,898
Somebody comes to them and says, I have powders.

1236
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:25,089
If you put up a three,
four-thousand-dollar investment...

1237
02:09:25,866 --> 02:09:28,889
we can make 50,000 distributing.

1238
02:09:29,467 --> 02:09:32,990
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1239
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:35,832
to keep it respectable.

1240
02:09:36,066 --> 02:09:39,261
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1241
02:09:40,634 --> 02:09:42,565
That's an infamia.

1242
02:09:43,633 --> 02:09:47,292
In my city, we'll keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1243
02:09:47,666 --> 02:09:50,565
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1244
02:09:57,666 --> 02:10:00,827
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1245
02:10:02,566 --> 02:10:05,692
As a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1246
02:10:05,867 --> 02:10:09,355
to find a peaceful solution to these problems.

1247
02:10:09,666 --> 02:10:11,326
Then we are agreed.

1248
02:10:11,567 --> 02:10:14,124
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted but controlled.

1249
02:10:14,367 --> 02:10:16,833
Don Corleone will give us
protection in the east...

1250
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,925
and there will be the peace.

1251
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:21,965
But I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

1252
02:10:22,633 --> 02:10:25,827
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger...

1253
02:10:26,033 --> 02:10:28,362
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1254
02:10:28,533 --> 02:10:30,591
Look, we are all reasonable men here.

1255
02:10:30,767 --> 02:10:33,062
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1256
02:10:34,167 --> 02:10:36,258
You talk about vengeance.

1257
02:10:36,901 --> 02:10:39,593
Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you?

1258
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:42,423
Or my boy to me?

1259
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:45,793
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1260
02:10:48,633 --> 02:10:50,826
But I have selfish reasons.

1261
02:10:53,168 --> 02:10:54,996
My youngest son...

1262
02:10:55,167 --> 02:10:57,133
was forced to leave this country...

1263
02:10:58,634 --> 02:11:01,065
because of this Sollozzo business.

1264
02:11:01,534 --> 02:11:04,056
All right. And I have to make arrangements...

1265
02:11:04,233 --> 02:11:08,461
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1266
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,963
But I'm a superstitious man.

1267
02:11:13,967 --> 02:11:16,432
And if some unlucky accident should befall him...

1268
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:19,328
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1269
02:11:20,766 --> 02:11:24,029
or if he should hang himself in his jail cell...

1270
02:11:24,368 --> 02:11:26,833
of if he's struck by a bolt of lightening...

1271
02:11:28,534 --> 02:11:31,796
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1272
02:11:33,701 --> 02:11:36,223
And that I do not forgive.

1273
02:11:38,467 --> 02:11:40,864
But that aside...

1274
02:11:44,034 --> 02:11:46,295
let me say that I swear...

1275
02:11:48,001 --> 02:11:50,433
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1276
02:11:51,267 --> 02:11:55,030
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1277
02:12:21,101 --> 02:12:23,293
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1278
02:12:23,467 --> 02:12:25,933
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1279
02:12:26,568 --> 02:12:28,897
Mention it. Don't insist.

1280
02:12:30,967 --> 02:12:33,762
Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told.

1281
02:12:34,667 --> 02:12:36,497
You mean Tattaglia.

1282
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,229
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1283
02:12:40,368 --> 02:12:42,890
He never could've outfought Santino.

1284
02:12:46,101 --> 02:12:48,726
But I didn't know until this day that it was...

1285
02:12:49,901 --> 02:12:51,730
Barzini all along.

1286
02:13:07,134 --> 02:13:08,895
Come on, Nancy.

1287
02:13:10,234 --> 02:13:12,530
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1288
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:15,760
All right.

1289
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:30,963
How long have you been back?

1290
02:13:31,867 --> 02:13:33,527
I've been back a year.

1291
02:13:35,201 --> 02:13:37,133
Longer than that, I think.

1292
02:13:39,967 --> 02:13:41,796
It's good to see you, Kay.

1293
02:13:48,401 --> 02:13:50,389
Hi, Miss Adams!

1294
02:13:53,301 --> 02:13:55,198
I'm working for my father now.

1295
02:13:58,301 --> 02:14:00,028
He's been sick.

1296
02:14:00,367 --> 02:14:02,266
Very sick.

1297
02:14:02,767 --> 02:14:04,028
But you're not like him.

1298
02:14:04,768 --> 02:14:07,461
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1299
02:14:07,667 --> 02:14:09,361
That's what you told me.

1300
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:13,566
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1301
02:14:15,069 --> 02:14:19,660
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1302
02:14:19,835 --> 02:14:22,198
Like a senator or a president.

1303
02:14:22,368 --> 02:14:24,732
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1304
02:14:24,902 --> 02:14:27,265
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1305
02:14:30,735 --> 02:14:32,791
Who's being naive?

1306
02:14:33,967 --> 02:14:36,195
My father's way of doing things is over.

1307
02:14:36,367 --> 02:14:39,027
It's finished. Even he knows that.

1308
02:14:39,868 --> 02:14:41,799
I mean, in five years the Corleone family...

1309
02:14:42,034 --> 02:14:45,024
is going to be completely legitimate.

1310
02:14:46,035 --> 02:14:49,125
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1311
02:14:51,435 --> 02:14:53,628
Why did you come here?

1312
02:14:53,801 --> 02:14:55,495
Why?

1313
02:14:56,135 --> 02:14:57,122
What do you want with me after all this time...

1314
02:14:58,435 --> 02:15:00,697
without even calling or writing?

1315
02:15:00,868 --> 02:15:02,856
I came here because I need you.

1316
02:15:03,034 --> 02:15:05,159
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it.

1317
02:15:05,568 --> 02:15:09,762
Because I want you to marry me.

1318
02:15:09,968 --> 02:15:12,059
- It's too late.
- Please.

1319
02:15:14,234 --> 02:15:19,394
I'll do anything you ask to make up
for what's happened to us.

1320
02:15:20,068 --> 02:15:22,297
Because that's important.

1321
02:15:22,501 --> 02:15:25,194
Because what's important is that...

1322
02:15:25,702 --> 02:15:27,600
we have each other.

1323
02:15:27,767 --> 02:15:30,097
That we have a life together.

1324
02:15:30,535 --> 02:15:33,626
That we have children... our children.

1325
02:15:36,102 --> 02:15:38,158
I need you...

1326
02:15:39,034 --> 02:15:41,660
and I love you.

1327
02:16:02,902 --> 02:16:04,595
Barzini's people chisel my territory...

1328
02:16:04,768 --> 02:16:06,393
and we do nothing about it.

1329
02:16:06,568 --> 02:16:09,193
Soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1330
02:16:09,368 --> 02:16:11,596
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help.

1331
02:16:11,802 --> 02:16:14,393
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1332
02:16:14,668 --> 02:16:16,531
We gotta protect ourselves.

1333
02:16:16,868 --> 02:16:18,528
Give me a chance to recruit some new men.

1334
02:16:18,768 --> 02:16:20,063
No.

1335
02:16:20,468 --> 02:16:22,798
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1336
02:16:22,968 --> 02:16:24,830
Mike, you're wrong.

1337
02:16:25,501 --> 02:16:29,093
Don Corleone, you once said the day would come...

1338
02:16:29,269 --> 02:16:31,496
when Tessio and me could form our own family.

1339
02:16:31,968 --> 02:16:33,831
Till today, I would never think of it.

1340
02:16:34,002 --> 02:16:36,194
I must ask your permission.

1341
02:16:37,102 --> 02:16:39,694
Well, Michael is now head of the family...

1342
02:16:39,868 --> 02:16:42,732
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1343
02:16:44,336 --> 02:16:46,426
After we make the move to Nevada...

1344
02:16:46,601 --> 02:16:49,159
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1345
02:16:49,802 --> 02:16:52,233
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1346
02:16:54,069 --> 02:16:55,535
Six months.

1347
02:16:55,768 --> 02:16:57,996
Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone...

1348
02:17:02,102 --> 02:17:04,000
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1349
02:17:04,269 --> 02:17:07,133
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1350
02:17:07,635 --> 02:17:10,466
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1351
02:17:10,736 --> 02:17:13,394
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1352
02:17:13,635 --> 02:17:15,329
Then be a friend to Michael...

1353
02:17:15,769 --> 02:17:17,927
and do as he says.

1354
02:17:21,868 --> 02:17:23,891
There are things being negotiated
that are gonna solve...

1355
02:17:24,169 --> 02:17:26,635
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1356
02:17:27,168 --> 02:17:29,499
That's all I can tell you now.

1357
02:17:30,469 --> 02:17:32,229
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1358
02:17:33,035 --> 02:17:35,467
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1359
02:17:36,536 --> 02:17:38,558
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1360
02:17:39,035 --> 02:17:41,365
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1361
02:17:41,536 --> 02:17:43,967
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1362
02:17:44,169 --> 02:17:45,760
Besides, if I ever need help...

1363
02:17:45,968 --> 02:17:48,025
who's a better consigliere than my father?

1364
02:17:48,235 --> 02:17:49,962
That's it.

1365
02:18:08,968 --> 02:18:11,161
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1366
02:18:12,803 --> 02:18:15,496
Why am I out?

1367
02:18:17,135 --> 02:18:19,294
You're not a wartime consigliere.

1368
02:18:21,102 --> 02:18:23,693
Things may get rough with the move we're trying.

1369
02:18:30,968 --> 02:18:32,901
I advised Michael.

1370
02:18:33,169 --> 02:18:35,999
I never thought you were a bad consigliere.

1371
02:18:36,369 --> 02:18:39,301
I thought Santino was a bad don...

1372
02:18:39,535 --> 02:18:41,365
rest in peace.

1373
02:18:41,769 --> 02:18:44,893
Michael has all my confidence, as you do.

1374
02:18:46,102 --> 02:18:49,761
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1375
02:18:49,935 --> 02:18:51,833
of what is going to happen.

1376
02:18:52,035 --> 02:18:53,558
Maybe I could help.

1377
02:18:53,736 --> 02:18:55,361
You're out.

1378
02:19:44,636 --> 02:19:46,863
I can't get over the way your face looks.

1379
02:19:47,035 --> 02:19:49,763
It really looks good. This doctor did some job.

1380
02:19:50,469 --> 02:19:52,934
Who talked you into it, Kay? Hey, hey, wait.

1381
02:19:53,336 --> 02:19:55,303
Leave them out here. We'll deal with them later.

1382
02:19:55,469 --> 02:19:57,025
He's tired. He wants to clean up.

1383
02:19:57,202 --> 02:19:58,793
Now, let me open the door.

1384
02:20:06,803 --> 02:20:08,462
Hello, Mike. Welcome to Las Vegas.

1385
02:20:09,969 --> 02:20:11,595
All for you, kid. It was all his idea, right?

1386
02:20:11,769 --> 02:20:13,428
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1387
02:20:18,836 --> 02:20:21,394
I'll be right back. You keep them occupied.

1388
02:20:21,570 --> 02:20:23,899
That a boy. Anything you want, kid.

1389
02:20:24,602 --> 02:20:26,364
Who are the girls?

1390
02:20:27,437 --> 02:20:29,129
That's for you to find out.

1391
02:20:29,235 --> 02:20:30,599
Get rid of them.

1392
02:20:32,370 --> 02:20:33,767
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business.

1393
02:20:33,969 --> 02:20:38,333
I leave tomorrow. Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1394
02:20:38,536 --> 02:20:40,525
Get rid of the band too.

1395
02:20:45,836 --> 02:20:48,927
Hey, just take off. Come on. Let's go.

1396
02:20:49,235 --> 02:20:51,429
Hey, that's it. Angelo, that's it.

1397
02:20:52,103 --> 02:20:53,864
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1398
02:20:54,035 --> 02:20:55,661
Scram!

1399
02:20:56,836 --> 02:20:59,199
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1400
02:20:59,502 --> 02:21:00,593
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him.

1401
02:21:00,803 --> 02:21:02,928
It's all right, Freddy.

1402
02:21:03,603 --> 02:21:05,864
I don't know. He's tired, he's hot.

1403
02:21:13,136 --> 02:21:15,294
What happened to Moe Greene?

1404
02:21:16,270 --> 02:21:18,634
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1405
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:20,528
when the party started.

1406
02:21:20,769 --> 02:21:22,429
Well, give him a call.

1407
02:21:24,003 --> 02:21:27,094
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello. Nice to see you again.

1408
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:29,327
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1409
02:21:29,537 --> 02:21:31,264
Sit down, Johnny. I want to talk to you.

1410
02:21:31,736 --> 02:21:35,168
- The don's proud of you too.
- I owe it all to him.

1411
02:21:36,436 --> 02:21:38,266
Well, he knows how grateful you are.

1412
02:21:38,437 --> 02:21:41,232
That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1413
02:21:41,502 --> 02:21:43,560
Mike, what can I do?

1414
02:21:44,804 --> 02:21:47,326
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1415
02:21:47,503 --> 02:21:49,935
in the olive oil business, settling out here.

1416
02:21:51,070 --> 02:21:54,230
Now, Moe Greene will sell us
his share of the casino and hotel...

1417
02:21:54,437 --> 02:21:56,402
so it can be completely owned by the family.

1418
02:21:57,136 --> 02:21:59,227
Mike, are you sure about that?

1419
02:21:59,437 --> 02:21:59,835
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1420
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:04,632
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1421
02:22:06,369 --> 02:22:07,801
See, Johnny...

1422
02:22:09,003 --> 02:22:11,095
we figure that entertainment will be a big factor...

1423
02:22:11,302 --> 02:22:13,132
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1424
02:22:13,303 --> 02:22:16,359
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1425
02:22:19,837 --> 02:22:23,291
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1426
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:24,959
to do the same.

1427
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:27,295
We're counting on you.

1428
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:32,427
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather.

1429
02:22:32,636 --> 02:22:33,795
You know that.

1430
02:22:33,969 --> 02:22:35,196
Good.

1431
02:22:36,704 --> 02:22:38,567
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1432
02:22:38,736 --> 02:22:42,600
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1433
02:22:42,769 --> 02:22:44,736
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1434
02:22:44,936 --> 02:22:47,401
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1435
02:22:47,569 --> 02:22:49,001
and your credit is good.

1436
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:51,363
Draw chips for everybody in the
room so they can play on the house.

1437
02:22:55,503 --> 02:22:56,935
My credit good enough to buy you out?

1438
02:22:59,837 --> 02:23:00,962
Buy me out?

1439
02:23:01,737 --> 02:23:03,759
The casino. The hotel.

1440
02:23:04,470 --> 02:23:06,095
The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1441
02:23:07,437 --> 02:23:09,902
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?

1442
02:23:10,403 --> 02:23:12,699
No, I buy you out. You don't buy me out.

1443
02:23:13,004 --> 02:23:15,902
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.

1444
02:23:16,403 --> 02:23:18,302
You think I'm skimming off the top?

1445
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:21,368
You're unlucky.

1446
02:23:25,136 --> 02:23:27,625
You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.

1447
02:23:27,804 --> 02:23:30,531
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1448
02:23:30,704 --> 02:23:32,636
- Then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1449
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:35,502
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1450
02:23:35,737 --> 02:23:38,135
bankrolled your casino because
the Molinari family...

1451
02:23:38,304 --> 02:23:40,496
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1452
02:23:40,704 --> 02:23:42,465
Now, we're talkin' business. Let's talk business.

1453
02:23:42,637 --> 02:23:45,296
Let's talk business. First of all, you're all done.

1454
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:47,800
The Corleone family don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1455
02:23:48,004 --> 02:23:50,333
The Godfather's sick. You're
getting chased out of New York...

1456
02:23:50,503 --> 02:23:52,332
by Barzini and the other families.

1457
02:23:52,503 --> 02:23:55,594
You think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1458
02:23:56,437 --> 02:23:57,994
I talked to Barzini.

1459
02:23:58,171 --> 02:24:00,466
I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel.

1460
02:24:01,403 --> 02:24:03,767
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1461
02:24:05,337 --> 02:24:06,769
That was nothin'.

1462
02:24:07,370 --> 02:24:09,802
Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1463
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:11,868
Sure he flies off the handle once in a while...

1464
02:24:12,303 --> 02:24:14,167
but Moe and me, we're good friends, right?

1465
02:24:14,538 --> 02:24:16,298
I got a business to run.

1466
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:18,993
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1467
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:21,659
We had a little argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1468
02:24:23,237 --> 02:24:25,362
You straightened my brother out?

1469
02:24:26,003 --> 02:24:28,435
He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time!

1470
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:31,861
Players couldn't get a drink.
What's wrong with you?

1471
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:40,834
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1472
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:42,930
Son of a bitch.

1473
02:24:43,171 --> 02:24:45,797
Do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene.

1474
02:24:46,004 --> 02:24:48,435
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1475
02:24:48,637 --> 02:24:50,467
Wait a minute. I got an idea.

1476
02:24:52,103 --> 02:24:55,161
Tom, you're the consigliere.
You can talk to the don.

1477
02:24:55,338 --> 02:24:57,030
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1478
02:24:57,370 --> 02:25:00,859
The don is semi retired. Mike is
in charge of the business now.

1479
02:25:01,171 --> 02:25:03,796
If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.

1480
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:12,659
You don't come to Las Vegas
and talk to Moe Greene like that!

1481
02:25:17,437 --> 02:25:19,869
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1482
02:25:21,671 --> 02:25:23,636
But don't ever take sides with anyone...

1483
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:26,132
against the family again...

1484
02:25:27,204 --> 02:25:29,033
ever.

1485
02:25:36,404 --> 02:25:38,198
I have to see my father and his people.

1486
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:39,666
Have dinner without me.

1487
02:25:42,204 --> 02:25:44,295
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city.

1488
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:47,232
We'll see a show and have dinner. I promise.

1489
02:25:55,770 --> 02:25:57,464
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1490
02:25:57,638 --> 02:25:59,603
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1491
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:02,362
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1492
02:26:02,805 --> 02:26:04,599
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1493
02:26:04,770 --> 02:26:06,430
Let me think about it. Come on.

1494
02:26:13,838 --> 02:26:15,235
So...

1495
02:26:15,870 --> 02:26:18,359
Barzini will move against you first.

1496
02:26:18,971 --> 02:26:21,902
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1497
02:26:23,404 --> 02:26:25,461
guaranteeing your safety.

1498
02:26:26,638 --> 02:26:29,002
And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated.

1499
02:26:34,604 --> 02:26:37,229
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1500
02:26:38,905 --> 02:26:40,870
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1501
02:26:41,171 --> 02:26:42,728
It's good for you, Pop.

1502
02:26:47,538 --> 02:26:48,834
I don't know.

1503
02:26:51,004 --> 02:26:53,334
Your wife and children, are you happy with them?

1504
02:26:54,871 --> 02:26:56,234
Very happy.

1505
02:26:57,104 --> 02:26:58,627
That's good.

1506
02:26:59,705 --> 02:27:01,637
I hope you don't mind the way I...

1507
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:04,462
I keep going over this Barzini business.

1508
02:27:04,638 --> 02:27:06,399
No, not at all.

1509
02:27:06,704 --> 02:27:08,534
It's an old habit.

1510
02:27:09,137 --> 02:27:11,728
I spent my life tryin' not to be careless.

1511
02:27:13,604 --> 02:27:16,626
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.

1512
02:27:20,238 --> 02:27:22,533
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1513
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:25,235
You know, he looks more like you every day.

1514
02:27:28,271 --> 02:27:30,635
He's smarter than I am.

1515
02:27:30,805 --> 02:27:33,032
Three years old, he can read the funny papers.

1516
02:27:34,805 --> 02:27:37,100
He reads the funny papers.

1517
02:27:44,104 --> 02:27:46,435
I want you to arrange to have a telephone man...

1518
02:27:46,604 --> 02:27:50,230
check all the calls that go in and out of here.

1519
02:27:50,404 --> 02:27:51,836
- I did it already.
- Could be anyone.

1520
02:27:52,005 --> 02:27:55,334
- I took care of that.
- That's right. I forgot.

1521
02:27:59,271 --> 02:28:00,965
What's the matter?

1522
02:28:01,805 --> 02:28:03,930
What's bothering you?

1523
02:28:07,339 --> 02:28:08,997
I'll handle it.

1524
02:28:09,771 --> 02:28:12,363
I told you I can handle it, I'll handle it.

1525
02:28:25,471 --> 02:28:29,062
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1526
02:28:29,771 --> 02:28:31,430
and Fredo...

1527
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:33,228
Well...

1528
02:28:34,237 --> 02:28:36,499
Fredo was...

1529
02:28:38,138 --> 02:28:41,195
But I never wanted this for you.

1530
02:28:43,138 --> 02:28:45,968
I worked my whole life... I don't apologize...

1531
02:28:46,138 --> 02:28:48,297
to take care of my family...

1532
02:28:48,472 --> 02:28:51,460
and I refused to be a fool...

1533
02:28:52,372 --> 02:28:56,463
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1534
02:28:58,539 --> 02:29:00,333
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1535
02:29:03,605 --> 02:29:05,934
that when it was your time...

1536
02:29:06,338 --> 02:29:10,236
you would be the one to hold the strings.

1537
02:29:10,771 --> 02:29:13,670
Senator Corleone.

1538
02:29:14,105 --> 02:29:16,332
Governor Corleone. Something.

1539
02:29:16,504 --> 02:29:19,130
Another pezzonovante.

1540
02:29:24,339 --> 02:29:27,362
Just wasn't enough time. Wasn't enough time.

1541
02:29:28,238 --> 02:29:30,295
We'll get there, Pop.

1542
02:29:30,871 --> 02:29:32,996
We'll get there.

1543
02:29:36,771 --> 02:29:40,204
Listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1544
02:29:41,073 --> 02:29:42,901
he's the traitor.

1545
02:29:43,072 --> 02:29:44,663
Don't forget that.

1546
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:03,098
Put it over the tree.

1547
02:30:18,771 --> 02:30:20,829
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1548
02:30:21,172 --> 02:30:22,468
That's fine.

1549
02:30:22,638 --> 02:30:24,968
Over here. Over here.

1550
02:30:27,139 --> 02:30:29,434
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1551
02:30:35,972 --> 02:30:38,903
Anthony, come here.

1552
02:30:42,206 --> 02:30:45,694
Go ahead. That's right. We'll put it right there.

1553
02:30:52,806 --> 02:30:55,101
I'll show you something. Come here.

1554
02:30:57,272 --> 02:30:58,965
Now, you stand there.

1555
02:31:02,772 --> 02:31:04,431
Give me an orange!

1556
02:31:23,206 --> 02:31:24,502
That's a new trick.

1557
02:31:25,905 --> 02:31:27,804
You run in there. Run in there.

1558
02:31:41,772 --> 02:31:43,738
- Where are you?
- Who?

1559
02:31:43,906 --> 02:31:45,167
Ouch!

1560
02:34:41,173 --> 02:34:42,934
Mike, can I have a minute?

1561
02:34:53,673 --> 02:34:55,764
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1562
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:58,697
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1563
02:35:00,207 --> 02:35:01,933
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1564
02:35:03,606 --> 02:35:05,197
I can arrange security...

1565
02:35:06,074 --> 02:35:07,971
on my territory.

1566
02:35:10,473 --> 02:35:11,871
All right?

1567
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:14,938
- All right.
- All right.

1568
02:35:30,673 --> 02:35:32,606
Do you know how they're gonna come at you?

1569
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:38,435
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.

1570
02:35:38,606 --> 02:35:40,367
Tessio's ground...

1571
02:35:41,873 --> 02:35:43,862
where I'll be safe.

1572
02:35:56,074 --> 02:35:58,370
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1573
02:35:59,673 --> 02:36:01,299
It's the smart move.

1574
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:04,096
Tessio was always smarter.

1575
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:08,166
But I'm gonna wait.

1576
02:36:08,341 --> 02:36:10,238
After the baptism.

1577
02:36:12,474 --> 02:36:15,633
I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.

1578
02:36:16,473 --> 02:36:19,099
And then I'll meet with don Barzini...

1579
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:24,566
all the heads of the five families.

1580
02:38:46,607 --> 02:38:48,664
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father Almighty...

1581
02:38:48,874 --> 02:38:52,068
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1582
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:53,501
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1583
02:38:55,674 --> 02:38:56,697
I do.

1584
02:38:56,874 --> 02:39:00,772
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1585
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:02,167
I do.

1586
02:40:08,341 --> 02:40:12,069
Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?

1587
02:40:18,708 --> 02:40:20,334
I do renounce him.

1588
02:40:29,708 --> 02:40:31,140
And all his works?

1589
02:40:44,708 --> 02:40:46,299
I do renounce them.

1590
02:40:51,774 --> 02:40:55,229
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1591
02:41:11,241 --> 02:41:15,333
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

1592
02:41:15,507 --> 02:41:16,871
I will.

1593
02:41:24,175 --> 02:41:26,640
Michael Rizzi, go in peace.

1594
02:41:26,874 --> 02:41:29,670
And may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1595
02:42:11,841 --> 02:42:13,774
- Carlo.
- What?

1596
02:42:13,975 --> 02:42:15,838
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up.

1597
02:42:16,009 --> 02:42:17,997
Everybody's gonna have to leave without us.

1598
02:42:18,475 --> 02:42:20,703
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1599
02:42:20,909 --> 02:42:22,033
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1600
02:42:22,208 --> 02:42:24,140
Wait for my call. It's important.

1601
02:42:25,909 --> 02:42:27,840
I'll only be a couple of days.

1602
02:42:30,875 --> 02:42:32,431
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1603
02:42:44,208 --> 02:42:46,038
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1604
02:42:48,508 --> 02:42:50,838
I hope Mike can get us a good deal tonight.

1605
02:42:51,042 --> 02:42:52,598
I'm sure he will.

1606
02:43:00,042 --> 02:43:02,939
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car.

1607
02:43:03,208 --> 02:43:04,936
He says for you two to go on ahead.

1608
02:43:05,575 --> 02:43:08,007
He can't do that. It screws up all my arrangements.

1609
02:43:08,241 --> 02:43:10,173
- That's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1610
02:43:23,242 --> 02:43:25,173
Tell Mike it was only business.

1611
02:43:26,209 --> 02:43:27,902
I always liked him.

1612
02:43:28,841 --> 02:43:29,865
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1613
02:43:37,809 --> 02:43:39,536
Can you get me off the hook?

1614
02:43:41,442 --> 02:43:44,034
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1615
02:44:30,142 --> 02:44:32,630
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1616
02:44:37,809 --> 02:44:39,241
You got it all wrong.

1617
02:44:39,376 --> 02:44:41,933
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.

1618
02:44:42,675 --> 02:44:45,733
That little farce you played with my sister.

1619
02:44:46,608 --> 02:44:48,472
Did you think that could fool a Corleone?

1620
02:44:48,642 --> 02:44:50,802
I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1621
02:44:51,909 --> 02:44:53,636
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1622
02:44:57,975 --> 02:44:59,804
Don't do this to me, please.

1623
02:45:08,775 --> 02:45:10,605
Barzini's dead.

1624
02:45:12,575 --> 02:45:14,768
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1625
02:45:16,142 --> 02:45:17,767
Moe Greene...

1626
02:45:18,608 --> 02:45:20,666
Strachi...

1627
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:23,538
Cuneo.

1628
02:45:24,343 --> 02:45:27,434
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent.

1629
02:45:29,643 --> 02:45:31,700
Admit what you did.

1630
02:45:35,309 --> 02:45:37,366
Get him a drink.

1631
02:45:43,475 --> 02:45:44,964
Come on.

1632
02:45:45,909 --> 02:45:47,603
Don't be afraid.

1633
02:45:48,475 --> 02:45:51,499
You think I'd make my sister a widow?

1634
02:45:52,543 --> 02:45:53,940
I'm godfather to your son.

1635
02:46:02,076 --> 02:46:03,372
Go ahead, drink.

1636
02:46:03,643 --> 02:46:05,233
Drink.

1637
02:46:09,077 --> 02:46:11,065
No, you're out of the family business.

1638
02:46:11,276 --> 02:46:14,708
That's your punishment. You're finished.

1639
02:46:15,142 --> 02:46:17,370
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1640
02:46:23,710 --> 02:46:26,107
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1641
02:46:27,376 --> 02:46:29,535
Only don't tell me you're innocent...

1642
02:46:31,242 --> 02:46:33,936
because it insults my intelligence.

1643
02:46:34,344 --> 02:46:36,309
It makes me very angry.

1644
02:46:39,776 --> 02:46:41,968
Now, who approached you?

1645
02:46:43,010 --> 02:46:45,770
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1646
02:46:53,276 --> 02:46:55,209
It was Barzini.

1647
02:46:59,110 --> 02:47:00,508
Good.

1648
02:47:06,843 --> 02:47:09,604
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1649
02:47:10,843 --> 02:47:13,036
I'll call your wife, tell her what flight you're on.

1650
02:47:19,177 --> 02:47:21,937
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1651
02:47:47,543 --> 02:47:49,009
Hello, Carlo.

1652
02:48:47,210 --> 02:48:49,641
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1653
02:48:50,277 --> 02:48:53,243
- I'm telling you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1654
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:04,303
Where is he?

1655
02:49:07,344 --> 02:49:11,436
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1656
02:49:12,477 --> 02:49:14,636
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1657
02:49:14,844 --> 02:49:16,275
and then you killed him!

1658
02:49:16,509 --> 02:49:19,442
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1659
02:49:19,677 --> 02:49:23,074
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1660
02:49:23,477 --> 02:49:25,738
Now what am I gonna do?

1661
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:31,998
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the mall?

1662
02:49:32,210 --> 02:49:34,438
All the time he knew he was gonna kill him.

1663
02:49:35,243 --> 02:49:37,800
And you stood godfather to our baby.

1664
02:49:37,976 --> 02:49:40,340
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1665
02:49:40,577 --> 02:49:42,634
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1666
02:49:42,876 --> 02:49:44,467
Read the papers! Read the papers!

1667
02:49:44,744 --> 02:49:47,141
That's your husband! That's your husband!

1668
02:50:01,677 --> 02:50:03,233
Take her upstairs.

1669
02:50:03,544 --> 02:50:05,772
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1670
02:50:26,011 --> 02:50:27,805
She's hysterical.

1671
02:50:32,378 --> 02:50:34,104
Hysterical.

1672
02:50:35,911 --> 02:50:37,809
Is it true?

1673
02:50:39,711 --> 02:50:40,768
Don't ask me about my business.

1674
02:50:41,811 --> 02:50:45,072
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1675
02:50:45,277 --> 02:50:46,800
Enough!

1676
02:51:06,344 --> 02:51:07,605
All right.

1677
02:51:10,544 --> 02:51:12,272
This one time.

1678
02:51:16,243 --> 02:51:19,142
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1679
02:51:25,877 --> 02:51:27,309
Is it true?

1680
02:51:31,444 --> 02:51:32,933
Is it?

1681
02:51:49,911 --> 02:51:52,139
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1682
02:51:52,310 --> 02:51:53,674
Come on.

1683
02:52:24,078 --> 02:52:26,135
Don Corleone.
