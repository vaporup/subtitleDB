1
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,628
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,477
Shu Lien!

3
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,063
Li Mu Bi is here!

4
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,114
- How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in

5
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,524
Mu Bi.
It's been too long

6
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:36,766
It has

7
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,264
- How's business?
- Good

8
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,183
- And how are you?
- Fine

9
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,026
Monk Zheng said
you were at Wudan Mountain

10
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,876
He said you were practicing
deep meditation

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,046
The mountain
must be so peaceful

12
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,185
I envy you

13
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,927
My work keeps me so busy,
I hardly get any rest.

14
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:04,185
I left the training early.

15
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:09,872
Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything.

16
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,598
During my meditation training...

17
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,378
I came to a place
of deep silence...

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,675
I was surrounded by light...

19
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,735
Time and space disappeared.

20
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:27,343
I had come to a place my master
had never told me about.

21
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,211
You were enlightened?

22
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:32,839
No.

23
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:36,332
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightenment.

24
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:41,765
Instead... I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

25
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,613
I couldn't bear it.

26
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,016
I broke off my meditation.

27
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,936
I couldn't go on.

28
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:53,188
There was something...
pulling me back.

29
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:55,616
What was it?

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,054
Something I can't let go of.

31
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:06,173
You're leaving soon?

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,432
We're preparing a convoy
for a delivery...

33
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:11,741
to Peking.

34
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:13,373
Perhaps I could ask you...

35
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:17,016
to deliver something
to Sir Te for me.

36
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,151
The Green Destiny sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,614
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

38
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,588
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

39
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,203
It has always been with you.

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,488
Too many men have died
at its edge.

41
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,374
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade.

42
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:49,040
You use it justly,
you're worthy of it.

43
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:54,229
It's time for me
to leave it behind.

44
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,170
So what will you do now?

45
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,997
Come with me to Peking.

46
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:05,031
You can give the sword to Sir Te
yourself.

47
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,688
It'll be just like old times.

48
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,873
First I must visit
my master's grave.

49
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,268
It's been many years since...

50
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,857
Jade Fox murdered him.
I have yet to avenge his death.

51
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,922
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

52
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,807
I must pray for his forgiveness.

53
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,311
Join me
once you have finished.

54
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,717
I can wait for you in Peking.

55
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,236
Perhaps.

56
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,203
Okay. Pass.

57
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:43,872
Thanks.

58
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,890
Let's go into the city.

59
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,223
Everything got here safely.
I'm much obliged.

60
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,292
Just doing my job.

61
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:06,683
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

62
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:10,868
You're a credit to his memory.

63
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,049
Thank you.

64
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,192
I mean it.

65
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,235
This is Li Mu Bai's
personal sword,

66
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,706
a great hero's weapon.

67
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:59,943
He is the only one in the world
worthy of carrying it.

68
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,170
It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it.

69
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,415
Sir Te...

70
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:06,754
it has brought him
as much trouble as glory.

71
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,603
Help him to leave
these troubles behind.

72
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:12,415
Otherwise, he'll never be able
to start anew.

73
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,590
All right.

74
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,478
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

75
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,242
Governor Yu has arrived.

76
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,555
I must change.

77
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:26,073
You've always been so good
to Li Mu Bai and me.

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,127
Please accept our thanks.

79
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,660
Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.

80
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,501
Now, Shu Lien...

81
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,649
tell me something.

82
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,232
And forgive me for prying.

83
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,020
Your father
was a great friend to me,

84
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,284
and I think of you
as my own daughter.

85
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,422
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

86
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,816
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword...

87
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:55,284
and his warrior days...

88
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:58,314
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something?

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,077
I don't know...

90
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:04,465
Don't be coy. I've always known
about your feelings for each other.

91
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:06,731
All these years, it's a shame...

92
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:10,890
neither of you is brave enough
to admit the truth to the other.

93
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,310
You're both wasting precious time.

94
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:20,713
I beg your pardon.
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

95
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,131
When it comes to emotions,

96
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,227
even great heroes can be idiots.

97
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:33,727
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more
open the next time you see him.

98
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:37,692
I'll give him an earful!

99
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,904
Sir Te said
to leave the sword in here.

100
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,851
Who are you?

101
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,574
I'm your guest today.

102
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,938
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

103
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:06,327
This is Sir Te's study.
You are here to...?

104
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:11,194
I was just looking
for a quiet corner.

105
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,369
I am Sir Te’s head servant.

106
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:15,319
And this is another of our guests.

107
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,733
It's heavy
for such a thin piece of metal!

108
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,738
The handle is heavy.
And the blade is no ordinary metal.

109
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,809
Still, the sword
is the lightest of weapons.

110
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,206
You’re just not used
to handling it.

111
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,789
But, I have had much practice.

112
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,999
As a child in the West,
a platoon lived with us.

113
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,076
They'd let me play
with their weapons.

114
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:50,596
The scabbard is so beautiful.

115
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,146
Beautiful but dangerous.

116
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:57,795
Once you see it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.

117
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:01,219
It's 400 years old.

118
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,080
Exquisite!

119
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,657
You said it belongs to...

120
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,917
My friend Li Mu Bai.
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

121
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,128
Li Mu Bai!

122
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,391
The famous warrior?

123
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:18,491
Why would he give his sword
to Sir Te?

124
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,990
You're too young to understand.

125
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,582
You're a sword fighter too?

126
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:24,607
Yes, I am.

127
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,525
But I prefer the machete.

128
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:30,843
Certain moves, however,
call for a sword.

129
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,334
Really?

130
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:38,492
It must be exciting to be
a fighter, to be totally free!

131
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:42,422
Fighters have rules too:
friendship, trust...

132
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:45,172
integrity.
Without rules...

133
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:47,606
we wouldn't survive for long.

134
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,199
I've read
all about people like you.

135
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,077
Roaming wild, beating up anyone
who gets in your way!

136
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,086
Writers wouldn't sell many books
if they told how it really is.

137
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,667
But you're just like
the characters in the stories.

138
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:02,993
Sure. No place to bathe for days,
sleeping in flea-infested beds...

139
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,260
They tell you all about that
in those books?

140
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,305
You know what I mean.

141
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,469
I'm getting married soon, but
I haven't lived the life I want.

142
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,433
So I heard.
Congratulations.

143
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:22,726
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

144
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,704
You're not married, are you?

145
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:28,064
What do you think?

146
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,340
No! You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

147
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,991
You're probably right.

148
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:57,815
TE'S

149
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,356
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

150
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,573
2 feet 9 inches long.

151
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:21,678
1 inch wide.

152
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:25,109
The handle is 1 inch deep,
2.6 inches wide.

153
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,781
7 tenths of an inch thick.

154
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,434
With seven rubies missing
from the hilt.

155
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,121
You can tell the design

156
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,658
dates back
to before the Chin era.

157
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:39,688
Engraved with a technique lost
by the time of the Han Dynasty.

158
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,212
Your knowledge is remarkable,
Sir Te.

159
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,443
A sword by itself rules nothing.

160
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,811
It comes alive
only through skillful manipulation.

161
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,027
I see your point.
Please continue.

162
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,164
The Imperial Court
isn't the problem.

163
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,877
With royalty and officials
everywhere...

164
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:04,672
the Royal Guard
keeps security tight.

165
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,750
But Peking is not like the West.

166
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:11,076
Here, you'll find
all sorts of characters.

167
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,141
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

168
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,448
Don't depend only on the court.

169
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:20,027
Contacts
in the Giang Hu underworld...

170
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,846
can ensure your position.

171
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,858
Be strong yet supple.

172
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,999
This is the way to rule.

173
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,216
Governess...

174
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,065
Let me do it.

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,893
Please sit.

176
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,028
I've made you silk pajamas.
Do you want to change into them?

177
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:11,503
Put them down.

178
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:20,009
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

179
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,212
Do you know her?

180
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,617
She's one of those.

181
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,139
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

182
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,288
I'll socialize
with whomever I please.

183
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,461
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

184
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,232
I'm tired now!

185
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,729
Go to bed then.

186
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:47,642
Miss has grown up,
and is getting married soon.

187
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,811
God knows
what the future will bring.

188
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,524
It'll be just the same.

189
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,849
Enough! I'm tired.

190
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,007
Autumn is coming.

191
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,239
I'll shut the windows for you.

192
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,942
- Chilly, eh?
- Yes, Master Bo.

193
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,154
Someone help!

194
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,749
Stop him!

195
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,294
He's on the roof!

196
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,164
The sword's been stolen!

197
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,585
Stop thief!

198
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:09,070
Stop him!

199
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,796
It’s Jade Fox!

200
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,033
We must avenge Mother!

201
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,150
Do something!
He's getting away!

202
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,140
Return the sword
and I'll let you go.

203
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:29,834
You've been trained at Wudan?

204
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,420
You're mistaken.

205
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,204
We’re just street performers.
We were rehearsing.

206
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,100
Father!

207
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,112
You were rehearsing?

208
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,938
Who are you trying to fool?

209
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,825
Where did that thief go?

210
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,398
Governor Yu’s house!

211
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:37,498
Get down here!

212
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:54,514
Give back the sword!

213
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,802
Sir Te awaits you.

214
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:14,362
I'm sure the thief
is in the Yu household.

215
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,540
How dare you imply?

216
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,276
Enough!

217
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,508
Has Governor Yu
ever seen the sword?

218
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:35,702
Yes, though I doubt
he's involved in this.

219
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,644
But the sword
could be in his compound.

220
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:46,633
Then someone's trying
to set him up.

221
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:49,006
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

222
00:20:58,735 --> 00:20:59,628
What is it?

223
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,026
Madam Yu,
someone's put up posters.

224
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,577
Let me see.

225
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,863
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

226
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,137
Preposterous, looking for her here!

227
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,527
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

228
00:21:57,722 --> 00:22:00,471
I haven't seen them in two days.

229
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:52,867
There's a Miss Shu Lien here
to see you.

230
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,372
Miss is busy right now.

231
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:55,777
I'll tell her.

232
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,534
Show her in.

233
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:07,319
This spells trouble.

234
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,334
I have a guest.

235
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,490
This way please.

236
00:23:25,212 --> 00:23:26,421
I've missed you.

237
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:27,383
How so?

238
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:29,139
I'm bored...

239
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,136
You're doing calligraphy?

240
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,530
I'll write your name.

241
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:41,997
Just for fun.

242
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,797
I never realized my name
looks like "sword."

243
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:14,592
You write gracefully. Calligraphy
is so similar to fencing.

244
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,967
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

245
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,559
Please.

246
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:27,041
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

247
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,212
You must be overwhelmed
by the preparations.

248
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:33,024
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it the better.

249
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:37,943
My parents
are arranging everything.

250
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:42,073
The Gous are a very powerful family.

251
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:46,233
My marrying one will be good
for my father's career.

252
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,910
You are fortunate
to marry into such a noble family.

253
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,381
Am I?

254
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,614
I wish I were like the heroes
in the books I read.

255
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,208
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

256
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:00,720
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

257
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:03,856
But to be free
to live my own life...

258
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,129
to choose whom I love...

259
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:09,619
That is true happiness.

260
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,337
Do you think so?
Let me tell you a story...

261
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,963
About you and Li Mu Bai?

262
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,310
Yes.

263
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:18,509
Did you know I was once engaged
to be married?

264
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:20,083
No, really?

265
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,966
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

266
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,071
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai
by oath.

267
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,338
One day, while in battle...

268
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:31,333
he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

269
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,947
After, Li Mu Bai and I
went through a lot together.

270
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,091
Our feelings for each other
grew stronger.

271
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:39,627
But how could we dishonor...

272
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,348
Meng's memory?

273
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:44,264
So the freedom
you talk about, I too desire it.

274
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:46,598
But I have never tasted it.

275
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:52,095
Too bad for Meng, but it's not
your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

276
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:57,409
I am not an aristocrat,
as you are...

277
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:02,013
but I must still respect
a woman's duties.

278
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,221
Don't distance us.

279
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:08,379
From now on, let's be like sisters.

280
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:14,109
Then as a sister, let me wish you
happiness in your marriage.

281
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:51,564
What a godforsaken place!

282
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:56,363
Can’t your father be appointed
closer to civilization?

283
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:00,171
Jen...

284
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,472
are you listening to me?

285
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:30,942
Let's go.

286
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,861
Who are you?

287
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:58,964
Wait! I'm a friend!

288
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:05,172
I don't care about your sword.

289
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,377
Why were you spying on the Yus?

290
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:10,261
I'm looking for someone.
Jade Fox.

291
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,684
I'm a police inspector
from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

292
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:17,964
Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

293
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:22,096
She must have come with them
when they transferred here.

294
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,481
But with Yu's reputation,
I can’t just go in and accuse her.

295
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,560
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- Yes.

296
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:31,590
Then leave her to me.

297
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,215
Pardon me,
but I doubt you can handle her.

298
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,804
My wife was
quite a martial arts expert.

299
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,283
Jade Fox killed her.

300
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:40,354
So you see...

301
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:43,524
this is personal.
Leave her to me.

302
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:45,570
It's ready.

303
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,208
I'm ready for anything!

304
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,632
Father gets first dip.

305
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:55,903
They're gone!

306
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,168
What does it say?

307
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:02,400
"We'll settle this at midnight
on Yellow Hill."

308
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:05,118
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

309
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,315
Shu Lien, look who’s here.

310
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:21,145
Sir Te believes it's a ploy
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

311
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,474
But something is going on
at the Yu household.

312
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,230
What have you discovered?

313
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:39,413
Jade Fox?

314
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:40,781
Impossible!

315
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:43,474
You'd always suspected
she'd fed to the West.

316
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:45,972
I didn't think she'd dare
come back to Peking!

317
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:48,972
Is there any place safer
than under the nose of Governor Yu?

318
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:55,152
So I shall avenge
my master's death after all.

319
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,606
Be careful.

320
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,257
Sir Te requires discretion.

321
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,562
Official business
is difficult enough.

322
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:07,142
Don't let personal feelings
make it worse.

323
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:10,377
And I don't know...
even this poster...

324
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,330
could be some sort of trap.

325
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,288
Did you see who posted it?

326
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:17,577
No.

327
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:19,843
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

328
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,976
On the night of the theft
there was a brawl near Yu's.

329
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:25,636
Were you involved?

330
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,709
It was Bo, Sir Te’s man.

331
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,596
I hear he followed the thief
to the Yu's.

332
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,252
Have you questioned him yet?

333
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,652
No, not yet...

334
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:37,051
But your men are watching over
Yu's compound?

335
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,796
No, I'd already sent them home.

336
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,345
You can blame me
for losing the sword...

337
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:46,651
but please trust
that I'll get it back soon...

338
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:48,726
using my own methods.

339
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,454
That's not what I meant.

340
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,240
I don't care about the sword.

341
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:57,205
What do you mean?
Didn’t you come back here for it?

342
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:00,987
I didn't know it was stolen
until I got here.

343
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,089
Then, why did you come?

344
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,822
Well, we had talked...

345
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,778
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li...

346
00:31:13,944 --> 00:31:15,666
your room is ready.

347
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:18,509
Thank you.

348
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,579
Please, lead the way.

349
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:34,246
The Fox doesn't care much
for punctuality.

350
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,488
Still no sign of her.

351
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:45,578
Enough! Show yourself!

352
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,007
Tsai...

353
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:52,647
You dog!

354
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,565
You will pay
for your stubbornness!

355
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,567
That's what you think, old witch!

356
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:00,637
If you surrender now,
you'll suffer less.

357
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,198
But if you resist,
I won't stop until you're dead.

358
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,801
Father!

359
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:07,041
Let me avenge my mother's death!

360
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:09,342
You'll soon end up like her,
you little whore!

361
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:11,743
You'll pay for that!

362
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:33,123
She's going to paralyze you!

363
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:40,763
May!

364
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,070
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

365
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,454
An ambush!

366
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,083
Father, are you all right?

367
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,886
Wudan should have gotten
rid of you long ago.

368
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,376
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

369
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,321
You don't remember me...

370
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:14,320
But you should
remember my master.

371
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:16,560
You infiltrated Wudan
while I was away.

372
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,865
You stole our secret manual...

373
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,972
and poisoned our master!

374
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:23,955
Now it's time for you to pay!

375
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,027
Your master
underestimated us women.

376
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:30,056
Sure, he'd sleep with me,
but he would never teach me.

377
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:32,909
He deserved to die
by a woman's hand!

378
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:15,005
You stole the secrets
of Wudan's highest martial arts.

379
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:18,018
But after ten years of training
your moves are still undisciplined.

380
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:19,584
And today...

381
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,330
under a Wudan sword...

382
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,162
you will die!

383
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,476
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

384
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:32,593
Let's go!

385
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,331
Another one!

386
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,721
I must get rid of Tsai!

387
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:43,800
Who are you?

388
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:47,981
Why is the Green Destiny
in your possession?

389
00:35:50,038 --> 00:35:51,085
What's it to you?

390
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,715
My name is Li Mu Bai.

391
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,181
The Green Destiny is mine.

392
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,468
Jade Fox can't be your master.

393
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,487
Where did you learn
that "Xuan Piu" move?

394
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,443
I'm just playing around.

395
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,661
Tell me, who is your master?

396
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,995
- Let's go!
- We must kill them!

397
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:50,977
Father!

398
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,326
This is Tsai?

399
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:17,206
My father.

400
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,789
Police inspector from Shaan.

401
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:25,326
This should be reported
to Governor Yu.

402
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,565
The victim is an officer.

403
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,187
You believe the killer
is hiding out in his compound?

404
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:33,933
I'd bet my life on it!

405
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:39,850
Come with me.

406
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:44,997
This needs to be resolved,
and quickly.

407
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:49,224
I'll get into the Yu household
and get her.

408
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,111
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

409
00:37:51,276 --> 00:37:52,650
We must be careful.

410
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:55,976
Yu is a court official,
and in charge of security.

411
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:59,105
Any disturbance
will cast suspicion on him.

412
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:00,931
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

413
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:04,125
This is a delicate matter.

414
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,332
Sir Te, can you find some excuse...

415
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,308
to invite
Madam Yu and her daughter?

416
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:13,408
What do you have in mind?

417
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:17,976
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

418
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:25,655
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.

419
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,336
She's being so considerate.

420
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:32,279
I'm sorry she's not feeling
well enough to receive you today.

421
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:35,128
I heard Sir Te lost something.

422
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:38,357
And now Madam Te's
not feeling well...

423
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,752
We know who stole
the missing item.

424
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:48,557
If the thief returns it,
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue...

425
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:50,549
the matter no further.

426
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:51,955
That's good.

427
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:55,091
Sometimes the help can't keep
their hands to themselves.

428
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,747
It's very embarrassing.

429
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,745
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes...

430
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,948
that can bring ruin to themselves
and their families.

431
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:08,107
But don't be too lenient.

432
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:11,240
No mercy will be shown
toward the murderer...

433
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,782
who turned up in Peking.

434
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:15,652
A murderer?

435
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:16,684
Yes...

436
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:20,740
the very killer
of Li Mu Bai's own master.

437
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:21,704
Last night...

438
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,518
she killed a policeman
who had tracked her down.

439
00:39:24,684 --> 00:39:27,400
A female criminal!
Now that's news!

440
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:30,464
You say she killed
a policeman?

441
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:32,198
Yes, from the West.

442
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:35,775
He went undercover,
and followed her here.

443
00:39:36,552 --> 00:39:37,664
Maybe the murderer...

444
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:40,318
and the thief are the same.

445
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,405
I doubt that.

446
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:43,101
This thief...

447
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,848
is very unusual.

448
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,798
And most likely smarter
than a mere killer.

449
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,454
Greetings, Sir Te.

450
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,146
Hello, Madam Yu.

451
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:06,421
This is Li Mu Bai...

452
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,922
the renowned swordsman.

453
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,611
Delighted to meet you.

454
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:14,323
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

455
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:18,799
Congratulations.

456
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:33,963
Why don’t you come in?

457
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,691
I'm standing guard.

458
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,439
Come in. It's cold.

459
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,161
Come in.

460
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:48,196
We don't have to fear Jade Fox
if we’re together.

461
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:12,898
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

462
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:17,698
You've brought me the sword?

463
00:41:18,724 --> 00:41:20,796
I do as I please.

464
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:25,019
Where is your master?

465
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,302
What's it to you?

466
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,457
Had enough flying?

467
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,156
You've got potential.

468
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:02,416
You've studied the Wudan manual
but you don't understand it.

469
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,692
You need a real master.

470
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:10,123
Do you think
you are a real master?

471
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,933
Like most things,
I am nothing.

472
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,884
It's the same for this sword.

473
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:18,381
All of it is simply
a state of mind.

474
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:21,124
Stop talking like a monk!

475
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:22,221
Just fight!

476
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,006
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

477
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:24,805
On guard!

478
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,764
Real sharpness
comes without effort.

479
00:42:58,273 --> 00:42:59,320
No growth.

480
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,600
Without assistance.

481
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,423
No action.

482
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:03,990
Without reaction.

483
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,971
No desire without restraint.

484
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,659
Now give yourself up
and find yourself again.

485
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:12,377
There is a lesson for you.

486
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,388
Go ahead.

487
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:21,139
Why should I?

488
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:25,264
You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny,

489
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:28,212
but first you must learn
to hold it in stillness.

490
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:32,433
Why do you want to teach me?

491
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,826
I've always wanted a disciple...

492
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:39,335
worthy of Wudan’s secrets.

493
00:43:40,914 --> 00:43:42,986
And if I use them
to kill you?

494
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,503
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

495
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:50,500
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

496
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:54,405
Wudan is a whorehouse!

497
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:55,652
Keep your lessons!

498
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,236
You're home late...

499
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:16,772
or should I say early?

500
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:21,695
Why are you still here?
You killed a policeman.

501
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,521
You should leave!

502
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:27,036
You'll bring ruin
on my whole family.

503
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:30,364
They wouldn’t have found me
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

504
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:34,106
Like a little girl,
you thought stealing would be fun?

505
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:37,756
You, too, are responsible
for that death. Come with me.

506
00:44:38,973 --> 00:44:42,802
You don't want to waste your life
as the wife of some bureaucrat.

507
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:45,690
Denied your talent...

508
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,185
As master and disciple
we will rule.

509
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:49,426
I'll never live as a thief!

510
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:51,284
You're already a thief.

511
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:52,659
That was just for fun.

512
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,734
How can I leave?
Where would I go?

513
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:57,292
Wherever we want.

514
00:44:57,463 --> 00:44:59,186
We'll get rid of anyone
in our way.

515
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,244
Even your father.

516
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,453
Shut up!

517
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:05,395
It's the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle... kill or be killed.

518
00:45:05,556 --> 00:45:07,214
Exciting, isn't it?

519
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,640
I owe you nothing.

520
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:16,775
Yes, you do!

521
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:21,132
You are still my disciple.

522
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:32,260
You think you’ve been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

523
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,206
You couldn't even
decipher the symbols!

524
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,586
I studied the diagrams.

525
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:41,607
But you hid the details!

526
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:45,247
You wouldn't have understood,
even if I had tried to explain.

527
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:46,848
You know...

528
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:50,177
you've gone as far as you can go.

529
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:53,407
I hid my skills
so as not to hurt you.

530
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:58,647
If I hadn't seen you
fight with Li Mu Bai...

531
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:02,332
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

532
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:06,524
Master...

533
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:11,127
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

534
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,289
You enchanted me
with the world of Giang Hu.

535
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:18,616
But once I realized
I could surpass you...

536
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,305
I became so frightened!

537
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,791
Everything fell apart.

538
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:26,033
I had no one to guide me...

539
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:29,101
no one to learn from.

540
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,875
Believe me...

541
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:35,020
I've a lesson or two left
to teach you!

542
00:47:44,124 --> 00:47:45,051
The sword is back...

543
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,220
Are you happy?

544
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,201
I admit...

545
00:47:50,363 --> 00:47:52,817
getting it back makes me realize
how much I'd missed it.

546
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,861
But it's not your sword anymore.

547
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:58,097
You gave it to Sir Te.

548
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:00,654
True.

549
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,658
But I must borrow it
for one last mission.

550
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:07,724
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

551
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,791
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

552
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:19,247
My job was to get the sword back,
without embarrassing anyone.

553
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:22,026
I wasn't about to ruin...

554
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,493
her life, or her father's.

555
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,272
You did your job well.

556
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,957
But, this girl...

557
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:32,262
I saw her last night.

558
00:48:34,763 --> 00:48:36,551
I knew she would intrigue you.

559
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:38,981
She needs direction...

560
00:48:39,145 --> 00:48:42,112
and training.

561
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,181
She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.

562
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:47,390
In any case,
it will all be over soon.

563
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:51,102
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

564
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,559
That's not for her.

565
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,993
She should come to Wudan
and become a disciple.

566
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,609
But Wudan does not accept women.

567
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:02,775
For her, they might
make an exception.

568
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:06,719
If not, I'm afraid she'll become
a poisoned dragon.

569
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:09,946
It's not our affair.

570
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:14,713
Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.

571
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,706
I thought by giving away the sword,

572
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,754
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

573
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:26,387
But the cycle of bloodshed
continues.

574
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,652
I wish there were something more...

575
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:31,920
I could do to help you.

576
00:49:37,845 --> 00:49:40,211
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

577
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,083
Lo?

578
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:03,683
Jen!

579
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:17,829
You shouldn't have come.

580
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,385
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days...

581
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:25,215
it took me a while
to get in here.

582
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:27,235
I can't wait any longer.

583
00:50:27,396 --> 00:50:29,915
I was wrong to let you go.

584
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:31,578
Come back with me.

585
00:50:31,746 --> 00:50:34,080
You'll be happy in the desert.

586
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,996
You'll be free there.

587
00:50:38,464 --> 00:50:40,951
You've been looking for me
all this time?

588
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:04,174
Jen...

589
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:05,902
Stop playing with it.

590
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:08,363
I won't break it.

591
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:36,447
It's Dark Cloud!

592
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:38,944
Dark Cloud is coming!

593
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,196
Lower the shade,
don't let them see you!

594
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:15,733
Don't touch the women!

595
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,608
Let's go!

596
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:04,614
Come get your comb.

597
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:54,582
Hurry back to your mother.

598
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:54,912
She's mine!

599
00:54:55,078 --> 00:54:56,026
Leave her to me!

600
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:07,739
Come and get it!

601
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,467
Give me back my comb!

602
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:12,351
Let's stop a moment.

603
00:55:12,512 --> 00:55:14,104
Give it back!

604
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:16,793
You're tired. You need rest.

605
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,467
Your horse needs water.
There's a creek up here.

606
00:55:33,113 --> 00:55:35,021
Well, there used to be!

607
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,157
What's your name?

608
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:46,221
I'm Lo.

609
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:48,427
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

610
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,351
I'm not that tall or big...

611
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,205
but I'm quick as lightning.

612
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:05,864
My comb!

613
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:40,706
If you like that arrow,
I can make you a bow.

614
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:43,047
Great for hunting wild chicken.

615
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:44,868
They're delicious.

616
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:52,486
You need to eat.
Understand?

617
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:56,453
Then you'll have
the strength to fight.

618
00:57:58,342 --> 00:57:59,290
Understand?

619
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:10,680
You're eating too fast.

620
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:12,223
Slowly.
