1
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,883
You've got quite a temper.

2
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:57,941
It's better this way...

3
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,618
You coward!

4
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,311
Still in a bad mood?

5
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,487
At least you’re speaking.

6
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,153
What's your name?

7
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:19,082
I didn't think the Hans
had names like that.

8
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:57,051
Relax.

9
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,565
If I had wanted to, I would
already have done it.

10
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,931
You must be dying for a bath.

11
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:07,131
Fresh water's hard to get here.

12
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,944
But I managed to bring some up.

13
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,496
You can wear my clothes
when you're done.

14
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,576
They're clean.

15
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,121
Don't worry.

16
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:37,294
I'll sing,
so you’ll know where I am.

17
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,462
After the bath,
you'll be calmer.

18
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,070
No more hitting on the head!

19
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,179
All this trouble for a comb?

20
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,581
It's mine.

21
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,604
It means a lot to me. A barbarian
like you wouldn't understand.

22
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,835
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

23
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,280
By the way,
I'm a real Manchurian.

24
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,441
I'm sorry...

25
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,043
I guessed wrong.

26
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,898
I thought you were a Han.

27
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,029
Give me back my comb.

28
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,943
I don't take orders from anyone.

29
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,518
Give it back.

30
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,302
One night...

31
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,902
when I was a boy, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.

32
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,770
I thought,
"Where did they all go?"

33
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,088
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.

34
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,976
I thought if I rode to the other
end of the desert, I'd find them.

35
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,653
I've been riding in the desert
ever since.

36
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,522
And so, the little boy
became a fearsome bandit.

37
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,659
He couldn't find the stars,
so he stole my comb.

38
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,524
Out here, you always fight
for survival.

39
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:30,202
You have to be part of a gang
to stand a chance.

40
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,434
Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.

41
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:37,336
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just to scare people...

42
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:39,641
and make my life easier.

43
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,867
So you are still that little boy...

44
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:45,240
Looking for shooting stars.

45
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,247
I am a man.

46
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,718
And now I've found
the brightest star of all.

47
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,888
Your father's men
are looking for you.

48
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,460
They're still out there,
circling closer.

49
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:51,645
Let them look.

50
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,071
It is trouble for me.

51
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,321
Don't send me back.

52
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,767
You must decide.

53
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,685
You might get tired of this life.

54
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,321
You might begin
to miss your family.

55
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,969
If it were our daughter,
we'd look for her too.

56
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,336
She would miss us.

57
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,214
Jen...

58
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,613
I want you to be mine forever.

59
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,166
I will make my mark
on the world.

60
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,702
I will earn your parents' respect.

61
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,319
We have a legend.

62
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,754
Anyone who dares to jump
from the mountain...

63
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,956
God will grant his wish.

64
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:44,080
Long ago, a young man's parents
were ill, so he jumped.

65
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,704
He didn't die.

66
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,917
He wasn't even hurt.

67
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,923
He floated away,
far away, never to return.

68
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:55,302
He knew his wish had come true.

69
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,344
If you believe,
it will happen.

70
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:01,154
The elders say...

71
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:04,099
"A faithful heart
makes wishes come true."

72
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,352
Keep it safe.

73
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:20,260
Return it to me
when we are together again.

74
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:23,549
I will.

75
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,328
If you don't,
I'll come after you.

76
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,757
And I won't let you off so easy.

77
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,409
Wherever I went
someone always recognized me.

78
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,904
I really tried.

79
00:10:57,977 --> 00:10:59,831
Later, I heard you came
to Peking.

80
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,228
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

81
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:04,403
So I came.

82
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:06,933
I can't let you marry.

83
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,949
Go.

84
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,026
Jen...

85
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,672
Don't ever come back.

86
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,360
So it's over?

87
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:22,800
Yes.

88
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,100
We heard noises.

89
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,826
It was just a cat.

90
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:00,958
You think Jade Fox will show up?

91
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:02,944
She's out there...

92
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,238
but I doubt she'll show herself.

93
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,862
We'll keep our eyes open.

94
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:08,884
Sooner or later...

95
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:12,052
she'll come for the girl.

96
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,020
Jen!

97
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,454
Come with me!

98
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,630
You're mine!
Come with me to the desert!

99
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:12,068
Jen!

100
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,594
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

101
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:20,479
Tell me.

102
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:21,890
Where is Jade Fox?

103
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:23,679
Come with me. Hurry!

104
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,888
You thought she'd give it all up
and go back West with you?

105
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,503
She's mine.

106
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,909
Either way...

107
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:38,552
you are no good to her dead.
With the Gou and Yu clans...

108
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,436
hunting you,
you'll soon be in their hands.

109
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,035
I don't care anymore.

110
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,120
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

111
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,016
Don’t you want to see her again?

112
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:56,271
All right.

113
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,775
I'll write you an introduction.
Take it to Wudan.

114
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,791
Wait there for news from me.

115
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,213
All right.

116
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,925
When will this end?

117
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:17,873
They take it, they put it back,
they take it again.

118
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:21,863
My home is turning into
a warehouse.

119
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:22,894
Come in.

120
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:25,869
Speak!

121
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,341
Jen has run away!

122
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,738
Gou found
the wedding chamber empty.

123
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,520
Governor Yu requests
your assistance.

124
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:34,245
You know
the Giang Hu underworld.

125
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:38,024
He wants to find her,
and keep her from harm.

126
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:42,754
Sir Te, leave this to us.
Don't worry.

127
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:01,880
What can I serve you?

128
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:05,307
This cup is dirty.

129
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:20,730
Hello.

130
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,630
What's your name?

131
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:26,739
Long.

132
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,262
It's young Master Long.

133
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,538
My apologies!

134
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:34,420
I'm Iron Eagle Sung...

135
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,077
and this is my brother in arms...

136
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,904
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

137
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,444
What brings you to Huai An...

138
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,874
and where are you headed,
Master Long?

139
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,308
Anywhere there's action.

140
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:48,875
In that case, perhaps
we could be of assistance.

141
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,624
Don't bother.

142
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,622
You don't seem to understand.

143
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,981
So what if I don't?

144
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,819
We have ways of helping you
to understand.

145
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,886
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

146
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,882
He is my defeated foe!

147
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,681
Have some tea.

148
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:07,825
Shu Lien...

149
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,285
The things we touch
have no permanence.

150
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,091
My master would say...

151
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:18,480
there is nothing
we can hold on to in this world.

152
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:23,398
Only by letting go
can we truly possess what is real.

153
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,912
Not everything
is an illusion.

154
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,737
My hand...

155
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,074
wasn't that real?

156
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:38,220
Your hand, rough and callused
from practice...

157
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,478
All this time, I've never had
the courage to touch it.

158
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:49,349
Giang Hu is a world
of tigers and dragons...

159
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:53,505
full of corruption...

160
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,312
I tried sincerely to give it up...

161
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,615
but I have brought us
only trouble.

162
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,268
To repress one's feelings
only makes them stronger.

163
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,666
You're right,
but I don't know what to do.

164
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:07,931
I want to be with you...

165
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,801
just like this.

166
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,281
It gives me a sense of peace.

167
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,517
Please follow me.

168
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,634
- I want a clean room.
- We have plenty.

169
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,278
Your order?

170
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,907
Steamed whole cod,
bite-size meatballs...

171
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,465
a little starchy,
but keep the sauce light...

172
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:50,635
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables,
and some warm wine.

173
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,808
I have to order
from a bigger restaurant.

174
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,984
Hurry then.

175
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,625
That's him.

176
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:49,270
I am Iron Arm Mi.

177
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:53,435
I heard a true master has arrived.
I have come to seek a lesson.

178
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:07,671
You asked for it!

179
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:28,939
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

180
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,280
You have amazing technique!

181
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,687
I am Flying Saber.

182
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,718
Are you related
to Southern Crane?

183
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,823
Southern Duck? I don't eat
anything with two feet.

184
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,130
Who could remember
such long-winded names?

185
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,519
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe...

186
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:02,303
and you don't know
his master Southern Crane?

187
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,639
Who are you?

188
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:09,496
I'm Shining Phoenix
Mountain Gou.

189
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:12,187
Gou?

190
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,395
I hate that name.

191
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,022
It makes me puke!

192
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,158
Too bad you're named Gou.

193
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,492
You'll be the first
to feel my sword today.

194
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,158
Hold it!

195
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,606
Don’t you know Monk Jing?

196
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:49,261
A monk, in a place like this?
You need a lesson!

197
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,021
Who are you?

198
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,293
Who am I?

199
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:54,663
I am...

200
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:02,089
I am
the Invincible Sword Goddess.

201
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,483
Armed with the incredible...

202
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,075
Green Destiny.

203
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:15,239
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

204
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:18,338
Lower your head...

205
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:19,651
and ask for mercy.

206
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,932
I am the desert dragon.

207
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:39,995
I leave no trace.

208
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,209
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

209
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:56,341
Tomorrow...

210
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:59,931
I'll kick over
Wudan Mountain!

211
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,460
We politely asked for
a friendly match...

212
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,800
but she showed no respect,
and attacked us.

213
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:22,346
Everyone came by
to teach her a lesson.

214
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:24,654
Her sword was just too powerful.

215
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,029
I've traveled everywhere...

216
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:28,136
but never
met anyone so uncivilized.

217
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:32,330
She kept accusing me of being
Gou Jun Pei's brother.

218
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,343
Who is this Gou, anyway?

219
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:37,991
Her husband.

220
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:52,127
We're close
to your headquarters.

221
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,638
Go home and check in.

222
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,979
What about you?

223
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:57,348
I'll look around
and catch up later.

224
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:58,340
Not a bad idea.

225
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,276
Tonight we'll get a good night's
sleep at headquarters.

226
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,825
Mistress, you're back.

227
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:35,736
It's you!

228
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,168
How is everything here?

229
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:39,093
Fine.

230
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,850
You've been gone a while.

231
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:42,423
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

232
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,493
- Your wife was due?
- Yeah, a baby girl.

233
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:45,362
Good!

234
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,176
I'll be happy if she’s
half as strong as you.

235
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,868
Mrs. Wu...

236
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:51,857
You're back!

237
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,191
- How's the arm? Still sore?
- Much better.

238
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:57,968
You've been gone so long.

239
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,194
Li Mu Bai is coming
to stay the night.

240
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:04,207
I'll go and make up his room!

241
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,434
Sister Shu Lien...

242
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,387
Here you must be in proper attire.

243
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,894
I'm just borrowing some
clean clothes. I'm not staying.

244
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,054
I'll give them to you.

245
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:56,438
I was just passing by
and wondered how you were.

246
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,324
You, sister...

247
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,169
Look at the trouble you've caused.

248
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,989
Now you know what
Giang Hu life is really like.

249
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,773
If you think of me
as your sister...

250
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:14,356
Let me give you
some sisterly advice.

251
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,454
You can run from marriage,
but not your parents.

252
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,012
They forced me to marry!

253
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:23,888
Go back to them first.

254
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,353
Then you can decide about Lo.

255
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,112
You know about Lo?

256
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:39,497
He really loves you.

257
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:44,036
Come back to Peking with me.
We'll find a solution.

258
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:49,320
Where is he now?

259
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,399
Li Mu Bai
has made arrangements.

260
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,990
He sent him
to Wudan Mountain.

261
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:00,613
You're working together
to set me up! I'm leaving!

262
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,075
How dare you accuse us!

263
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,442
I always knew
you had stolen the sword!

264
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,972
I've done nothing
but protect you and your family.

265
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,402
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

266
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:13,466
Li Mu Bai himself spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

267
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:16,604
We wanted some peace
and you've ruined it all!

268
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,647
You're no sister of mine!

269
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,422
What do I care?

270
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:25,306
You were never a real friend anyway.

271
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:27,319
But I wonder...

272
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:29,526
how long could you last
as my enemy?

273
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:32,916
Put the sword down!

274
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:44,628
Jen!

275
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:50,256
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

276
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:03,597
Fine... the friendship is over.

277
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,607
Don't touch it!

278
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,554
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

279
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,975
Come and get it if you can.

280
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,500
Without the Green Destiny,
you are nothing.

281
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,026
Don't be a sore loser.

282
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:28,485
Go ahead. Take your pick.

283
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:30,338
I'll wait.

284
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:33,922
Go ahead.

285
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,858
Give me the sword.

286
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:30,894
Take it!

287
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:36,558
Stop it!

288
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:41,958
You don't deserve
the Green Destiny.

289
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,556
Not another lecture!

290
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,523
On guard!

291
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,596
Let's end this here.

292
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,673
Only the sword will settle this.

293
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:28,441
I only let you go because
I wanted to see the real you.

294
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,267
What do you know
about a true heart?

295
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:16,150
What do you want?

296
00:35:16,602 --> 00:35:18,740
What I've always wanted,
to teach you.

297
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:51,844
All right.

298
00:35:52,493 --> 00:35:54,980
If you can take back the sword
in three moves...

299
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,490
I'll go with you.

300
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:01,732
Give it back!

301
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,785
- Kneel!
- Never!

302
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:06,214
Then you have no use
for the sword.

303
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,366
Sooner or later
they'd drag you back to Peking.

304
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:24,363
Your parents
will never accept you again.

305
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,707
But why go home?

306
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,513
We've gone this far,
we won't stop now.

307
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,983
You'll always be my Lady.

308
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,389
At last, we'll be our own masters.

309
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:44,513
We'll be happy.
That's the most important thing.

310
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:46,946
All we have left is each other,
right?

311
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,496
Lie down and rest.

312
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,451
She's crazy.
You should have killed her.

313
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:20,406
I didn't have the heart.

314
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,310
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

315
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:33,277
Is it me
or the sword you want?

316
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,196
You've been drugged.

317
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,229
Where is Jade Fox?

318
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,131
What happened?

319
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,744
Jade Fox drugged her.

320
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,321
How did you get here?

321
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:04,828
We followed Jade Fox.

322
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,923
And so you die.

323
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,054
And so shall you!

324
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:48,778
A poisoned needle!

325
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:54,696
You deserve to die...

326
00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:58,149
but the life
I was hoping to take...

327
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:00,458
was Jen's.

328
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:04,262
Ten years I devoted to you.

329
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,079
But you deceived me!

330
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,829
You hid
the manual's true meaning.

331
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:11,906
I never improved...

332
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:16,866
but your progress was limitless!

333
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:19,581
You know what poison is?

334
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,081
An eight-year-old girl...

335
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:25,244
full of deceit.
That's poison!

336
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:30,393
Jen!

337
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,169
My only family...

338
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:37,180
my only enemy...

339
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:46,709
You can't die!

340
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,201
Tell us what poison you used!

341
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,377
You can't die!

342
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:53,619
Tell us the antidote!

343
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:56,307
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

344
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,196
She used Purple Yin...

345
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,170
Purple Yin poison.

346
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:02,862
It goes straight to the heart.

347
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:09,226
It's the same poison she used
to kill my master.

348
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:14,023
My blood
will soon reverse its flow.

349
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,684
There is no antidote.

350
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:20,773
That can't be!
Everything has an antithesis!

351
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:22,984
Why not this?

352
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:24,361
The antidote exists.

353
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:26,919
She taught it to me.

354
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:29,546
The formula is simple...

355
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,781
but it takes time to prepare.

356
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:38,442
Trust me.

357
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:41,477
As you have helped me...

358
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,397
Let me help him.

359
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:46,117
All right.

360
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:49,856
Hurry.
I will hold on as long as I can.

361
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:52,323
Take my horse
and go to the compound.

362
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:55,135
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

363
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:58,147
Spare your energy.
I'll be back!

364
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:27,984
Where is Mrs. Wu?

365
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:30,477
Stop it!

366
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,700
Shu Lien
told me to show you this.

367
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,108
Let her in.

368
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:53,161
Mu Bai, hold on.

369
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:59,207
Give me some hope.

370
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:23,869
Shu Lien...

371
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,166
Save your strength.

372
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,906
My life is departing.

373
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:35,130
I've only one breath left.

374
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:39,870
Use it to meditate.

375
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:42,846
Free yourself from this world...

376
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:45,558
as you have been taught.

377
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:47,961
Let your soul rise to eternity...

378
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:50,775
with your last breath.

379
00:45:52,412 --> 00:45:54,069
Do not waste it...

380
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,959
for me.

381
00:45:58,586 --> 00:46:00,690
I've already wasted
my whole life.

382
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:05,138
I want to tell you
with my last breath...

383
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,333
I have always loved you.

384
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:47,621
I would rather be a ghost,
drifting by your side...

385
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:50,655
as a condemned soul...

386
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:56,706
than enter heaven without you.

387
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:00,320
Because of your love...

388
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:07,225
I will never be a lonely spirit.

389
00:48:00,846 --> 00:48:02,253
He's gone?

390
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:31,388
Bo...

391
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:35,322
please take this sword
back to Sir Te.

392
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:44,062
Now you must go
to Wudan Mountain.

393
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:46,100
Lo awaits you there.

394
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:49,080
Promise me one thing.

395
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:52,276
Whatever path
you take in this life...

396
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:54,712
be true to yourself.

397
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:46,889
Do you remember the legend
of the young man?

398
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:51,666
"A faithful heart
makes wishes come true."

399
00:50:57,585 --> 00:50:59,494
Make a wish, Lo.

400
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:04,649
To be back in the desert,
together again.
