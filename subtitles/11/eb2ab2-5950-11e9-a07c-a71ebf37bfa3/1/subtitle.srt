1
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,119
Jesus.

2
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,113
Anybody out there?
I need a little help.

3
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,273
You're alive.

4
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,474
OK.

5
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,671
OK. All right!

6
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,839
You're all right.

7
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,713
OK, now.

8
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,029
You're going to live.
Can you stand? Come on.

9
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,873
Come on. Hold on to me.

10
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,348
OK...

11
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,279
OK.

12
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,035
What do you mean I'm... I'm alive?

13
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,797
You're on a boat. My boat.

14
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,638
- Why am I on your boat?
- Maybe you can tell me.

15
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,598
All right?

16
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,428
I was dead. I was sure of that.

17
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,670
No. But you're not.
You're alive now.

18
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,278
- Why? Why am I alive?
- I don't know. You were in my net.

19
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,752
- Net?
- Yeah. You were drowning.

20
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,471
You swallowed water.
You sank. Don't ask me how.

21
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,516
- Come on. Are you cold?
- Yes.

22
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,150
Come on. Hold on to me.
Get up. Get up.

23
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,433
OK.

24
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,830
Watch your step.

25
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,318
- Keep warm. You need a hospital.
- No!

26
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,389
- Why not?
- Because I'm fine.

27
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,913
You'll need to see a doctor.

28
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,116
- After a thing like that!
- No, I don't!

29
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,197
- I don't want to see anyone.
- Will I just disappear, then?

30
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,230
- I don't mind seeing you.
- You don't mind seeing me...

31
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,913
That's nice.

32
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,030
- Say again?
- Most people do.

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,555
- Well, I don't.
- Why not?

34
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,876
Because... you fished me from the water.

35
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,314
How are ya?

36
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,198
Jesus. You really
don't want people seeing you.

37
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,229
What's your name?

38
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,833
- I don't know.
- You lost your memory in the water?

39
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,036
- Maybe.
- I've heard it happens.

40
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,035
- Does it?
- People knock their head.

41
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,113
Forget the lot.
Then it all comes back suddenly, like.

42
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,235
What's your name?

43
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,870
My name's Syracuse,
but people call me Circus.

44
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,754
Why?

45
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,390
To let on, you know, that I'm a clown.

46
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,348
- A clown... in a circus?
- Something like that.

47
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,755
- I think I'll call you... Syra...
- Syracuse.

48
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,356
OK, then. I'm taking you to a hospital.
I've a car on the shore.

49
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,509
No!

50
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,919
- Are you one of those asylum seekers?
- What?

51
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,640
You swam here from Arabia?
It's a hell of a swim.

52
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,279
Let me go, then.

53
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,557
Do you really want to drown?

54
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,032
- I can't die twice.
- Well, you can die once for real.

55
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,196
Please. I don't need a hospital.

56
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,868
I know a place.
Where people won't see you.

57
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,555
Come on.

58
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,913
<i>- Whose is this place?</i>
<i>- It was me mam's.</i>

59
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,354
- She lived here?
- On and off.

60
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,149
- She was a kind of... loner.
- Loner?

61
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,835
Bit like you.
She didn't like people much.

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,149
Why?

63
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,068
She was a kind of gypsy.

64
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,029
- Where is she now?
- She's with her Maker.

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,075
- You mean she's dead?
- Yes.

66
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,073
- Like me.
- You're not dead.

67
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,837
No. But maybe I should have been.

68
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,434
Here's some sandwiches.
Well, me lunch.

69
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,353
With all the strange fishing today,
I forgot to eat it.

70
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,355
Thank you.

71
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,276
Right, can I leave you now?

72
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,119
- If you have to.
- I do, yeah. Got to be somewhere.

73
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,549
OK.

74
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,948
OK?

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,355
- She's been waiting.
- I'm sorry. Something came up.

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,988
- Appointment's for six. She gets upset.
- I'll make it up to her.

77
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,230
How's my baby? Right.

78
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,035
- Bye, Mam.
- You have to fuck it up, don't you?

79
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,236
Yeah. It's genetic.

80
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,271
Right, up you get.

81
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,514
- Anything strange or wonderful?
- Why do you always say that?

82
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,831
I don't know, Annie.
It's... a kind of a wish.

83
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,232
- A wish?
- Yeah, that something strange...

84
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,119
...or wonderful might happen.

85
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,716
No, Da, nothing strange or wonderful.

86
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,438
That's good, then.

87
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,591
- Hello.
- How are you?

88
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,994
- Is Dr Hannon around?
- No, just missed him.

89
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,075
- I thought he was gonna be here.
- Something came up. In Cork.

90
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,392
- How long this time?
- Same as usual.

91
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,950
An hour and a half or so.
Does she have a book?

92
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,516
No book. Maybe I'll tell her a story.

93
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,069
- I'll be inside if you want me.
- All right.

94
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,069
Well... go on.

95
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,312
- Go on what?
- You said you'd tell me a story.

96
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,312
OK.

97
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,717
Once upon a time...

98
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,155
Does it always have
to be "Once upon a time"?

99
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,394
Well, it's how stories begin.

100
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,876
- And a very good time it was.
- Yes... It was a good time.

101
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,476
And it was a bad time.

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,199
- How are you feeling, love?
- Never mind about me. Go on.

103
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,709
Once upon a time...
there was a fisherman.

104
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,110
And he was pulling in his nets...
and it was a normal day.

105
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,478
- And?
- And what?

106
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,757
- What was she?
- What was she?

107
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,550
- Was she a mermaid?
- No. She wasn't a mermaid.

108
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,553
- Was she a selkie, then?
- What's a selkie?

109
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,474
A kind of seal woman.
You hear them singing out on Seal Rock.

110
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,349
<i>- Who told you that?</i>
<i>- Teacher.</i>

111
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,432
She comes out of the sea.
Loses her seal coat.

112
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,512
Lives on land until
the sea calls her back.

113
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,676
Well, she didn't have a seal coat.
Whatever that is.

114
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,110
- She seemed to remember drowning.
- And?

115
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,677
- And... that's it.
- That's a real shite story.

116
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,230
Yeah, maybe.

117
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,915
Remember that thing
we ordered from the CRC?

118
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,356
- What thing?
- Wait till I show you.

119
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,197
Now...

120
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,236
You should rest as much
as possible until we sort you out.

121
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,277
- All right?
- OK.

122
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,034
- You've got juice now, Annie.
- Juice.

123
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,918
Look at this, Alex.

124
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,874
Wow.

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,237
- Doesn't do bumps.
- Did your daddy buy you that?

126
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,551
- No. The CRC.
- Well, that figures.

127
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,632
- How's the fishing, Circus?
- It's Syracuse.

128
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,917
- Syracuse, how's the fishing?
- Same. See you.

129
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,513
- When?
- Tomorrow.

130
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,750
- So, did you see the doctor?
- He wasn't there.

131
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,638
- Because you were late, you fool.
- Clown.

132
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,713
Yeah, you clown. He's been doing tests.
She needs a kidney.

133
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,996
- Something about... what's the word?
- Compatibility.

134
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,957
- You understand?
- It has to be the right fit.

135
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,510
Blood group, you flipping clown.
You were to ask him had he news.

136
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,829
Goodbye.

137
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,799
Still here?

138
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,556
- You thought I'd be gone?
- No. Thought I'd dreamed it.

139
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,075
You dreamt you fished me
from the water?

140
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,434
Something like that.

141
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,232
- So you still dreaming now?
- That's my mother's coat.

142
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,719
- Sorry. Had to wash my dress.
- Doesn't suit the dream.

143
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,749
- No?
- No. She was large, my mother.

144
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,071
- And kind of awkward.
- Awkward?

145
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,676
Yes, she was not like you.

146
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,591
- I can be awkward.
- So can most of us.

147
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,155
- You're going fishing?
- Yes.

148
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,796
- Thought I might catch another.
- Another girl like me?

149
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,589
Yes. Maybe the sea is full of them.

150
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,792
- Can I come with?
- No.

151
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,032
- Why?
- Thought you didn't want to be seen.

152
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,432
- I can hide again.
- And it's bad luck.

153
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,194
- A girl on a boat?
- For the fishing.

154
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,994
Have you been having good luck lately?

155
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,559
None.

156
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,315
OK, then. Get in.

157
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,556
What was that song you were singing?

158
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,076
- Just a song.
- But you remembered it?

159
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,038
- I must have.
- Do you remember your name?

160
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,830
- You can call me Ondine.
- That's nice.

161
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,115
- What's it mean?
- She came from the water.

162
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,353
Ondine means
"she came from the water"?

163
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,308
No. Ondine was the girl
that came from the water.

164
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,631
- When?
- Long time ago.

165
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,114
Do you want to help?
Load that pot over there.

166
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,909
Over there.

167
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,916
- They're empty.
- So they are.

168
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,833
- Did someone rob them?
- I hope not.

169
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,791
- My God.
- What?

170
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,351
- You're playing games with me.
- No, I'm not.

171
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,153
What did you just do?

172
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,596
- I... I sang.
- Yeah. I know. Come down here.

173
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,836
Sing again, would you?

174
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,074
Jesus... you bring me luck.

175
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,475
- Luck?
- Haven't had much.

176
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,350
- Everyone needs luck.
- They do. Not everyone gets it.

177
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,398
- Maybe it's your turn.
- That would be nice.

178
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,634
Right, come over here.
Help me tie their claws.

179
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,679
Right, put one in-between your legs
so he doesn't bite you.

180
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,432
And then just do
the other one like this.

181
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,759
- What do you do with them?
- What do you think?

182
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,878
- Eat them.
- No. Sell them.

183
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,677
- You always catch this much?
- No. Almost never.

184
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,713
Right. There you go.

185
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,310
Claws there. Grab that.

186
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,874
It wasn't your song, you know.
Couldn't have been.

187
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,237
- No.
- They were already in the pots.

188
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,070
- Watch yourself.
- OK.

189
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,039
Why you put them back?

190
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,955
Save them for a rainy day.
We sell the rest.

191
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,072
We'll get something for these.

192
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,390
- We?
- Your share of the catch.

193
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,994
You did sing. Just don't go
around town singing for everyone.

194
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,469
Come on into the Co-op,
we'll get ten euro a pound.

195
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,910
I don't want to meet anyone.

196
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,309
You've met me.

197
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,312
You're the only one.

198
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,109
OK.

199
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,388
- How are you, Mary?
- All right, Circus.

200
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,075
- You've done well today, then?
- Yes, for a change.

201
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,273
- And they say there's no lobster left.
- They do.

202
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,239
- Thank you very much.
- Lovely.

203
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,036
- Can I help you, Circus?
- Tracy, would this go near you?

204
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,192
- You want me to try it?
- OK.

205
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,869
It's a bit tight around here.

206
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,679
- At least you're not invisible.
- What?

207
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,592
Nothing. I'll take it.

208
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,557
- For who?
- Just for Annie.

209
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,952
- This would never fit Annie.
- It will someday.

210
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,678
- What do you think, Circus?
- I think that's not my name.

211
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,035
Sorry. Da.

212
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
- Do they give you a hard time?
- No, they're jealous.

213
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,192
How many of them have their own
set of wheels? Motorised wheels.

214
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,279
- What are we doing?
- I was going to drive you home.

215
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,635
- I'll race you.
- Annie...

216
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,792
- Yeah?
- Go on so.

217
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,231
- So, what's the story?
- Oh, she sings.

218
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,389
Who sings?

219
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,551
The woman in the story
I told you about.

220
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,790
- With the fisherman?
- Yes.

221
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,828
She sings to the
fishes and he catches them.

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,468
- You sure you're not dreaming, Da?
- Dreaming?

223
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,076
Yeah. You sure this isn't
some weird wish-fulfilment thing?

224
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,470
- Where did you learn words like that?
- I go to school.

225
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,871
- And I didn't?
- No. Let's be honest, you didn't.

226
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,554
- You move your mouth when you read.
- Is that bad?

227
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,518
No, but it means something.
So she sings, does she?

228
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,752
Yeah. A song in a
language he has never heard.

229
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,751
- That would be Selk.
- Selk?

230
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,319
A kind of seal talk.

231
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,232
- Do you know why she sings?
- Why?

232
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,277
That's the way they
communicate underwater.

233
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,830
- They don't speak, they sing.
- So the lobster hear her singing.

234
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,194
What lobster?

235
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,591
What I mean is, under the water
they hear her singing?

236
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,069
- The denizens of the deep.
- Are you sure?

237
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,277
- She's a seal. She's not human.
- She looks human.

238
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
- In the story?
- Yes, in the story.

239
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,355
- Whose story is this?
- It's mine.

240
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,080
- You're making it up?
- Yeah. For you.

241
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,755
- What're you planning for the weekend?
- Practising my new wheels.

242
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,992
Curious.

243
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,231
- Got you some things.
- Things?

244
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,868
- Messages.
- Messages?

245
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah, food and stuff. Even girls from
the water... You need to eat, right?

246
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,553
You need clothes.

247
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,838
Need to... tie their shoelaces.

248
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,670
Curiouser and curiouser.

249
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,313
- You know my size?
- Tracy in the shop.

250
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,870
She looked like... your size.

251
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,238
Thank you.

252
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,911
- Can I...
- What?

253
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,709
- Can I clean up this place?
- I suppose.

254
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,998
- How long are you staying?
- Depends, I guess.

255
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,152
- On what?
- On you.

256
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,719
On me? It depends on me,
you can stay forever.

257
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,916
- Forever?
- Forever.

258
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,990
Happily ever after.
Once upon a time.

259
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,115
I've been...
telling my daughter a story.

260
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,869
A fairytale.

261
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,638
What's the story, Da?

262
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,998
That's great. See you, Deirdre.

263
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,473
Hi, Annie.
God, you've a load of books there.

264
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,473
- I'm researching.
- Researching what?

265
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,238
Something on seals, is it?

266
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,469
My name's Syracuse,
and I'm an alcoholic.

267
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,758
I've told you before, Circus, that
confessional is not a chapter of AA.

268
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,115
Well, there's none in this town, Father.

269
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,515
I've been sober two years,
seven months and 18 days.

270
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,159
This is where they all clap, Father.

271
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,675
- Did you see that in the movies?
- Yes.

272
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,313
- Thank you.
- So, tell me.

273
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,152
I had a dream, Father.

274
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,472
I'm at his funeral and she's beside me,
and I'm panicking again.

275
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,358
Maybe you still want to be with her.

276
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,637
No, I'm panicking because
I'm back with her.

277
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,032
Can't happen. She's still drinking.
All I want is Annie.

278
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,953
Perhaps you need
to talk to someone, Circus.

279
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,830
- It's Syracuse. And I'm talking to you.
- No, I mean a counsellor.

280
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,231
I could put you both in touch
with one if you'd give me permission.

281
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,109
You have no permission.
I only talk to you because it's secret.

282
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,512
Well, whenever you feel able to,
tell me and I'll set it in motion.

283
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,633
Until then...
try to control your feelings.

284
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,430
Anything else?

285
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,872
I suppose there is.

286
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,233
- Yeah, I stole.
- Oh, dear.

287
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,829
- What did you steal, Syracuse?
- Some ladies' clothes.

288
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,073
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.
I don't like this at all, Syracuse.

289
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,913
- This is a bad development.
- It's not what you're thinking, Father.

290
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,957
- There was a reason.
- What was the reason?

291
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,192
I stole them because I was
embarrassed to be seen buying them.

292
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,158
- What did you want them for?
- They were for this girl I met, Father.

293
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,756
A girl? Where did you meet this girl?

294
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,753
I pulled her out of the water in my net.

295
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,150
- In your net?
- In my fishing net.

296
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,835
- You're joking, surely?
- No, not joking.

297
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,470
Dreaming, maybe. But sure I went back
to my boat this morning and...

298
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,039
...there she was.

299
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,988
And did she spend
the night in the boat?

300
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,475
- No.
- No?

301
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,634
- So where did this girl sleep?
- I'm not telling you.

302
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,917
- No. I can't force you to, can I?
- No.

303
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,517
- And you can't tell anyone, either.
- No, my lips are sealed.

304
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,639
But you'll keep me
informed of developments, Syracuse?

305
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,869
Definitely, Father.

306
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,109
- So, will I see you at mass on Sunday?
- You know you won't, Father.

307
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,748
I suppose I do.
You only avail of the confessional...

308
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,832
Because there's no AA chapter
in this poxy town.

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,958
You wouldn't say a couple of Hail Marys
on your way out, would you?

310
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,752
- What are you reading, Annie?
- For school. Selkies.

311
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,229
Selkies? They're a Scottish thing.

312
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,436
This one isn't.

313
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,274
Curiouser and curiouser.

314
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,909
What's that?

315
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,674
What Alice said to the White Rabbit.

316
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,198
- Come again?
- Curiouser...

317
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,509
...and...

318
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,270
...curiouser.
- See. I knew you were real.

319
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,992
- I was real?
- Yes. I knew it wasn't a story.

320
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,356
- What wasn't a story?
- The fisherman. The girl in the net.

321
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,630
My da told me a story about you.

322
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,311
- Your dad is Syracuse?
- Yeah, the fisherman.

323
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,790
So, do you have magic powers?

324
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,269
- Do you?
- You know I don't.

325
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,238
OK. You don't.

326
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,432
- Can you make me better?
- Better?

327
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,718
I'm sick. I've got kidney failure.
Didn't he tell you?

328
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,755
- What's your name?
- It's Annie.

329
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,388
Annie.

330
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,354
- I'm Ondine.
- Ondine.

331
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,354
I'm examining you for webs.

332
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,759
Well, do I disappoint you?

333
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,789
Ondine is French, isn't it?
What's a French selkie doing here?

334
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,112
- Who said I was French?
- You got lost, did you?

335
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,675
Yes. I suppose I did get lost.

336
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,149
- You cold?
- Suddenly.

337
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,673
Because you're on land now.

338
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,149
Your natural habitat
is in the water, you see.

339
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,434
- You seem to know a lot about me.
- Yes. I've been reading...

340
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,718
...researching.
- Want to come inside?

341
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,077
If I walk across the threshold,
you might put a hex on me.

342
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,677
- What's a hex?
- It's bad news, a hex.

343
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,670
Maybe underwater feels better.

344
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,150
- Better than what?
- Some days I'm sick all the time.

345
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,311
Does it feel better underwater?

346
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,435
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- Oh, come on.

347
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,592
Let's not try and fool each other.
We both know the truth.

348
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,718
And if we're not straightforward,
there's no point in being friends.

349
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,672
So we're to be friends, then?

350
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,550
We could be.
If we play our cards right.

351
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,597
So I need you to be specific.

352
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,437
Does it feel better in that
home of yours under the waves?

353
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
Well, it... definitely feels different.

354
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,559
And I know you don't
talk down there. You sing.

355
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,356
Yes. Singing travels better underwater.

356
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,279
- And what about the cold?
- Get used to it.

357
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,989
Oh, of course, you have
your seal coat, don't you?

358
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,709
My seal coat?

359
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,110
Look, there's no point
in beating round the bush.

360
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,352
I do know these things.
I've been studying them.

361
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,995
So... tell me about my seal coat.

362
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,116
You lose it when you
get out of the water.

363
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,475
And you can't go back in
until you find it again.

364
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,077
And if you do find it and bury it
on land, you can stay for seven years,

365
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,310
and you cry seven tears.

366
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,313
But then when the crying is done,
your kind of folk

367
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,950
can often find unexpected
happiness with a...

368
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,157
- What's it called?
- Are you lost for words?

369
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,311
A landsman, that's what.

370
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,917
Selkie women often find
unexpected happiness with a landsman.

371
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,469
And that's all I know.

372
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,308
This is my granny's place.
He misses her.

373
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,949
And where do you live?

374
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,351
With me ma, and it's not
underneath the waves.

375
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,670
She'll be wondering where I am.

376
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,593
See you again.

377
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,871
Your cheek is wet.

378
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,077
- Is that one of the seven tears?
- Maybe.

379
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,390
You've only six left.

380
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,398
- Can I help you there, Circus?
- Yeah. Have you any books on selkies?

381
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,711
We do. But, strangely enough,
they're all out at the moment.

382
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,269
- Out?
- Your daughter has them.

383
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,079
- Annie?
- She's doing a project, she said.

384
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,028
Yeah. Just trying to help her
get ahead of the game.

385
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,792
Good man.

386
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,718
- Does it do stunts, Annie?
- What do you mean, stunts?

387
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,393
Stunts like this.

388
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,269
I don't think it's a
recreational vehicle.

389
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,829
- So it's only for spaz?
- You don't say "spaz".

390
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,355
You say "special needs".
Don't you, Annie?

391
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,795
- Yeah.
- See, you feckin' retard. Say it.

392
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,635
- Special needs.
- Special needs, Annie. Give us a go?

393
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,990
- Does it float?
- I don't think it's amphibious.

394
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,435
Special needs, my arse.

395
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,908
Come on, guys.

396
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,989
- Is mam up yet?
- No.

397
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,998
- Was there something up?
- Why do you think?

398
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,038
- Is it battery trouble?
- It got wet.

399
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,834
Come here. I don't bite.

400
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,560
Come on. Jesus, you're getting big.

401
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,829
You said you had
selkies in Scotland.

402
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,436
Aye. We invented selkies.

403
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,716
In the Outer Hebrides.

404
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,431
- You mean you made them up?
- No. No, they're a Scottish thing.

405
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,554
There you go.

406
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,316
- She doesn't speak like you.
- Who?

407
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,559
Oh, we've got secrets,
have we, little girl?

408
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,916
- Well, you could say thanks.
- Thanks.

409
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,873
You're welcome.

410
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,791
- Do you want to come again?
- Fishing?

411
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,473
Only if you want, like.

412
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,636
You promise I'll see nobody but you?

413
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,314
I promise you'll see nobody but me.

414
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,913
You're swimming in my dress?

415
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,476
It was a gift... from a fisherman.

416
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,159
- Can I help?
- You can man the tiller.

417
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,636
Right. Straight out to sea.

418
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,072
Keep her steady, would you?
Fisheries Board.

419
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,313
You can't really guide
a boat with your foot.

420
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,439
- I'm not doing well?
- No, I never said that.

421
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,039
Oh, shit.

422
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,199
Would you look at that?

423
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,631
- My God.
- What?

424
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,314
That's weird. Salmon.

425
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,314
- Weird?
- You don't get salmon trawling.

426
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,790
- Trawling.
- Only with a gill net.

427
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,831
- Curiouser and curiouser.
- Where did you hear that?

428
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,471
- Alice said it.
- To the White Rabbit.

429
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,312
- Annie says it, too.
- Annie?

430
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,469
My daughter.

431
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,358
Jesus Christ.

432
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,434
- What?
- They're going to come on board.

433
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,998
Lads.

434
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,830
- See you caught salmon.
- I did.

435
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,388
- How did you catch them?
- Trawling.

436
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,711
- And you expect us to believe that?
- No, but it's true.

437
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,189
- Show us your gill nets.
- In the hold.

438
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,512
- That's not wet.
- I know.

439
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,389
- So how did you dry it?
- I didn't. Told you, I didn't use it.

440
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,751
- There's a girl here, Circus.
- Where?

441
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,913
In your net.

442
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,713
- Is that illegal?
- No, but... it's unusual.

443
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,194
- And you can see her?
- She's right here in front of me.

444
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,998
Ask her how I caught the salmon.

445
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,673
How did he catch them?

446
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,908
Trawling.

447
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,435
And you want us
to believe in fairytales?

448
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,159
Yes.

449
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,790
- What did she say?
- She said yes.

450
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,511
Well, then, you'd better believe her.
Right. Close it up, lads.

451
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,673
So, they saw you.
Is that all right?

452
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,149
- No.
- That's a relief in a way.

453
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,709
- Means you're not in my mind.
- Means they'll talk.

454
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,313
Course they will.

455
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,273
- What will they say?
- Take your pick.

456
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,796
Circus. Clowns. Salmon. A girl.

457
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,160
I'm going to the harbour.
Do you want me to drop you off?

458
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,995
- It's done, isn't it?
- What's done?

459
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,553
I've been seen.

460
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,115
Here, take a look at
the girl coming in on that boat.

461
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,508
She's not bad, is she?

462
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,795
It is a small town. Everyone stares.

463
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,272
You can say that again.

464
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,396
What's wrong with being seen?

465
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,357
Nothing. When you look good.

466
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,398
You look mighty.

467
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,556
I'm going to have to
declare these, Circus.

468
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,948
- They've already seen them.
- Who?

469
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,269
The Fisheries.

470
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,954
They're fine, believe me.

471
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,109
Thanks, Mary.

472
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,918
Can I buy you a present?

473
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,519
Clothes. But can I choose this time?

474
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,592
- You don't like the dress?
- No, I like it, just...

475
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,797
...underwear could be better.
- Didn't fit?

476
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,510
- Tight around the edges.
- You have edges?

477
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,915
- I knew it wasn't a story.
- What wasn't a story?

478
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,196
You're such a shite storyteller anyway.

479
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,876
- I knew it had to be true.
- Ondine, this is my daughter, Annie.

480
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,873
- We've met before.
- Yes, we have.

481
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,112
- What are we doing?
- Buying clothes.

482
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,713
OK.

483
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,158
This town is what you'd call
sartorially challenged.

484
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,548
What does that mean?

485
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,676
A supermodel's nightmare.

486
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,356
Do selkies do lingerie?

487
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,754
Why not?

488
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,595
They wear seaweed knickers
and a scallopy bra.

489
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,230
But that's underwater.
Won't do here.

490
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,078
I'm not suggesting she
buy them all, Da. Just a selection.

491
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,593
That's where I found her...
Roan Carraig.

492
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,116
- You know what it means?
- Seal Rock.

493
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,636
It's a kind of sanctuary for her kind.

494
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,158
- Her kind?
- Yeah. The well-dressed kind.

495
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,999
What do you think?

496
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,991
Or should we say
what do they think?

497
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,552
You cleaned the place.

498
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,552
Like Snow White.

499
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,796
- Is that all right?
- But I'm not a dwarf, you know.

500
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,155
I'm little, but I'm not a dwarf.

501
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,559
- Who is Snow White?
- Doesn't matter. She didn't swim.

502
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,669
- Can you swim, Annie?
- No.

503
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,400
There's no pool in the town,
and I've never had lessons.

504
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,516
I think it could relax you a lot.

505
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,318
Unless you have a fear of water.

506
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,514
I wouldn't have a fear of water
with a water creature around me.

507
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,510
OK, then. Come on.

508
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,833
What will I wear?

509
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,955
Underwear.

510
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,836
- She's gone already.
- Where?

511
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,632
The caravan at Poulin. Is that
where she sleeps, your water baby?

512
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,752
Thought I might
take her out for the day.

513
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,435
- The regatta starts at three.
- Oh, the three of you.

514
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,160
Go diving for pearls?

515
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,838
Something like that.

516
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,237
What kind of stories are you spinning?

517
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,671
Just relax.

518
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,111
OK. Lie down now.

519
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,998
I'll hold you.

520
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,953
Easy. You see?
You're a sea creature.

521
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,873
- You think?
- I know.

522
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,635
Relax. Relax.

523
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,917
OK, let's go on the raft. OK?

524
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,470
- What's that?
- Just something I found.

525
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,757
- You found your seal coat.
- Maybe.

526
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,196
- Are you going to bury it?
- Would you like me to bury it?

527
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,828
Yes, because it means
you'll be here for seven years.

528
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,788
- Would you like that?
- I would like that a lot.

529
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,115
- We had better bury it then.
- Absolutely.

530
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,508
OK.

531
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,919
Help me.

532
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,799
Will I remember where it is?
In seven years' time?

533
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,439
Watch this.

534
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,799
Seventeen steps.

535
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,469
And it's our secret.
We tell nobody.

536
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,715
You know, Da, if she buries her seal
coat she stays seven years on land?

537
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,314
- Annie...
- It's true.

538
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,270
- With a... what's it called again?
- A landsman.

539
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,431
Unless her selkie husband
claims her back.

540
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,275
- I don't have a husband.
- Maybe you don't remember, but you do.

541
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,715
All selkies do.

542
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,478
- Go on! Go on!
- Oh, you bastard!

543
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,189
These are magic, man, I'm telling you.
Here. Have a chip.

544
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,956
And the thing last is, Da,
she can make a wish come true.

545
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,759
- Please, Annie.
- If you're a selk you can.

546
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,195
But I'm not a selk.

547
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,674
OK. You're not a selk.

548
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,313
- Come on, lads, pull harder!
- Come on, lads!

549
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,833
So you're not a selk. Prove it!

550
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,353
What?

551
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,713
Annie! Annie!

552
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,791
Annie! Annie?

553
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,471
Annie? Annie?

554
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,039
Annie?

555
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,314
Annie?

556
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,829
Annie!

557
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,518
Jesus Christ...

558
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,396
Annie! Come here to me.

559
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,358
Come here, baby.
I got you, I got you.

560
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,669
I got you.

561
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,513
Jesus Christ. What happened?

562
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,511
- The brakes went.
- What?

563
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,558
- The brakes went.
- Let me see you.

564
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,358
- Come here!
- And I was lucky, wasn't I?

565
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,353
- Lucky, how?
- That she breathes underwater.

566
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,669
Jesus.

567
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,993
- What happened?
- She fell in the water chasing a duck.

568
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,832
- Come here.
- The brakes went, Ma.

569
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,073
- By the pier. She saved me.
- Your water baby?

570
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,869
Clown. Come on. We'll get you
upstairs and into a bath, quick.

571
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,790
The brakes, they didn't go, did they?

572
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,988
- No. She did that herself.
- Why? Why did she do it herself?

573
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,312
To test me, maybe?
See how much I'd do for her.

574
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,470
Strange... Feels like home.

575
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,395
Who is this woman, Annie?

576
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,996
She's from the Orkney Islands.
She swam round the coast to here.

577
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,229
What if she was?

578
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,392
I imagine she'd be a wee bit wet
around the scratcher, though?

579
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,439
- Bit cold round the old thigh region.
- Stop him, Ma. Close the door.

580
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,909
Your clown of a fisherman
would not notice, would he?

581
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,877
Close the door, Ma.

582
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,073
Did he declare her
to the Fisheries Board?

583
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,310
How much would you do for her?

584
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,189
- You testing me, too?
- I'm sorry.

585
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,229
So why do they call you
Circus the clown?

586
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,273
Because I was one for years. I drank.

587
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,552
- What made you stop?
- Annie.

588
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,234
I came back from a week
on the trawlers and...

589
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,518
...found her unconscious.
Her mother out on the piss.

590
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,432
I thought one of us better be sober.
Then she kicked me out.

591
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,797
- You couldn't take Annie with you?
- This is Ireland.

592
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,593
Men like me don't get custody.

593
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,751
- Someone was looking for her.
- Who?

594
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,069
- A man.
- A dark-haired man?

595
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,275
- Yeah.
- You didn't tell him.

596
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,634
- What's her name?
- Ondine.

597
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,950
That's not what he called her.

598
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,031
- Men like you?
- Fishermen.

599
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,193
Are you dry?

600
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,875
Didn't Annie tell you?

601
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,918
When a selk makes
love to a fisherman, she...

602
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,116
...she weeps...

603
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,070
...salt tears.

604
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,230
You said you died. In the water.

605
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,949
How many lives do you have?

606
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,829
For you? I can't count.

607
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,958
<i>My name's Syracuse</i>
<i>and I'm an alcoholic.</i>

608
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,999
<i>And you've been sober for</i>
<i>two years, seven months and...</i>

609
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,151
<i>Twenty-one days.</i>

610
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,357
<i>- Doing very well, Syracuse.</i>
<i>- It's about the girl, Father.</i>

611
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,479
<i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>The one you... met... out fishing.</i>

612
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,475
- I drew her up in a net, Father.
- She looked pretty real to me, Circus.

613
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,315
- Syracuse.
- Sorry. Syracuse.

614
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,353
So, what about her?
You've sinned with her, I suppose?

615
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,032
Of course.

616
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,158
And I don't suppose
you want absolution?

617
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,515
- No.
- No.

618
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,196
So, why are you here, Syracuse?

619
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,909
You know the story about
the king who had a secret,

620
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,278
and it drove him mad
so he told it to the tree?

621
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,273
OK, so... pretend I'm a tree.

622
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,229
She brings me luck...
and I don't know why.

623
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,594
I'm afraid, Father...

624
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,716
...because...

625
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,597
...I'm beginning to hope.

626
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,396
We should never lose hope, Syracuse.

627
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,869
She was drowned, Father,
my net brought her back to life.

628
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,110
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know.

629
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,555
None of it makes sense,
that's why I'm afraid.

630
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,508
I know something's going
to happen, something wonderful.

631
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,955
Or terrible.

632
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,630
It's just the kind of girl she is.

633
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,880
It's just the kind of person she is.

634
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,309
And that's my secret.

635
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,031
So what kind of tree are you, Father?

636
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,349
I suppose I'm an oak.

637
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,758
You look more like one of the ones

638
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,514
- they make hurley sticks out of.
- Oh, an ash, yeah.

639
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,875
As long as you're a tree.

640
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,636
Hey. You Syracuse?

641
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,518
- Yeah.
- Syracuse the fisherman?

642
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,148
- What's it to you?
- You got a light?

643
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,758
The girl on the boat.
What do you call her?

644
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,636
My mascot.

645
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,876
- You were upset last night.
- Not so much.

646
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,033
- Your mam said you were.
- Well, she imagines things.

647
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,352
- Do you imagine things, Da?
- I leave that to you.

648
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,318
It's because
I've too much time on my own.

649
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,632
My blood going from here to there.
I try to imagine a happy ending.

650
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,157
It's hard.
Some days it's hard.

651
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:51,993
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, God. In town for the regatta.

652
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,037
- The regatta?
- Yeah.

653
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,115
There's bands playing. Late night
opening. Mam told me, I forgot.

654
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,510
- Have you got a key?
- Yeah, but I left it inside.

655
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,671
- Annie.
- Come on.

656
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,956
- Where does she drink these days?
- Skippers.

657
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,599
Skippers?

658
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,832
Hello?

659
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,194
Hello?

660
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,759
- Done it, Ma.
- Oh, you good thing, you.

661
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,916
Careful.
They don't serve knackers here.

662
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,469
Just give us the keys, Maura.
I'll take her home.

663
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,232
She'll be fine.
A bar never hurt anyone.

664
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,960
- Please, Maura.
- You've cleared a few in your time.

665
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,237
- She's coming to my place.
- She's not. Go back to your caravan.

666
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,709
Home to your mermaid, Circus, huh?

667
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,314
You know, he's got himself
a water baby?

668
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,631
- Annie?
- I'll be fine. You just go, Da.

669
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,230
- Two shots, aye?
- Two shots, is it?

670
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,392
That's it. Middle pocket, right?

671
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,120
Right middle pocket.

672
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,919
- Oh, pish.
- Two shots to me.

673
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,679
Ondine!

674
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,478
Ondine!

675
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,031
Ondine!

676
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,437
Don't I get seven years?

677
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,428
- Remember the bit about selkie men?
- The husband?

678
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,034
Well, he's here.

679
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,954
- And he's taking her back?
- Yes.

680
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,270
So I'll see you at home then, huh?

681
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,474
Hey.

682
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,437
A guy was breathalysed
in one of those in Glasgow.

683
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,752
No, seriously.
No, he was six times over the limit.

684
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,195
What if I take the footpath?

685
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,353
Look, you're still in charge
of your flipping vehicle, right?

686
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,112
I'll go slowly.

687
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,310
- Tell him to piss off.
- I wish I could.

688
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,472
- Wish, then.
- I can't.

689
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,349
- You can grant a wish.
- You sure?

690
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,435
- Annie says so.
- OK.

691
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,636
I wish she wasn't sick.

692
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,031
So do I.

693
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,312
And I wish you'd stay.

694
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,317
- That's two wishes.
- One for you. And one for me.

695
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,712
Have you got your lights on, hen?
The cops will get you if you don't.

696
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,875
Maybe it's all a lie.

697
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,354
Maybe you walked into the sea
to get away from a bad marriage.

698
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,559
- Would you believe that?
- I did it once.

699
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,792
- What happened?
- I got wet. Got sense. Got sober.

700
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,309
- That's not the story, though.
- Well, what is, then?

701
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,990
Like Annie says, I'm a selk.

702
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,435
Something's up.

703
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,514
A crash.

704
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,036
No. No...

705
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,516
No! Annie. Get out... out of me way!

706
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,709
- Annie. Annie. Annie!
- Syracuse. Syracuse!

707
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,553
She's OK, she's OK.
She's in good hands.

708
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,031
Jesus Christ!
Tell me what happened to her.

709
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,998
She's been a terrible accident,
but Annie is all right, you hear me?

710
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,388
Annie is fine.

711
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,350
- You wore your seat-belt, love.
- What happened?

712
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,158
I don't know yet.

713
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,754
- She's all right... Father?
- Please God, she will be.

714
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,832
We're going to move her to
another room. Want to follow me?

715
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,188
Is something wrong?

716
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,552
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I don't know.

717
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,637
- What's happening?
- The doctor will explain.

718
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,756
Syracuse, can we talk in private?

719
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,832
- What's going on?
- Alex had a donor card.

720
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,629
- What?
- We have a tissue match.

721
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,677
Strangest thing, but it's happened.

722
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,912
- Are you serious?
- Come on.

723
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,634
Retractor.

724
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,989
So why are you here?

725
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,959
- You speak their language now.
- It's softer than ours.

726
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,794
- I wish you were dead.
- None of us are that lucky.

727
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:14,194
So... the sea spat you out, did it?

728
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,793
It can swallow me again.

729
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,189
We don't belong here, do we?

730
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,558
- So? Go home.
- I can't.

731
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,349
- Police want to talk to me.
- About what?

732
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,910
She came from nowhere. Drunk.

733
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,073
- They should talk to her, not me.
- Tell them that.

734
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,357
I will. And then you'll tell me.

735
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,953
Nothing.

736
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,112
Hey.

737
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,392
Where's mam?

738
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,678
She's asleep. She can't see
you right now, but she will later.

739
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,799
- Where's Ondine?
- Ondine's close by.

740
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,353
You'll see her, too.
Just rest. Just rest.

741
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,317
He had a wife and
three children in Scotland.

742
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,277
Where are they now?

743
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,476
They said we were welcome to him.

744
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,398
I'm sorry it happened like this.

745
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,195
- Sure I can't take it in.
- I know. It's hard.

746
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,632
Why aren't you blaming me?

747
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,109
Because, for once,
you had nothing to do with it.

748
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,319
- Why do I feel as if I did?
- Because you're Circus.

749
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,516
You get everything wrong.

750
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,838
I met him on this ferry.

751
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:19,310
- Where was I?
- Where you always were. At sea.

752
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,915
Take Annie home, when she's stronger,
till I get out of this thing.

753
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,355
- I can't cope.
- OK.

754
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,318
- It's what you always wanted, isn't it?
- Yes.

755
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,597
So... you've got it.

756
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,796
But I don't want that woman there.

757
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,676
And take me to his wake now.

758
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,796
- I can't.
- Oh, I insist.

759
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,070
- Two whiskies and ice.
- One.

760
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,674
- Two.
- Maura, I don't...

761
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,558
Show some respect.
It's his funeral.

762
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,159
- Get rid of her, Circus.
- Who?

763
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,916
Your water baby.
She brings good luck, then bad.

764
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,549
Two more, Maggie.

765
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,793
You all right?

766
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,959
Finders keepers.

767
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,632
Why are you looking
at me like that?

768
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,920
Because you're a selkie...
and I'm an alcoholic.

769
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:50,108
- A peaceful night's sleep, had you?
- No.

770
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:57,030
- He's still out there somewhere.
- OK. I'm taking you home.

771
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,029
Hey!

772
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,154
That bit about the husband...

773
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,517
- He's not my husband.
- What is he, then?

774
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,468
- My <i>pushta.</i>
- What's that? Selkie for squeeze?

775
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,432
Look. You're home.
You'll be safe there.

776
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,434
- You can sing your song.
- Who will I sing it to?

777
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,639
To me. Go on, sing.
Make the seals dance.

778
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,869
- I can't.
- Why not?

779
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,395
- Because you're drunk.
- I'll be sober in the morning.

780
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,278
You can sing to me then.

781
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,513
I fished round here for years.
Never knew this selkie stuff.

782
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,148
Maybe you were dead.
And I fished you back to life!

783
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,753
Yes!

784
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,195
And now you're gonna haunt me?

785
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,271
Forever! Come here.

786
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:59,198
What does "haunt" mean?
What does "haunt" mean?

787
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,472
You want some?

788
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,395
Selkies don't drink?

789
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,714
So... you're safe here.
Is that right?

790
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,389
- How's Annie?
- She's fine.

791
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,838
She's safe, too.

792
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,318
I got another bottle on the boat.

793
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,313
Syracuse.

794
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,516
What does "haunt" mean?

795
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,798
It means what you're doing... to me.

796
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,914
You wouldn't.

797
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,114
Syracuse! Syracuse!

798
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,913
Don't!

799
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,197
- What are you doing?
- I know it's not how fairy tales end.

800
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,158
But this one does.
This one does because it has to.

801
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,754
What do you mean?
What do you mean?!

802
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,392
I mean your kind and my kind.
We don't belong together.

803
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,915
- I have to say goodbye...
- Go away.

804
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,438
...to Annie.

805
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,999
Syracuse.

806
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,231
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, I'm your buddy, am I?

807
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,949
Yeah. You are.

808
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,317
You're my sobriety buddy.

809
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,790
Where were you last night?
I needed you.

810
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,748
- You fell off the wagon.
- Big time.

811
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,430
Circus of fools.

812
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,990
I was twirling around that big top.

813
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,028
I'm back in the sawdust now.

814
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,436
And it tastes like shite.

815
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,629
Do you know
what my problem is, buddy?

816
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,598
You can't take good luck.

817
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,711
Ten out of ten, Sherlock.

818
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:44,479
Misery is easy, Syracuse.
Happiness you have to work at.

819
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,556
Why didn't the tree say that?

820
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,871
Sure, the tree's
not gonna tell you anything.

821
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,479
- What about the girl?
- She's gone.

822
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,632
- And Annie?
- She's getting out today.

823
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,792
I'm taking her home with me.

824
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,919
After that, there's no excuses,
is there, buddy?

825
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,999
No.

826
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,239
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not.

827
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,277
Yes, you are. I can tell.

828
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,590
Maybe because you're
back on the road again.

829
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,309
- You're home.
- Where's Ondine?

830
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,040
Ondine had to go away for a while.

831
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,510
- That's why you're crying.
- It's not, I swear.

832
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,956
- Did her husband come?
- He must have.

833
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,556
Because she's gone.
On sea business.

834
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,435
- But she'll be back, you know.
- Do you think?

835
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,794
I know.

836
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,633
- She left something here.
- What?

837
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,157
<i>The eldest of two children,</i>
<i>a younger brother, Robert...</i>

838
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,678
- What time is it?
- Half-one.

839
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,355
- Why didn't you wake me?
- Because you were sleeping like a baby.

840
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,829
- I thought you were the baby.
- Doesn't look like it.

841
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,717
- Do you want breakfast?
- Lunch.

842
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,719
There you are, baby.

843
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,875
- Annie, that song.
- What song?

844
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,234
Just a minute ago.

845
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,956
- It's real.
- Course it's real.

846
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,553
It's Sigur Rós.

847
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,270
Annie, I have to go out for a bit.

848
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,476
- I'll take you to your mam's.
- No.

849
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,995
- I can't leave you on your own.
- Yes, you can.

850
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,993
- Don't you get it? I'm better.
- Are you sure?

851
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,157
You got some unfinished sea business?

852
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,359
- I suppose.
- Go on, then.

853
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,192
I'm kind of busy here anyway.

854
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,148
Hey!

855
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,318
Hey!

856
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,558
There were seals down there.

857
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,429
Basking on the rock. My kind, huh?

858
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,196
- I didn't say that.
- No, but you thought it.

859
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,797
Then the storm came up.

860
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,918
They slipped into the water, one by one.

861
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,548
I was going to join them.

862
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,870
What changed your mind?

863
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,912
What changed yours?

864
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:33,036
She was switching channels on the TV,
and your song came on.

865
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,475
Was never my song.

866
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,555
- So tell me.
- No.

867
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,757
- No. Take me home.
- Where is home?

868
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,673
Where do you think?

869
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,878
- You'll tell me the truth now.
- The truth?

870
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,235
The truth is I'm a creature
from the sea that found her seal coat

871
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,789
and buried it because
she found a family she liked.

872
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,953
- Please.
- That's...

873
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,475
That's one truth.
You don't want to know the other.

874
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,074
Try me.

875
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,232
OK.

876
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,558
I am a prisoner and
a drug mule from Romania.

877
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,711
I said the real truth.

878
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,636
This is the real truth.

879
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,879
I was on a boat with
a kilo of heroin in a backpack.

880
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,110
Coast Guard came,
Vladic made me swim for it.

881
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,558
- Vladic?
- My selkie husband.

882
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,754
My <i>pushta.</i>

883
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,988
<i>He was like a monster, from a fairytale.</i>

884
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:16,996
<i>But he couldn't swim,</i>
<i>so he made me take to the water.</i>

885
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,798
<i>I was always a good swimmer,</i>
<i>but your Irish waves wore me down.</i>

886
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,480
<i>I swam till I could swim no more.</i>

887
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,433
<i>Then I floated.</i>

888
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,673
<i>Then I sank.</i>

889
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,275
<i>It was almost a relief.</i>

890
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:48,997
<i>I said, "Here goes... I die".</i>

891
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,108
<i>And that's the truth.</i>

892
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,550
You brought me back to life.

893
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,432
I found a caravan, a family.

894
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,159
Now it's gone, OK?

895
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,799
Caravan's going nowhere.

896
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,556
What's your real name?

897
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,712
- It's Joanna.
- Joanna.

898
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,672
Just tell her you were away
on sea business.

899
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,671
Sea business?

900
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,596
- Annie?
- I told them nothing.

901
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,228
- Told who?
- Not true, little girl.

902
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,552
You told us about
seven tears and the selkie island.

903
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,711
And how Ondine came out of the water.

904
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,871
But nothing important, I swear.

905
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:16,319
Seven tears are important, surely?
And the selkie island.

906
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,992
Still some details
I'd like to get more clear.

907
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,559
Do you want to eat some?

908
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,994
- Da!
- Are you OK?

909
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,795
- Who the heck are you?
- Circus the clown.

910
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,111
We've got seals, selkies, clowns...
Someone start making sense!

911
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,749
- Is she the swimmer?
- Yes, I swim like a fish.

912
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,354
- Is she the one that lost it?
- I'll get it back. Put that thing down.

913
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,556
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

914
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,756
- He wants her seal coat.
- What's she on about?

915
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,797
- Yes, I want her seal coat.
- Don't give it to them.

916
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,110
- We have to.
- Means you'll go.

917
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,548
- We don't know that.
- I know it!

918
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,755
- Tell her!
- Tell her what?

919
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,353
That you don't care about me.

920
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,914
- I don't care about her!
- All you want is the coat.

921
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,515
- What's he saying?
- It's not important. Listen to me!

922
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,752
Let them go. Put that thing away!
I'll show you where.

923
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,638
- Where?
- I'll show you where.

924
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,553
- It's OK...
- Give her to me. Come here.

925
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,678
Here, Annie.
Come here, come here.

926
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,079
What? What?

927
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,199
Here, it was here, I swear. I swear.

928
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,038
Stop it! Stop it.

929
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,878
- Listen to me. Listen to me...
- Look at me, little girl.

930
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:48,477
- Don't make me bite.
- Did you move it, Annie?

931
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,712
...he digs it up and then she doesn't
stay for seven years...

932
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,348
Tell them where you moved it
before they hurt somebody, OK?

933
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,669
I don't want you to go.

934
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,954
If you tell me where you moved it,
I promise I stay.

935
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,951
- How long?
- As long as you want.

936
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,271
I'll find a job on a fishing boat,
anything. Just tell me.

937
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,479
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart and hope to die.

938
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,429
- The lobster pot.
- The lobster pot?

939
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,558
- What lobster pot?
- The one for storage.

940
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,948
- OK, show us.
- Out there.

941
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,189
Show us, baby.

942
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,714
Give it here...

943
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,155
It's full of water.

944
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,595
- He's not a selkie, is he?
- No, he isn't.

945
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,151
- You still are.
- It was vacuum packed.

946
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,195
Always.

947
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,558
Help! I can't swim. Help!

948
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,874
Keep that gun on him.

949
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,997
- So he couldn't breathe underwater?
- No, he couldn't.

950
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:35,154
- Does that mean he drowned?
- Don't you worry about it, love.

951
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,314
- That's it, lads. Over this way now.
- All right.

952
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,359
All right, let's go.

953
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,155
<i>- Is this not an AA meeting?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

954
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:08,990
<i>Thing is, Father, she's</i>
<i>in front of the judge next week.</i>

955
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,199
<i>- And?</i>
<i>- And she's a non-national.</i>

956
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,078
<i>And?</i>

957
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,516
<i>And this is the confessional,</i>
<i>Father, we're not talking gossip here.</i>

958
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,829
<i>I'm still an oak.</i>

959
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,991
<i>I thought you were a</i>
<i>what-do-you-call-it...</i>

960
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,912
<i>- An ash.</i>
<i>- An ash.</i>

961
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:28,039
<i>Well, her solicitor said</i>
<i>she'll get deported</i>

962
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,191
<i>if she doesn't become a national.</i>

963
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:33,909
So she has to apply
to the Department of Justice.

964
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,758
Or... she gets... married.

965
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,878
So, who's going to marry her, Syracuse?

966
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,079
Well... it's not like
there's a queue, Father.

967
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,800
- Well, I can't marry her.
- No. You're a tree.

968
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,552
Exactly.

969
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,236
<i>And I threw the</i>
<i>selkie coat in the water.</i>

970
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,439
<i>I told a lie about that, too.</i>
<i>Wasn't a real lie, was it?</i>

971
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,556
<i>Because I wanted her to stay forever.</i>

972
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,199
<i>She's staying forever?</i>

973
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,998
Yeah. Haven't you heard?

974
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,232
They're getting married
next week to make her a national.

975
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,439
So I suppose she isn't a selkie, really.

976
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,670
Because you can't marry a seal,
can you?

977
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,798
No. You definitely cannot.

978
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,428
Not in the real quotidian world anyway.

979
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,909
- Quotidian?
- Yeah.

980
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,469
Means the one we have to live in.

981
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,314
If she was a seal, though,
would you still do the wedding?

982
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,549
Me?

983
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,119
What about your past lives?

984
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,795
- Are you sure I have them?
- Yeah, everybody does.

985
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,076
It's just a matter of remembering.

986
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,357
- Stop peeping, would you?
- I don't peep.

987
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,717
I mean, you could have even
been married in one of them...
