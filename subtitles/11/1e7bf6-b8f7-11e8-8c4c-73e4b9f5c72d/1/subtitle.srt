1
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,160
Cicerone.

2
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,660
Cicerone.

3
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,040
Where are you?

4
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,510
Cicerone.

5
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,840
Cicerone.

6
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,790
The name, "Cicerone", did your father give him that name?

7
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,670
Cicerone named himself that.

8
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,300
I see.

9
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,300
It's a very fancy name.

10
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,010
I found you.

11
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,530
This time, it's Sachi's turn.

12
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,990
Not yet.

13
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,700
Not yet.

14
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,540
I'm ready.

15
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,700
Come here.

16
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,740
Cicerone.

17
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,120
Come here, Cicerone.

18
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,020
Sachi?

19
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,060
Sachi?

20
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,850
Satchan.

21
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,360
Satchan. Satchan. Satchan. Satchan. Satchan. Satchan. Satchan.

22
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,390
Left and right engine outputs nominal.

23
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,060
Pressure level normal.

24
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,600
Heart rate increasing.

25
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,230
Perspiration increasing.

26
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,600
Brain waves, no abnormalities.

27
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,900
At the time, due to a request from a certain magazine,

28
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,530
I was writing an article on Zach Hugh.

29
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,530
The brutal race, which sends countless racers to their deaths,

30
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,200
Death Circus.

31
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,660
As its champion, Zach Hugh was the man who reigned on its throne for nearly ten years.

32
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,380
His magnificent, death-defying control of his machine

33
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,590
drove the audience wild.

34
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,130
Zach the Grim Reaper.

35
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,590
The Immortal Man.

36
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,680
He was given many names.

37
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,430
However...

38
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,020
Contact spacing, unstable.

39
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,900
Heart rate, perspiration, still increasing.

40
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,150
Ocular response declining.

41
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,450
At that point, the repeated strain of the brutal race

42
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,990
had already destroyed his mind and body.

43
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,380
He's reached his limits.

44
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,760
He can't take the shock from the machine any longer.

45
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,790
It's not possible to continue any longer.
Have him forfeit.

46
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,420
Chief, he's not slowing down.

47
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,800
What?!

48
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,810
This is unbelievable...

49
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,640
Chief!

50
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,770
Look!

51
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,450
After crossing the goal, his machine continued to accelerate even more.

52
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,530
He continued to run.

53
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,510
Zach Hugh.

54
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,800
He was a great champion.

55
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,690
But, his death is still shrouded in mystery.

56
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,420
You know that five days ago a coup occurred in the Aloana Republic?

57
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,170
Yes.

58
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm sure you're also aware that in the country's Piraru River region's jungle

59
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,930
our company's 444th construction project is progressing?

60
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,850
Yes.

61
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,810
This project is a strategic step for us to achieve a foothold in the resource rich Aloana Republic.

62
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,110
But, three days ago, Aloana's new government sent us

63
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,440
a unilateral decision to cancel the construction contract.

64
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,990
Do you understand?

65
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,990
I see.

66
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,820
No, you don't see!

67
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,330
It's been cancelled! Cancelled!

68
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,250
That construction project's been cancelled!

69
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,360
Mister, you just ran a light.

70
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,120
According to the notice

71
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,410
we must cease the construction immediately and, in addition

72
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,710
get this, the deferred payment for the breach of contract is going to be made over twenty years.

73
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,340
Twenty years?!

74
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,760
It is true that #444 is quite a difficult construction.

75
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,050
The designated area is a swampland sandwiched by higher ground.

76
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,970
When the rainy season comes, the whole area turns into a river.

77
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,940
And when the water recedes, next comes the vegetation.

78
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:55,570
It grows like a monster and turns the place back into a jungle in less than six months.

79
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,940
It's an unreal place!

80
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,240
Ah, I see.

81
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,280
Construction #444 began with the appropriation of an enormous budget.

82
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,540
Currently, it's still proceeding to expend an enormous budget.

83
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,210
Before the losses spread any further, we must cease operations immediately

84
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,130
and pull our assets out.

85
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,210
Then you should instruct the site...

86
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,670
We sent the cancellation order out to the site manager...

87
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,840
Well, then...

88
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,090
The day we sent the cancellation order

89
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,180
he disappeared and we haven't had any communication since.

90
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,470
He's missing?

91
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,010
Because of the way the construction site is,

92
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,020
we depend solely on robots for the labour force.

93
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,150
The only human being there was the man who was the site manager.

94
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,480
Then...

95
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Even as we speak, those damn puppet robots

96
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,990
are taking expensive materials and chucking them into the mud.

97
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,870
Finding the missing previous foreman and halting

98
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,660
the 444th construction project immediately

99
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,330
is the reason why you are being dispatched.

100
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,960
We're counting on you, Sugioka.

101
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes, Sir.

102
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,810
What is that?

103
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,320
Would you be the foreman, sir?

104
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,580
This place is unbelievable.

105
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,840
Please state your name and employee number.

106
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,470
Oh! Ah! Hey! What are you doing?!

107
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,470
Well then, mister, call us when you're done with your work here!

108
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,350
We'll be by to pick you up!

109
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Uh, you're going already?!

110
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,890
Hey, wait a...

111
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,440
Mister, be careful!

112
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,230
Wait! Wait!

113
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,020
Hey! You!

114
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,820
What are they in a hurry for?

115
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,570
If they've broken the camera or something I'm going to have them replace it.

116
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,950
They've got to be kidding.

117
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,790
Who knows what people lacking culture think.

118
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,330
I agree.

119
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,800
I require confirmation of name and employee number.

120
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,380
Yeah, what was the name of the previous foreman that disappeared?

121
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,640
Do you know where he went?

122
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,220
If you do not state your name and your employee number

123
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,690
it means that you are not the recognised as the proper foreman.

124
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,520
If you are not recognised as the proper foreman, then you will be

125
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,740
considered unrelated to the construction...

126
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,530
Anyway, show me to the dormitory.

127
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,530
You can give me the details there.

128
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,580
or possibly someone who intends to
interfere with the construction efforts

129
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,620
and will be repelled and...

130
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,920
Tsutomu Sugioka.

131
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,710
Employee number CX88.

132
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,090
Confirmation... completed.

133
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,770
Welcome, for having come from so far Mr. Foreman.

134
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,600
Yeah, nice to meet you.

135
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,940
I am #1 of 444...

136
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,990
...is how it is done.

137
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,700
Orders regarding construction #444 are all transmitted from myself

138
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,990
to other robots in charge.

139
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,580
Oh, good grief.

140
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,910
They're working at it so hard.

141
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,460
All the foreman's orders must go through me as well.

142
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,670
If we do not use this system, the chain of command will be thrown into chaos.

143
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,140
Well, I want you to use that system and convey to all the robots the new foreman's orders.

144
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,100
It has been decided that this construction is to be cancelled.

145
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,480
Cease work immediately and...

146
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,230
Hey! Wait a second!

147
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm not done with my orders yet!

148
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,440
Hey!

149
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,770
Hey! Hey!

150
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,440
You!

151
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,030
What's the meaning of this!

152
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,320
Hey!

153
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,780
Mr. Foreman must be exhausted by the long journey,

154
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,410
so I will take my leave for today.

155
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,950
Why do you need to lock the door! You!

156
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,540
<i>This area is rife with harmful insects and this is for your safety.</i>

157
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,750
In any case, open this door!

158
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,920
Hey!

159
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,550
You!

160
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,010
Do you understand me!

161
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,010
<i>Furthermore, tomorrow, your schedule</i>

162
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,010
Come back!

163
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,010
<i>is on the wall schedule chart.</i>

164
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,010
Hey!

165
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,720
Don't you understand I'm telling you to come back!

166
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,350
Open this!

167
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,680
Shit!

168
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,480
Don't you understand!

169
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,820
Open it!

170
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,900
Hey!

171
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,340
Breakfast will be until 30 minutes past the hour.

172
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:13,220
At 45 minutes past the hour until 10:25 will be an inspection tour of the first site.

173
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,260
At 10:30, in the reference room...

174
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,360
See, it is right over there where the construction

175
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,990
is delayed the most; the 8th district.

176
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,310
Hey! What's wrong with that robot?

177
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,770
It's overheated.

178
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,770
The work is very harsh so his circuits must have given out.

179
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,060
Ridiculous!

180
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,400
How much do you think that single robot costs?!

181
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,320
It's more expensive than an airliner!

182
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:00,660
The work is experiencing delays so I am having the robots work at full capacity.

183
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,290
My job is to ensure that the construction is completed by the date it's due.

184
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,330
Some sacrifices are unavoidable.

185
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,340
There is no due date anymore!

186
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,130
More importantly, we have to minimise the losses...

187
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,590
The due date is in one month.

188
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:24,470
The work is suffering delays so I am having the robots work at full capacity...

189
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,350
What? What's wrong with you?

190
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,350
Oh, are you angry?

191
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,900
Next, we will inspect district 10.

192
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,950
This way, Mr. Foreman.

193
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,080
W... Wait just a moment, please.

194
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,340
Breakfast will be until 30 minutes past the hour.

195
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,890
At 45 minutes past the hour until 10:25 will be an inspection tour of the first site.

196
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:09,020
At 10:30, in the reference room, please examine the previous

197
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,480
month's construction reports and paperwork.

198
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,020
What's this?

199
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
At 12:30...

200
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,950
It is about time for the inspection tour, Mr. Foreman.

201
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,500
Hey! Wait!

202
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,380
I can't take this any more!

203
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,010
Make a fool of a human!

204
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,260
Even though I'm normally quiet...

205
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,390
The rainy season is approaching so beginning today

206
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,940
the robots' workload has been increased.

207
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,440
Who made that order?!

208
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,110
There has been a slight increase in the loss of robots,

209
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,240
but the rate of construction has increased.

210
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,200
Please be delighted.

211
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,540
A slight increase in the loss of...

212
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,750
How many?!

213
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,870
Today, there have been twenty units.

214
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,210
Tomorrow, there are twenty-four units scheduled.

215
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,670
We can't just let you trash those robots like that!

216
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,050
Listen carefully, you puppet robot!

217
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,970
Get this! This construction has been issued a cancellation order!

218
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,560
Cease immediately! Do you understand?!

219
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,440
I judge that statement as an intent to interfere with the current construction.

220
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,780
Any statements made by you from here on will have no effect.

221
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,320
Shut up! I told you to stop!
Stop, you stupid robot!

222
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,830
That which interferes with the progress of the construction must be removed.

223
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,330
Removed?

224
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,310
Beginning today for an indefinite term

225
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:58,150
the Foreman's inspection tours of the sites will be cancelled.

226
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,850
This is madness.

227
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,180
Good morning.

228
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,770
I have brought you your meal.

229
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,320
Yes!

230
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,460
Even if you destroy me, the construction will progress.

231
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:29,590
We must complete it before the deadline no matter...

232
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,380
what... progress...

233
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,760
Damn it!

234
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,600
Bastard!

235
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,160
No good!

236
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,530
The puppet robots are still working.

237
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,160
As I thought.

238
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,040
This one's just a terminal.

239
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,500
I need to destroy the system core or the robots won't stop working.

240
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,130
If I follow this cable...

241
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,810
Emergency communique! An emergency communique from corporate headquarters!

242
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:27,400
Early dawn today, there was a second coup in the new government

243
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,110
of the Aloana Republic and power has been restored to the former government.

244
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,280
Earlier, there was a press conference by the former government

245
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,410
to announce the resumption of the 444th construction contract.

246
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,280
Damn it!

247
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,410
Damn it!

248
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,200
I repeat.

249
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,530
It has been decided that the 444th construction project will continue.

250
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,910
Damn it!

251
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,950
Tsutomu Sugioka!

252
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,080
It's me!

253
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,460
Section chief, Maruyama!

254
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Hey!

255
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,460
Tsutomu Sugioka!

256
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,960
It's me!

257
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,460
Respond!

258
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,170
Hey!

259
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,920
Hey! Sugioka!

260
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,310
Welcome.

261
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:08,050
Labyrinth Story

262
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,890
Labyrinth * Labyrinthos

263
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,120
Neko-machi Alley

264
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,510
"Here, come in, you two... "

265
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,920
The Running Man

266
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,710
Construction Cancellation Order

267
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,310
Safety First

268
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:55,820
Please help me! I'm going to be killed! That robot is insane!
To my wife, Sachiko. I'm not going to make it. I love you!
I wanted to do it one more time.
Tooru, listen to your mother. Study hard and become an upstanding human being.
O...
