      He deals drugs, Mai.      

134
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,308
  Heroin, cocaine. That's       
  where the money comes from.   

135
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,578
    That's how he can afford    
    to pay you to fuck him.     

136
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,019
 Oh, great. I'll get the crab.  
 He'll have the spicy chicken.  

137
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:15,892
 And May here will have a salad 
 with the dressing on the side. 

138
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,361
           It's Mai.            

139
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,201
           I'm sorry.           

140
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:29,105
  I apologize for my behavior.  

141
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:34,677
      It's just that            
      I'm a little upset.       

142
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,647
   I have lost my first son.    

143
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,188
      I'm sorry for that.       

144
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,256
           Thank you.           

145

It's good to know someone cares.

'Cause I swear to God, sometimes
I think Julian hated Billy.     
Maybe "hate" is the wrong word. 

147
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:01,704
      But you were always       
      jealous of him.

Competitive.                    

149
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:12,015
  And what with Billy           
  being the older brother       
  and having a bigger cock...   

150
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,785
   Julian's was never small,    
   but Billy's was...           

151
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,755
      Oh, it was enormous.      

152
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,426
 How can you compete with that? 

153
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:33,670
      Billy was everything      
      Julian wanted to be.      

154
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,942

     have found your killer
