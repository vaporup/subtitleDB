1
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,667
Where do you want to begin?

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,940
Dustpan...

3
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,041
Spoon...

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,361
Noodles...

5
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,401
Bear...

6
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,087
Frying pan...

7
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,568
Fire. Apollo Ape. "Marry Me."

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,442
Where did it all begin?

9
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,020
Okay, it started three days ago.

10
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,407
Ln the town of Liman, West Virginia.

11
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,010
It's where I lived
with my girlfriend, Phoebe.

12
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,650
She is the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,008
I honestly cannot even remember
my life before her.

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,020
We were the perfect fucked-up couple.

15
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,363
She was perfect, and I was the fuck-up.

16
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
And we were really, really happy.

17
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,001
And I wanted to make it forever,
so I saved up for the perfect ring.

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,443
And I planned the perfect romantic trip
to surprise her.

19
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,180
And then I fucked that up, too.

20
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,180
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 1204,

21
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,740
departing for Oahu, Hawaii.

22
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,260
I repeat, this is the final
boarding call for Flight 1204,

23
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,124
departing for Oahu, Hawaii.

24
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,460
Now boarding all rows and all zones.

25
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,040
All passengers should be
onboard at this time.

26
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,620
God damn it, Mike, come on.

27
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,485
All passengers please proceed
to the gate.

28
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,650
I really am sorry, Phoebe.

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,060
I really thought I could
beat the panic attacks this time.

30
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,241
It's okay.

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,540
- It's not.
- No, it's fine.

32
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,165
No, it's not fine.

33
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,820
This is something
I really wanted to do for you.

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,526
Then I ruined it
and now we're going back home.

35
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,500
- You didn't ruin this.
- Yes, I did. It's my fault.

36
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,820
You should be mad at me...

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,331
- No.
- Why not?

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,851
- You can't help it, Mike...
- Okay. Thanks.

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,846
Shit.

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,081
Jesus.

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,700
Are you holding?

42
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,580
No, of course not.
We were going on a plane.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,727
Why would I...

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
You holding?

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,801
Yeah.

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,646
Sorry.

47
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,885
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,260
- Hi, Mike.
- Hey.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,806
Heard you two were going on vacation.

50
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,050
Hawaii.

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,286
Get another one of your
little episodes there, Mike?

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,767
You know, Phoebe.

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,940
I once had to drive your boy home

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,220
'cause he was having one of them
panic attacks up on the freeway,

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,580
trying to leave town.

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,300
Is there a reason
that you pulled us over?

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,131
Hey, easy on the tone, Miss Larson.

58
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,620
I'd hate to have to search this car.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,340
It's getting to the point
where your boyfriend

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,126
should start leaving a toothbrush
at the overnight down at the station.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,740
Ain't that right, Mike?

62
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,444
That's right, Sheriff Watts.

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,321
Well, just wanted to
welcome you back to town.

64
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,167
I'll get the bags.

65
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,641
Hey, Phoebe, do you want an omelet?

66
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,402
This could be the right moment.

67
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
Hey, Mikey?

68
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,004
Is this okay? I think this...

69
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,740
- What the fuck!
- Phoebe, no, I'm sorry.

70
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,460
Did you burn your hand?

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,260
Just let me do the cooking, okay?

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,840
- I will. Sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

73
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,641
Okay.

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,241
Apollo Ape...

75
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,801
I got you.

76
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,885
No, what do you think you're doing?

77
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,460
Hey, honey, no,
I just wanted to tell you

78
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,580
I had, like, a really
funny idea for Apollo Ape.

79
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,727
That's cool, what is it?

80
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,081
How the fuck am I supposed to read this?

81
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,369
Hey. Hello there.

82
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,125
You're here late, Lasseter.

83
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,900
You're not my assistant anymore, Petey.
What are you doing down here?

84
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,540
I know, I just miss ya.

85
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,780
Come on, you're not at the big desk
anymore, you can let a few things slide.

86
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,530
Enough, Agent Douglas.

87
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,409
Okay, I'm leaving.
Do you need anything before I...

88
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,460
Lasseter.

89
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,860
The Ultra Program Tough guy is active.

90
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,020
Wiseman asset Howell is the target.

91
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,700
- What?
- He'll be eliminated within 24 hours.

92
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,140
This is American soil,
they can't do that.

93
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,540
We promised to protect him.
Who is it? Yates?

94
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,420
The operation is in progress.

95
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,180
You're being informed as a courtesy.

96
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,300
- Who is this?
- Do not interfere.

97
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,561
Have a nice evening.

98
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,764
So Apollo Ape and Chip
the Brick are, like,

99
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,460
"Hey, what the heck happened?" You know?

100
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,980
And then they find out that Spicy Tomato
was in charge of the resistance.

101
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,940
Okay, but what they didn't find out,

102
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,521
which they'll find out in the next book,
is that Fido Astro is also in on it.

103
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,140
No. Dude.

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,500
I know.

105
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,460
I feel so betrayed.

106
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,820
Do you get it? It's because he's man's
best friend, not monkey's best friend.

107
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,060
Of course. I mean, in hindsight
it makes total sense to me.

108
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,764
- It's just that...
- He's a dog.

109
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,140
You should write it down,
I'm telling you.

110
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,460
I don't know, I mean,
I really just like thinking about it

111
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,289
and like talking about it.

112
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,100
Apollo Ape and his adventures.

113
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,361
No, I love when you talk about it.

114
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,330
I think other people would love it, too.

115
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,965
Like, even...

116
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,205
Like, they might love to read it
if you wrote it down, seriously.

117
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,723
Do something really real with it.

118
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,643
You know what skives me out, Pheebs?

119
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,820
What?

120
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,925
That car down there has moved so much.

121
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,329
Like it was built in a factory,
you know, on a production line.

122
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,340
And then it was
like shipped, like, here.

123
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,340
And like, then this guy
drove it all over the place.

124
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,930
Yeah, exactly.

125
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,740
But all that time, like for years,

126
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,700
or really for, like, decades really,

127
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,802
this one tree has been
sitting in this one place

128
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,925
not doing anything until tonight,
when it, like, stopped the car.

129
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,571
- Yeah?
- Okay, so this car is always going.

130
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,100
And that tree is always just,
like, stopping. You know?

131
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,740
Like, it's just been
stopping there for years

132
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,460
until tonight when it met something
that it didn't want to keep going,

133
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,882
and it was just like,
"No. You're stopping, too."

134
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,968
And then this tree that has
never done anything, is fucking, like...

135
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,740
Like, destroying this beautiful...

136
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,491
Like, really beautiful
and fast-moving thing.

137
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,340
Why? Why are you crying?

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,044
Because, Phoebe, like...

139
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,365
Am I that tree?

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,081
No.

141
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,300
No.

142
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,780
I think I'm that tree. And I think...

143
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,121
I think you're the car.
And I think I'm stopping you.

144
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,927
- You are not the tree.
- Okay.

145
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,965
I love you.

146
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,924
Phoebe, I really am sorry about Hawaii.

147
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,242
It's okay, honestly.

148
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,763
I totally over-reacted.
I was really upset.

149
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,524
It's not going to be
like this always, you know.

150
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,204
Mike, you're like...

151
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,448
...the strongest, kindest person
I've ever met in my whole life.

152
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,006
I fucking love you.

153
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,886
- You're a fucking mess, man.
- I know.

154
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,767
- Yates!
- For Christ's sake.

155
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,180
Yes, Victoria?

156
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,930
I need to speak with you right now.

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,700
Okay, I guess we were
pretty much done here.

158
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,165
Thanks, guys.

159
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,646
Stop avoiding me.

160
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,380
I've got word that Tough guy
is moving in on my old Wiseman asset.

161
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,980
What is Tough guy?

162
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,889
- And where did you hear that?
- Is it true?

163
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,806
It doesn't concern you. Okay?

164
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,980
Wiseman was my baby.

165
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,420
Yeah, and it's still-born.
So, what are you crying about?

166
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,966
So you're coming after
my still-born baby?

167
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,887
Let's finish this in my office.

168
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't understand
why you're so upset here.

169
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,260
Aren't you the one
who shut down the program?

170
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,180
Yeah, because it was a flawed model.

171
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,860
Because we were hurting people.

172
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,500
I didn't expect your yuppie ass
to come riding in on a vulture

173
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,931
and pick at the bones of my operation.

174
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,220
I was made supervisor fair and square.

175
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,900
You were made a temporary supervisor
because you kissed the right asses.

176
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,420
Because I'm the right man for the job.

177
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,409
According to who? Daffy Duck?

178
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,607
Daffy Duck...

179
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,300
I guess I'm doing something right because
I've had the job for about two years.

180
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,481
Yeah, it should have been two months.

181
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,780
You're supposed to protect these assets.
Not kill them!

182
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,660
Victoria, we're clearing the portfolio.

183
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,100
- What?
- Mike Howell keeps trying to leave town.

184
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,565
He needs to be eliminated.

185
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,780
You're going to kill him
for trying to leave town?

186
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,620
That's a security breach.
I'm just doing my job.

187
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,700
He's a human being.

188
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,020
- They're assets.
- He's an American citizen.

189
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,340
They're government property.

190
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,820
Are you actually fucking insane?

191
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,260
Language.

192
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,780
Listen to me, King Idiot!

193
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,860
If you think I'm just going
to sit back...

194
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,540
No, you listen to me,
you snipey overbearing bitch!

195
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,802
Howell dies today!

196
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah. And you can't do shit.
What are you going to do?

197
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,726
You going to go over me?

198
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,002
You're my fucking dog here, okay?

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,570
Sit. Stay. Behave.

200
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,490
Now get the fuck
out of my fucking office!

201
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,250
Mike, what's happening?

202
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,081
Nothing. Just something.
I have to go to work.

203
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,324
Isn't it early?

204
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,980
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,560
But they needed me to do a thing.

206
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,201
What thing?

207
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,246
Groceries.

208
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,801
I love you.

209
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,260
- Rose.
- What's up?

210
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,540
- How's it goin', man?
- How you doin', baby?

211
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,801
What's up!

212
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,524
I really appreciate
you doing this for me, man.

213
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,540
Come on, man. Come on, baby,
you know I got you, right?

214
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,580
- Okay.
- I got you.

215
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,700
You're my nigga-nigga-noga.

216
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,140
- You know that shit, right?
- All right. Yeah.

217
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,605
All right, right.
Now go open up your trunk.

218
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,689
- Okay, all right.
- It's all cool.

219
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,609
Casual like, no big D.

220
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,680
Stay chill.

221
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,001
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.

222
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,571
All right.

223
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,740
Yo', this is more illegal than the shit
you usually get, know what I mean?

224
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,300
- Yeah.
- Feel me?

225
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,140
This is some fucking
powerful fireworks, man.

226
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,900
This gonna light up
the sky for ya bitch.

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,161
Rose.

228
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,841
Phoebe is going to love this.

229
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,006
This is perfect, Rose,
this is so perfect. Man.

230
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm tellin' ya, this is some serious

231
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,860
life changing shit you're doin'.

232
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,500
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- That's the plan.

233
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,780
- Yo' you're a sensitive nigga, bitch.
- Well, I love her.

234
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,609
You got to give it all when
you love like that, you know?

235
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,529
Yeah, exactly. Comes once a life, right?

236
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,130
Serious. Yeah, yeah.

237
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,940
- All right, thanks, man.

238
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,100
- Yeah.
- Where you goin'?

239
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Gotta drop those off
and I gotta go to work.

240
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,260
Wanna drop some acid
and go inside the titty bar?

241
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,409
Nah, that's okay.
It's 8:15 in the morning, Rose.

242
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,340
- Thank you, Nancy.
- Thank you, Mike.

243
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,441
Bye.

244
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,060
Chariot Progressive. Listen.

245
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,060
Mandelbrot set is in motion.

246
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,607
Echo Choir has been breached,
we are fielding the ball.

247
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,930
Is that a lyric from something?

248
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,446
Fuck.

249
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,460
No. Chariot Progressive. Listen.

250
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,660
Okay.

251
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,300
- Mandelbrot set is in motion.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,289
Ma'am, are you going to get something?

253
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,500
Chariot Progressive, Mike.

254
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,980
Lady, could you please,
like, stop it with...

255
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,380
Chariot Progressive.

256
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,180
- Are you okay?
- Listen.

257
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,487
Mandelbrot set is in motion.

258
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,170
Echo Choir has been breached.

259
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,540
We are fielding the ball.

260
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,780
Chariot Progressive.
Chariot Progressive.

261
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,405
Listen, Mike. You're not listening...

262
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,780
Listen. Chariot Progressive!

263
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,166
Chariot Progressive.

264
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,481
Chariot Progressive is in motion.

265
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,931
Motion...

266
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,500
Mike. Please listen to me.

267
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,780
All right, lady,
enough with that stuff, okay?

268
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,900
You're in danger.
You have to listen to me.

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,490
I've got to close up soon. So...

270
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,406
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,331
- It's okay.
- About all of this.

272
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,124
I'm sorry, Mike. I tried.

273
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,161
It's cool.

274
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,845
Do you want your soup?

275
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,049
Hey, stop doing shit to my car.

276
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,340
- Hey, babes, what's up?
- Hey.

277
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,620
I just killed two people...

278
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,820
Two... Two gentlemen.

279
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,206
That's awesome. Why?

280
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,660
No, these two guys were trying to, like,
break into my car at work,

281
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,860
and they had guns and knives
and they were being, like, total dicks

282
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,260
and they just attacked me.

283
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,380
Shit, babe, you got mugged?

284
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,220
Then I took, like,
a spoon and I just like...

285
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,810
I, like, shoved it through this guy.

286
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,140
- Did you call the police?
- No, I didn't call the police.

287
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,900
'Cause I'm the killer...
I'm the murderer, okay?

288
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,260
I also have, like...

289
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,100
I have, like, a lot of weed
and mushrooms in my car.

290
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,611
I just killed two dudes
in a parking lot, okay,

291
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,820
and, Phoebe,
if you don't come here right now,

292
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm just gonna start
like pissing in my pants.

293
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,565
I swear to God, Phoebe,
I'm just gonna start, like, pissing.

294
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,123
How did this happen?

295
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,809
How the fuck did this happen?

296
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,780
I shot those guys in the head.

297
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,100
And that guy, I, like,
I spooned him in the neck

298
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,248
and his shit just, like, ended.

299
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,660
You just killed two guys?

300
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,380
They were trying to,
like, stab me, Phoebe.

301
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,324
- Why are people trying to stab you?
- I don't know!

302
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,060
I don't know, but I am...

303
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,980
I am, like, freaking out
all over the place.

304
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,401
Babe, I have, like,
a lot of anxiety about this.

305
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,340
Get your hands in the air.

306
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,220
Fuck me! Yup.

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,540
God, it's Mike.

308
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,608
- I'm sorry!
- Drop it.

309
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,220
What do you mean, two casualties?

310
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,900
We lost two assets attempting to neutralize
Wiseman-designate Howell.

311
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,140
How is that possible?

312
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,321
He was armed with a spoon, sir.

313
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,460
A fucking spoon? What?

314
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,211
We're not sure yet,
the exact nature of the confrontation...

315
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,500
He's been fucking activated!
Do you not see that?

316
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,220
- Yes, sir.
- This is Lasseter.

317
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,180
She's in the town.
Lock it down and find her.

318
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,420
Shut down the bridge,
nobody gets in or out!

319
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,580
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Where's asset Howell now?

320
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,700
He's been arrested, sir.

321
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,260
Perfect. Okay, we go in.
We take him out.

322
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,340
He's trapped in one place.
You cannot possibly fuck this up.

323
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,601
Yes, sir.

324
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,970
Employ assets Crane and Laugher.

325
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,580
Okay, so just lead me
through this one more time.

326
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,260
Just so I'm clear. Just so...

327
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,600
No, no, no.

328
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,860
- I hit him with a spoon...
- Yeah.

329
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,530
...and his lungs exploded.

330
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,380
- It wasn't his lungs.
- No, that's what happened.

331
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,482
'Cause he couldn't breathe,
'cause I got him in the neck.

332
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,860
Your lungs aren't in your neck,
they're in your chest.

333
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,460
I know that, Phoebe.

334
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,100
No, I don't know that. No, I do.

335
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,820
Phoebe. It doesn't even
make any sense to me.

336
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,300
Okay. Okay.
So you said something about a lady.

337
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,980
- Yeah.
- What did she say to you?

338
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,684
Okay, so she said...

339
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,446
I don't know what she said.
Like, some bullshit. Like...

340
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,300
I don't know what she said.

341
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,420
- Babe. We're in jail.
- Yeah?

342
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,980
So maybe just try and remember
and focus and put it together.

343
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,820
- Okay, I will.
- What did the lady say?

344
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,967
Okay.

345
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
She said...

346
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,300
Mandelbrot set is in motion.
Echo Choir has been breached.

347
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,845
We are fielding the ball.

348
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,921
- Mike, what the fuck does that mean?
- I don't know.

349
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,366
Phoebe, I don't know
but I remember it like it just happened.

350
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,686
I remember every single thing that happened
to me in the last 94 minutes.

351
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,180
Ninety-four minutes?
How did I even get that number, Phoebe?

352
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,681
I remember literally every single thing
that happened, I can picture it.

353
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,860
- Mike, listen.
- Okay.

354
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,564
Just slow down.

355
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,166
Yeah, Mike.

356
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
You slow way down.

357
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,500
How many times have you been
in this station, Mike?

358
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,090
Since you were 22?

359
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,460
Your probation officer must be
the Michael Jordan of bullshitters.

360
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,690
Because I've never seen you gone
more than couple of hours?

361
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,727
Mike.

362
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,649
Tell me you didn't kill these people.

363
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,700
They attacked him.

364
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,900
- He was defending himself.
- Yeah.

365
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,287
- Excuse me?
- What was he supposed to do?

366
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,780
You're his girlfriend. You're his mom.

367
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
You're his maid. You're his landlady.

368
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,526
- Now you're his lawyer?
- It was just a thing.

369
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,844
It was just a thing that happened.

370
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,841
Mike...

371
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,160
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to?

372
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,180
Two men are dead, Mike.

373
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,725
There's no walking away this time.

374
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,203
- What the hell is that?
- What's going on?

375
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,489
Shit, lock it down!

376
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,361
Hey, we've got a problem.

377
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,900
Why is the power out?

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,606
Hell, Phoebe, I don't know.
Just keep moving.

379
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,885
Hold on. Hold on.

380
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,362
- All right, just...
- Mike, I really don't want to go in there.

381
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,007
Mike... There we go. Just hold on.

382
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,460
All the lines
out of the station are down.

383
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,580
Radio, Internet, the phone...

384
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,170
Who the fuck is that?

385
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,007
Mike!

386
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,321
Mike, grab his gun!

387
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
Move! Move! Move!

388
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,008
Get down! Down! Stay down!

389
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,003
No, no, get out. Phoebe, get out!

390
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,326
Phoebe, the gun.

391
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,641
Just go!

392
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,361
Get out of here!

393
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,521
Come on!

394
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,561
Wait!

395
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,820
- Hi, darlin'.
- Why is Liman on lockdown?

396
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,380
Why are there men in Hazmat suits
walking around like extra-terrestrials?

397
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,820
What the fuck are you doing?

398
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,700
A dog with rabies got loose.
A real old bitch.

399
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,041
- You're all class, Adrian.
- You activated Howell.

400
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,540
Now two of my Tough guy assets are dead.

401
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,660
I know what you're doing here.
Don't fuck with my operation!

402
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,220
Your operation is murder.

403
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,060
This is the last time
that you and I speak.

404
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,380
I'm taking you down, Yates.
You understand me?

405
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,140
That's pretty big talk
for a middle-aged woman with a...

406
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,460
What? A cell phone?

407
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,324
You can't touch me. Okay...

408
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,380
You can't even...
Did you just hang up on me?

409
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,245
Please tell me
you did not just hang up on me.

410
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,860
Yo, Phoebe, where are we going?

411
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,820
We are leaving,
we are getting the fuck out of town.

412
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,287
No, I can't leave town, you know that.

413
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,820
Well, you didn't have people
try to kill you before,

414
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,161
I was thinking maybe
that could motivate us here.

415
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,566
Okay, fine. So where do you want to go?

416
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,580
- Fuck!
- All right, listen, listen.

417
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,460
We'll take my car
and we'll go to Rose's house, okay?

418
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,005
- What?
- What?

419
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,420
You want to get high right now, Mike?

420
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,931
No, I don't want to get... No.

421
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,500
Rose has like guns and shit, okay.

422
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,082
He can help us hide out
and I'm still in handcuff.

423
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,180
Okay, you are not in any position
to be making the plan right now.

424
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,420
Really? Well, who is, all right?

425
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,460
- The cops are all dead.
- The guy in the thing,

426
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,884
in the cell thing, doesn't see the gun,
you don't point at it and go, "Gun..."

427
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,860
Okay. No, no. I recognize that now
as, like, a faux pas. I'm sorry.

428
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,460
Like, and if someone who's trying
to kill you, goes, "Wait..."

429
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,620
You don't go,
"What do you want to talk about?"

430
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,300
Okay, you're right. Sorry. I'm sorry.

431
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,740
Please just don't yell at me, okay?

432
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,780
- No. I'm just starting to freak out.
- No. I know you are.

433
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,087
I just think that maybe we need to
figure out what the fuck we're doing...

434
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,100
Come here. You're fine.
I'm fine. All right?

435
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,060
We made it out of there. Okay?

436
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,460
And nothing else
is going to happen, I promise.

437
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,925
Let's just get in my car...

438
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,241
Fuck!

439
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,766
So that's what those guys were doing?

440
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,927
That would have hurt.

441
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,965
Okay,

442
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,371
let's take my car.

443
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,161
Hello?

444
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,969
I'm in Liman. I activated Howell.

445
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,722
What?

446
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,340
Yates' Tough guy assets are in town.

447
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,180
I'm here trying to save asset Howell
and derail this operation.

448
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,420
But something's not right.

449
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,020
I'm standing in front
of the sheriff station which is on fire.

450
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,180
I don't understand...

451
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,487
Why would you...
I should not be talking...

452
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,700
Listen to me. I need a weapon.

453
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,540
- Oh, my God.
- There's an empty field.

454
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,380
I'm going to send you
coordinates for the drop.

455
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,860
And I need to know where the fuck

456
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,500
Yates is pulling the subjects
for this operation.

457
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,460
If they're trained assets, they should
be doing this quickly and quietly

458
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,860
This behavior makes no sense.

459
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,220
Okay, I'm sorry.
I gotta hang up. I can't...

460
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,700
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

461
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,820
He's boxing me into this town.

462
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,649
He's going to trap me like a rat
and he's going to kill me.

463
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,483
Please, Petey, I really need you.

464
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,970
Okay, here we go.

465
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,841
Hey.

466
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,451
Hey, you seem, like, spooky quiet.

467
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,010
I am spooky quiet.

468
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,820
I'm like...

469
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,287
I think I'm in the anaphylactic shock.

470
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,420
That's not what that's called.

471
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,900
Like, I'm trying to think
of stuff, you know...

472
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,660
Phoebe, I can't remember anything.

473
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,205
Like I never even...

474
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,607
I can't even remember
where I went to school.

475
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,370
- Maybe don't think about it.
- Did I go to school?

476
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,527
Did we even talk about my parents?

477
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,820
We walk from here.
Is that what's happening now?

478
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,160
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

479
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,330
- Shit.
- What?

480
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,204
What if I'm like... Like a robot?

481
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,780
No. No...

482
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,882
With gigabytes of memory recall,

483
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,721
and, like, karate programming
where I use objects to kill people.

484
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,560
Mike, you're not a robot.

485
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,460
With advanced biological engineering.

486
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,820
Maybe I am.

487
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,410
- Mike.
- Yeah?

488
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,891
- You are not a robot.
- Yeah, but how do you know?

489
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,500
I have the weirdest thoughts
in my head right now.

490
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,540
I know. I know, babe.

491
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,642
Do you know what a M1 Abrams is?

492
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,460
It's a type of tank.

493
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,660
I could list like 50 types
of tanks right now.

494
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,330
When did I learn about tanks?

495
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,180
I didn't.

496
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,500
I know nothing about tanks
or guns or bombs,

497
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,220
but I suddenly know, like,
everything about tanks and guns and...

498
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,765
Freeze, motherfucker!

499
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,180
- Shit, Mike! It's you?
- Rose. Rose.

500
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,300
What the fuck you doing here, man?

501
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,940
- Can we come over?
- Yo, yo, yo... Get inside!

502
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,140
Get inside right now, man!

503
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,540
Shit crazy tonight.

504
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,166
I ain't tryin' to die from no monkey disease.
Come on, get inside!

505
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,370
What the fuck?

506
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,540
What the fuck is all this?

507
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,180
- Mr. Yates, sir...
- I said subtle!

508
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,620
I said covert!

509
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,380
Not pitch a tent in the middle
of the fucking parking lot!

510
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,482
- Sir, this is...
- Where are the assets?

511
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,100
You got them all just sitting
in a dark truck?

512
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,220
- You said as bare bones as possible.
- Yes. Right, you're right.

513
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,765
Thank you.

514
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,726
Laugher?

515
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,740
What happened to you?
I heard you were KIA.

516
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,242
We recovered him
from the sheriff station 30 minutes ago.

517
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,740
But you saw him, right? Howell?

518
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,524
He took my teeth.

519
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,685
But I got 'em back.

520
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,300
Yeah, thanks.

521
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,420
We just wanna, like, hang out
here for a couple of hours.

522
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,806
'Cause things are like...

523
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,100
I don't know, but things are, like,
pretty dangerous right now.

524
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,540
Yeah, so why do you
come to my house, Mike?

525
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,210
Why don't you go to your house?

526
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,740
Crazy is as crazy does
and you dragged crazy here.

527
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,300
And I don't even know
what that does or what that is.

528
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,820
You see what I'm saying?

529
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,900
I don't know, Rose.

530
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,729
We just thought it would be,
like, safer here.

531
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,540
Safer from what?

532
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,940
- Wait, why do you think it's dangerous?
- Yeah?

533
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,724
Like I said to you before
because of the...

534
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,780
- The what?
- The monkeys. The monkeys!

535
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,700
And, yo, Mike,
what you gonna be safer from, Mike?

536
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,420
What you gonna be safer from?

537
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,620
Rose... I...

538
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,767
Safer from what, Mike?

539
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,780
Perimeter's clear, man.

540
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,660
Yo, this is Big Harold and Quinzin.

541
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,569
Niggas, this is Mike and Phoebe.

542
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,060
- Mike? Me and Mike know each other.
- Me and Quinzin know each other.

543
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,140
Jinx, right?

544
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,100
Dude, it sucks, you were in first place
for like three weeks

545
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,645
- and your kickers got hurt.
- I know, man.

546
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,980
What?

547
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,660
We do Fantasy Football together,
you dig?

548
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,660
And you ain't even tell me?

549
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,761
Shit!

550
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,900
Everybody's got
a Fantasy Football league but Rose,

551
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,180
is what you're sayin'.

552
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,460
I guess Rose just sits alone, I guess.

553
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,131
I don't know nothin'
about no Fantasy Football.

554
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,060
Well that don't make me feel
better, man, nobody tell you shit.

555
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,446
So hurtful.

556
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,740
Sorry, man, sorry.
But it's all about conspiracies tonight.

557
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,100
Sorry, can I just ask about the monkeys?

558
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,740
And the gas masks? What...

559
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,940
You ain't heard?
Town's under government wildfire.

560
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,180
Outer-space shit,

561
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,682
straight Andromeda Strain bacterial
disease type shit!

562
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,180
- I'm sorry?
- You ain't seen?

563
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,900
Fuckin' look at the TV, man!

564
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,060
Look at the fuckin' TV!

565
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,620
Look at that shit, right there!

566
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,020
...level six quarantine
around the town of Liman, West Virginia.

567
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,580
The CDC has said
a breakout of what is being described

568
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,180
as Super Typhoid
began earlier this evening.

569
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,980
The bridge into town has been blocked
with access in or out of the town...

570
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,208
What did I tell ya?
What the fuck I tell ya?

571
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,129
...sources believe
the beginning of the outbreak...

572
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,540
That's not real. That can't...

573
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,620
...traced back
to these two individuals...

574
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,700
That can't be real.

575
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,300
Anyone having knowledge
of their whereabouts

576
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,460
should contact
the authorities immediately.

577
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,820
Shit, Phoebe. Fuck...

578
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,220
These two animal activist
are highly contagious...

579
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,890
That's that lady
I was telling you about.

580
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,580
...and should not be approached
under any circumstances.

581
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,806
What?

582
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,100
Officials have indicated that Victoria
Lasseteris responsible for the outbreak.

583
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,340
Why the fuck y'all on TV, Mike?

584
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,780
...Victoria Lasseter's inappropriate
close contact with several test monkeys.

585
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,380
Yo, Mike, are you in on this?

586
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,220
You mean, this is the lady
that talked to you?

587
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,340
- Yeah.
- What?

588
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,620
Why the fuck do you know
that monkey fucking motherfucker, man?

589
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,927
- Dude, calm down.
- Calm down?

590
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,684
I want fuckin' answers now.

591
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,740
Yo! Yo! Yo!

592
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,569
Okay, Rose, listen...

593
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,842
Things don't mean
what you think they mean.

594
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,363
This is going to sound crazy.

595
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,380
Something very weird is happening
to me tonight, okay,

596
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,260
and I don't know what it is,
but I keep, like, killing people, okay.

597
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,408
And there's a chance I may be a robot.

598
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,180
Shit.

599
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,980
You got the fuckin' monkey virus.

600
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,100
No, Rose. Stop...

601
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,900
You're fucking going
to quarantine, Mike!

602
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,340
- Rose, don't do that!
- Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

603
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,125
- That's entirely unnecessary!
- You're going to quarantine, motherfucker!

604
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,801
Damn!

605
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,761
Yo, bitch!

606
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,042
Rose. I'm sorry.

607
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,860
Okay, Rose, can you just,

608
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,850
whatever you do,
not call that number that was on the TV.

609
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,340
You think I'm gonna call the government?
Bitch, I ain't trying to get neuralized.

610
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,140
Rose, maybe we could
just talk about this, okay?

611
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,208
Nuh-uh, Mike. Nuh-uh!

612
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,646
Okay.

613
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,820
- Hey, Rose.
- Yeah?

614
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,820
I think I could probably
break this lock.

615
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,524
- Please don't.
- Okay.

616
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,928
I've never been down here.

617
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,900
Hey, Phoebe...

618
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,606
Phoebe, do you really think
I have that disease?

619
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,100
What? That fake
monkey news-story disease?

620
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,770
How do you know it's fake?

621
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,360
I did meet that woman.

622
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,684
Well, how do you feel?

623
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,244
You feel sick?

624
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,207
No. I feel kind of amazing.

625
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,006
Oh, my God!

626
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,570
Oh, my God.

627
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,888
- Hello?
- Hola, Petey.

628
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,007
Why am I hearing that
there's a supply drop made over Liman?

629
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,140
Do you understand
that you're assisting the efforts

630
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,580
of a rogue CIA operative
acting against national security?

631
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
What do we call that, Petey?

632
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,340
When someone is actively working
against the interests of their own country?

633
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,521
Treason.

634
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,580
Gosh, help me out here
because I always forget,

635
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,126
what's the punishment for treason?

636
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,730
We take you outside
and we shoot you in the fucking head.

637
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,260
Now I'm keenly aware

638
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,260
that you have
a degree of loyalty to Lasseter.

639
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,060
That ends now.
You're not to help her again.

640
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,685
- I...
- Understood?

641
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,980
Thanks for the location on Howell.

642
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,340
I'm heading to him right now,
but in the meantime

643
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,340
we've got to go public on this.
Call Krueger.

644
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,820
I can't believe Yates has been training
mental patients for his program.

645
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,620
It is my duty to inform you that should
you go public with this operation...

646
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,340
It's your duty? What?

647
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,020
We have to stop this!
He's completely out of his...

648
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,460
If you go public with this operation,
you're committing treason,

649
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,980
and will be treated as a traitor
to the United States of America.

650
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,300
No! Pete? Peter?

651
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,606
- I'm sorry.
- Petey!

652
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,968
I can't help you anymore.

653
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,251
Fuck!

654
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,765
Phoebe, what are you doing?

655
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,965
We are escaping.

656
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,162
Phoebe. No, Phoebe, stop.

657
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,180
I really don't think
we should do this, okay?

658
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,260
I think we should just wait here.

659
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,940
Rose is like a really good guy,
he'll come around.

660
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,963
You'll see.
He's just a sensitive and complex man.

661
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,500
Babe, I'm not going to sit around

662
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,682
and wait on the judgment
of your drug dealer.

663
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,980
Do we have a location on Howell?

664
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,180
He's at his friend's house.

665
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,420
Okay, we roll in waves. Got it?

666
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,340
Employ Newton, Laugher and Bourbon.

667
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,566
Is the press package ready?

668
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,660
- Yes, sir.
- Activate it.

669
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,524
And...

670
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,371
I'm clearing use of Riofloxin gas.

671
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,485
No more risks. No more mistakes.

672
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,684
Clean sweep.

673
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,644
- Fuck!
- Do you know what you're doing?

674
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,921
I'm just going to scoot a little bit further
and see if I can get into the other room.

675
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,280
Just give me one second.

676
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,047
This is not the right moment.

677
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,540
What do you mean, Quinzin,
I can't be in your league?

678
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,500
- I know football. Dang.
- It's too late, man.

679
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,568
Too late? It's never too late.

680
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,567
What the...

681
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,810
Shit! Phoebe!

682
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,281
Shit!

683
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,486
What?

684
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,460
Babe, come here. Hey, honey?

685
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,060
Mike... Come here. Come here.

686
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,300
Hey, wake up! Wake up! Come on, come on.

687
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,243
You have to stay awake, all right?

688
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,740
Hey, that Riofloxin shit,
it's going to make you really tired!

689
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,700
This is going to help a little bit.

690
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,980
Only if you stay awake for me, okay?

691
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,740
- I feel sleepy.
- Don't sleep! Don't sleep!

692
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,860
Baby, if you sleep you die. Okay?

693
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,100
If you sleep you die, Mike.
That's how this shit works.

694
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,820
Shuts your senses down one by one.
Keep your eyes open!

695
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,580
Baby, keep your fucking eyes open!

696
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,967
Honey? Honey? Babe!

697
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,580
Babe, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, okay?

698
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,460
Fuck! Babe...

699
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,740
No, what the fuck! No!

700
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,922
What about Chip the Brick?
Hey! What about...

701
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,340
What about Apollo Ape?

702
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,180
I love them. I love them...

703
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,860
If you die, they die.

704
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,020
I don't want them to fucking die.
I love you, babe.

705
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,121
Babe! Please!

706
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,161
Mike, wake up.

707
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,801
I love you.

708
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,881
Look at me.

709
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,603
Mike, you won't remember this,
but I love you.

710
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,760
...new start, away from all this.

711
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,641
Just you and me.

712
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,605
You're free.

713
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,520
Away from all this.

714
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,761
I love you.

715
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,451
It's over. I love you.

716
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,243
Interview number 13985.

717
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,700
This is our last session, Mike.

718
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,900
Mike!

719
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,161
You won't see me again.

720
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,169
I love you. It's over.

721
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,891
Wake up. Please!

722
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,420
Wake up! Mike.

723
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,090
Mike, you gotta wake up.

724
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,700
Mike! Mike!

725
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,370
Please!

726
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,161
Okay.

727
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,163
- Hey.
- No, no.

728
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,210
How do you know what that gas was?

729
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,763
Okay... I...

730
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,940
No, no, no. What is going on?
How do you know...

731
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,540
How do you know what that gas was?

732
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,007
I don't know what's going on.
But, listen...

733
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,500
- Baby...
- No. No.

734
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,700
Okay, Mike. Mike. Mike... Hey...

735
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,620
I don't know what's going on.

736
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,340
But I do know
what's going on with you, okay.

737
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,300
If you just listen... Listen.

738
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,700
Okay, tell me then.

739
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,780
It's not going to make
any sense right now.

740
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,360
What is going on?
What's going on with me?

741
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,326
I...

742
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,420
I'm your handler.

743
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,260
I was assigned to you five years ago.

744
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,124
- And I'm...
- My handler?

745
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,660
Please understand... I'm CIA, okay.

746
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,140
- But...
- You're what?

747
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,460
- Listen to me. It's okay.
- You're what?

748
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,660
I've been trying to tell you
this for so fucking long.

749
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,764
Phoebe... Are you not...
Are you not my girlfriend?

750
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,060
Of course I'm your girlfriend.

751
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,180
- Babe, that's what...
- Please stop it.

752
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,700
That's what I'm telling you. No...

753
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,780
Please stop it. No.
I can't even look at you.

754
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,723
No, no, no, I gotta go.

755
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,561
Mike!

756
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,840
Mike, you have to let me explain!

757
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,340
- No. No. No... Mike...
- No, no, no.

758
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,820
- Hey...
- Leave me alone!

759
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,127
- Unlock the door, Mike!
- Leave me alone!

760
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,607
Shit!

761
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,940
No, no, no. Get off of me.
Get off of me!

762
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,166
Mike, relax...

763
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,924
Look, I just need to know.

764
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,330
Am I real?

765
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,524
Yes, you're real.

766
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,291
Are your parents really dead?

767
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,300
Okay, how much of everything
that you've ever told me

768
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,686
is just a complete lie?

769
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,860
Not everything is a lie.

770
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,900
No, please don't use
your grown-up voice with me.

771
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,980
I'm not.

772
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,020
Okay... No. I was in love with you.

773
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,060
I am in love with you...
I don't even know who you are!

774
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,220
Fuck, Mike!

775
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,940
No, you don't get to like,
fake cry with me, okay.

776
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,980
They probably like train you
how to do this, don't they?

777
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,100
To fuck with my emotions.
Okay, well stop it.

778
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,645
Please stop it.

779
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,528
Hey! Hey! Stop it, okay!
Fucking stop it!

780
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,569
I'm not lying anymore.

781
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,900
Just give me one chance.

782
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,570
- I'm not going to lie to you, okay?
- Okay.

783
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,446
Get out.

784
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,740
No. No, Mike.

785
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,460
Phoebe, get out of my car.

786
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,860
I can't...

787
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,580
- Get out of my car, okay!
- I can't...

788
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,682
- Get out of my car!
- It's my fucking car!

789
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,848
No! Get out of the car! Okay!

790
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,801
Phoebe...

791
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,886
Phoebe!

792
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,526
Phoebe!

793
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,289
I'm supposed to bring you in alive.

794
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,885
Lucky you!

795
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,641
Shit.

796
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,041
Fuck!

797
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,420
No, no, no.

798
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,887
Bang! Bang! Bang!

799
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,848
Phoebe! Phoebe!

800
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,971
Phoebe!

801
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,008
I'm going to do something very bad.

802
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,606
Phoebe!

803
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,420
Shit! What is that?

804
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,940
It smells like gas!

805
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,900
- Gas!
- No! No!

806
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,525
Fuck! No! No! No, don't!

807
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,883
Fuck! Man!

808
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,620
I fucking hate you, man!

809
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,961
Well, I fucking hate you too, man!

810
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,250
Shit! No!

811
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,900
- Hey, I wanna show you something!
- No, no, no.

812
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,001
Hey, wake up.

813
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,881
Hey, wake up!

814
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,362
I said I wanna show you something.

815
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,161
Look!

816
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,802
Mike! Mike!

817
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,246
Sir!

818
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,900
Well, if it isn't
Miss Stockholm Syndrome 2010.

819
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,162
Yates. What the fuck are you doing here?

820
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,780
That's unprofessional.

821
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,881
Who's running this operation?

822
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,288
Since when did desk jockeys
like you run field ops?

823
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,660
Well, I guess that's the problem
with going dark for five years.

824
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,161
You kinda fall out of the loop
on a couple of things.

825
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,260
Do you have authorization at all?

826
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,460
Where's Krueger?

827
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,050
Phoebe Selburg,

828
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,300
she who'd rather suck some stoner's cock
than turn herself back in for debrief,

829
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,940
is going to question my authorization?

830
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,929
I've read your file.

831
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,921
You have no secrets from me!

832
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,010
Your boyfriend isn't real.

833
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,045
We made him.

834
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,660
I'm so sorry, that some lab-rat
made you cum a bunch of times

835
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,020
in the back of a Taco Bell!

836
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,700
Yeah, that's probably a good reason
to throw away your entire life!

837
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,660
Well, I guess it all worked out.

838
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,780
Because look where I am now.

839
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,803
In charge of a major operation.

840
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,929
And look where you are.

841
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,740
Under departmental arrest
for insubordination.

842
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,220
And your face is all messed up.

843
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,420
And I'm gonna get a promotion.

844
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,842
Your pathetic stoner boyfriend
has been burned alive.

845
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,604
Hey. Hey.

846
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,367
- It's okay. It's okay. Hi.
- Hi.

847
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,842
Mike, do you recognize me?

848
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,163
Do you know who I am?

849
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,850
Yeah, you're the woman from the market.

850
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,080
Yeah.

851
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,209
Do you really know who I am?

852
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,245
Are you my mother?

853
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,041
No.

854
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,580
Okay, you know what,
I gotta take you somewhere.

855
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,966
- No, no, no.
- We got to go someplace safe.

856
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,060
No, we have to. You're coming with me.

857
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,100
- No, I'm...
- No...

858
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,580
Stop. I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me

859
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,205
what the hell is going on with me, okay?

860
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,660
Who are you

861
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,922
and what did they do with my girlfriend?

862
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,886
Okay.

863
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,020
Do you remember

864
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,806
when you were arrested
when you were 18 for the acid?

865
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,100
That was when we first met.

866
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,965
I was recruiting people
for a program called Wiseman.

867
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,605
Which was basically designed
to take third strike misdemeanor offenders

868
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,060
and offer them the opportunity
to volunteer.

869
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,900
Volunteer? For what?

870
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,207
To be... To be an experiment.

871
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,131
An experiment?

872
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,960
Yeah.

873
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,020
That was a mistake.

874
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,260
No, but Mike, you worked.

875
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,020
All the other subjects that came in,
they were all failures.

876
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,690
But not you.

877
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,403
You were a success.

878
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,485
But it was driving you insane.

879
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,523
It was driving everybody insane.

880
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,323
The risks weren't worth the rewards.

881
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,246
So I shut it down,

882
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,206
and I gave you all
new lives and new identities.

883
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,402
- A fresh start here.
- Yeah.

884
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,921
So you erased my memories.

885
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,780
And you fucked with my head.

886
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,771
And you left me here
with a fake girlfriend.

887
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,403
- No.
- No, Mike, Mike, wait.

888
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,580
This isn't who you always were.

889
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,251
The slow thinking,
the inability to leave town.

890
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,700
The phobias...
We did that to protect you.

891
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,300
- To protect me?
- Yeah.

892
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,020
Well, tell that to the guys
who are trying to kill me.

893
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,540
Who the fuck are those people?

894
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,420
Hey. You're the lady from TV!

895
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,567
Hey.

896
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,606
You fuck monkeys!

897
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,481
What?

898
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,809
Mike, where are you going?

899
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,049
Sir, asset Howell is still alive.

900
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,164
He and Agent Lasseter were spotted
at the gas station near Chestnut Street.

901
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,401
Shit!

902
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,220
- Hello?
- Hola, Petey.

903
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,620
I need a drone in the sky
in less than an hour.

904
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,290
Call me when it's entering my air-space.

905
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,860
- So you're going to blow up a civilian town?
- If I have to.

906
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,260
To catch one guy?

907
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,681
This is it, Pheebs.

908
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,369
The kid gloves are off.

909
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,170
It's fine. Go back to work!

910
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,580
Sir, new sighting.

911
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,001
Two subjects
heading east on Perryman Way.

912
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,130
They're going back to the house.

913
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,685
He's not just going
to go back to the house.

914
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,220
Mike can be a little slow sometimes,
but he's not a fucking idiot.

915
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,620
Mike, I can't believe
you're going back to your house.

916
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,620
I'm going inside and I'm going to sleep.

917
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,940
He could have snipers
taking aim at us right now.

918
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,280
Really? Then shoot me, please!

919
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,540
So what? Why are you still here?

920
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,881
- I don't want you to die.
- Why?

921
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,640
Because...

922
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,260
Because I care about you, all right?

923
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,340
Okay, well I don't care, all right.

924
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,860
If I die, I'm going to do it stoned,

925
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,100
and smiling in my bed.

926
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,965
And you can stay or you can go.

927
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,940
Otis, I need you and Beedle
to go to the house

928
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,089
and confirm the location
of Lasseter and asset Howell.

929
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,020
Now, thank you, now!

930
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,451
Sir, yes, sir.

931
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,611
What the fuck are you looking at?

932
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,724
Who's Apollo Ape?

933
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,220
He's a monkey astronaut.

934
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,800
I made him up. He goes on adventures.

935
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,366
Hey, Mike, you know Phoebe
was supposed to come back in.

936
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,740
When you were in the program,
she always looked out for you.

937
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,940
As all the other assets kept failing,
you kept succeeding.

938
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,883
She had so much faith in you.

939
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,287
You were real to her.

940
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,420
She was just supposed to
get you settled into this town

941
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,966
and then she was going to be reassigned.

942
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,580
But she decided to stay with you.

943
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,729
She gave up everything,
her whole real life.

944
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,564
Just thought you should know that.

945
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,889
Miss Lasseter?

946
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,721
Come here.

947
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,420
Asset Howell confirmed on site!

948
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,329
Sir, asset Howell confirmed on site.

949
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,180
Requesting immediate backup.

950
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,340
Copy that.
Drone strike is a go, call it.

951
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,460
But what about Otis?

952
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,460
Drone strike is a go! Call it!

953
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,700
We are go for strike.

954
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,140
Roger, go for strike.

955
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,891
Agent Douglas, please confirm.

956
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,961
Go for strike.

957
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,764
Moving into attack position.

958
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,761
Okay. There you go. All right.

959
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,087
Shit! Okay, stay here.

960
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,126
Beedle!

961
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,860
Target lock in progress.
Waiting confirmation to strike.

962
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,961
Fire!

963
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,300
Agent Douglas,
please confirm deployment.

964
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,686
Fucking fire!

965
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,647
What the fuck is wrong with you!
Drop it now!

966
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,401
Drop it!

967
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,740
Now! Fire! Now!

968
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,887
Agent Douglas?

969
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,411
We're losing our target window.

970
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,329
- Do you copy? Agent Douglas!
- Fucking idiot!

971
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,442
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

972
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,924
- five, four, three, two...
- No, fuck you.

973
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,322
Target lock disengaged.

974
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,940
Predator satellite link down.

975
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,044
Ground station has lost
communication with the drone.

976
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,003
The old frying pan bullet trick.

977
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,408
Shit. Shit!

978
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,522
- This is Krueger.
- Hello, Mr. Krueger.

979
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,930
Do you have a minute?

980
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,246
All personnel evacuate.

981
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,060
All personnel evacuate.

982
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,500
Initiate immediate
non-combatant evacuation protocol.

983
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,840
All transport vehicles...

984
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,690
Otis,

985
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,290
how'd you get tied up in all this?

986
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,220
Don't answer that.

987
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,580
What if it's the guys who have Phoebe?

988
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,380
It definitely is.

989
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,642
- Okay, then I'm going to answer it.
- No, Mike.

990
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,580
- Hello?
- Hello.

991
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,011
Who's this?

992
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,780
You first.

993
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,300
Fuck me. It's you, isn't it?

994
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,020
- It's Mike Howell.
- Yeah. Who's this?

995
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,100
Is the house not all on fire?

996
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,851
No. Man, the house
is like basically normal.

997
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,620
Okay.

998
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,180
So what's the plan now?

999
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,170
I mean, like, like do you surrender?

1000
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,964
Fuck! You got me.

1001
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,330
I surrender.

1002
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,660
Why don't you come on down
to the Max Goods parking lot,

1003
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,020
and accept my surrender.

1004
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,260
- The Max Goods on Wilson?
- Yeah.

1005
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,980
Yeah, is that one
across from the tire shop?

1006
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,220
The Ten Minute Tires?

1007
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,100
What? Yes! That Max Goods.

1008
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,460
So what happens if I meet you there?

1009
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,530
Like, how do you accept a surrender?
Do I need to sign something?

1010
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,568
Your girlfriend's here.

1011
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,844
Would you ever like
to see her alive again?

1012
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,530
I don't know.

1013
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,540
So if I just took out my gun
and blew her fucking face off,

1014
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,404
you'd be cool with that?

1015
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,724
No, that wouldn't be cool.

1016
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,731
Is she really there with you?

1017
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,081
Mikey?

1018
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,365
I'm sorry.

1019
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,730
But I'm the tree.

1020
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,522
I've been the tree the entire time,
you're the car.

1021
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,285
Okay?

1022
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,651
I love you.

1023
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,764
So you can leave, you can go wherever
you want and they will fucking never...

1024
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,165
That was really fucking lame.

1025
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,260
Mike, what are you doing?

1026
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,409
I'm going to save my girlfriend
from Max Goods.

1027
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,727
Get out! Get out of the fucking truck!

1028
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,540
You're all now Code-3 right now!

1029
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,860
Go! Go! Faster! Go!

1030
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,849
Go! This is it!

1031
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,260
This is the moment
that I have trained you for!

1032
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,260
This is not a fucking
dress rehearsal, okay!

1033
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,420
This guy is deadly.

1034
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,300
He is silent and he will sneak up on us.

1035
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,606
Are we clear?

1036
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,801
Fuck!

1037
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,804
Laugher, get out here!

1038
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,482
Hey, Phoebe! Phoebe!

1039
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,130
- Hey, Phoebe...
- Mike!

1040
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,780
I just wanted to say that I love you.

1041
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,900
And that everything is going to be okay.

1042
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,500
I mean, not like perfect,
obviously, but better.

1043
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,500
Like, we'll probably
have to get a new house,

1044
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,220
- and also cars...
- You two, can you kill him?

1045
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,500
- Please, kill him.
- ...but I'm coming to get you.

1046
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,444
And this will all be over.

1047
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,611
Soon-ish.

1048
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,891
Phoebe!

1049
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,380
Yates, give up!

1050
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,369
Just let me go, that's all he wants!

1051
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,688
Go! Go!

1052
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,087
- Laugher, grab her.
- Fuck!

1053
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,641
Phoebe!

1054
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,923
Laugher, end this.

1055
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,410
Don't hide!

1056
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,965
Come out. I really want to talk to you.

1057
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,445
Come out!

1058
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,441
Come here!

1059
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,740
You know...

1060
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,980
What? What do I know? What do I know?

1061
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,460
Why don't you tell me what I know?

1062
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,540
You're fucked!

1063
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,085
Am I? How?

1064
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,925
My pathetic stoner boyfriend...

1065
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,370
He's going to kill you and you know it.

1066
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,170
You know what?

1067
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,881
You...

1068
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,525
I think you're a lot like me.

1069
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,846
Fuck this!

1070
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,180
Fuck you! They're going to be
laughing at your pothead ass

1071
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,645
tomorrow morning at debriefing!

1072
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,940
You know what, Tarzan,

1073
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,168
why don't you go
burn with your fucking ape?

1074
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,700
You're scaring me.

1075
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,202
Will you please come out?
Can we just talk?

1076
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,201
I wanna talk...

1077
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,686
I'm sorry.

1078
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,007
I can't control it.

1079
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,244
The things that they did to my head.

1080
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,569
They made you like they made me.

1081
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,929
But you're better than me.

1082
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,561
Who told you what to do?

1083
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,600
Nobody.

1084
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,770
That must be nice.

1085
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,127
Who's the bitch now, fucker?

1086
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,405
Enough, Lasseter.

1087
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,366
Enough!

1088
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,731
Mike?

1089
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,845
Mike?

1090
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,366
Baby?

1091
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,681
Phoebe...

1092
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,446
Fuck.

1093
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,090
Do you want to go home?

1094
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,846
Okay.

1095
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,120
Okay.

1096
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,721
She said yes!

1097
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,606
She said yes!

1098
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,325
Man, come on, just give us, like, one...

1099
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,766
- On the ground!
- Perfect.

1100
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,580
Congratulations. In the fucking woods,
in the fucking rain!

1101
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,260
That is the level of fuck-up
you have achieved!

1102
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,380
I just want to say, sir, that Peter Douglas
should not be held responsible

1103
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,100
for any of his actions
in the last 24 hours.

1104
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,140
Douglas will be dealt with
when he's dealt with.

1105
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,580
You, on the other hand,

1106
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,420
you directly interfered
with a government operation.

1107
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,980
And as a result, you caused
the deaths of innocent civilians.

1108
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,320
Is that correct?

1109
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,442
- Yes, sir.
- You're absolutely right, sir.

1110
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,420
Thanks to Lasseter activating asset Howell,
seven American citizens are now dead.

1111
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,100
In an operation that wouldn't...

1112
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,100
This is an operation
that you created and spearheaded

1113
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,740
without any authorization,
is that correct?

1114
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,810
Yes, sir, but you have to understand,

1115
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,300
I was self-starting.

1116
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,006
- Excuse me?
- Did I make some mistakes?

1117
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,020
You know, I did.

1118
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,140
Did I take some shortcuts? Sure.

1119
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,340
But in the end, I was just
doing what I needed to do

1120
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,580
to create a cost-efficient exploit
of a system already put in place.

1121
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,082
And if I'd pulled it off,
you'd be thanking me. Right?

1122
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,246
Come on, you'd be
fucking thanking me, right?

1123
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,090
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1124
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,366
Thank you.

1125
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,925
Now I'm...

1126
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,460
I don't know if this is appropriate,

1127
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,688
but please, please do not kill me.

1128
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,487
I'm your source.

1129
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,340
When I called you to notify you
that the sweep was happening,

1130
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,922
I did it out of respect and courtesy,
and you've made me regret that now.

1131
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,860
It was not my intention
for you to act like a child

1132
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,300
and try to save your puppy.

1133
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,801
The puppy was going down,
I was notifying you of the puppy's death.

1134
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,180
But the puppy just shit
all over everything!

1135
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,540
You have a crazy, scary rabid puppy

1136
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,087
that murders people
and will still need to be put down.

1137
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,200
You understand that? Correct?

1138
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,660
Yes, sir.

1139
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,366
You better pray you can
find a way to turn this into a win

1140
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,649
and pull a miracle out of your ass!

1141
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,171
Because if you can't...

1142
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,487
That's you.

1143
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,963
You already have your miracle, sir.

1144
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,809
My program worked.

1145
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,860
Wiseman beat Tough guy.

1146
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,046
Mike Howell eliminated
17 Tough guy assets single-handedly.

1147
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,620
That makes him the most effective asset

1148
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,580
we've ever seen
in any of the Ultra Programs.

1149
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,682
Ever. In 60 years.

1150
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,043
Pardon me for saying it, sir.

1151
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,528
But that is a puppy worth saving.

1152
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,246
That is a $400 million puppy.

1153
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,684
And you have him
sitting in a holding cell right now.

1154
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,522
You're just going to put him down?

1155
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,884
Where do you want to begin,
Agent Howell?

1156
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,488
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Okay.

1157
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,731
Hello. Hi.

1158
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,971
They took the bait.

1159
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,808
Something funny?
