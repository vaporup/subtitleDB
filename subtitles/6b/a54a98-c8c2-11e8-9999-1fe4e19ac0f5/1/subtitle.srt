1
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:07,799
I'm inviting you for breakfast.

2
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:15,098
I can't.
I have to go to church.

3
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,813
Well, after church then.

4
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:24,732
Come on,
we haven't seen you for so long.

5
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,318
Why don't you put this on,
because

6
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,780
I don't want your little baby
to get sick.

7
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,991
It's so cold out.

8
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,372
- Come on!
- Okay.

9
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,459
Okay?

10
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:47,422
You'll come?

11
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,591
Oh, yeah.

12
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,927
Great!

13
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:56,890
- Could you put the whole thing on?
- Oh, yeah. - Okay.

14
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,100
See you.

15
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:19,787
You owe me five dollars.

16
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,836
Not till he's sitting at the table.
I don't owe you anything yet.

17
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:31,925
Something's going on with him.
I'm worried.

18
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,928
You keep saying that.
I think your...

19
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,598
Your maternal instincts
might be kicking in.

20
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,106
In all the world,

21
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:51,694
there are books and books
and books of laws.

22
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:57,033
But in all this world,
there really is only one Lord.

23
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,288
We need never ask:
"Lord, what should I do?",

24
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,292
because the Lord
has told us what to do.

25
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,212
"Love one another."

26
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:14,634
That, my friends,
is the one true law.

27
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,930
Love is God in action.

28
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:22,517
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the love of God,

29
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,688
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
be with you all now and forever more.

30
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,107
- Amen.
- Amen.

31
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,782
Hi, Mrs. Gruner.
Do you want some help?

32
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:40,076
- Thank you, dear.
- Okay.

33
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,122
It's my turn
to drop them off at the hospital.

34
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,003
You're a good-looking fellow, Lars.

35
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,838
Where's your girlfriend?

36
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:53,506
I don't have one.

37
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,425
- Are you gay?
- No.

38
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,177
My grandson's gay,
I know all about the gays.

39
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:00,221
I know, but I'm not gay, so...

40
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,018
- Well, don't leave it too long.
It's not good for you. - Okay.

41
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:08,354
Here.

42
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:12,025
Give this to somebody nice.

43
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:13,568
For a start.

44
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,240
Hello, Lars.

45
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,632
I guess...

46
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,885
- I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

47
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,850
Karin, my brother is 27-years-old.
Maybe he wants to be left alone.

48
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,686
- That's not what he wants.
- Really? Hey, just...

49
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,814
Go.
How do you know that exactly?

50
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:55,235
Because that's not how people are.

51
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,197
There he goes.

52
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,038
Lars! Come on, you promised!

53
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,257
- Is that normal?
- Five dollars.

54
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,468
Morning!

55
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,970
Good morning, Cindy.

56
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,889
Did you have a nice weekend?

57
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:09,976
That new girl's kind of cute, huh?

58
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,313
You and Margo!
What do you think?

59
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:27,619
Lars, you've got to see this!

60
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:30,580
I'm not really in the mood
for porn this morning.

61
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:31,706
It's not porn.

62
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,794
Okay, it is,
but check it out, alright?

63
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:41,841
You like?
Man, it's solid!

64
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:46,221
If she'd weigh 125 pounds,
then she weighs 125 pounds.

65
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,347
Is that right?

66
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,351
You can customize everything.
They've got different heads and parts.

67
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:53,311
You can design your own woman!

68
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:56,231
And, Lars...

69
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,608
- Lars!
- Yeah?

70
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,238
They're anatomically correct.

71
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,496
You aren't going to buy one, are you?

72
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,039
I wish.

73
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:17,252
Look how much they cost.
I'm wiped out from the X-box.

74
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,046
Morning.

75
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,300
- Morning!
- Oh, hey! Yeah. Morning!

76
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,886
Margo's here, everybody!
Hurray!

77
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,726
Could you put the headset on?

78
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,193
I was thinking,

79
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,946
we're the only ones from the lake.
We could carpool.

80
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:49,158
Lars, it's your day for coffee, buddy.

81
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,743
Oh, yeah.

82
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,585
You know what your problem is?
You're just too aggressive.

83
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:03,047
- Just chillax, you know?
- Shut up.

84
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,308
Wait. Stop.

85
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,475
Stop!

86
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:19,105
Karin! What? What?

87
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,275
We want you to come for dinner.

88
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,196
Will you come?

89
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,496
You scared me.

90
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,208
- Sorry! Sorry.
- You scared me.

91
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,418
Oh, sweetheart. Sorry.

92
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,587
Wait.

93
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:46,883
- It's okay. I can't. I can't.
- Why not? No!

94
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,345
Why not?
Come on, Lars, we miss you.

95
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:57,977
I brought my work home, so I have to...
I'll get in trouble.

96
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,230
No, you didn't.

97
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:02,565
Did you hear that?
That's my phone, I think.

98
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,944
No, come on, wait! Wait!
Lars! Stop! Stop!

99
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,492
- Come on, please?
- I have other plans.

100
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,536
And I can't.

101
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:19,207
Lars, there's salmon
and cherry pie in there.

102
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,754
- Could you please let me go?
- No.

103
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,050
Okay.

104
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,025
Is that all you can eat?

105
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,736
- Yeah, that was delicious. Thank you.
- Okay.

106
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,406
No, no, you stay there.
No, it's my turn.

107
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:53,908
You boys talk.

108
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,503
Okay...
Karin's been worried about you.

109
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:09,507
She thinks you've got a problem because
you spend so much time by yourself.

110
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,387
I'm fine.

111
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,807
That's what I told her.
That's exactly what I said.

112
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,101
Okay.

113
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:23,396
Dad was kind of like that too, so...

114
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:28,109
Yeah, but he didn't want
anyone around. That's the difference.

115
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:31,696
That's not true.

116
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:38,411
Okay. You know? Yeah, sure,
maybe after mom died,

117
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,748
but you didn't even know him
before that. So...

118
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,878
I mean, not that you could have,
but I'm just saying...

119
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,311
Karin and I would really like it
if you moved in.

120
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:08,107
No, that's okay. Thank you.

121
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,109
The house is half yours.

122
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,403
I know, but I'm fine, thanks.

123
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,740
I'm just putting it out there.

124
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:23,289
- Well, goodnight. Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

125
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,793
Wait.
Here's some leftovers for you.

126
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,087
Do you have my blanket?

127
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,674
- Oh, yeah. It's on the...
- I'll get it. Grab these.

128
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,968
I'll be right back.

129
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,223
It's a beautiful blanket.

130
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,726
- Gus says your mother made it for you.
- Yeah.

131
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,311
When she was pregnant.

132
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:52,569
She must have loved you very much,
like we do.

133
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,370
- Are you mad at me?
- Is he coming?

134
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:06,207
- Here we go. - Goodnight.
- Thanks. Goodnight.

135
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,050
What?

136
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:17,802
We talked, he's fine.

137
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:02,138
- Hello?
- Hey, Lars. It's Karin.

138
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,557
They just delivered
a huge box for you.

139
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:06,017
It's in the garage.

140
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,147
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay, bye.

141
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:13,274
Thanks.

142
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,586
That's a nice sweater.

143
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:32,353
Hey!

144
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,522
Come on in.

145
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,654
That's okay.
Is Karin gonna come to the door?

146
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:42,989
Karin!

147
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,574
Yeah?

148
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,576
Honey, come here, it's Lars!

149
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,162
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:54,792
She's just doing some kind of...

151
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:58,129
It's pregnant women's yoga.

152
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,593
No, it's good.
It's good, good stuff.

153
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,011
- Hey.
- Hi.

154
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,346
What's up?

155
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,143
I have a visitor.

156
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,772
- You have...?
- In the garage?

157
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:17,732
- Now?
- Yeah.

158
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,400
A visitor?

159
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,111
That's great!

160
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,531
Yeah.

161
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,283
And she's not from here.

162
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:28,910
She?

163
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,537
Yeah.

164
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:33,706
Wow, what do you know?

165
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,043
Where did you meet this person?

166
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,797
- On the Internet.
- Yeah, everybody's doing that now.

167
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,091
That's great!

168
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,178
She doesn't speak much English, though.

169
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:51,182
That's okay.
It's the same with the guys at work.

170
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:54,102
- It's not that big a deal.
- Okay.

171
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,731
Oh, yeah.
You know, she's in a wheelchair,

172
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,234
so I don't want her
to feel weird about it.

173
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,403
- We don't care.
- Oh, no. No.

174
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:04,612
Okay.

175
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:08,908
And I have to ask you a really...
I know it's a really big favor.

176
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,119
Yeah.

177
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:15,832
Well...
She's really religious and,

178
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,209
because we're both young and single,

179
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:21,671
it doesn't feel right for us
to stay in the garage alone together.

180
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,965
No.
We'll put her in the pink room.

181
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:26,676
- She could sleep here.
- In the pink room? - Yeah!

182
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,804
- Okay.
- Sure! And there are new towels.

183
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:36,060
Just give us half an hour to pick up

184
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,354
and get something in the oven.

185
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,648
- Okey-dokey.
- Let's get the place ready.

186
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,322
Okay. Let's get started!

187
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,492
Man, that is...

188
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:56,372
You quiet ones...
You know what they say.

189
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:01,044
It's great. It's great.
See you in a little bit.

190
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,837
- Okay.
- Okay.

191
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,696
You know, Bianca's a missionary.

192
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,741
Was a missionary.
Right, sorry.

193
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:33,243
She was raised by nuns.

194
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,162
But now she's on a sabbatical,
she can experience the world.

195
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:37,413
Isn't that neat?

196
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,463
She's shy.

197
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,716
Well, you are.

198
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,511
Everything's so new

199
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,639
for her. Right?

200
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,231
- Are you hungry?
- We're starving.

201
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,986
Gus, will you give me
a hand in the kitchen?

202
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:15,660
How was that?

203
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,371
I know.

204
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,333
He's out of his mind.

205
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,129
Oh, my God!

206
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,924
It seems crazy, right?
I mean, he's crazy!

207
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:35,597
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. - What are we gonna do?

208
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,351
Oh, my God!

209
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:43,229
We have to put him in a hospital,
I think.

210
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:45,773
We have to put him in a hospital,
I can't afford that.

211
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:49,652
Karin, I can't believe this.
My little brother is totally insane!

212
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,197
- Pull yourself together.
- How am l...? - Gus!

213
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,158
- Calm down! - How can l?
- Calm down, okay? Now!

214
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,743
He's talking to a doll!

215
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,163
We've just got to get
through this somehow, okay?

216
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,624
- I don't know how we're gonna
do that. - Me neither.

217
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,334
But you've gotta be calm.

218
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:06,419
Okay?

219
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,129
Okay.

220
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,717
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

221
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:19,265
Karin, she's not gonna eat!

222
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,672
You're never gonna believe this.

223
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,341
It makes me mad.

224
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,844
Bianca's from the tropics.

225
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,429
She's Brazilian.

226
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,059
Well, half Brazilian, half Danish,
that's right.

227
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:08,231
And somebody stole her luggage.

228
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,361
Yeah!
And they stole her wheelchair.

229
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,867
That's terrible.

230
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,453
Yeah!
Can you believe that, Gus?

231
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:25,707
- Yeah, I can't believe it.
- Right.

232
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,713
Well, it makes me angry.
Anyway...

233
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,928
I wanted to ask you a favor.
She doesn't mind, I promise.

234
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:43,224
Karin, would you mind lending Bianca
some clothes? She doesn't have any.

235
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:56,779
Do you?

236
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,449
I'm not sure we're the same type, Lars.

237
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:01,784
That's okay, Karin, because

238
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:05,997
Bianca doesn't care about superficial
things like that, so it's okay.

239
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,550
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's right.

240
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:21,137
See? I told you.
Thanks.

241
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:28,853
This used to be my mom's room.
So...

242
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:32,774
If you need anything,
Gus and Karin are across the hall.

243
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm in the garage.

244
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:38,446
You know that, so what else?

245
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:42,450
Your towels are brand-new,
thanks to Karin.

246
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:48,289
Lars, I think we should go to bed.

247
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:49,541
Oh, okay.

248
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,877
Just one second.

249
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:57,131
I just wanted to say
I'm so glad you're finally here.

250
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,010
I think right now...

251
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:04,389
Yeah. Okay, goodnight.

252
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:17,986
Wait!
Gus had a good idea.

253
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,365
He's concerned about Bianca's health.

254
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:27,370
You know, with the traveling,
the change of climate, and everything...

255
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,330
Well, it's stress, you know?

256
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,293
I'll make an appointment
with Doctor Berman for tomorrow.

257
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,711
For early tomorrow.

258
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,296
We'll all go.

259
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:39,340
Yeah. You remember Dagmar?

260
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:44,637
- Okay. Do you think that's a good idea?
- I do. I think we should do it.

261
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:46,514
Yeah.

262
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:49,601
- That's a good idea, I was gonna go...
- Let's go to bed.

263
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:51,644
...shopping for wheelchairs, anyway.

264
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:54,147
- So, goodnight.
- Night.

265
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,316
I'll see you tomorrow.

266
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,991
Oh, my God.

267
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:10,473
Natasha escaped from Moscow,

268
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:13,560
where she was forced to strip
for the Russian mob.

269
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:17,063
Now all she wants is
an all-American male to love.

270
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:23,027
Midori left a high-paying job in Tokyo
because she was unsatisfied as a woman.

271
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:27,490
Tammy dropped out of high school
to join the rodeo.

272
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:31,452
Are you the right cowboy
to tame this wild filly?

273
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:48,386
The doctor will tell us what to do.

274
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,140
But she's family practice.
We need a shrink.

275
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,767
No, she's a psychologist, too.

276
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:01,065
She says you have to be,
this far north.

277
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,072
What'll people think?

278
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:12,869
We can't worry about that.

279
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:17,874
Right.

280
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:38,269
Right there
is where my dad used to work.

281
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:40,772
Our dad.

282
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,444
That's the library. I have a card,
you can borrow it if you want to.

283
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:50,907
Actually, I'll have to take them out
for you, but you just tell me.

284
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:55,286
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, actually. Gus?

285
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:57,956
What was it that dad did?

286
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,125
Water and Power.

287
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,221
My job's at the School Department.

288
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:19,644
I miss everybody, but there's
so much to do in the house.

289
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:23,231
I'll go back
as soon as the baby's old enough and...

290
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,001
Yeah. Sure.

291
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:45,503
"Reader's Digest",

292
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,008
"Midwest Living" or "Country Home"?

293
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,094
That's what I would say.

294
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:10,653
Well, her blood pressure's low.

295
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:19,204
- Is that serious? - Could be.
We'll have to wait and see.

296
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,168
It's fine.

297
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:28,504
Mine's probably low, too.

298
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:35,929
I...

299
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,642
I want you to bring her in
every week for a special treatment.

300
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:43,144
Can you do that?

301
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:50,735
Are you sure that's necessary?

302
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:55,990
- Yes.
- Okay. Okay.

303
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,910
What do you think?

304
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:02,664
If that's what she says,
then we should.

305
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,166
Okay.

306
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,795
You can set that up with Joanna,
at the desk.

307
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,550
I look forward
to getting to know you, Bianca.

308
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,474
- Karin, I'm telling you,
he belongs in a hospital! - No!

309
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:25,061
My Uncle Garth went to one
of those places and never came back.

310
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:27,397
But he needs more help
than we are able to give.

311
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,817
- I told you something was wrong
and you wouldn't listen! - If I may.

312
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:34,654
Has Lars been functional?

313
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:37,365
Does he go to work,
wash, dress himself?

314
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:38,992
So far.

315
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,079
Has he had any violent episodes?

316
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:47,458
No! No, never. He's a sweetheart,
he never even raises his voice.

317
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:48,668
Okay.

318
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:50,962
We gotta fix him.
Can you fix him?

319
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,922
I don't know, Gus.

320
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:57,802
I don't believe he's psychotic
or schizophrenic.

321
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:02,390
I don't think this is caused by genes
or faulty wiring in the brain.

322
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,809
So, what the hell is going on then?

323
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:06,728
He appears to have a delusion.

324
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:08,062
A delusion?

325
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:11,566
What the hell is he doing
with a delusion, for Christ's sake?

326
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,735
That's what we have to find out.

327
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,155
Chances are he's been
decompensating for some time.

328
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,409
I guess we didn't realize.

329
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:28,917
Have there been any changes
in the family in the last year or so?

330
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,502
No, everything is
pretty much exactly the same,

331
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:35,173
except that Karin is pregnant
and Lars is nuts.

332
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:38,551
You know, this isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

333
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:43,139
What we call mental illness
isn't always just an illness.

334
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:47,727
It can be a communication,
a way to work something out.

335
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,021
Fantastic.
When will it be over?

336
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,065
When he doesn't need it anymore.

337
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:56,903
How can we help?

338
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:03,618
- Go along with it.
- Oh, no. No, that's...

339
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:09,249
Oh, my! No, no, no.
I mean, pretend that she's real?

340
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,626
I can't.
I'm just not gonna do it.

341
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,254
- She is real.
- Well... - I mean,

342
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,381
she's right out there.

343
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:18,007
Right. I get that.

344
00:31:18,132 --> 00:31:20,969
But I'm not gonna do it.

345
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:23,596
You won't be able
to change his mind anyway.

346
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,557
Bianca's in town for a reason.

347
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,268
- Right, but...
- It's not really a choice.

348
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:35,900
Okay. Okay. Alright.
Then we'll do it. Whatever it takes.

349
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:39,028
Oh, yeah.
And everyone's gonna laugh at him.

350
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:40,905
And you.

351
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:56,129
She loves kids.

352
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,430
- More coffee, Lars?
- Yes, please.

353
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,474
You see the funny face?

354
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,562
Does Bianca want some?

355
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:15,899
Yeah.

356
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,277
- There you go.
- Thank you, Karin.

357
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,529
Gus? No? Okay.

358
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,157
Sure.

359
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:32,207
Are you not gonna
go to work today, Gus?

360
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,003
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, no.

361
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,967
Bianca could help you.
She has nurse's training.

362
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:47,430
No, she doesn't. She doesn't
have nurse's training, Lars,

363
00:32:47,514 --> 00:32:49,390
because she's not a person.

364
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:51,392
She's a big plastic thing.

365
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:55,146
That's amazing.

366
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,525
Did you hear that?

367
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:02,987
Bianca just said that's why
God made her, to help people.

368
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:13,706
Are you gonna be late?

369
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,667
For work?

370
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:22,048
I am gonna be late.

371
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:24,342
I have to go.

372
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:25,718
Okay.

373
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:28,680
But I'm going to check in.

374
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:30,223
Okey-doke.

375
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:33,184
- You have my number at work,
right, Karin? - Yeah.

376
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,528
I wanted to tell you
you look really pretty today.

377
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:50,159
I hope you feel better, Gus.

378
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,370
Me, too.

379
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:55,123
- And thanks so much for breakfast.
- No.

380
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,459
- Okay, gotta go. Bye!
- See you!

381
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:05,466
Well, I had to try. You know...

382
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:13,057
- What? What? What?
- It's just... I don't know.

383
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:18,771
It's true. We've been all wrapped up
in ourselves. We have, Gus!

384
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:22,275
This is not my fault, though.
It's not my fault.

385
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:32,577
Come on, Bianca.
Let's make a couple of calls.

386
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,221
Good morning, Cindy.
You look pretty today.

387
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:53,181
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Sunshine...

388
00:34:55,683 --> 00:35:01,648
It's way in advance, but you know
how excited I get about these things.

389
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:12,450
- Where are they? I know you took them.
- Did not. - You did, too. As revenge.

390
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:15,078
- For what?
- The fake rat I put in your drawer.

391
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,162
Oh, that.

392
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:18,998
Lars, I'm missing 3
of my action figures.

393
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,502
It's your turn to get coffee.

394
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,048
Listen up, Margo. Those action figures
are extremely important to me.

395
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:28,508
They're worth a lot of money.

396
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:31,052
If I don't see every damn one
back on my desk soon,

397
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:34,430
you can tell your teddy bear
to watch his back.

398
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,152
I'll return them.
One at a time.

399
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:57,120
- Are you going to Cindy's party?
- Oh, no.

400
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:02,876
I was hoping you would.
I really wish you would.

401
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,838
Well, maybe.

402
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:09,048
That'd be great!

403
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:13,136
Do you think
I could bring my girlfriend?

404
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,472
Yeah!

405
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,267
Yeah. I mean,
I'm totally bringing somebody.

406
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,401
Wow.

407
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,361
I didn't know there were sex dolls!

408
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:32,572
Love dolls.
That's what they call them.

409
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:35,575
I saw a special on cable.

410
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:38,286
So you're serious?
Bianca really has a...

411
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:43,917
She's really
just one of the girls then.

412
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,003
I'm sorry.

413
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,797
Que un hombre se compró
una muñeca que se infla...

414
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,633
Le salen las tetas así,
el tipo se la come...

415
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:54,052
Sale volando.

416
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,263
No way!

417
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:01,226
Does she have a sister?

418
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,438
I wish I had a woman
that couldn't talk.

419
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,486
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

420
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:15,031
We don't want anything to do with her.
She's a golden calf.

421
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:17,325
We all know what happened with that.

422
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:20,036
He's not worshipping her.
They're just dating?

423
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,413
These young people have no willpower!

424
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,582
He's sick, alright? He's sick.

425
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:30,338
We were just hoping, if we came to you,
you could help pave the way a little.

426
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:33,258
If you could just try to understand...

427
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,635
- He is a nice man.
- We can try.

428
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,638
- I don't know why we're here.
- Oh, for Heaven's sake!

429
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,265
What's the big deal?

430
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:45,395
Sally, your cousin
puts dresses on his cats.

431
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,525
Hazel, your nephew
gave all his money to a UFO club.

432
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,695
Arnie, everybody knows
your first wife was a klepto.

433
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:56,656
- She wasn't! - Why is she buried
in a pair of my earrings?

434
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,117
That's enough.

435
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,494
These things happen.

436
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:04,789
Lars is a good boy.

437
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:10,336
You can depend on me.

438
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,755
Thanks, Mrs. Gruner.

439
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:17,427
Well, he's not bringing her to church,
is he, Reverend Bock?

440
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:23,516
Well...
The question is, as always,

441
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,104
what would Jesus do?

442
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:40,742
#Oh, Holy, Holy,
merciful and mighty.#

443
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:49,918
#God in three Persons.
Blessed Trinity.#

444
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,550
I would like to take the opportunity

445
00:38:57,675 --> 00:39:01,221
to welcome all of our new visitors
to our church today.

446
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:06,851
Bianca, it's good to see you.
Lars, God bless. God bless.

447
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:10,813
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

448
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,900
- Watch yourself.
- Easy, easy.

449
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,614
These are for you, Bianca.

450
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,075
Thank you.

451
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,327
Bianca, this is my friend,
Mrs. Gruner.

452
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,539
She has a darling figure.

453
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:36,381
Those are nice. They're not real,
so they'll last forever. Isn't that neat?

454
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,801
Hello.

455
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:44,430
Get back here!

456
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,466
There we go.
Watch your head on the way in.

457
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:23,803
Watch, watch!
There we go.

458
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:30,560
Are you comfortable?
I'll get the chair.

459
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,897
Can you put her seatbelt on?

460
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:36,816
Bianca, Gus is gonna
put on your seatbelt.

461
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:41,446
- And put that on her legs.
She gets cold. Thank you. - Yeah.

462
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,793
Thanks, Gus.

463
00:40:57,253 --> 00:41:00,173
Where are you guys going?

464
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,053
Just one second.

465
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:09,933
She doesn't know. It's a secret.
But I can tell you.

466
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:13,978
She's asking questions all the time
and wants to know all about me,

467
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:15,772
so I thought I'd take her

468
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:18,816
to the lake, where we used to play.

469
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:22,362
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that? - Yeah.

470
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,365
That sounds nice.

471
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:29,035
Yeah. I gotta go.

472
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,746
I'm coming
Why are you yelling?

473
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:58,231
Gus and his friends
used to come up here all the time.

474
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,775
In the summer they'd go fishing.

475
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:03,862
In the winter they'd play hockey.

476
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,786
Watch your head.

477
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:14,581
Here we go.

478
00:42:16,457 --> 00:42:17,792
That's okay.

479
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:23,548
This was our tree-house.
The rope's here.

480
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:26,134
And the ladder.

481
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:48,239
#L is for the way you look at me,#

482
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:56,080
#O is for the only one I see,#

483
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:04,005
#V is very, very extraordinary,#

484
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:13,097
#E is even more
than anyone that you adore.#

485
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:21,564
#And love
is all that I can give to you,#

486
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:29,197
#Love
is more than just a game for two.#

487
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:34,494
#Two in love can make it...#

488
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:39,290
You should watch me
chop wood, too.

489
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,126
I'm really good at it.

490
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,180
I'm sorry.

491
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:58,268
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to see how she was doing.

492
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:02,689
After the treatment, she has to rest.
It doesn't work without the resting.

493
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:08,903
Keep me company?
Lars?

494
00:44:09,696 --> 00:44:10,947
Keep me company.

495
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,419
Do you know how many sessions
she's gonna have to have?

496
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:30,508
No. I don't, it's a tricky illness.

497
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:37,765
But, what I could use
is a more complete history on her.

498
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:41,019
- Parents...
- They died when she was a baby.

499
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,190
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, but...

500
00:44:46,107 --> 00:44:48,610
She doesn't feel sorry
for herself or anything.

501
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:52,238
She just wants to be normal,
have everyone treat her normal.

502
00:44:54,908 --> 00:45:00,455
- That's nice. I admire that.
- Me too. Is that your husband?

503
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:05,126
- Yes. He died.
- Oh, no.

504
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,379
I'm sorry.

505
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:12,258
- Do you have kids?
- No.

506
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:19,390
You must get really lonely.

507
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:22,685
Sometimes I get so lonely,
I forget what day it is and

508
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,270
how to spell my name.

509
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,903
How about you?

510
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,699
You're funny.

511
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,746
So what's the difference between
a delusion and a hallucination?

512
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,084
It's false perception
versus false belief.

513
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:49,337
- So when Moose thinks
the FBI's after him... - The DEA.

514
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,757
- INS.
- IRS. ATF. AAA.

515
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,467
That would be a delusion.

516
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,845
Hey, dude,
they are after us.

517
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:05,436
My dad told me that

518
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:11,484
wood warms you three times:

519
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:16,114
first when you chop down a tree,
then when you chop it up...

520
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:38,261
- What are we doing? Why are we
doing this for him? - Come on.

521
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:41,890
It's funny.

522
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:44,392
Is it?

523
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:48,688
I don't know.

524
00:46:48,897 --> 00:46:50,440
Maybe not.

525
00:46:56,404 --> 00:46:57,947
So tell me about Karin.

526
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:03,077
- I don't know her very well.
- She's wonderful!

527
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:07,332
Gus and I are both very lucky
with women. She's wonderful.

528
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:11,920
But she...

529
00:47:16,174 --> 00:47:19,052
We don't have to talk.
Let's find you something to read.

530
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:23,681
- No, it's just... Between us?
- Of course.

531
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:29,646
I'm worried about her.

532
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:33,024
I think she has a little problem.

533
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:37,195
- Maybe you shouldn't tell me.
- No, it's okay. It's just...

534
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,368
And I think it's
'cause she's insecure, but

535
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:46,454
she's just always
trying to hug everybody.

536
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:51,167
You know, some people don't like that!
Some people don't like to be hugged.

537
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,463
But she doesn't realize that.
She takes it personally, and thinks...

538
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:58,007
You know?
It hurts her feelings.

539
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,930
I don't know what to do about that.

540
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,559
Do you?

541
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:12,272
But it's such a comfort sometimes,
to have somebody's arms around you.

542
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:13,648
Don't you think?

543
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:17,819
- No.
- Come on, it feels good.

544
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:21,322
It does not feel good.
It hurts.

545
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,162
Like a cut or a bruise?

546
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:32,876
Like a burn. Like when you go outside
and your feet freeze

547
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:36,129
and then you come back in
and they thaw out. It's like that.

548
00:48:37,797 --> 00:48:39,757
It's almost exactly like that.

549
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,135
Same with everybody?

550
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:47,473
Well, not really with Bianca.

551
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:52,353
But everyone else.

552
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:55,231
So, you don't let people touch you.

553
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:58,359
Lars, isn't that hard
to get away with?

554
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,656
Not really here,
'cause I have all these layers.

555
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:07,744
- And that helps.
- Look...

556
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:10,371
We can't change Karin.

557
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,126
But I can help you.

558
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:24,844
That's fine.

559
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,351
Pain?

560
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:33,228
Yeah, but I can take it.

561
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:44,697
Are you okay?

562
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:52,413
- Well, that's enough for today.
- Yeah. Thanks.

563
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,754
What?

564
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:01,840
Yeah, I'm okay.

565
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,022
Well, it's scientifically proven
that everyone's favorite word

566
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:20,024
is their own name, so

567
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,068
if you just

568
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,113
say their names a lot, you're okay.

569
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:29,492
You can see
it's gonna make them happy.

570
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:32,745
Okay.

571
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,347
Yeah.

572
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,183
Okay...

573
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:05,570
Mr. Sunshine!

574
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:10,074
And this must be Bianca. Welcome!
Welcome. Come on in!

575
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21,252
I have my boots on,
but I brought my shoes.

576
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:23,963
Don't worry about it. Baxter?
Baxter, baby.

577
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:26,716
Lars, this is my husband.

578
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:31,179
Hi, Lars.

579
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:34,891
Bianca...

580
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:37,685
How are you?

581
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:42,607
Is that for me, Bianca?
Thank you!

582
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:48,530
Can Baxter get you two
something to drink from the kitchen?

583
00:51:58,748 --> 00:51:59,999
Lars?

584
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:04,921
I'll have a beer.

585
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:08,258
And for Bianca?

586
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:11,719
She doesn't drink.

587
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,598
She doesn't like it when I drink either,
but I'm just gonna have one.

588
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:20,979
I can help you with your coats.

589
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:26,150
Hi. This is Margo.
And this is Bianca.

590
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:29,571
Hi. Hi, Bianca.

591
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,328
I'm glad you sent around that memo.
I would have freaked.

592
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:39,789
It's so bizarre.

593
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,459
- It's a disorder.
- What a weirdo.

594
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:45,879
Lars?

595
00:52:46,588 --> 00:52:50,341
Look at him. He's in love
with that slutty hunk of silicone.

596
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:54,012
- Her name's Bianca.
- Does he have sex with her?

597
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,055
Babe, that's what she's for.

598
00:52:57,765 --> 00:53:01,102
- So, I hear you guys
are getting married! - Yes! - No!

599
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,063
Tickle fight!

600
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:16,409
I would kill to have hair like hers.

601
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:20,371
Oh, I'd cut it to here,
long in front, short in back.

602
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:24,542
Lars would never let her cut it.
Guys and long hair...

603
00:53:27,045 --> 00:53:28,421
I don't care.

604
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:32,509
However she likes it,
that's how I like it.

605
00:53:33,635 --> 00:53:35,220
That's my kind of guy.

606
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:38,431
I need wine.

607
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:42,101
I'll get it.

608
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,106
- Anyone else?
- Oh, no. - No, thanks.

609
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,459
Dude...

610
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,964
Hey, Lars.
Bianca? Total babe.

611
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:17,095
- Thanks. - The best thing is,
she doesn't know how hot she is.

612
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,722
That's what you want in a woman.
They stay with you,

613
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:22,267
'cause they don't know
they could get somebody better.

614
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,018
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:27,522
Is she flexible?

616
00:54:41,202 --> 00:54:42,328
Yes.

617
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,701
Did you have fun?

618
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,296
Yeah.

619
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,969
I'm just happy, that's all.

620
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:33,857
And so he solaced himself
with pacing up and down the meadow

621
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,609
and writing and carving
on the bark of the trees

622
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,320
and on the fine sand
a multitude of verses,

623
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:43,783
all in harmony with his sadness.
In sum and praise of Dulcinea.

624
00:57:03,845 --> 00:57:05,513
But what distressed him greatly

625
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,391
was not having another hermit there
to confess him.

626
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:37,670
Pain?

627
00:57:38,546 --> 00:57:39,797
That's okay.

628
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:42,592
That's okay.
I can take that.

629
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:48,348
You must be excited
about a baby on the way.

630
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:53,978
Don't you want to be an uncle?

631
00:57:58,024 --> 00:57:59,609
Yeah...

632
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:07,242
- Do you ever wanna be a mom?
- I don't know.

633
00:58:17,585 --> 00:58:18,920
Yes.

634
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,927
But I'm not able
to have children of my own.

635
00:58:28,847 --> 00:58:31,057
Oh, that's too bad.

636
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:43,987
Bianca's like that, actually.

637
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:52,996
She can't have babies, either.

638
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:55,290
That's a shame.

639
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,836
When she was a baby,
her mom died in the middle of things

640
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,963
when she was being born.

641
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:04,674
Like yours.

642
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:08,553
You have a lot in common.

643
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:22,859
Lars, you know we've learned a lot
since then.

644
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:26,821
- Things are better.
- But it could still happen, right?

645
00:59:26,905 --> 00:59:29,824
It's highly unlikely. It's

646
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:33,578
rare.
- Yeah, but it still could.

647
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,585
Lars, just take a breath.

648
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:48,343
That's okay.

649
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,137
I'm sorry.

650
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,141
I'm sorry.
It's just so dangerous.

651
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,478
- I don't like to think about it.
- Lars, sit down.

652
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,188
Put your head between your knees.

653
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:02,899
Put your head between your knees.
Sit down.

654
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,029
Just put your head
between your knees. Bend over.

655
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:10,365
Okay. Okay.

656
01:00:11,324 --> 01:00:12,575
Okay.

657
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:17,997
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Take a breath.

658
01:00:28,883 --> 01:00:32,554
We should get cell phones.

659
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:36,808
Then we can call each other
whenever we want.

660
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:52,866
How about afternoons,
Mondays and Wednesdays,

661
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,909
and then maybe all day Saturday?

662
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,794
Yeah? You sure?

663
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,755
Okay!
Bianca, is that okay with you?

664
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,052
Bianca wants to volunteer
at the hospital on Thursday afternoons.

665
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:15,972
You do?

666
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:19,100
What about your blood pressure?

667
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:24,022
Just think of all the bald children.
Wouldn't they love her?

668
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:26,316
That's true.

669
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,819
A little bit of layering here
and some texture right there.

670
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:32,572
And I don't know
what you guys think, but...

671
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:38,203
- Bangs?
- I like that. - That's pretty.

672
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,790
Are you sure?
Because it's not growing back, right?

673
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:49,881
"What's That Sound?"
by Veronica Charles.

674
01:01:50,298 --> 01:01:53,760
- I hear the telephone.
- Ring! Ring!

675
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:32,048
- Hey.
- Hey.

676
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:41,975
He's not gonna get any better, is he?

677
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:47,522
No, probably not.

678
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:52,026
He's gonna love that thing

679
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:58,074
his whole life,
and it's all my fault.

680
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,996
No, it's not.

681
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:05,707
I don't know.

682
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:12,714
I mean, I left home
as fast as I could. You know?

683
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:17,218
I never thought about him.

684
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:21,681
Then the two of us
move back here all fat and happy,

685
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:25,685
and he moves into the goddamn garage
like the family dog.

686
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:30,064
And I let him.

687
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,738
No wonder he goes
and orders a fiancé in a box.

688
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:41,743
Come here.

689
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,435
There was this pair of... Benji?

690
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,271
- Oh, Basenjis?
- Basenjis!

691
01:04:10,688 --> 01:04:12,899
Yes, there were these two Basenjis.

692
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,902
They don't bark at all.

693
01:04:41,886 --> 01:04:43,137
Hello!

694
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:52,647
Bianca!

695
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,858
We're upstairs!

696
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,031
What's going on?

697
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,410
It's the hospital volunteer banquet
at the VFW.

698
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:09,038
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- She does. She looks beautiful!

699
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,376
Because...

700
01:05:15,587 --> 01:05:17,755
We were supposed to play Scrabble.

701
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:19,966
Are you sure?

702
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:21,426
Yeah.

703
01:05:21,509 --> 01:05:24,137
Her schedule's on the refrigerator.
Did you check?

704
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:28,224
No, I didn't. I forgot.

705
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,440
Could I have a moment
alone with her, please?

706
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,404
Thank you.

707
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:43,781
Thank you.

708
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,498
You're my girlfriend!

709
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,085
I shouldn't have to check a schedule
to see when you make a plan!

710
01:05:57,045 --> 01:05:59,047
You have 10 people
around you all the time!

711
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,466
You can't ask one of them
to call me and let me know?

712
01:06:01,549 --> 01:06:05,428
- They never fight. - At work I get
excited about playing Scrabble...

713
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:07,180
I don't like his tone.

714
01:06:13,394 --> 01:06:14,896
Now, you listen to me.

715
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:17,148
Bianca has a life of her own.

716
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:19,943
No self-respecting woman
is gonna be at your beck and call!

717
01:06:20,026 --> 01:06:21,653
The sooner you learn that, the better.

718
01:06:21,736 --> 01:06:24,364
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you're away
at your job all day.

719
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:28,409
What's she supposed to do? Wait for you?
Would you do that for her?

720
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:30,245
Would she even ask you to?

721
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,083
She's out in the community doing
things for others less fortunate.

722
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:37,961
- You should be proud of her.
- What about me?

723
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:41,965
Big baby.
He's just like my husband!

724
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:44,676
She'll be home at 11.

725
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,947
She's my girlfriend and I shouldn't
have to check a schedule to see her!

726
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:11,536
Are you okay?

727
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:16,249
How would she feel if I just left her?

728
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,131
- What if I abandoned her? - She didn't
abandon you. She'll be back.

729
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,593
How do I know that?

730
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:31,472
People do whatever they want.

731
01:07:32,974 --> 01:07:37,353
- They don't care.
- No, we all care. Lars, we do care.

732
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,773
No, you don't.

733
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:46,738
That is...
That is just not true! God!

734
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,450
Every person in this town

735
01:07:50,658 --> 01:07:53,953
bends over backwards
to make Bianca feel at home.

736
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:57,624
Why do you think
she has so many places to go

737
01:07:57,832 --> 01:07:59,334
and so much to do?

738
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,339
- I don't know.
- Because of you!

739
01:08:04,756 --> 01:08:08,343
Because all these people love you!

740
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:12,180
We push her wheelchair,
we drive her to work,

741
01:08:12,347 --> 01:08:16,976
we drive her home,
we wash her, we dress her,

742
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,564
we get her up,
we put her to bed, we carry her!

743
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:26,819
And she is not petite, Lars!
Bianca is a big, big girl!

744
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,742
None of this is easy for any of us,
but we do it!

745
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:37,539
God, we do it for you!

746
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,462
So don't you dare tell me
how we don't care!

747
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,730
I think it's the person's job
who's upset, to say they're upset,

748
01:09:02,814 --> 01:09:04,440
because they cannot, you know...

749
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:06,234
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

750
01:09:06,568 --> 01:09:08,736
- Hey!
- How was the game?

751
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:13,867
The cheese inspectors
beat the crap out of us.

752
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:18,037
Is everything all right?
I usually put Bianca to bed.

753
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:19,330
I know.

754
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,501
Okay, tell him.

755
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:26,296
We wanted
to talk to you about that.

756
01:09:30,842 --> 01:09:33,720
You don't have to do that anymore.
I'm gonna do that.

757
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:36,264
Are you sure?
Because I don't mind.

758
01:09:36,347 --> 01:09:37,765
I thought that you...

759
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:39,726
Sorry.

760
01:09:40,768 --> 01:09:45,356
- It's just been one of those days.
- It's... It's fine.

761
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:48,318
It's up to you.

762
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:53,948
- I'll leave you guys.
- Hey, Gus?

763
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:57,327
- What's that?
- Thank you, though.

764
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,164
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

765
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,293
Okay.

766
01:10:09,797 --> 01:10:11,049
I'm tired.

767
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:21,184
- Did I miss something?
- We had a big fight!

768
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,769
- Really?
- Yes!

769
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:37,200
Are those hand knit mittens?

770
01:10:37,784 --> 01:10:39,744
I think it's kind of cold out.

771
01:10:45,124 --> 01:10:48,169
- Lars, have you met Erik?
- Not officially.

772
01:10:48,837 --> 01:10:50,547
You're famous around here.

773
01:10:52,632 --> 01:10:53,800
I know.

774
01:10:54,634 --> 01:10:56,261
Hell of a grip too, pal.

775
01:10:58,388 --> 01:10:59,514
Yeah.

776
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,002
Yes?

777
01:11:42,015 --> 01:11:46,519
- My office.
- I think I'm gonna stay.

778
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:50,023
She's feeling pretty lousy today.

779
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:53,943
We'll both stay.

780
01:12:02,702 --> 01:12:05,330
I asked her to marry me last week.

781
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:12,128
Congratulations!

782
01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:15,548
When's the happy day?

783
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,759
She said no.

784
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:23,806
I know. I couldn't believe it.

785
01:12:26,726 --> 01:12:28,228
Yeah.

786
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:39,531
Stop it! You have no right
to talk to me like that!

787
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:40,907
No, you don't!

788
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:43,243
You don't.
I don't talk to you like that!

789
01:12:58,258 --> 01:13:00,009
Have you stopped yelling?

790
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:41,968
I was talking to Bianca

791
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:45,930
and she was saying that, in her culture,
they have these rites of passages

792
01:13:46,014 --> 01:13:48,558
and rituals and ceremonies...

793
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:51,644
Just all kinds of things
that when you do them,

794
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,730
or when you're done,
if you live through them,

795
01:13:53,813 --> 01:13:55,565
they'll let you know
you're an adult.

796
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:58,693
Doesn't that sound great?

797
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:00,987
It does.

798
01:14:02,447 --> 01:14:05,158
- How did you know?
- How did I know what?

799
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,035
That you were a man.

800
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:11,539
I couldn't tell you.

801
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:15,793
Was it...

802
01:14:16,377 --> 01:14:17,921
Was it sex?

803
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:28,056
Yeah, you know...

804
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:29,974
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of...

805
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:35,063
No. Well, it's kind of sex,
but it's not, you know?

806
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,440
I don't know.
I don't know.

807
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,943
It's a good question.

808
01:14:40,818 --> 01:14:42,487
Yeah, but I have to know.

809
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,490
Hold that thought.

810
01:14:57,502 --> 01:15:00,296
- You should ask Dagmar.
- I did ask Dagmar.

811
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,173
She said I should ask you.

812
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:09,347
- I can only give you my opinion.
- That's all I want.

813
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:11,724
It's not like
you're all one thing or the other.

814
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,393
There's still a kid inside.

815
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:16,312
But you grow up
when you decide to do right.

816
01:15:16,396 --> 01:15:19,357
Not what's right for you;
what's right for everybody.

817
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,526
Even when it hurts.

818
01:15:23,403 --> 01:15:25,071
Okay. Like, what?

819
01:15:28,408 --> 01:15:29,492
Like...

820
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:36,332
Like you don't jerk people around,
and you don't cheat on your woman,

821
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:39,961
and you take care of your family.
You admit when you're wrong.

822
01:15:40,128 --> 01:15:41,880
You try to, anyways.

823
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:45,675
That's all I can think of.

824
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:48,845
It sounds like it's easy and,
for some reason, it's not.

825
01:15:48,928 --> 01:15:52,348
- I know, because nothing's easy.
- It's like the old man.

826
01:15:52,432 --> 01:15:54,642
He didn't have
to take care of 2 kids alone.

827
01:15:54,726 --> 01:15:57,937
He could have given us to an orphanage.
People do that.

828
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:01,691
But he loved us and tried to do right,
even though he didn't know how

829
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:04,235
and even though
he had a broken heart.

830
01:16:14,746 --> 01:16:16,915
I shouldn't have left you
alone with him.

831
01:16:17,165 --> 01:16:20,627
He was too sad.
It scared me and I just...

832
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:23,338
I just ran.

833
01:16:27,008 --> 01:16:28,468
That was selfish

834
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,222
and I'm sorry.

835
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,811
That's okay.

836
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:44,025
Okay.

837
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:50,949
You've crossed the line!

838
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:55,453
- You kept swiping my action figures.
- I hide them! I don't hang them!

839
01:16:55,537 --> 01:16:58,373
Whatever, you're too old
for that thing, anyway. Okay?

840
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:02,377
- Take off the noose.
- No. - Take it off!

841
01:17:02,836 --> 01:17:06,381
Face it, Margo! The bear is dead.
Okay? Burn on you!

842
01:17:14,055 --> 01:17:15,181
I warned her.

843
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,660
It's not just the bear.

844
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:38,705
I broke up with Erik.

845
01:17:46,713 --> 01:17:48,256
I'm sorry to hear that.

846
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,719
Yeah, I didn't even
have a good reason.

847
01:17:53,303 --> 01:17:55,513
He just wasn't very interesting.

848
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:08,026
Then why was he your boyfriend?

849
01:18:11,863 --> 01:18:13,531
I get lonely.

850
01:18:16,576 --> 01:18:18,536
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

851
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:38,389
Thank you.

852
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:40,475
Sure.

853
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:46,356
Hey, what are you doing
on Friday night?

854
01:18:49,776 --> 01:18:55,198
I have a School Board meeting.
Bianca got elected, so...

855
01:18:56,991 --> 01:18:59,577
- That's great!
- Yeah. - Yeah.

856
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:04,499
Okay.

857
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:08,294
Why?

858
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:13,258
I was just thinking that maybe
we could all go out sometime.

859
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:19,973
- Never mind.
- After I drop off Bianca, I'm free.

860
01:19:20,473 --> 01:19:22,684
But just me, so...

861
01:19:27,564 --> 01:19:29,274
That would be great, Lars!

862
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:32,193
Thank you.

863
01:19:35,613 --> 01:19:36,781
Okay.

864
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,014
Nice shot.

865
01:20:26,372 --> 01:20:29,000
You're putting
too much spin on the ball.

866
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:30,251
I know.

867
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:39,677
Sorry, we're full up. Next week's
the Ladies League Tournament.

868
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:42,388
- Nada? - Dude!
- Tell them lady go.

869
01:20:42,472 --> 01:20:44,474
No way, Nelson,
they'll shred me.

870
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:47,268
Is that Lars?

871
01:20:49,687 --> 01:20:53,650
- Hey, buddy!
- We're full. - No problema!

872
01:20:58,404 --> 01:21:02,033
- I kicked your butt.
- No, no, I'll kick your butt!

873
01:21:06,496 --> 01:21:08,373
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

874
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:31,789
This was exactly what I needed.
Things look so much better!

875
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,627
Thanks for going bowling with me, Lars.

876
01:22:44,344 --> 01:22:45,678
I don't...

877
01:22:54,020 --> 01:23:01,027
I don't want to give you
the wrong idea about this.

878
01:23:03,988 --> 01:23:09,077
It's just,
I never could cheat on Bianca, ever.

879
01:23:09,494 --> 01:23:11,704
Oh! No!

880
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:16,167
Oh, my God,
I hope you didn't think that, Lars.

881
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:18,294
I would never do that.

882
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:30,390
I would never do that.

883
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:37,188
Oh, okay, good. Yeah.

884
01:23:37,397 --> 01:23:41,442
Because a man doesn't cheat
on his woman, and that's that.

885
01:23:42,527 --> 01:23:45,029
Absolutely. And vice versa.

886
01:23:45,864 --> 01:23:49,617
Besides, I don't mean
to steal anybody's boyfriend.

887
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:52,704
One day,
I'll find a man of my own and

888
01:23:54,914 --> 01:23:56,332
we'll be happy, too.

889
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:01,963
That's the way it works, I guess.

890
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,649
Thanks.

891
01:24:25,487 --> 01:24:26,946
Snow!

892
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:35,413
I was hoping that winter was over.

893
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:40,585
No, it's a thaw.
Winter isn't over till Easter.

894
01:24:48,593 --> 01:24:49,969
Thanks again.

895
01:24:51,429 --> 01:24:52,555
Hey.

896
01:25:19,624 --> 01:25:21,084
Goodnight, Lars.

897
01:25:40,395 --> 01:25:43,273
I'm not sure how well
these treatments are working.

898
01:25:43,523 --> 01:25:44,816
No?

899
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:50,947
What do you think?

900
01:25:52,949 --> 01:25:54,409
I don't know.

901
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:02,667
I'm sorry.

902
01:26:13,011 --> 01:26:15,722
I don't know.
It's hard, because

903
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:20,852
I know that she loves me, but

904
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:23,479
I ask her to marry me
and she says: "No".

905
01:26:26,566 --> 01:26:28,443
Or she says: "l don't know".

906
01:26:31,404 --> 01:26:33,281
Or she doesn't say anything.

907
01:26:38,703 --> 01:26:40,163
Nothing?

908
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:54,719
When I was a child, I spoke
as a child. I understood as a child.

909
01:27:11,152 --> 01:27:12,278
Hey...

910
01:27:58,783 --> 01:28:00,368
Wake up!

911
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:02,162
Wake up!

912
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:07,542
She won't wake up.

913
01:28:08,126 --> 01:28:12,463
- Bianca! I think she's unconscious!
- Are you sure? - Look at me. Bianca?

914
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:15,383
Hey, hey, hey!

915
01:28:15,675 --> 01:28:18,094
- Bianca's unconscious!
- Can you hear me?

916
01:28:18,178 --> 01:28:19,345
Bianca!

917
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:23,391
Wake up!

918
01:28:23,474 --> 01:28:26,769
Hey, she looks alright!
She looks alright!

919
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:29,606
- Hey, hey!
- Call 911! - Okay.

920
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:37,989
- 911? - I don't know! You always
expect me to know what to do!

921
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,709
They're here.
Call Doctor Berman.

922
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:51,794
#...you look at me,#

923
01:28:51,878 --> 01:28:54,923
#O is for the only one I see,#

924
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:58,468
#V is very, very extraordinary,#

925
01:28:58,676 --> 01:29:01,804
#E is even more than anyone...#

926
01:29:01,971 --> 01:29:04,098
I'm sorry,
you'll have to wait out here.

927
01:29:04,182 --> 01:29:05,767
#...that you adore.#

928
01:29:06,768 --> 01:29:08,937
It's okay.
The doctor's on the way.

929
01:29:10,563 --> 01:29:12,565
Hello? Hello?

930
01:29:12,732 --> 01:29:14,651
- Lars!
- Yeah.

931
01:29:25,829 --> 01:29:26,955
What?

932
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,459
What?

933
01:29:32,627 --> 01:29:34,379
Bianca's very sick.

934
01:29:36,589 --> 01:29:39,634
No, she's not.
Come on, she's not sick.

935
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:41,719
She's not! Lars?

936
01:29:44,889 --> 01:29:46,015
She's dying.

937
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,060
- But...
- God!

938
01:29:49,811 --> 01:29:52,689
We're gonna keep her here
till she's stable, but

939
01:29:53,314 --> 01:29:55,608
she wants to go home
with Lars tonight.

940
01:29:56,109 --> 01:29:57,652
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

941
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:23,595
What?

942
01:30:44,282 --> 01:30:47,368
I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.

943
01:30:47,494 --> 01:30:51,456
What's this gonna do to him?
How could you let this happen?

944
01:30:51,664 --> 01:30:56,169
I'm not letting it happen, it's Lars.
It's always been Lars.

945
01:30:57,212 --> 01:31:01,424
He's making the decisions.
He's the one who found her unconscious;

946
01:31:01,633 --> 01:31:03,885
he's the one who said she's dying.

947
01:31:17,482 --> 01:31:19,150
Are you okay back there?

948
01:31:19,984 --> 01:31:22,695
They gave her something,
so she's asleep.

949
01:31:24,447 --> 01:31:26,157
Anything you want, Lars?

950
01:31:31,996 --> 01:31:34,666
We're gonna stay together
in the pink room tonight.

951
01:33:21,564 --> 01:33:26,152
Come down to the family room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.

952
01:33:35,245 --> 01:33:37,539
We sent Gus and Karin to the movies.

953
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,667
They didn't want to leave you.

954
01:33:46,756 --> 01:33:50,510
No, I'm glad...
I'm glad they left.

955
01:33:50,927 --> 01:33:54,597
I feel terrible that all this is
happening so close to the baby coming.

956
01:33:54,681 --> 01:33:58,059
That's how life is, Lars.
Everything at once.

957
01:33:58,476 --> 01:34:00,145
We brought casseroles.

958
01:34:01,938 --> 01:34:03,189
Thank you.

959
01:34:10,947 --> 01:34:13,825
Is there something
I should be doing right now?

960
01:34:14,033 --> 01:34:16,452
- No, dear.
- You eat.

961
01:34:18,204 --> 01:34:19,706
We came over to sit.

962
01:34:20,206 --> 01:34:22,750
That's what people do
when tragedy strikes.

963
01:34:22,917 --> 01:34:24,586
They come over and sit.

964
01:34:26,087 --> 01:34:27,213
Okay.

965
01:34:30,758 --> 01:34:32,760
Don't you feel a little better?

966
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:55,992
I got spring fever, we're going
to the lake. You wanna come?

967
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:07,462
Lars, why don't you come with us?

968
01:35:07,629 --> 01:35:09,547
It would do everybody good.

969
01:35:16,846 --> 01:35:18,306
Bianca?

970
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,559
Don't you wanna see
this beautiful day?

971
01:35:35,782 --> 01:35:38,785
- Is there a storm coming?
- The weather said no.

972
01:35:43,081 --> 01:35:44,958
Looks like a storm to me.

973
01:35:46,084 --> 01:35:50,296
Well, I need to stretch my legs.
Let's take a chance.

974
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:58,137
Lars?

975
01:36:01,558 --> 01:36:03,434
We're gonna watch the water.

976
01:36:04,477 --> 01:36:09,482
- We won't be far.
- Holler if you need us. - Okay.

977
01:37:58,299 --> 01:38:02,220
- You think it's not that color?
- It doesn't match the curtains.

978
01:38:03,096 --> 01:38:06,766
- I think so. Here, just be careful.
- Okay.

979
01:38:14,482 --> 01:38:15,650
Gus...

980
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:21,573
No. Don't run. Lars!

981
01:38:23,658 --> 01:38:24,826
Lars!

982
01:38:50,435 --> 01:38:57,192
Lars asked us not to wear black today.
He did so to remind us

983
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,445
that this is no ordinary funeral.

984
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:07,869
We are here to celebrate
Bianca's extraordinary life.

985
01:39:10,371 --> 01:39:13,500
From her wheelchair,
Bianca reached out

986
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:15,710
and touched us all

987
01:39:16,377 --> 01:39:19,797
in ways
we could have never imagined.

988
01:39:21,883 --> 01:39:23,218
She was a teacher.

989
01:39:26,387 --> 01:39:29,265
She was a lesson in courage.

990
01:39:34,604 --> 01:39:36,397
And Bianca loved us all.

991
01:39:38,483 --> 01:39:39,943
Especially Lars.

992
01:39:43,404 --> 01:39:45,073
Especially him.

993
01:40:31,035 --> 01:40:32,412
Hi.

994
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:35,331
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry, I just...

995
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:42,005
I don't know, it's just funerals
and mom and dad, you know.

996
01:40:49,762 --> 01:40:52,765
- He's unbelievable, huh?
- He is.

997
01:40:58,855 --> 01:41:02,066
I wanted to thank you for...

998
01:41:11,576 --> 01:41:12,619
Gus!

999
01:41:15,872 --> 01:41:16,915
Yeah.

1000
01:41:20,043 --> 01:41:22,253
So, shall we see you at the house?

1001
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,756
- Of course.
- Okay. - Sure.

1002
01:41:54,869 --> 01:41:57,747
She asked me not to be sad,
but I can't help it.

1003
01:42:01,626 --> 01:42:03,211
Yeah. Me neither.

1004
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:08,883
But it'll get better with time.

1005
01:42:11,386 --> 01:42:13,680
That's what everyone keeps saying,
so...

1006
01:42:15,765 --> 01:42:18,476
It's true, I think, in a way.

1007
01:42:23,565 --> 01:42:25,900
But there'll never be
anybody like her.

1008
01:42:49,382 --> 01:42:51,134
I suppose we should

1009
01:42:53,136 --> 01:42:54,888
catch up with everyone.

1010
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,189
Do you wanna take a walk?

1011
01:43:06,608 --> 01:43:07,859
Yes.

1012
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:20,121
