17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,999
500 years had passed,
and still the country remained closed.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,074
Cut off from the world,
knowing neither hope nor despair...

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,239
...the land breathed an air
of quiet stagnation.

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,236
Reformers driven to armed
rebellion...

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,710
...had been suppressed by the State.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,913
The House of Takemikazuchi...

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,269
...were assassins hired
to suppress the rebels.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,835
From ancient times...

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,273
...they had been guards to
the rulers of a neighboring kingdom.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,035
That country, modernizing,
had overthrown its monarch.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,472
Driven into exile,
they had reached this land.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,593
Now they were a tribe of assassins...

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,199
...who would kill anyone
they were paid to.

30
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,398
The Takemikazuchi...

31
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,239
Mother...

32
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,957
Byakurai wants you.

33
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,951
Anka fled this morning.

34
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,872
He who flees the Takemikazuchi
is a traitor who will sell our secrets.

35
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,918
He's headed across Shikon Mountain.

36
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,673
But with his leg, he won't have
reached the old mine yet.

37
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,474
Yuki...

38
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,352
...take Kiri with you.

39
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,913
I'll go alone.

40
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,913
I'll go!

41
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,918
He'll slow me down.

42
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,959
Take me with you!
Byakurai told you to!

43
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,630
Could you really kill Anka?

44
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes.

45
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,716
What if he begged?

46
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,749
I'd still kill him!

47
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,753
I don't think so.

48
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,438
Yuki... it's you...

49
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,790
I'm unarmed. Don't kill me.

50
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,516
Please...

51
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,672
Take my sword.

52
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,797
Tell them you killed me, OK?

53
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,076
- I see I'm no match for you any more, Yuki.
- Who are you?

54
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,518
My name is Kuka.
I served your mother.

55
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
I have something to tell you.

56
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,199
It's about who killed your mother.

57
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,477
You were told she died
in an attack...

58
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,911
...but it was Byakurai
who killed her.

59
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,239
- Liar!
- Byakurai killed your mother Azora...

60
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,153
...Princess Takemikazuchi.

61
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,991
You must either take revenge
and succeed to your mother's place...

62
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,878
...or leave.

63
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,230
Tomorrow you turn 20.

64
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,112
On that day a princess assumes
leadership of the Takemikazuchi.

65
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,036
You must choose either
to take over the House...

66
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,634
...or to leave it.

67
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,793
If you choose to leave,
come to the old mine.

68
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,198
I have delivered
the message of Azora.

69
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,676
Did Anka beg for his life?

70
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,115
Did my mother beg for hers?

71
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,472
What do you mean?

72
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,557
Your voice is shaking.

73
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,638
Your mind's racing.

74
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,514
Are you aware what you're doing?

75
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,231
Tell me.

76
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,556
Byakurai... did you kill my mother?

77
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,192
No.

78
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,957
Put up your sword, Yuki.
I'll overlook this.

79
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,038
I didn't want to tell you.

80
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,518
Your mother was killed because
she meant to betray us and flee.

81
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,238
Liar!

82
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,713
Lashing out won't help!

83
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,315
I have no choice. Die!

84
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,878
Wonderful news from
the Union Assembly.

85
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,634
Under our Great Leader,
we are winning the production war.

86
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,790
The Ministry of Consumption
reports...

87
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,313
...living standards have risen
20 per cent over the past year.

88
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,830
Celebrating this news the citizens
have come out into the streets...

89
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,560
...in a spontaneous parade.

90
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,632
Aya?

91
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,791
What is it?

92
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,791
Is this to kill me with?

93
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,151
You're a Takemikazuchi, aren't you.

94
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,912
Who hired you?

95
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,156
Talk.

96
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,117
Where are the others?

97
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,833
There's no one else coming.
I'm not here to kill you.

98
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,558
Liar.

99
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,270
You think I believe that?

100
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,879
Trust me.

101
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,398
Trust you?

102
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,879
You guys kill anyone you're paid to.

103
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,194
If I trust you I'll end up dead.

104
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,350
If I was after you...

105
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,956
...you'd be dead now.

106
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,673
Trust me?

107
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,514
- Doesn't that hurt?
- Yes...

108
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,116
...if you let it.

109
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,719
I saw a girl.

110
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,393
Where is she?

111
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,476
I'm alone here.

112
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,278
- That's my bed.
- Good night.

113
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,230
We lost her at the road
through the Forest Zone.

114
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,115
You came back to tell me that?

115
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,354
No.

116
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,435
Someone saw a truck.

117
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,108
We'll watch the road.

118
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,713
She'll be back.

119
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,476
She wants revenge.

120
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,196
- Someone told her.
- Who?

121
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,798
Hmm...

122
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,151
Yuki's 20 today.

123
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,954
Whoever told her about Azora
knew that, and what it means.

124
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,832
Kuka...

125
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,314
So you think she wants to kill you
to avenge Azora?

126
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,990
That means she'll come here.

127
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,072
If Kuka wanted to talk to Yuki,
where would he call her to?

128
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,037
To his home?

129
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,073
I'd find a better place than that.

130
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,079
How have you been?
It's Kidokoro.

131
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,917
I'm back. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

132
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,995
I'll come today.

133
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,678
No. I'll come to you...

134
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,756
...the day after tomorrow.

135
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,509
Roger.

136
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,550
I'll be waiting at the usual place.

137
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,758
A man had pledged with Azora,
heir to the House of Takemikazuchi.

138
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,356
He swore fealty to the House...

139
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,196
...but Byakurai framed him
as a traitor and killed him.

140
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,073
That man was my father?

141
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,075
You wouldn't remember.
You'd only just turned two.

142
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,112
There were still many
of Takemikazuchi blood.

143
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,269
Byakurai sought to
marry Azora himself...

144
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,313
...and make the House
of Takemikazuchi his.

145
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,271
But Azora refused.

146
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,594
Discouraged, she sought to bring
the Takemikazuchi to an end.

147
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,309
Byakurai found out and killed her.

148
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,115
Then everything changed.

149
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,749
Many were unhappy with Byakurai,
and tried to leave.

150
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,472
But only very few...

151
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,755
...managed to escape.

152
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,228
Princess Azora was killed here.

153
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,074
I'm sure she hoped you would
leave the Takemikazuchi.

154
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,275
She wanted you to succeed
where she had failed.

155
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,954
You need not take revenge on Byakurai.

156
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,875
The fate of the Takemikazuchi
is to disappear.

157
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,917
Princess Yuki...

158
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,113
Your mother had been tortured
almost to death...

159
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,079
...but the final blow came from me.

160
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,475
Kill me if you will.

161
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,676
My life since then has been one
of waiting for this day.

162
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,353
I offered to accompany
her to the next world...

163
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,397
...but she wouldn't allow it.

164
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,472
I was commanded
to tell you everything...

165
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,191
...when you reached 20 years of age.

166
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,397
If Princess Yuki were to do me
the honor of killing me...

167
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,596
Don't say that.

168
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,112
There's no point.

169
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,353
So it was you, Kuka...

170
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,438
Soma...

171
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,551
My, how you've grown!

172
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,076
By your leave...

173
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,598
Kuka!

174
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,672
This is what I wanted!

175
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,594
Princess Yuki! Don't die!

176
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,399
Kill me if you want...

177
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,233
...but don't raise your blades
against Princess Yuki!

178
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,472
That I can't promise.

179
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,038
Kuka!

180
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,913
When I was small...

181
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,751
...I was always happy.

182
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,596
I never dreamed...

183
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,749
...things would turn out like this.

184
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,997
You know why people thought
that way then?

185
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,838
It's because no one had any ideals.

186
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,194
Yes, people died when
we put a bomb in the Assembly.

187
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,952
But it was very effective.

188
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,838
You should be proud.

189
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,639
It was a holiday.
No one was supposed to be there.

190
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,030
You told me that.

191
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,152
Losses are inevitable.
You don't get something for nothing.

192
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,553
Mimura knew that.
His death wasn't wasted.

193
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,993
No one pays any attention
unless a few dozen citizens die.

194
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,592
I'd like to move on to the next
project.

195
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,039
Mr Sugimoto...

196
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,638
...didn't think so.

197
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,513
He called you while I was gone?

198
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,232
Last month.

199
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,235
He's been expelled.

200
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,590
I trust you.

201
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,195
We have to do whatever's necessary
to achieve our ideals.

202
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,518
Takashi...

203
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:17,795
...what's the safest place in the
jungle?

204
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,200
On the lion's back.

205
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,029
The fleas there enjoy
the most peaceful life there is.

206
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,798
Hey...

207
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,753
Hey...

208
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,678
Hey!

209
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,351
Shit!

210
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,916
Where are you bleeding?

211
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,989
You need protein, or you won't heal.

212
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,552
Put these on.

213
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:59,749
That's all there is here.

214
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,237
Hurry up!

215
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,271
It suits you.

216
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,518
What are you doing?

217
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,271
Throwing these out.

218
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,191
You saw Mr Kidokoro?

219
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:11,271
You saw Mr Kidokoro?

220
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:14,876
Takashi... be careful of him.

221
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,278
Did you hear about Sugimoto?

222
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,597
Did you hear about Sugimoto?

223
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:28,992
He's dead.

224
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,598
Murdered.

225
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,070
I'm leaving this country.

226
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,991
There's happiness somewhere.
You just have to go there.

227
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,198
Who's that?

228
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,956
A guest.

229
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,711
A guest?

230
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,158
So you've found happiness?

231
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,353
Take care.

232
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:19,755
Call me if you want to come.

233
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,677
Thanks.

234
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,356
Why did you come back?

235
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,028
What's happened now?

236
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:41,398
Don't want to say?

237
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,349
It's probably safer for me
if I don't know.

238
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,990
Does it bother you to kill someone?

239
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,191
Why do you kill people?

240
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,479
For money?

241
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,153
My body moves.

242
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:22,075
When I hold my sword and close in
on a target, my body just moves...

243
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:26,034
...before I can think why.

244
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,389
Aw, you poor dear!

245
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,916
Some king stops paying his guards...

246
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,628
...so they put their skills
on the market.

247
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,195
You kill people for no reason.

248
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,956
Not to defend your country,
not to defend yourselves...

249
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:59,196
You have nothing to defend.
You just kill.

250
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,476
But I had...

251
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,236
...a reason.

252
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:21,711
I had a reason.

253
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:27,239
I'm sure I had...

254
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,231
...a reason to kill.

255
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,918
Come with me.

256
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,552
My sister.

257
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,829
When she was eight...

258
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:45,629
...I came home from school
to find blood everywhere...

259
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:50,316
...and just her alive.

260
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:00,549
The guys who did it were let off
for lack of evidence.

261
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,871
So I killed them myself.

262
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,990
I was caught, tried, and sentenced.

263
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:20,595
Four years later when I got out,
I couldn't see things...

264
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:23,638
...the way I had before.

265
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,911
Everything looked completely
different.

266
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,110
Then I met someone...

267
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:44,711
...who said he wanted me to be
as happy as I'd been before.

268
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:49,034
No one else said that.

269
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,518
I've done things,
and been pushed into doing things.

270
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,869
To get back to being happy,
I've rationalized everything.

271
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,557
Renkyo?

272
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,597
Yes.

273
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:02,274
I need to talk to you.

274
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,597
About what?

275
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,635
Can we really kill Yuki?

276
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,909
Without her, we have no leader
of Takemikazuchi blood.

277
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,830
- And then...
- Then what?

278
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,157
We've already lost just about
everyone of Takemikazuchi blood.

279
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,673
But what reason do we have to exist...

280
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,788
- ...without that name?
- We don't need a reason.

281
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,389
Now we have nothing left
to guard any more.

282
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:08,913
I venerated our ancestors,
I believed in the motherland.

283
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,268
But when the monarchy fell...

284
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,318
...our swords were taken from us.

285
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,278
Those who were caught had
their memories erased with drugs...

286
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,108
...and to slow their arms...

287
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,390
...needles driven into their elbows.

288
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,758
We fled, without turning our swords
on the motherland.

289
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,677
Remember, Renkyo?

290
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:05,192
Those tanks on that southern island
we saw as we went?

291
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:10,153
A group of ruined tanks...

292
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,113
...all eaten away by acid rain...

293
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:19,558
...and stinking of corpses.

294
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:25,795
But there were no corpses.

295
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,394
The stench was coming from us.

296
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,278
At that time...

297
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,351
...we were dead.

298
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,598
Hello?

299
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,595
- Hello?
- It's me.

300
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,597
Mr Kidokoro...

301
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,030
Why are you phoning?

302
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:47,990
I sent you a schematic.
Can you take a look at it?

303
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,718
Sure.

304
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,470
Be right back.

305
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,236
Did you see it?
I want to move in ten days.

306
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:19,432
Are you there?

307
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,317
Ten days...

308
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:25,597
I can't.

309
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:28,955
OK, when?

310
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:37,872
Never.

311
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,752
No?

312
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,877
No.

313
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,955
All right. I'll be in touch.

314
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,680
You always look so sad...

315
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,710
And you have no expression at all.
Have you ever been sad?

316
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:35,955
I make it go away. Just like pain.

317
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,118
And that's how you can kill people?

318
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:55,591
When you're sad you should grieve,
and when you're happy, celebrate.

319
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,510
Have you ever laughed?

320
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,076
When I'm sad I grieve.

321
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,751
For hours...

322
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,232
For days...

323
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,551
For years...

324
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,755
Have you ever heard of
a miki-ishi?

325
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,990
No.

326
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,874
It means 'beautiful precious stone'.

327
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,278
They're rare.

328
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,999
You can look all year
and be lucky to find even one.

329
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:44,036
When you grind it on a whetstone,
you get a little green crystal.

330
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,115
My mother collected them.

331
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,788
When she found one,
she'd carefully polish and save it.

332
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,353
When she had 30,
she was going to make a necklace...

333
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,355
...for my wedding day.

334
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:20,433
She said she'd put it around my neck
the day I got married.

335
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,997
She started collecting them at 18...

336
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,591
...had me at 22...

337
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,990
...and died at 27.

338
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,716
...and died at 27.

339
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,718
...in a little treasure box.

340
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,159
Not enough for a necklace.

341
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:11,355
Soon I'll pass the age
she was when she had me...

342
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,630
...and then her age when she died.

343
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,952
But I haven't collected anything
I could leave...

344
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,476
...to anyone.

345
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:45,755
I don't have anyone
to leave anything to.

346
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,711
There's no one...

347
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:05,478
...I feel like I want to treasure.

348
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,791
Let's leave here...

349
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,112
...leave this country.

350
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,472
There's nothing holding us here.

351
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,910
Somewhere there must be a place
we can forget everything.

352
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:16,478
Let's go there.

353
01:10:08,839 --> 01:10:10,397
Mother...

354
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:14,077
...now...

355
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,957
...I'm happy.

356
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,191
You think you'll ever be happy?

357
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:34,392
Even if you kill me,
you still walk the path of blood.

358
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,067
You can't avoid it.

359
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:41,990
Mr Kidokoro...

360
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:51,316
Your sister looks well.

361
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,316
What do you want?

362
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,710
Oh...

363
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:05,433
If it's about that schematic...

364
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,109
No. I changed plans.

365
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:21,837
This one's a great idea.
I'm sure you'll like it.

366
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,989
What is it?

367
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,357
We find common ground
with the government.

368
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:39,788
We achieve our ideals,
and very few people get hurt.

369
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,948
What do you think, Takashi?
Good plan, huh?

370
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:26,477
You're selling me out?

371
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,194
It's a deal. We respect the law,
and our ideals are realized.

372
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:33,912
Traitor!

373
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,468
In spirit we will continue.

374
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,270
The plan I sent you was to be the
last.

375
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:43,919
Because we'd all be killed?

376
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,669
Don't talk like that!

377
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,595
Isn't that what you've wanted
all along anyway?

378
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,874
- But this way you're safe.
- I said it was a deal!

379
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:00,868
A fair deal.

380
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,915
So why did we do all that?

381
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,511
Why all those victims?!

382
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,957
It meant something. We all acted
because we believed in our ideals.

383
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,749
No. We believed in you!

384
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,988
No. We believed in you!

385
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:22,991
...Mimura blown up...

386
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,595
They all believed in you!

387
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,428
You said we'd be happy again.

388
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,035
You're the only one who did!

389
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:35,509
Happiness will come.

390
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,031
Of course it won't be free.
I told you the price would be high.

391
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:44,511
All we can do is pray for the victims.

392
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,595
But you don't have to pray, Takashi.

393
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,995
You're one of the victims
we'll be praying for.

394
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,357
You bastard!

395
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,991
I am Azora's daughter...

396
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:21,718
...Princess Yuki
of the Takemikazuchi.

397
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,598
In the name of my mother,
I take your life!

398
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,912
Don't you understand?

399
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,515
It's over! Get lost!

400
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,629
I'll keep this.

401
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:54,877
Live.

402
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:00,158
Be happy.

403
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,672
Live for me.

404
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,549
Takashi...

405
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,232
Takashi...
