1
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,480
I owe everything to George Bailey...
Help him, dear Father.

2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,320
Joseph, Jesus and Mary.
Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
Help my son, George, tonight.

4
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,600
He never thinks about himself,
God, that's why he's in trouble.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,840
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God...

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,800
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight...

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Please, God, something's
the matter with Daddy...

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,320
Please bring Daddy back.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,720
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.

11
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,440
A lot of people asking for help for
a man named George Bailey.

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,840
George Bailey. Yes. Tonight's
his crucial night. You're right.

13
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,200
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,720
That's why I came to see you, sir.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,120
It's that clock-maker's turn again.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,480
Oh, Clarence. Hasn't got
his wings yet, has he?

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,600
We've passed him up right along.

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,920
Because, you know, sir, he's
got the I.Q. of a rabbit.

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Yes, but he's got the faith
of a child. Simple.

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Joseph, send for Clarence.

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
You sent for me, sir?

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,520
Yes, Clarence. A man down
on earth needs our help.

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
Splendid! Is he sick?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,280
No. Worse. He's discouraged.

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
At exactly ten forty-five
P.M., earth-time,

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,080
that man will be thinking seriously of
throwing away God's greatest gift.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Oh, dear, dear! His life!
Then I have only an hour to dress.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,120
What are they wearing now?

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,480
You will spend that hour getting
acquainted with George Bailey.

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Sir, lf I should accomplish this mission,
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
I've been waiting for over two
hundred years now, sir...

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,120
and people are beginniing to talk.

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
What's that book you've got there?

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
Clarence, you do a good job with
George Bailey and you'll get your wings.

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,720
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

37
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Poor George. Sit down.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Sit down?! What are we...

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
If you're going to help a man, you want
to know something about him, don't you?

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,800
- Well, naturally, of course, I...
- Well, keep your eyes open.

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,640
- See the town?
- Where? I... I don't see a thing.

42
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Oh, I forgot. You haven't
got your wings yet.

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Now look, I'll help you out.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,400
Concentrate.

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
Begin to see something?

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,880
Why, yes! This is amazing!

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,560
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

48
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, wonderful!

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Yippee!

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay, boys, let's go.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Hey, who's that?

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,880
- That's your problem, George Bailey.
- A boy?!

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,280
That's him when he was twelve.
Back in nineteen nineteen.

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,600
Something happens here you'll
have to remember later on.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,520
Come on, Marty. Come on, Marty.

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

57
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,000
And here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother, Harry Bailey!

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm not scared!

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Go, Harry! C'mon, Harry!
Attaboy, Harry! Come on, Harry!

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,400
Help, George! Help! Help!

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,120
...Harry, I'm coming!

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm coming! Chain Gang!

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,120
George saved his brother's life that day.

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,800
But it caught him that cold
which infected his left ear.

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,880
It was weeks before he was able
to go back to his after-school job

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
at old man Gower's Drugstore.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Potter!

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Who's that? A king?

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,360
That's Henry F. Potter.

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
The richest and meanest
man in the county.

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,080
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave...

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,360
I wish I had a million
dollars! Hot dog!

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,760
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,920
- You're late
- Yes, sir.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Hello, George. Hello, Mary.

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
Hello, Violet.

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,760
Two-cents' worth of shoelaces?

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
She was here first.

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm still thinking.

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Shoelaces?

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,840
Please, Georgie. I like him.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,720
You like every boy.

85
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,560
What's wrong with that?

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,720
Here you are.

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,480
- Help me down.
- Help you down?!

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Made up your mind yet?

89
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll take chocolate.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
With coconuts?

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't like coconuts.

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
You don't like coconuts?

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,960
Look it here... from Tahiti,
Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,080
A new magazine! I never saw it before.

96
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
Of course you never.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Only us explorers can get it.

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,480
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

100
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,520
George Bailey, I'll love
you till the day I die.

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm going out exploring
some day, you watch.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,280
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems,
and maybe three or four wives.

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,640
Wait and see.

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
- George! George!
- Yes, sir.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,640
You're not paid to be a canary.

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
No, sir...

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Mr. Gower, do you want something?

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,880
- Anything?
- No.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,200
- Anything I can do back here?
- Nope.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll get them, sir.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,960
...take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine's.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
- She's waiting for them.
- Yes, sir...

113
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,280
They have the diphtheria
there, haven't they, sir?

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,400
Ummm.

115
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Is it a charge, sir?

116
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Yes, charge.

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,920
- Mr. Gower, I think...
- Aw, get going!

118
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,560
Fast there, Captain Cook!
Where you headin'?

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,800
- Some other time, George.
- It's important!

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,560
There's a squall in there that's
shapin' up into a storm.

123
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
Uncle Billy, telephone.

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,040
- Who is it?
- The Bank examiner.

125
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Bank examiner?

126
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh, I should have called him yesterday.

127
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
Switch it inside.

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

129
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Well, you're begging and
that's a whole lot worse.

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
All I'm asking for is thirty days more.

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
- Pop!
- Just a minute, son.

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Just thirty short days. I'll dig up
that five thousand somehow.

133
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
- Shove me up. Shove me up.
- Pop!

134
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Have you put any real pressure on these
people of yours to pay those mortgages?

135
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,080
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of
these people are out of work.

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
- Then foreclose!
- I can't do that.

137
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
- These families have children.
- Pop!

138
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
They're not my children.

139
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,920
But they're somebody's
children, Mr. Potter.

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,200
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,400
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

142
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Mr. Potter, what makes you such
a hard-skulled character?

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,920
You have no family, no children.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,880
You can't begin to spend
all the money you've got.

145
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,800
So I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures like you

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,520
and that idiot brother of
yours to spend for me.

147
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,880
He's not a failure!

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,240
- You can't say that about my father!
- George, George, quiet. George...

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,000
You're not! You're the
biggest man in town!

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
- Run along.
- Bigger than him.

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,520
- Run along!
- Bigger than everybody!

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't let him say things
like that about you, Pop.

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
All right, son. All right.

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
Thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.

156
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
What!

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

158
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,520
It'll be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

159
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,520
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,320
I feel...

161
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,360
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, sir, I...

162
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
What kind of tricks are
you playing anyway?

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Why didn't you deliver
them right away?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,000
You're hurting my sore ear.

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,520
You lazy loafer!

167
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
Mr. Gower, you don't know
what you're doing.

168
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

169
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
I know you're unhappy.

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,880
You got that telegram and you're upset.

171
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
You put something bad in those capsules.

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,560
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

173
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Just look and see what you did.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,440
Look at the bottle you
took the powder from.

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
It's poison! I tell you it's poison!

176
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,720
I know you feel bad.

177
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
I didn't know...

178
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
- Oh...
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no, no...

180
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, George. George...

181
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,120
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
I know what you're feeling.

183
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
I won't tell a soul.

184
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,280
- Hope to die, I won't.
- Oh, George, George...

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,040
An overnight bag, genuine
English cowhide,

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,280
combination lock, fitted up
with brushes, combs...

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,840
Nope! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

188
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Now look, Joe. Now look,

189
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,440
I, I-I want a big one.

190
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,580
What did you stop it for?

191
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,060
I want you to take a
good look at that face.

192
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,060
- Who is it?
- George Bailey.

193
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,380
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

194
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,980
That's the kid.

195
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,700
Uh-huh. It's a good face.

196
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,220
I like it. I like George Bailey.

197
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,780
Tell me, did he ever tell
anyone about the pills?

198
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,220
Not a soul.

199
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,100
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

200
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,580
Well, wait and see.

201
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,740
Big... see... I, I don't want
one for one night.

202
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,820
I want something for a thousand
and one nights.

203
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,420
With plenty of room here for labels from
Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand...

204
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,540
a great big one.

205
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,500
- I see, a flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,380
I don't suppose you'd like this old
second-hand job, would you?

207
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,620
Now you're talking.

208
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,620
Gee whiz, I could use that as
a raft in case the boat sunk.

209
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,540
- How much does this cost?
- No charge.

210
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,900
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded as if you said no charge.

211
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
That's right.

212
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,660
Well, what's my name doing on it here?

213
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,540
A little present form old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

214
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,500
He did?!

215
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,500
What do you know about that...
my old boss. Isn't that nice?

216
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,500
What boat you sailing on?

217
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

218
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,540
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

219
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,380
- Hello, Mr. Gower.
- George!

220
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,060
How are you? Thanks ever
so much for the baggage.

221
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,660
- It's just exactly what I wanted.
- Aw, forget it.

222
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,460
Oh, it's wonderful of
you to think of it.

223
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,060
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

224
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,540
I wish I had a million dollars. Hot dog!

225
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,460
Avast there, Captain Cook!
You got your sealegs yet?

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,900
Parlez vous Francais, Mister?

227
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Hey, send us some of their picture
postcards, will you, George?

228
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,820
Hey, George, don't take
any plugged nickels.

229
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,860
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

230
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,220
Hey, Ernie! Hi, Ernie!

231
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,260
- Hiya, George.
- Hi, Bert.

232
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,340
- George...
- Hey, hey, I, I'm a rich tourist today.

233
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,060
- How about driving me home in style?
- Great.

234
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,420
Hop in Your Highness, hop in.
And for the carriage trade.

235
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,020
I put on my hat.

236
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,180
- Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
- Hello, Violet.

237
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,380
Hey, you look good. That's some
dress you got on there.

238
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,020
What! This old thing?

239
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,380
Why, I only wear it when
I don't care how I look.

240
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,740
- How would you like...
- Yes.

241
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,380
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

242
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,660
No, thanks. I, uh, I've gotta go
home and see what the wife's doing.

243
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,020
Family man.

244
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,140
George! Harry!

245
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,460
You're shaking the house down! Stop it!

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,460
Oh, let them alone! I wish I
was up there with them.

247
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,940
But Harry'll tear his
dinner suit! George!

248
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,380
That's why all children
should be girls.

249
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,700
But if they were all girls,
there wouldn't be any...

250
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,220
Oh, never mind.

251
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,700
George! Harry! Come down
to dinner this minute.

252
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,700
Everything's getting cold and you know,
how long we've been waiting for you.

253
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,460
Okay, Mom!

254
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,780
- Here's a present for you, Pop.
- Oh, you two idiots!

255
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,780
- George, sit down and have dinner.
- I've eaten.

256
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,300
Well, aren't you going to finish
dressing for your graduating party?

257
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,420
- Look at you!
- I don't care.

258
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,140
It's George's tux. Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

259
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,580
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom.

260
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,980
Annie, I'm in love with you,
there's a moon out tonight.

261
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,820
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, my last meal
in the old Bailey Boarding House.

262
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,980
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

263
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,380
Pop, can I have the car? I have to
take over a lot of plates and things.

264
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,580
- What plates?
- Oh, Mom,

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,140
I'm Chairman of the Eats Committee
and we only need a couple of dozen.

266
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,620
Oh, no, you don't. Harry, now,
not my best Haviland.

267
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,660
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

268
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,540
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

269
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll miss you too, Pop. What's
the matter? You look tired.

270
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,180
- Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
- Oh.

271
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,180
I thought when we put him on the board of
Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.

272
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,020
Oh, what's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

273
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,580
Oh, he's a sick man.
Frustrated and sick.

274
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,260
And his mind's sick in
his soul, if he has one.

275
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,180
He hates everybody that has
anything that he can't have.

276
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,900
He hates us mostly, I guess.

277
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,580
Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.

278
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,780
So long!

279
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,780
- Harry, you got a match?
- Very funny. Very funny.

280
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,260
Put those things in the car and I'll
get your tie and studs ready for you.

281
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,860
- Now, hurry up, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.

282
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,140
- You coming later?
- Don't you drop one of those.

283
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,260
- You coming later, George?
- What do you mean,

284
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,220
- and be bored to death?
- Couldn't want a better death.

285
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,460
Lots of pretty girls, and we're going
to use that new floor tonight, too.

286
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,300
- Oh, I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, son!

287
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,860
- Aw, Pop, just a little.
- No, son. Not one drop.

288
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,060
Oh!

289
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,260
Boys and girls and music...
why do they need gin?

290
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,380
Father, did I act like that when
I graduated from high school?

291
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Pretty much.

292
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,820
You know, George, I wish we could
send Harry to college with you.

293
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,380
Your mother and I talked
it over half the night.

294
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,620
Mmm, we have that all figured out.

295
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,780
Harry'll take my job at the Building
and Loan, and work there four years,

296
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,060
then he'll go.

297
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,020
- He's pretty young for that job.
- Well, no younger than I was.

298
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Maybe you were born older, George.

299
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,820
How's that?

300
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,540
I say, you were born older.

301
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,820
I suppose you've decided what you
want to do when you get out of college.

302
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Oh well, you know what I've always
talked about... build things...

303
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,220
design new buildings...
plan modern cities...

304
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,180
- all that stuff.  - Still after that
first million before you're thirty.

305
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,620
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.

306
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,660
'Course it's just a hope, but uh,

307
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,260
you wouldn't consider coming back
to the Building and Loan, would you?

308
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,780
Well, I... I... Why, Annie, why,
why don't you draw up a chair?

309
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,860
Then you'd be more comfortable and you
could hear everything that's going on.

310
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,300
I would if I thought I'd hear
anything worth listening to.

311
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,180
You would, eh?

312
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,060
- I know it's soon to talk about it.
- Oh, now, Pop. I, I,

313
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:28,460
I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for
the rest of my life in a shabby little office...

314
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,900
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop, I
didn't mean it that way,

315
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,380
but this business of nickels and
dimes and spending all your life

316
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,100
trying to figure out how to save three
cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy.

317
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,740
I... I wanna do something
big and something important.

318
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,260
You know, George, I feel that in a small
way we are doing something important.

319
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,580
Satisfying a fundamental urge.

320
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,100
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

321
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,620
And we're helping him get those
things in our shabby little office.

322
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,780
I know, Pop. I, uh, I, I know
that I, I... I wish I felt...

323
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,620
but I, I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

324
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,820
Most of my friends have
already finished college.

325
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,420
I, uh, I just feel like if
I didn't get away, I'd bust.

326
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,540
Yes, yes. You're right, son.

327
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,420
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

328
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,460
This town is no place for any man
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

329
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,700
And you've got talent,
son. I've seen it.

330
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,180
You get yourself an education.
Then get out of here.

331
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,820
Pop, you want a shock?

332
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
I think you're a great guy.

333
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,820
Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

334
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,740
I heard it. About time one
of you lunkheads said it.

335
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm going to miss old Annie.

336
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,820
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

337
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,260
Have a good time, son.

338
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,180
Here you are.

339
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,260
George! Hello!

340
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,580
You know my kid brother, George?
I'm going to put him through college.

341
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,260
- Hello, George!
- Hee-haw!

342
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh, oh, Sam Wainwright.

343
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,100
How are you? When did you get here?

344
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,460
Oh, this afternoon. I thought
I'd give the kids a treat.

345
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,860
Old college graduate now, huh?

346
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,060
Yeah. Old Joe College
Wainwright, they call me.

347
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,660
Well, freshman, looks like
you're going to make it after all.

348
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
- Yep.
- Hey, hey!

349
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,900
Harry! You're the guy I want to see.

350
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,540
- The Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

351
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,540
Yeah. He's followed every
game and his mouth's watering.

352
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,380
He wants me to find out if you're
going to come along with us.

353
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,300
Well, I eh, I gotta
make some dough first.

354
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,900
Well, you'd better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

355
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,020
Not broken-down old
guys like this one!

356
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,900
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

357
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,700
George! Welcome back!

358
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,260
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

359
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Putting a pool under this
floor was a great idea.

360
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,460
Saved us another building.

361
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

362
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,380
There's lots of stuff
here to eat and drink.

363
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,140
- Lots of pretty girls around.
- Hey, George...

364
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,860
- Hello, Violet. How are you...
- Hello. What am I bid?

365
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,940
- George...
- Marty. Well, it's old home week.

366
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,060
Marty! Glad to see you.

367
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,060
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

368
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,540
- Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

369
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,220
"Mamma wants you, Marty."
"Mama wants you." Remember?

370
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,180
Dance with her, will you?

371
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Oh, me? Oh, well, I feel funny
enough already, with all these kids.

372
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,260
Aw, come on. Be a sport.

373
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,020
Just dance with her one time and
you'll give her the thrill of her life.

374
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,020
- Aw, go on.
- Hey, sis!

375
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,780
And don't be long, Marty! I don't
want to be a wet nurse for...

376
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,500
And the next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

377
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,460
That's the reason
why I came in fourth.

378
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,460
If it hadn't been for that, that
race would have been a cinch.

379
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,340
I tried to find out who it was
later but I couldn't find out.

380
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,460
Nobody'd ever tell you who... whoever,
whoever it was because they'd be scared.

381
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,580
- They know what kind of a guy I am...
- You remember George?

382
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,740
- This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Well... well... well...

383
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,540
Now, to get back to my story, see...

384
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,700
Hey, this is my dance.

385
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, why don't you
stop annoying people?

386
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,660
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

387
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,180
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

388
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,660
- You look at me as if you didn't know me.
- Well, I don't.

389
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,020
You've passed me on the
street almost every day.

390
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,620
Me?! Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.

391
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,700
That was a little girl named
Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

392
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,380
O-yes,
o-yes, o-yes!

393
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,020
The big Charleston contest!

394
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,180
The prize? A genuine loving cup!

395
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,340
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor. Let's go!

396
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,540
- I'm not very good at this.
- Neither am I.

397
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,140
Okay. What can we lose?

398
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,820
Hey, you're wonderful!

399
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,380
What's the matter, Othello, jealous?

400
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,420
Did you know there's a
swimming pool under this floor?

401
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,540
And did you know that button behind
you causes this floor to open up?

402
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,740
And did you further know that George
Bailey is dancing right over that crack?

403
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
And I've got the key?

404
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

405
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,420
They're cheering us. We must be good.

406
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,580
Get out! Oh, well...

407
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,973
Buffalo Gals, can't
you come out tonight?

408
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,813
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

409
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,773
Buffalo Gals, can't
you come out tonight?

410
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:15,733
And dance

411
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:23,613
by the light of the moon.

412
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,133
- Oh, Hot dog! Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

413
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,533
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

414
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,373
You, you should have seen the
commotion in that locker room.

415
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:33,453
I, I had to knock off three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

416
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:35,973
Here, let me, let me hold
that old wet dress of yours.

417
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:37,373
Do I look as funny as you do?

418
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:39,013
I guess I'm not quite
the football type.

419
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,773
I... You, you look wonderful!

420
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,053
You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd
say you were the prettiest girl in town.

421
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:48,853
Well, why don't you say it?

422
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:51,933
Well, I don't know. Maybe I will
say it. How old are you anyway?

423
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:55,813
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?!

424
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:58,613
Why, it was only last
year you were seventeen.

425
00:24:58,653 --> 00:24:59,893
Too young or too old?

426
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:03,333
Oh, no, no. Just right.
Your age fits you.

427
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,373
Yes, sir, you look a little
older without your clothes on.

428
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:09,933
I, I mean, without a
dress. You look older.

429
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:12,813
I, I mean, younger. You
look... y-y-you just look...

430
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,133
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, oh!

431
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:17,893
- Oh, no. I wanna...
- Sir, my train, please!

432
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:21,013
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

433
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:24,093
Your... your caboose, me lady.

434
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,733
- You may kiss my hand.
- Ummm.

435
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,053
Hey.

436
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:34,333
Hey, Mary.

437
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:38,013
As I was lumbering down the street,

438
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,973
down the street, down the street...

439
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,213
Okay then, I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

440
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,493
Oh, no, don't! I-I
love that old house.

441
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,773
No. You see, you make a wish and
then try and break some glass.

442
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,373
And you got to be a pretty
good shot nowadays, too.

443
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,733
Oh, no, George, don't.

444
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:53,133
It's full of romance, that old place.

445
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,973
I'd like to live in it.

446
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,573
- In that
place?! - Uh-huh.

447
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:58,333
I wouldn't live in it
as a ghost. Now watch.

448
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,293
There's a window right on
the second floor there, see?

449
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:09,613
- What did you wish, George?
- Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful.

450
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,493
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

451
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:14,413
and the next day and the next
year and the year after that.

452
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:17,293
I'm shaking the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet

453
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,933
and I'm gonna see the world.

454
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:22,373
Italy, Greece, the
Parthenon... the Colesseum.

455
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,893
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college and see what they know

456
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,613
and then I'm going to build things.

457
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,093
I'm gonna build air fields.

458
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,853
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
a hundred stories high.

459
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:32,813
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

460
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:34,733
Well, are you gonna throw a rock?

461
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:40,973
Hey, that's pretty good.

462
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,453
What'd you wish, Mary?

463
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,173
Buffalo Gals, Can't
you come out tonight?

464
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,173
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

465
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:55,133
Buffalo Gal, Can't
you come out tonight?

466
00:26:55,173 --> 00:27:02,133
And dance by the light of the moon.

467
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,053
What'd you wish when
you threw that rock?

468
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:05,813
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

469
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,813
If I told you, it might not come true.

470
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:09,733
What is it you want, Mary?

471
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:10,733
What do you want?

472
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:12,493
You, you want the moon?!

473
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:16,053
Just say the word and I'll throw
a lasso around it and pull it down.

474
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,413
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

475
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:23,373
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it. Then what?

476
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,053
Well then, you could swallow it,

477
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,133
and it'd all dissolve, see?

478
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:30,573
And the moon beams'd shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

479
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,493
and the ends of your hair.

480
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,493
Am I talking too much?

481
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,773
Yes!

482
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,093
Why don't you kiss her instead
of talking her to death?

483
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,093
How's that?

484
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:44,173
Why don't you kiss her instead
of talking her to death?

485
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:47,613
Want me to kiss her, huh?

486
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:52,413
Aw, youth is wasted
on the wrong people!

487
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,773
Hey, hey, hold on. Hey,
mister, come on back out here.

488
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,573
I'll show you some kissing
that'll put hair back on your head.

489
00:27:58,613 --> 00:27:59,893
What are you...

490
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:08,733
Mary?

491
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,453
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

492
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,213
Over here, in the hydrangea bushes.

493
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,613
Here you are. Catch.

494
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,373
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

495
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,413
This is a very interesting situation!

496
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:41,493
- Please give me my robe.
- Hmm.

497
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:44,253
A man doesn't get in a
situation like this every day.

498
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,133
I'd like to have my robe.

499
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:48,653
Not in Bedford Falls anyway.

500
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,053
- Ooooouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

501
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:53,053
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

502
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,813
Give me my robe!

503
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:57,533
I've read about things
like this, but I never...

504
00:28:57,573 --> 00:29:00,493
Shame on you! I'm going
to tell your mother on you!

505
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,413
Oh, my mother's way up
on the corner over there.

506
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,173
I'll call the police!

507
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:07,773
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

508
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,733
Then, then, then I'm going to scream!

509
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:13,373
Maybe I could sell tickets.

510
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:18,613
Let's see. No, no, the point
is, in order to get this robe...

511
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:21,773
I've got it. I'll make
a deal with you, Mary.

512
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,573
George! George!

513
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:28,253
George! Come on home. Quick.

514
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,133
You father's had a stroke!

515
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:31,253
What?!

516
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,413
Mary! Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

517
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:34,453
Come on, George. Let's hurry!

518
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:37,093
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes. Campbell's there now.

519
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,893
I think that's all we'll need you for,
George, I know you're anxious to make a train.

520
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,533
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

521
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:55,533
I want the Board to know that
George gave up his trip to Europe

522
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,813
to help straighten things out
here these past few months.

523
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:00,733
Good luck to you at school, George.

524
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,573
- Thanks.
- Good luck! So long!

525
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:05,133
Now we come to the real
purpose of this meeting...

526
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:07,893
to appoint a successor to
our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

527
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,133
Mr. Chairman, I'd like
to get to my real purpose.

528
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,373
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

529
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:15,893
I claim this institution is
not necessary to this town.

530
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:20,213
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a
motion to dissolve this institution

531
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:23,093
and turn its assets and
liabilities over to the receiver.

532
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,573
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...

533
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,813
I'll wring his neck,
so help me, George,

534
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,413
- you hear what that buzzard...
- Mr. Chairman,

535
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:31,933
it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to
talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

536
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,213
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

537
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,053
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

538
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:40,053
Very well. In that case, I'll ask the
two executive officers to withdraw.

539
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,533
But before you go,

540
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,293
I'm sure the whole Board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

541
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,933
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

542
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:50,653
It was his faith and devotion that
are responsible for this organization.

543
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:52,573
I'll go further than that.

544
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:57,253
I'll say that to the public, Peter
Bailey was the Building and Loan.

545
00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:59,453
Oh, that's fine,
Potter, coming from you,

546
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,533
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

547
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,493
Peter Bailey was not a business man.

548
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:09,013
That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean
any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.

549
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:12,813
He was a man of high
ideals, so-called.

550
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:16,813
But ideals without common
sense can ruin this town.

551
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:20,733
Now, you take this loan
here to Ernie Bishop...

552
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:26,733
you know, that fellow that sits around all
day on his brains in his taxi, you know.

553
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:32,173
I happen to know the bank turned
down this loan, but he comes here

554
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:37,853
and we're building him a house
worth five thousand dollars.

555
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,293
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

556
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,533
You have all the papers there.

557
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:44,573
His salary, insurance. I can
personally vouch for his character.

558
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:47,173
- A friend of yours.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:50,813
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

560
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:53,453
you can come and borrow money.

561
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,213
What does that get us?

562
00:31:55,253 --> 00:32:00,453
A discontented, lazy rabble
instead of a thrifty working class.

563
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:05,613
And all because a few starry-eyed
dreamers like Peter Bailey

564
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:09,893
stir them up and fill their heads
with a lot of impossible ideas.

565
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,373
- Now, I say...
- Just a minute. Just a...

566
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:14,773
Just a minute. Now,
hold on, Mr. Potter.

567
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,013
You're right when you say my father
was no business man. I know that.

568
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,373
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante
Building and Loan, I'll never know.

569
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:24,773
But neither you nor anybody else can
say anything against his character,

570
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,693
because his whole life was...

571
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,453
Why, in the twenty-five years since
he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

572
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:32,133
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

573
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,893
He didn't save enough money to
send Harry to school, let alone me.

574
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:37,573
But he did help a few people get
out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

575
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:38,813
And what's wrong with that?

576
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,533
Why... here, you are
all businessmen here.

577
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:44,733
Doesn't it make them better citizens?
Doesn't it make them better customers?

578
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,733
You... you said that uh... what'd
you say just a minute ago...

579
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:50,693
They, they had to wait and save their money
before they even thought of a decent home.

580
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:52,573
Wait! Wait for what?

581
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:54,093
Until their children
grow up and leave them?

582
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,533
Until they're so old and
broken-down that they...

583
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:59,653
Do you know how long it takes a working
man to save five thousand dollars?

584
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:02,693
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that
this rabble you're talking about...

585
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:06,853
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

586
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:09,093
Well, it is too much to have
them work and pay and live and die

587
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:11,133
in a couple of decent
rooms and a bath?

588
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,333
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

589
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,413
People were human beings to him,

590
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,333
but to you, a warped, frustrated
old man, they're cattle.

591
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,853
Well, in my book, he died a much
richer man than you'll ever be.

592
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:26,253
I'm not interested in your book. I'm
talking about the Building and Loan.

593
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:28,053
I know very well what
you're talking about.

594
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:31,413
You're talking about something you can't
get your fingers on, and it's galling you.

595
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,853
That's what you're
talking about, I know.

596
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,653
Well, I, I, I've said too much.

597
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:39,373
I... You're, you're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

598
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,813
There's j-just one thing more though.

599
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,973
This town needs this
measly one-horse institution

600
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:47,973
if only to have some place where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

601
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:49,213
Come on, Uncle Billy.

602
00:33:54,773 --> 00:34:00,253
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

603
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:02,493
Oh boy, that was telling
him, George, old boy.

604
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,693
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

605
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:05,853
What happened? We
heard a lot of yelling.

606
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:09,373
Well, we're being voted out of
business after twenty-five years.

607
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:10,773
Easy come, easy go.

608
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,893
Here it is. "Help wanted
- Female."

609
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,933
You still want me hang around, George?

610
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,173
Yeah, I'll be right down.

611
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:17,333
Hey, you'll miss your train.

612
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,173
You're a week late for
school already. Go on.

613
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:22,173
- What's going on in there?
- Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.

614
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:24,333
They're putting us out
of business. So what?

615
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:26,493
I can get another job.
I'm only fifty-five.

616
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,133
- Fifty-six.
- Go on, go on.

617
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:31,413
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now
you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

618
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:32,533
George! George!

619
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,013
They voted Potter down.
They want to keep it going.

620
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,453
- Whoopee!
- You did it, George, you did it.

621
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,333
But they got one condition,
only one condition.

622
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,133
- What's that?
- That's the best part of it.

623
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:45,573
They've appointed George here as Executive
Secretary to take his father's place.

624
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:46,813
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

625
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,693
You can keep him on. That's all right.

626
00:34:48,773 --> 00:34:50,533
As Secretary you can
hire anyone you like.

627
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:52,493
Dr. Campbell, now let's
get this thing straight.

628
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:53,973
I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now.

629
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,773
I'm going to school.
This is my last chance.

630
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:57,253
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

631
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:59,933
But, George, they'll vote
with Potter otherwise.

632
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:04,653
I know, I know, he didn't go.

633
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:05,693
That's right.

634
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:10,333
Not only that, but he gave his school money
to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.

635
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,173
Harry became a football star.

636
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:14,333
Made second team All-American.

637
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,413
Yeah, but what happened to George?

638
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:19,613
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

639
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:21,333
and take over the Building and Loan.

640
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:24,093
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

641
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,213
Look at this. There...

642
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:29,693
Venezuela oil fields... "Wanted. Man with
construction experience."

643
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:34,493
Here's the Yukon, oh, right here -
"wanted - man with engineering experience."

644
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,133
There she blows.

645
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,613
You know what the three most
exciting sounds in the world are?

646
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,013
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served,
lunch is served, dinner...

647
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,573
No, no, no, no!

648
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:47,213
- Anchor chains, plane motors,
and train whistles. - Peanut?

649
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:48,453
There's the Professor now.

650
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:52,413
- Phil Beta Kappa Bailey! All-American. -
Old George Geographic Explorer Bailey.

651
00:35:52,493 --> 00:35:54,213
What? No husky dogs? No sled?

652
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:55,693
Uncle Billy, you
haven't changed a bit.

653
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:59,133
- Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
- Oh, am I glad to see you.

654
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:01,293
- Say, where's mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

655
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,373
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

656
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,373
George, Uncle Billy, I
want you to meet Ruth.

657
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:07,693
- Hello.
- How do you do.

658
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,533
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

659
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,573
Huh?

660
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:15,133
Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.

661
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:18,053
Well, what do you know
- wife.

662
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,533
Well, how do you do. Congratulations.

663
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:23,893
What am I doing? Congratulations!

664
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,853
They're married... why
didn't you tell somebody?

665
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,293
...Oh, I can't wait to see Tilly's face.

666
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:32,653
- Did you really marry him?
- Why, yes...

667
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:36,053
What's a pretty girl like you doing
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

668
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,693
Well, I tell you.
It's purely mercenary.

669
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:38,933
My father offered him a job.

670
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:43,613
Oh, he gets you and a job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

671
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:46,533
Uh, George, about that job,
Ruth spoke out of turn.

672
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,253
I never said I'd take it.

673
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,173
You've been holding the bag
here for four years, and...

674
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,733
well, I won't let you down, George.

675
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,053
I would like to... Oh, wait
a minute. I forgot the bags.

676
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,173
I'll be right back.

677
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:01,773
It was a surprise to me. This is the
new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

678
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:07,533
Old, old friends of the family.

679
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,693
- Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.
- And I want you to tell you,

680
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:17,253
we're going to give the biggest
party this town ever saw.

681
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:19,433
Here, have some popcorn.

682
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:23,273
George, George, George, that's
all Harry ever talks about.

683
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:26,633
Uh, uh, uh, Ruth, uh, this,
uh, what about this job?

684
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:29,513
Oh, well, my father owns
a glass factory in Buffalo.

685
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:32,353
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

686
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,873
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

687
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:38,313
- Not much money, but, uh,
good future, you know.
- I know.

688
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:40,273
Harry's a genius at research.

689
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:43,513
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

690
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,513
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

691
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:05,633
I feel so good. I could
spit in Potter's eye.

692
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,513
I think I will. I think I will.

693
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,793
What did you say? Huhh?

694
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,913
Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

695
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,953
Where's my hat? Where's my...

696
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:18,593
Oh! Oh, thank you,
George, which is mine?

697
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:21,913
- The middle one.
- Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.

698
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:25,713
Now, look, if you'll point me in the right
direction... would you do that, George?

699
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:29,153
- Right down here.
- Oh... Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

700
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:32,553
Now you just turn this way and
go right straight down there.

701
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:33,793
That way, huh?

702
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:38,673
My Wild Irish rose...

703
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:44,793
I'm all right. I'm all right.

704
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:51,013
The sweetest flowers...

705
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:28,433
Hello, Ma.

706
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,193
That's for nothing.

707
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,353
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

708
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,953
Looks like she can keep
Harry on his toes.

709
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:41,473
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

710
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,393
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

711
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:48,793
Came back three days ago.

712
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:50,513
Hmmm...

713
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:54,153
Nice girl, Mary.

714
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:57,193
Kind that'll help you find
the answers, George.

715
00:39:57,273 --> 00:40:00,313
Stop that grunting.

716
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:01,553
Hmmm.

717
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,073
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

718
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,753
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

719
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,793
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

720
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,073
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

721
00:40:11,153 --> 00:40:12,633
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

722
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:15,753
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

723
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,793
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

724
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:19,953
Oh...

725
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:24,313
Besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York,
and you're here in Bedford Falls.

726
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:27,033
And all's fair in love and war.

727
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:28,553
I don't know about war.

728
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:36,193
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

729
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,473
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

730
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,073
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

731
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,953
All right, Mother, old Building
and Loan pal,

732
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:50,153
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

733
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:51,633
Oh, George...

734
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:54,793
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

735
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:57,713
This direction.

736
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:06,433
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

737
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,513
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

738
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:22,753
I think I got a date.

739
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,393
But uh, stick around,
fellows, just in case, huh?

740
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:28,473
We'll wait for you, baby.

741
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:33,553
- Hello, George-Porgie!
- What?

742
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:36,473
- Hey, uh... What gives?
- Nothing.

743
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:41,713
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm... probably end up down the library.

744
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:45,953
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

745
00:41:46,993 --> 00:41:51,353
- Yes. What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

746
00:41:51,953 --> 00:41:53,753
Are you game, Violet?
Let's make a night of it.

747
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,953
Oh, I'd love it, Georgie.
What'll we do?

748
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:59,353
Let's go out in the fields and take off
our shoes, and walk through the grass.

749
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,353
Huh?

750
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,473
Then we can to up to the falls. It's
beautiful up there in the moonlight,

751
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:05,713
and there's a green pool up there,

752
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:08,033
and we can, uh, s-swim in it.

753
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,233
Then we can climb Mt. Bedford,

754
00:42:10,313 --> 00:42:13,273
and smell the pines and watch
the sunrise against the peaks,

755
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:14,713
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

756
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:16,753
and everybody'll be talking and
there'll be a terrific scandal...

757
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:18,633
Georgie, have you gone crazy?

758
00:42:18,673 --> 00:42:20,673
Walk in the grass in my bare feet?

759
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:24,753
- Why, it's ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.
- Shhh...

760
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:28,193
- You think just because you...
- O-O-Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

761
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,833
What are you doing, picketing?

762
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,553
Hello, Mary.

763
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,873
I just happened to be passing by.

764
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:55,153
Yes, so I noticed.

765
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:57,553
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

766
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,073
Have you made up your mind?

767
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:02,313
- About what?
- About coming in.

768
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:06,073
Your mother just phoned and said you
were on your way over to pay me a visit.

769
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:08,353
My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know?

770
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:10,553
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

771
00:43:10,593 --> 00:43:13,713
I just went for a walk and
happened to be passing by, idiot.

772
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:19,273
What do you... went
for a walk. That's all.

773
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:22,953
- I'll be downstairs, mother.
- All right, dear.

774
00:43:45,313 --> 00:43:49,473
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

775
00:43:49,513 --> 00:43:53,593
Well, I'll come in
for a minute. But I...

776
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,593
I didn't tell anybody I was
coming over here, you know.

777
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:14,273
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

778
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:16,113
Where'd you get that dress?

779
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,593
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

780
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:27,313
I thought you'd go back to New York
like Sam and Angie, and the rest of them.

781
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:31,833
Oh, oh, I worked there a
couple of vacations. But...

782
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:33,873
I don't know... I-I
guess I was homesick.

783
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:37,193
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

784
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:44,033
Yes, and my family,
and... Oh, everything.

785
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:45,793
Would you like to sit down?

786
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,513
All right, for a minute.

787
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:52,793
I-I still can't understand it though. You
know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

788
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:53,953
Would you rather leave?

789
00:44:53,993 --> 00:44:55,953
No, I don't want to be rude.

790
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,753
Well, then sit down.

791
00:44:57,793 --> 00:44:58,873
What's this?

792
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,553
Some joke, huh?

793
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:14,193
Well, I see it still smells
like pine needles around here.

794
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:16,233
Thank you.

795
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,433
And dance by the...

796
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,673
What's the matter?

797
00:45:27,913 --> 00:45:29,913
Oh, oh, yeah... yeah...

798
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,673
Well, I...

799
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:36,113
It was nice about your brother
Harry, and Ruth, isn't it?

800
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:38,593
Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

801
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:39,713
Don't you like her?

802
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:42,033
Well, of course, I like her.
She's a peach.

803
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:47,713
Oh, it's just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

804
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:52,033
No. Uh, marriage is all right for
Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

805
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:53,753
Mary! Mary!

806
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,593
Who's down there with you?

807
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:57,313
It's George Bailey, Mother.

808
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,273
George Bailey?! What's he want?

809
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,793
I don't know.

810
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,273
What do you want?

811
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:06,233
Me?

812
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:08,873
Not a thing. I-I just
came in to get warm.

813
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:14,673
He's making violent
love to me, Mother.

814
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:17,953
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either.

815
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:21,113
Sam Wainwright promised to
call you from New York tonight.

816
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,633
But your mother needn't...

817
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:24,273
You know I
- I didn't come here to...

818
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:25,673
What did you come here for then?

819
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:26,793
I don't know. You tell me.

820
00:46:26,873 --> 00:46:28,593
You're supposed to be the
one that has all the answers.

821
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,353
- You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?

822
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:33,273
That's where I'm going. I don't know
why I came here in the first place.

823
00:46:33,353 --> 00:46:34,793
- Good night.
- Good night!

824
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,313
Mary! Mary!

825
00:46:36,353 --> 00:46:39,273
- The telephone. It's Sam!
- I'll get it.

826
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:41,593
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

827
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:53,473
Mary, he's waiting!

828
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:58,113
Hello.

829
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,273
I forgot my hat.

830
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:06,593
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

831
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:09,593
Aw, I'm great. Gee, it's good
to hear your voice again.

832
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:13,313
Oh, well, that's awfully
sweet of you, Sam.

833
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:16,793
There's an old friend of
yours here. George Bailey.

834
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:19,193
You mean old moss-back George?

835
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,553
Yes. Old moss-back George.

836
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:23,353
Hee-haw! Put him on.

837
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:25,713
W-Wait just a minute.
I-I'll call him. George!

838
00:47:25,753 --> 00:47:27,993
He doesn't want to speak
to George, you idiot!

839
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:29,193
He does so. He asked for him.

840
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:33,553
Geo-George! George, Sam
wants to speak to you.

841
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:41,113
- Hi, Sam.
- Well, George Bailoffski!

842
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,793
Hey, a fine pal you are.

843
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,753
What're you trying
to do? Steal my girl?

844
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:47,673
W-W-What do you mean? Nobody's
trying to steal anybody's girl.

845
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:49,593
H-Here... here's Mary.

846
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,233
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

847
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:53,393
- Here to you.
- Tell Mary to get on the extension.

848
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,513
- You tell him.
- Mother's on the extension. We...

849
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,793
I am not!

850
00:47:57,513 --> 00:48:00,073
We can both hear. Come here.

851
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,153
We-We're listening, Sam.

852
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,793
Well look, I have a big deal coming
up that's going to make us all rich.

853
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:08,753
George, you remember that night
in Martini's Bar when, eh,

854
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:11,913
you told me you read someplace about
making plastics out of soybeans?

855
00:48:11,953 --> 00:48:13,113
Jelly beans?

856
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:14,153
Shut up, will you?

857
00:48:14,193 --> 00:48:18,153
Do you remember out of jelly
- ...out of soybeans?

858
00:48:18,193 --> 00:48:21,073
Huh? Yeah, yeah,
yeah... soybeans. Yeah.

859
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:23,913
Well, listen. Dad snapped up the idea.

860
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:26,233
And he's going to build a
factory outside of Rochester.

861
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:27,553
How do you like that?

862
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:33,193
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

863
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:36,113
Well, why not? Can you
think of anything better?

864
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:37,873
Oh, I don't know... It's just...

865
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,473
Why not right here?

866
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:42,353
Y-You remember that... that
old tool and machinery works?

867
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:45,193
W-Well, you tell your father
he can get that for a song.

868
00:48:45,273 --> 00:48:46,433
And all the labor he wants, too.

869
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:49,313
Half the town was thrown out
of work when they closed down.

870
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:51,553
Is that so? Well, I'll tell him.

871
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:53,033
Hey, that sounds great.

872
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:54,913
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

873
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,233
Now here's the point,

874
00:48:56,273 --> 00:49:00,753
Mary... Mary, you're in on this, too.
Now listen, have you got any money?

875
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,073
- Money? Yeah... well, a little.
- Well now, listen.

876
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:09,953
I want you to put every cent you've
got into our stock, you hear?

877
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:12,593
And George, I may have a job for you,

878
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,953
that is, unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

879
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:21,033
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio.
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

880
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:23,353
Oh, Mary... Mary...

881
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:27,553
Well, I-I'm here.

882
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:31,433
Uh, would you tell that guy I'm giving
him the chance of a lifetime, you hear?

883
00:49:31,473 --> 00:49:33,393
The chance of a lifetime.

884
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:39,873
H-He says it's the
chance of a lifetime.

885
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:44,553
Now you listen to me.

886
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:47,673
I don't want any plastics. I
don't want any ground floors.

887
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:51,233
And I don't want to get married
ever to anyone. You understand that?

888
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:53,513
I want to do what I want to do.

889
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:55,793
And you're... and you're...

890
00:49:56,473 --> 00:50:00,633
- Oh, Mary... Mary...
- George... George... George...

891
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:09,073
Mary... Would you? Would you...

892
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:15,353
Here they come! Here they come!

893
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:38,113
Goodbye.

894
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:56,073
First Harry. Now George.

895
00:50:56,113 --> 00:50:58,393
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

896
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,513
You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.

897
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,593
If either of you two see a
stranger around here, it's me.

898
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:11,273
Hey, look! There's
somebody driving this cab.

899
00:51:11,353 --> 00:51:13,193
Bert the cop sent this over.

900
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,473
He said to float away to
Happy Land on the bubbles.

901
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:18,073
- Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
- Good old Bert.

902
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:21,153
By the way, where are you two
going on this here now honeymoon?

903
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,473
Where are we going?

904
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:24,513
Look at this. There's
the kitty, Ernie.

905
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:26,233
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

906
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:28,073
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look!

907
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:30,393
You know what we're going to do?
We're going to shoot the works.

908
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:32,673
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

909
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:35,313
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

910
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:39,913
the richest caviar, the hottest
music, and the prettiest wife!

911
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:41,433
Wow! That does it! Then what?

912
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,833
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

913
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:48,153
That does it, come here,
come here, come here!

914
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:54,993
Don't look now, but there's something funny
going on over there at the bank, George.

915
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:58,713
I've never really seen one, but that's
got all the earmarks of being a run.

916
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:09,433
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

917
00:52:09,513 --> 00:52:12,193
- George, let's not stop. Let's go.
- Just a minute, dear.

918
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:17,273
- Oh-oh... - Please,
let's not stop, George.

919
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:18,633
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

920
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,313
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

921
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:40,793
Charlie? What's the matter
here, can't you get in?

922
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,673
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

923
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:02,393
George...

924
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,553
Come on in, everybody. That's right.

925
00:53:05,593 --> 00:53:06,873
Just come on in.

926
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,433
Now look, why don't you all sit down?

927
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:14,153
There are a lot of seats over there.

928
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,993
Just make yourself at home.

929
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,153
George, can I see you a minute?

930
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:24,233
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

931
00:53:24,313 --> 00:53:25,833
This is a pickle,
George. This is a pickle.

932
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:27,353
All right now, what
happened? How did it start?

933
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:29,953
Well, how does a thing like this ever start?
All I know is the bank called our loan.

934
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:31,233
- When?
- About an hour ago.

935
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,113
- I had to hand over all our cash.
- All of it?

936
00:53:33,153 --> 00:53:34,953
Every cent of it and it
still was less than we owe.

937
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:36,753
Holy mackerel!

938
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:40,593
And then I got scared, George, and
closed the doors. I... I... I...

939
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,473
The whole town's gone crazy.

940
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:45,953
Yes, h-hello?

941
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,153
George, it's Potter.

942
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:53,433
- Hello?
- George,

943
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:58,993
there is a rumor around town that
you've closed your doors. Is that true?

944
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:03,113
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear
that. George, are you all right?

945
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:06,833
- Do you need any police?
- Police? What's for?

946
00:54:06,873 --> 00:54:11,073
Well, mobs get pretty
ugly sometimes, you know.

947
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:15,273
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

948
00:54:15,313 --> 00:54:20,753
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

949
00:54:20,793 --> 00:54:24,073
They'll close up for
a week and then reopen.

950
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:26,153
He just took over the bank.

951
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:32,513
I may lose a fortune, but I'm
willing to guarantee your people too.

952
00:54:32,593 --> 00:54:37,753
Just tell them to bring their shares over
here, and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.

953
00:54:37,793 --> 00:54:39,993
Aw, you never miss a
trick, do you, Potter?

954
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,073
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

955
00:54:41,113 --> 00:54:45,073
If you close your doors before
six P.M., you will never reopen.

956
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,953
George, was it a nice wedding?
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

957
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:58,953
Yeah...

958
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:02,793
You can take this one off now.

959
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:16,953
Now, just remember that this
thing isn't as black as it appears.

960
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:28,273
I have some news for you folks.

961
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:31,593
I was just talking to old man Potter and
he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

962
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:33,393
The bank's going to reopen next week.

963
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,113
But, George, I got my money here.

964
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:36,873
Did he guarantee this place?

965
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:38,673
Well, no, Charlie. I
didn't even ask him.

966
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:41,393
- We don't need Potter over here.
- I'll take mine now.

967
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:46,593
No, but you... you... you're
thinking of this place all wrong.

968
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,433
As if I had the money back in a safe.

969
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:50,473
The, the money's not here.

970
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,993
Well, your money's in Joe's
house... that's right next to yours.

971
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:56,993
And in the Kennedy House, and Mrs.
Macklin's house, and, and a hundred others.

972
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:58,793
Why, you're lending
them the money to build,

973
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,553
and then, they're going to pay
it back to you as best they can.

974
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:02,913
Now what are you going
to do? Foreclose on them?

975
00:56:02,953 --> 00:56:05,153
I got two hundred and
forty-two dollars in here

976
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:08,673
and two hundred and forty-two
dollars isn't going to break anybody.

977
00:56:09,553 --> 00:56:12,793
Okay, Tom. All right. Here
you are. You sign this.

978
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,993
- You'll get your money in sixty days.
- Sixty days?

979
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,233
Well, now that's what you agreed
to when you bought you shares.

980
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:20,313
- Tom... Tom... Did you get your money?
- No.

981
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:24,153
Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty
cents on the dollar for every share you got.

982
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:26,913
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

983
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:29,513
- Well, what do you say?
- Now, Tom,

984
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:31,233
you have to stick to
your original agreement.

985
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:33,753
- Now give us sixty days on this.
- Okay, Randall.

986
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:36,633
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
- Better get half than nothing.

987
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:39,593
Tom! Tom!

988
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:41,673
Randall, now wait a minute, wait...

989
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:43,633
now listen... now listen to me.

990
00:56:43,713 --> 00:56:46,033
I-I beg of you not to do this thing.

991
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,753
If Potter gets ahold of
this Building and Loan,

992
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:50,073
there'll never be another
decent house built in this town.

993
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:52,353
He's already got charge of the
bank. He's got the bus line.

994
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:54,673
He's got the department
stores. And now he's after us.

995
00:56:54,713 --> 00:56:56,193
Why? Well, it's very simple.

996
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,553
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

997
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,833
And because he wants to
keep you living in his slums

998
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:02,873
and paying the kind
of rent he decides.

999
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:05,713
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses,
didn't you? Well, have you forgotten?

1000
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:08,513
Have you forgotten what he
charged for that broken-down shack?

1001
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:11,553
Here, Ed. You know, you remember last
year when things weren't going so well,

1002
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:12,833
you couldn't make your payments.

1003
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:15,953
You didn't lose your house, did you? Do
you think Potter would have let you keep it?

1004
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,033
Ca-Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1005
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:20,713
Don't you see what's happening?

1006
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:22,873
Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying.

1007
00:57:22,913 --> 00:57:25,833
And why? Because we're panicky
and he's not. That's why.

1008
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:26,953
He's picking up some bargains.

1009
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:29,553
Now, We-We can get through
this thing all right.

1010
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:32,993
We-We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.

1011
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,113
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year and I need money.

1012
00:57:36,193 --> 00:57:39,553
- How am I going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.

1013
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:42,193
- I need cash.
- I can't feed my kids on faith.

1014
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:44,233
How much do you need?

1015
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:47,593
Hey! I got two thousand dollars.

1016
00:57:48,473 --> 00:57:51,073
Here's two thousand dollars. This'll
tide us over until the bank reopens.

1017
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:52,433
All right, Tom, how much do you need?

1018
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:53,713
Two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1019
00:57:53,753 --> 00:57:56,193
Aw, Tom, just enough to tide
you over till the bank reopens.

1020
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:58,913
I'll take two hundred
and forty-two dollars.

1021
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:03,433
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1022
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:05,553
Your account's still
here. That's a loan.

1023
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,273
Okay. All right, Ed?

1024
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,633
- I got three hundred dollars here, George.
- Alright, now, Ed...

1025
00:58:09,713 --> 00:58:12,633
wh-wh-what'll it take till the
bank opens? What do you need?

1026
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:16,953
- Well, I-I suppose twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars. Now you're talking.

1027
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,073
Fine. Thanks, Ed.

1028
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:19,713
All right now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1029
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:21,593
- But it's your own money, George.
- Never mind about that.

1030
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:24,073
- How much do you want?
- I can get along with twenty, all right.

1031
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:26,073
- Twenty dollars.
- And I'll sign a paper.

1032
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:27,153
You don't have to sign anything.

1033
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:29,073
I know you-you'll
pay it when you can.

1034
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:30,913
That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis?

1035
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:35,033
- Could I have
seventeen-fifty? - Seven...

1036
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:38,113
Bless your heart, of course you
can have it. You got fifty cents?

1037
00:58:38,153 --> 00:58:39,513
- Seven...
- We're going to make it, George.

1038
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:43,393
- They'll never close us up today!
- Six, five, four,

1039
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:46,673
three, two, one...

1040
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:47,993
Bingo!

1041
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:50,193
We made it. Close the door,
Ernie. We made it. Look.

1042
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:52,353
Look, we're still in business.
We're still got two bucks left.

1043
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:54,513
Well, look, let's have some
of that. Let's celebrate, huh.

1044
00:58:54,553 --> 00:58:56,033
G-Get some glasses, Tilly.

1045
00:58:56,113 --> 00:58:57,953
Well, a couple of financial wizards.

1046
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,553
Those Rockefellers.

1047
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:01,993
Get a tray for these two great
big important simoleans here.

1048
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:03,633
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1049
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,033
A toast! A toast to Mama
Dollar and to Papa Dollar,

1050
00:59:07,073 --> 00:59:09,393
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1051
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:11,673
- you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.

1052
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:12,993
I wish they were, too.

1053
00:59:14,153 --> 00:59:16,513
Okay, let's put them in
safe and see what happens.

1054
00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:29,353
- Folks, folks, wedding
cigars! - Oh-oh... wedding!

1055
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:34,007
Holy mackerel, I'm married!
Where's Mary? Mary...

1056
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:35,047
Well, poor Mary.

1057
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:37,167
Look, I've got a train to
catch. Well, the train's gone.

1058
00:59:37,247 --> 00:59:39,807
I wonder if Ernie's still
here with his taxicab?

1059
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:42,207
George, there's a call for you.

1060
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:45,087
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.

1061
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,967
- Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
- I don't want Mrs. Bailey.

1062
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:50,807
I want my wife. Mrs. Bailey!
Mrs... oh, that's my wife.

1063
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,807
Here, I'll take it in here.

1064
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:56,367
Mary! Hello. Listen,
dear. I'm sorry...

1065
00:59:56,407 --> 01:00:00,767
What? Come home? What home?

1066
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,967
Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what...

1067
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:08,007
whose home is that?
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1068
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,967
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1069
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,127
How would you like to
get a ticket next week?

1070
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,087
- Haven't you any romance in you?
- Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

1071
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:27,207
Liver pills!

1072
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:30,047
Who wants to see liver
pills on their honeymoon?

1073
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:34,047
What we want is romantic places, beautiful
places... places George wants to go.

1074
01:00:35,527 --> 01:00:38,647
- Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
- Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1075
01:00:38,687 --> 01:00:40,527
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1076
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,527
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1077
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:43,847
What are they
- ducks?

1078
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:49,367
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1079
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,767
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1080
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:03,847
Hiya... Geo... uh...
good evening, sir.

1081
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:07,847
Entree, Monsieur.

1082
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:17,967
- Entree.
- Islands of Hawaii,

1083
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:27,247
Where skies of blue are calling me.

1084
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:36,487
Where balmy air and golden moonlight

1085
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:45,687
caress The waving palms of Waikiki.

1086
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:31,207
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1087
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:38,647
Well, I'll be...

1088
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,927
Mary, where did you...

1089
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:58,087
I Love You Truly,

1090
01:02:58,127 --> 01:03:03,167
Truly, Dear.

1091
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:07,727
Life with Its Shadows,

1092
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:08,767
Oh, Mary...

1093
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:11,607
Life with Its Tears.

1094
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:13,407
Remember the night we broke
the windows in this old house?

1095
01:03:13,447 --> 01:03:18,847
Fade into Dreams,
- This is what I wished for.

1096
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:22,807
When I Feel You Are Near,

1097
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:32,527
- Darling, you're
wonderful. I Love You Truly,

1098
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:39,607
Truly, Dear.

1099
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,167
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1100
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,927
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1101
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:57,847
I own the house.

1102
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,247
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1103
01:04:01,287 --> 01:04:04,727
No more we live like pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1104
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:06,127
Hurry, Marie!

1105
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,607
Come on... Bring the baby.

1106
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,287
This is like a dream!

1107
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:11,887
I'll take the kids in the car.

1108
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:13,727
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

1109
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,487
All right, kids. Here.

1110
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:16,527
Get in here.

1111
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:18,527
Now get right up on the seat there.

1112
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:22,647
Get the... get the dog!

1113
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:26,447
You've got a goat too!

1114
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:33,447
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, everybody!

1115
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:37,167
All in.

1116
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:58,007
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1117
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:01,087
Good old George. He's
always making a speech.

1118
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:04,127
Hee-haw!

1119
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:08,127
- Sam Wainwright!
- Oh, who cares!

1120
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:11,207
Bread! That this house
may never know hunger.

1121
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:15,447
Salt! That life may
always have flavor!

1122
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:19,287
And wine!! That joy and
prosperity may reign forever.

1123
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:21,207
Enter the Martini castle!

1124
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:25,327
Look, Mr. Potter, it's
no skin off my nose.

1125
01:05:25,407 --> 01:05:27,167
I'm just your little rent collector.

1126
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:31,047
But you can't laugh off this
Bailey Park anymore. Look at it.

1127
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:34,807
Congressman Black is here to see you.

1128
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,207
Oh, tell the congressman
to wait. Go on.

1129
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:39,887
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1130
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:42,487
There's the old cemetery,
squirrels, buttercups, daisies.

1131
01:05:42,527 --> 01:05:44,287
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1132
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:47,047
Look at it today.

1133
01:05:47,087 --> 01:05:50,047
Dozens of the prettiest
little homes you ever saw.

1134
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:53,447
Ninety per cent owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you!

1135
01:05:53,527 --> 01:05:56,807
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr.
Employer, is becoming just that.

1136
01:05:56,847 --> 01:06:00,367
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1137
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:02,047
Oh, they are, are they?

1138
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:04,967
Even though they know the Baileys
never made a dime out of it.

1139
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:06,207
You know very well why,

1140
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:07,607
the Baileys were all chumps.

1141
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:11,847
Every one of these homes is worth twice
what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1142
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,527
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- Well, you are not me.

1143
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:17,887
As I say, it's no skin off my nose.

1144
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:25,567
But one of these days this bright young man
is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.

1145
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:31,807
The Bailey family has been a
boil on my neck long enough.

1146
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,087
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1147
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:36,087
We just stopped in town to take a
look at the new factory, and then

1148
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:38,047
- we're going to drive on down to Florida.
- Oh...

1149
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,647
- Why don't you have your friends join us?
- Why, sure.

1150
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:43,567
Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1151
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:46,367
Oh, I'm afraid I
couldn't get away, Sam.

1152
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:48,447
Still got the nose to
the old grindstone, eh?

1153
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:53,447
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground
floor in plastics and he turned me down cold.

1154
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,207
- Oh, now don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1155
01:06:56,247 --> 01:06:57,967
Well, I guess we better run along.

1156
01:06:58,007 --> 01:06:59,327
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

1157
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:00,607
- Nice meeting you.
- Goodbye.

1158
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:02,047
- Goodbye, George.
- So long, George.

1159
01:07:02,087 --> 01:07:03,767
- See you in the funny papers.
- Goodbye, Sam.

1160
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,447
- So long, Mary.
- So long, Sam. Have fun.

1161
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:06,527
Thanks for dropping around.

1162
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:08,327
Florida! Hee-haw!

1163
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:09,407
Hee-haw.

1164
01:07:38,647 --> 01:07:39,727
Thank you, sir.

1165
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:41,607
Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.

1166
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:44,127
You like it? I'll send you a box.

1167
01:07:52,807 --> 01:07:56,087
Well, I, uh, I suppose I'll
find out sooner or later,

1168
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:59,367
but just what exactly did
you want to see me about?

1169
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:06,287
George, now that's just what
I like so much about you.

1170
01:08:06,327 --> 01:08:10,007
George, I'm an old man,
and most people hate me.

1171
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:13,007
But I don't like them, either,
so that that makes it all even.

1172
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:18,087
You know, just as well as I do, that I
run practically everything in this town

1173
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,967
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1174
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:25,727
You know, also, that for a number of years I've
been trying to get control of it or kill it.

1175
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:28,087
But I haven't been able to do it.

1176
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:31,007
You have been stopping me.

1177
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:34,327
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1178
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:39,447
and as anyone in this county can
tell you, that takes some doing.

1179
01:08:39,527 --> 01:08:42,647
Take during the
depression, for instance.

1180
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:45,927
You and I were the only
ones that kept our heads.

1181
01:08:45,967 --> 01:08:49,287
You saved the Building and
Loan, I saved all the rest.

1182
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:53,127
Yeah. Well, most people
say you stole all the rest.

1183
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:56,927
The envious ones say
that, George, the suckers.

1184
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:01,447
Now, I have stated
my side very frankly.

1185
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:04,407
Now, let's look at your side.

1186
01:09:04,447 --> 01:09:11,407
Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
married, making say... forty a week.

1187
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:14,407
- Forty-five! -
Forty-five. Forty-five.

1188
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:17,367
Out of which, after
supporting your mother

1189
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:22,007
and paying your bills, you're able
to keep, say ten, if you skimp.

1190
01:09:34,558 --> 01:09:38,678
But, George Bailey is not
a common, ordinary yokel.

1191
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:42,798
He's an intelligent,
smart, ambitious young man,

1192
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:48,038
who hates his job, who hates the
Building and Loan, almost as much as I do.

1193
01:09:48,078 --> 01:09:53,238
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1194
01:09:53,278 --> 01:09:56,238
A young man... the smartest
one of the crowd, mind you,

1195
01:09:56,278 --> 01:09:59,718
a young man who has to sit by
and watch his friends go places,

1196
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:01,358
because he's trapped.

1197
01:10:01,438 --> 01:10:09,318
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.

1198
01:10:09,398 --> 01:10:12,718
Do I paint a correct
picture, or do I exaggerate?

1199
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,438
Oh, what's your point, Mr. Potter?

1200
01:10:16,518 --> 01:10:20,158
- My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1201
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:23,758
I want you to manage my
affairs, run my properties.

1202
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:28,918
George, I'll start you out at
twenty thousand dollars a year.

1203
01:10:32,838 --> 01:10:35,838
Twenty thous... twenty
thousand dollars a year?

1204
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:39,318
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1205
01:10:39,398 --> 01:10:41,918
buying your wife a
lot of fine clothes,

1206
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:46,798
a couple of business trips to New York
a year, maybe once in a while Europe.

1207
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:48,438
You wouldn't mind
that, would you, George?

1208
01:10:48,518 --> 01:10:49,878
Would I?

1209
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:55,118
Y-You're not talking to somebody
else around here, are you?

1210
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:59,158
You know, th-this is me, you
remember me? George Bailey.

1211
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,118
Oh, yes, George Bailey.
Whose ship has just come in,

1212
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,478
provided he has enough
brains to climb aboard.

1213
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:16,118
Holy mackerel!

1214
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:21,678
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1215
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:25,318
Oh, confound it, man!
Are you afraid of success?

1216
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:30,398
I'm offering you a three-year contract at
twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today.

1217
01:11:30,438 --> 01:11:32,238
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1218
01:11:33,878 --> 01:11:35,598
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1219
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:40,438
I... I know I ought to jump at
the chance but I... I just, uh,

1220
01:11:40,478 --> 01:11:44,438
I-I wonder if-if it would be possible for you
to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

1221
01:11:44,478 --> 01:11:46,238
Sure, sure, sure.

1222
01:11:46,278 --> 01:11:49,038
You go on home and talk
about it to your wife.

1223
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:50,598
- I'd like to do that.
- Yeah.

1224
01:11:50,638 --> 01:11:52,958
In the meantime, I'll
draw up the papers.

1225
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:55,238
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1226
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:58,118
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1227
01:12:08,398 --> 01:12:11,278
No, no, no, no. Wait a
minute here. Wait a minute.

1228
01:12:11,318 --> 01:12:14,398
I don't need twenty-four hours.
I, I don't have to talk to anybody.

1229
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:16,558
I know right now, and
the answer is no! No!

1230
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,078
Doggone it!

1231
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:20,678
You sit around here and
you spin your little webs

1232
01:12:20,718 --> 01:12:22,918
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1233
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:24,718
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1234
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,878
In the... in the whole vast
configuration of things,

1235
01:12:27,918 --> 01:12:30,958
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1236
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:35,718
You... and that goes for you, too.

1237
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:41,998
And it goes for you, too.

1238
01:12:48,718 --> 01:12:52,238
If you wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town.

1239
01:12:52,278 --> 01:12:55,078
Buying your wife a
lot of fine clothes.

1240
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:58,638
Going to New York on a business
trip a couple of times a year.

1241
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:01,198
Maybe to Europe once in a while.

1242
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:03,758
I know what I'm going to do tomorrow

1243
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:07,078
and the next day and next
year and the hear after that.

1244
01:13:07,158 --> 01:13:12,318
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little
town off my feet, and I'm going to see the world

1245
01:13:12,398 --> 01:13:15,198
and then I'm going to build things.
I'm going to build air fields.

1246
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:18,118
I'm going to build skyscrapers
a hundred stories high.

1247
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:21,598
I'm going to build
a bridge a mile long.

1248
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:23,318
What is it you want,

1249
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:25,198
Mary? What? Y-You want the moon?

1250
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:27,798
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1251
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:29,838
and pulls her down for you.

1252
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:32,318
Buffalo Gals, won't
you come out tonight,

1253
01:13:32,358 --> 01:13:35,358
Won't you come out tonight,
Won't you come out tonight.

1254
01:13:35,398 --> 01:13:38,758
Buffalo Gals, won't
you come out tonight,

1255
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:40,798
And...

1256
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:48,558
- Hi.
- Hi.

1257
01:13:54,078 --> 01:13:55,478
Mary Hatch!

1258
01:13:57,838 --> 01:14:02,038
Wh-Why in the world did you
ever marry a guy like me?

1259
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:04,558
To keep from being an old maid.

1260
01:14:04,598 --> 01:14:08,678
You could have married Sam
Wainwright and anybody else in town.

1261
01:14:08,718 --> 01:14:12,078
I didn't want to marry
anybody else in town.

1262
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,278
I want my baby to look like you.

1263
01:14:14,358 --> 01:14:17,198
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1264
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:20,038
I promised you... your what?

1265
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:22,598
My baby.

1266
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:27,958
You... You-You-You-You-You-You-You...
Mary, you're on the nest?

1267
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:30,638
George Bailey lassoes stork.

1268
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:32,118
Lassoes the stork!

1269
01:14:34,118 --> 01:14:35,878
What do you...

1270
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:37,878
You mean...
you-you-you...

1271
01:14:37,918 --> 01:14:40,158
What-what-what is
it, a boy or a girl?

1272
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:41,398
Uh-hm.

1273
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:48,038
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1274
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:49,038
No!

1275
01:14:49,078 --> 01:14:52,158
Mary had her baby, a boy.

1276
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:54,638
Then she had another one, a girl.

1277
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:59,958
Day after day she worked away remaking
the old Granville house into a home.

1278
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:03,638
Night after night, George
came back late from the office.

1279
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:09,478
Potter was bearing down hard.

1280
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,438
Then came a war.

1281
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:21,118
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1282
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:25,398
Mary had two more babies but
still found time to run the U.S.O.

1283
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:29,398
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1284
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:32,198
Potter became head of the draft board.

1285
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:40,278
One-A...
one-A... one-A

1286
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:43,078
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1287
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:47,718
Bert the cop was wounded in
North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1288
01:15:47,758 --> 01:15:51,558
Ernie, the taxi-driver,
parachuted into France.

1289
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:55,158
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1290
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:58,678
Harry, Harry Bailey topped them all.

1291
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:02,478
A Navy flier, he shot
down fifteen planes.

1292
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:06,878
Two of them as they were about to
crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1293
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,998
- Yes, but George...
- George?

1294
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:16,198
Four-F on account of his ear, George
fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1295
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,118
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

1296
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:19,998
Don't you know there's a war on?

1297
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:22,198
Air raid warden...

1298
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:35,718
paper drives... scrap
drives... rubber drives...

1299
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:40,758
Like everybody else, on
V-E day he wept and prayed.

1300
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:44,398
On V-J day, he wept and prayed again.

1301
01:16:44,478 --> 01:16:48,038
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1302
01:16:48,078 --> 01:16:49,318
Yes, sir.

1303
01:16:49,358 --> 01:16:54,238
This morning, day before Christmas,
about ten A.M., Bedford Falls Time.

1304
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,798
Hi, Ernie, look at that.

1305
01:17:02,078 --> 01:17:03,118
Gonna snow again.

1306
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:06,478
What do you mean it's gonna
snow? Look at the headlines.

1307
01:17:06,518 --> 01:17:08,958
I know, I know, George.
And it's marvelous.

1308
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:10,718
Commander Harry Bailey!

1309
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:12,358
Mr. Gower, look at this.

1310
01:17:12,438 --> 01:17:14,478
The second page. Now
look, this is for you.

1311
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:16,278
This is for you. That's for you.

1312
01:17:16,318 --> 01:17:17,958
- Thanks.
- See you again.

1313
01:17:19,558 --> 01:17:21,718
Be sure you spell the name right.

1314
01:17:21,798 --> 01:17:23,638
Hello, Billy, how are you?

1315
01:17:31,798 --> 01:17:34,478
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1316
01:17:34,518 --> 01:17:36,798
George! George! It's Harry now
on long distance from Washington.

1317
01:17:36,878 --> 01:17:39,838
- Harry! What do you know about that!
- He reversed the charges. It's okay, isn't it?

1318
01:17:39,878 --> 01:17:42,478
Reverse the charges...
of course it's for a hero.

1319
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:43,958
Harry...

1320
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:46,958
Oh, you old seven
times of a son of a gun.

1321
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,198
Congratulations!

1322
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:49,958
How's mother standing it?

1323
01:17:50,038 --> 01:17:51,358
She did?

1324
01:17:51,398 --> 01:17:52,438
What do you know...

1325
01:17:52,518 --> 01:17:54,078
Mother had lunch with
the President's wife.

1326
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:55,318
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1327
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:57,158
- What did they have to eat? -
Wha-What did they have to eat?

1328
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,998
H-H-Harry, you should see what
they're cooking up in the town for you.

1329
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:02,998
Oh, they are?

1330
01:18:03,038 --> 01:18:04,998
The Navy's going to fly
mother home this afternoon.

1331
01:18:05,038 --> 01:18:06,718
In a plane?

1332
01:18:06,758 --> 01:18:08,718
What? Uncle Billy?

1333
01:18:08,758 --> 01:18:10,798
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- No, he stopped at the bank first.

1334
01:18:10,878 --> 01:18:12,838
No, he's not here right
now, Harry. But look...

1335
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:14,718
- George... ...tell me about it.

1336
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:16,478
...George, tha-that man's here again.

1337
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:18,198
- What man? -
B-B-Bank... examiner.

1338
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:19,598
Oh, oh. Uh, uh,

1339
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:21,878
Harry, talk to Eustace
for a minute, will you?

1340
01:18:21,918 --> 01:18:23,918
I'll be right back. Well...

1341
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,918
- Harry...
- Good morning, sir.

1342
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,198
Carter, bank examiner.

1343
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:29,638
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1344
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:31,438
We're all excited around here.

1345
01:18:31,478 --> 01:18:33,478
My brother just got the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1346
01:18:33,518 --> 01:18:34,958
The president just decorated him.

1347
01:18:35,038 --> 01:18:36,598
Well, I guess they do those things.

1348
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,198
Well, I trust you had a good year.

1349
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:39,438
Good year?

1350
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:42,878
Uh, well, between you and
me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1351
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,318
Yeah, very funny.

1352
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:49,158
Uh, w-well... Now, come
right in here, Mr. Carter.

1353
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:53,758
Oh, I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse
charges on personal long distance calls.

1354
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:54,758
George, shall we hang up?

1355
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,958
No, no. He wants to talk to
Uncle Billy. You just hold on.

1356
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,878
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd
like to finish with you by tonight.

1357
01:18:59,918 --> 01:19:02,678
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1358
01:19:02,758 --> 01:19:04,078
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1359
01:19:04,118 --> 01:19:06,358
Just step right in
here. We'll fix you up.

1360
01:19:06,398 --> 01:19:10,118
December twenty-fourth...

1361
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:18,238
Eight thousand.

1362
01:19:18,878 --> 01:19:21,358
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter...

1363
01:19:21,398 --> 01:19:23,798
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter?

1364
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:25,078
What's the news?

1365
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:28,838
Oh, well, well, well. Harry
Bailey wins Congressional Medal.

1366
01:19:28,918 --> 01:19:30,958
That couldn't be one
of the Bailey boys?

1367
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:34,638
You just can't keep those Baileys
down, now can you, Mr. Potter.

1368
01:19:34,678 --> 01:19:37,318
How does slacker
George feel about that?

1369
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:38,478
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1370
01:19:38,518 --> 01:19:40,798
He only lost three
buttons off his vest.

1371
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:45,038
Of course, slacker George would have
gotten two of these medals if he had gone.

1372
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:46,038
Bad ear.

1373
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:50,278
Yes. After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1374
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:54,158
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1375
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:05,238
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1376
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:09,158
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1377
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:11,198
- You forgot something.
- What?

1378
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:13,878
- Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
- Oh, sure, sure I am.

1379
01:20:13,918 --> 01:20:16,478
Well, then it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1380
01:20:16,558 --> 01:20:20,358
Huh? Oh, shucks...

1381
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:24,078
Well, I knew I had...

1382
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,038
- How about that finger there?
- Hmm? Well, I...

1383
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:29,238
Bailey...

1384
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:38,198
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1385
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:42,358
Come on, look sharp.

1386
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:01,398
Take me back.

1387
01:21:11,518 --> 01:21:14,758
Just make yourself at home, Mr.
Carter. I'll get those books for you.

1388
01:21:14,838 --> 01:21:16,238
Oh, hello, Vi.

1389
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:17,918
George, can I see you for a second?

1390
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,758
Why, of course you can.
Come on in the office here.

1391
01:21:20,798 --> 01:21:23,518
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1392
01:21:24,598 --> 01:21:27,358
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1393
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:28,558
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1394
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,758
Harry, your nephew, remember?

1395
01:21:29,798 --> 01:21:32,198
Here he is. Hurry up.

1396
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:33,918
Hello... hello.
Y-Y-Yes, Harry.

1397
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,998
Yes... everything...
everything's fine.

1398
01:21:36,878 --> 01:21:39,638
I should have my head examined.
Eight thousand dollars.

1399
01:21:39,718 --> 01:21:41,558
It's got to be somewhere.

1400
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:49,118
Here you are.

1401
01:21:49,678 --> 01:21:51,358
Character?

1402
01:21:51,398 --> 01:21:52,598
If I had any character, I'd...

1403
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:56,398
It takes a lot of character to leave
your home town and start all over again.

1404
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,758
No, George, don't...

1405
01:21:57,798 --> 01:22:00,678
- Now here, now you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...

1406
01:22:00,758 --> 01:22:03,558
What do you want to do,
hock your furs and that hat?

1407
01:22:04,998 --> 01:22:06,318
Want to walk to New York?

1408
01:22:06,398 --> 01:22:08,078
You know, they charge for
meals and rent up there

1409
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:09,718
just the same as they
do in Bedford Falls.

1410
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,638
- Yeah, sure.
- It's a loan.

1411
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,318
That's my business. Building and Loan.

1412
01:22:14,398 --> 01:22:16,358
Besides, you'll get a job.

1413
01:22:16,438 --> 01:22:17,398
Good luck to you.

1414
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:19,758
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1415
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:26,278
Say hello to New York for me.

1416
01:22:26,318 --> 01:22:27,438
Yeah, yeah... sure, I will.

1417
01:22:27,518 --> 01:22:29,278
Now let's hear from
you once in a while.

1418
01:22:30,318 --> 01:22:31,598
Hmm.

1419
01:22:33,798 --> 01:22:36,918
- Merry Christmas, Violet.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1420
01:22:37,678 --> 01:22:39,238
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter,

1421
01:22:39,318 --> 01:22:40,798
I'm sorry. I'll be right with you.

1422
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:43,438
- Uncle Billy in?
- Yeah, he's in his office.

1423
01:22:43,478 --> 01:22:45,798
Unc... What's going on?

1424
01:22:45,838 --> 01:22:48,598
The bank examiner's here, and I...

1425
01:22:48,638 --> 01:22:49,918
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:51,718
He wants the accounts payable...

1427
01:22:51,798 --> 01:22:54,598
- What's the matter with you?
- Come here.

1428
01:23:15,478 --> 01:23:16,638
- Eustace.
- Yeah?

1429
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:17,798
Come here a minute.

1430
01:23:19,518 --> 01:23:21,878
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1431
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:24,518
He had it on his desk counting
it before he closed up.

1432
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:26,998
Now look, did you buy anything?

1433
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:29,478
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1434
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:31,838
Now, we'll go over every step
you took since you left the house.

1435
01:23:31,918 --> 01:23:33,278
All right. This way.

1436
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:45,278
And did you put the
envelope in your pocket?

1437
01:23:45,318 --> 01:23:48,118
Yeah... maybe, maybe, maybe...

1438
01:23:48,198 --> 01:23:49,838
Maybe-Maybe! I don't want any maybe.

1439
01:23:49,878 --> 01:23:51,518
We've got to find that money!

1440
01:23:51,558 --> 01:23:55,078
- I'm no good to you, George. I...
- Uncle Billy, do you...

1441
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:01,398
Listen to me. Do you have
any secret place hiding place?

1442
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:09,718
Listen to me, listen
to me! Think! Think!

1443
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:13,798
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts...

1444
01:24:13,878 --> 01:24:16,838
Where's that money, you
silly, stupid old fool?!

1445
01:24:16,878 --> 01:24:17,958
Where's that money?

1446
01:24:18,038 --> 01:24:19,718
Do you realize what this means?

1447
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:22,918
It means bankruptcy
and scandal, and prison!

1448
01:24:23,878 --> 01:24:25,158
That's what it means.

1449
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:26,798
One of us is going to jail!

1450
01:24:26,838 --> 01:24:28,398
Well, it's not gonna be me.

1451
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:52,398
Hello, darling.

1452
01:24:52,438 --> 01:24:54,158
Hello daddy, hello daddy.

1453
01:24:54,198 --> 01:24:56,398
How do you like it?
We're going to put...

1454
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,318
Bless you!

1455
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:00,718
Did you bring the wreath?

1456
01:25:00,758 --> 01:25:03,718
- Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
- What wreath?

1457
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:06,318
Oh, that's the Merry Christmas
Wreath for the window.

1458
01:25:06,358 --> 01:25:07,838
No. I left it at the office.

1459
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:09,918
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, just started.

1460
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:13,518
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1461
01:25:13,558 --> 01:25:16,438
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1462
01:25:24,678 --> 01:25:26,678
Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.

1463
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:27,918
You can put the star up.

1464
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,958
Way up at the top.

1465
01:25:29,998 --> 01:25:31,478
That's it.

1466
01:25:31,518 --> 01:25:32,878
All right.

1467
01:25:32,918 --> 01:25:34,638
Fill in that little
bare spot right there.

1468
01:25:34,678 --> 01:25:35,918
That's it.

1469
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,918
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?

1470
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:41,238
We're famous, George.

1471
01:25:41,318 --> 01:25:45,318
I'll bet I had fifty calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1472
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:47,638
Your mother's so excited, she...

1473
01:26:08,278 --> 01:26:10,438
Must she keep playing that?

1474
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:13,198
I have to practice it for
the party tonight, Daddy.

1475
01:26:13,238 --> 01:26:16,518
Mommy says we can stay up till
midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1476
01:26:16,558 --> 01:26:17,838
Can you sing, Daddy?

1477
01:26:18,438 --> 01:26:20,238
Better hurry and shave.

1478
01:26:20,278 --> 01:26:21,838
The families will be here soon.

1479
01:26:21,878 --> 01:26:25,358
Families! I... I don't
want the families over here.

1480
01:26:27,318 --> 01:26:30,758
Come on out in the kitchen
with me while I finish dinner.

1481
01:26:30,798 --> 01:26:32,998
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1482
01:26:33,038 --> 01:26:35,158
Have a hectic day?

1483
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:39,198
Oh, yeah. Another big
red-letter day for the Bailey's.

1484
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:41,878
Daddy, the Brown's next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1485
01:26:41,918 --> 01:26:44,518
Well, what's the matter with our
car? Isn't it good enough for you?

1486
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:45,798
Yes, Daddy.

1487
01:26:45,878 --> 01:26:47,758
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1488
01:26:47,838 --> 01:26:49,678
Excuse you for what?

1489
01:26:49,758 --> 01:26:51,038
I burped!

1490
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:53,278
All right, darling, you're excused.

1491
01:26:53,318 --> 01:26:55,758
Now go upstairs and see
what little Zuzu wants.

1492
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:58,718
Zuzu. W-What's the matter with Zuzu?

1493
01:26:58,758 --> 01:27:00,598
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed.

1494
01:27:00,638 --> 01:27:02,318
Caught it coming home from school.

1495
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:03,918
They gave her a flower for a prize

1496
01:27:03,998 --> 01:27:06,318
and she didn't want to crush it
so she didn't button up her coat.

1497
01:27:06,358 --> 01:27:07,998
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- Just a cold.

1498
01:27:08,038 --> 01:27:09,878
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1499
01:27:09,918 --> 01:27:11,638
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1500
01:27:11,718 --> 01:27:13,438
- He says it's nothing to worry about.
- Is she running a temperature?

1501
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,798
- What is it? - Just a
teensy one, ninety-nine, six.

1502
01:27:15,838 --> 01:27:18,038
- She'll be all right.
- Gosh, it's this old house.

1503
01:27:18,078 --> 01:27:20,398
I don't... I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1504
01:27:20,438 --> 01:27:25,118
This drafty old barn! Might as
well be living in a refrigerator.

1505
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:29,918
Why did we have to live here in the first place
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1506
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:31,998
George, what's wrong?

1507
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:33,358
Wrong? Everything's wrong.

1508
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:34,598
You call this a happy family?

1509
01:27:34,638 --> 01:27:36,518
Why did we have to
have all these kids?

1510
01:27:36,558 --> 01:27:38,598
Dad, how do you spell 'frankincense'?

1511
01:27:38,638 --> 01:27:40,558
I don't know. Why, ask your mother.

1512
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:42,638
- Where're you going?
- Going up to see Zuzu.

1513
01:27:42,678 --> 01:27:44,758
He told me to write
a play for tomorrow.

1514
01:27:55,718 --> 01:27:59,718
F-R-A-N-K-I-N...

1515
01:27:59,758 --> 01:28:01,158
Hi, Daddy.

1516
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:04,958
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1517
01:28:04,998 --> 01:28:07,638
Wait now. W-Where do
you think you're going?

1518
01:28:07,678 --> 01:28:09,238
Want to give my flower a drink.

1519
01:28:09,278 --> 01:28:11,798
All right, all right, here,
give Daddy the flower.

1520
01:28:11,878 --> 01:28:14,478
I'll give it a drink. All right, here.

1521
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:21,038
- Look, Daddy... paste it.
- Yeah, all right...

1522
01:28:24,838 --> 01:28:26,918
Now, I'll paste this together.

1523
01:28:30,478 --> 01:28:35,918
Now, there it is, good as new.
All right, give the flower a drink.

1524
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,278
- Now, will you do something for me?
- What?

1525
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:40,278
Will you try to get some sleep?

1526
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:43,118
I'm not sleepy. I want
to look at my flower.

1527
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,878
I know, I know, but
you just go to sleep

1528
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:50,398
and then you can dream about
it, and it'll be a whole garden.

1529
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:52,558
- It will?
- Uh-huh.

1530
01:29:00,038 --> 01:29:03,158
- Telephone!
- I'll get it.

1531
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:07,238
Hello.

1532
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:09,558
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1533
01:29:09,598 --> 01:29:12,718
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1534
01:29:12,758 --> 01:29:15,518
The doctor says that she ought to be out
of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1535
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,198
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1536
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:18,558
Let me speak to her.

1537
01:29:18,638 --> 01:29:21,518
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1538
01:29:21,558 --> 01:29:23,638
This is George Bailey.
I'm Zuzu's father.

1539
01:29:23,678 --> 01:29:25,678
Say, what kind of a
teacher are you anyway?

1540
01:29:25,718 --> 01:29:28,078
What do you mean sending her
home like that, half naked?

1541
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:30,278
Do you realize she'll probably end
up with pneumonia on account of you?

1542
01:29:30,318 --> 01:29:31,718
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing

1543
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:34,758
we pay taxes for
- to have teachers... to have teachers like you?

1544
01:29:34,798 --> 01:29:38,318
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1545
01:29:38,398 --> 01:29:40,318
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids,

1546
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:42,118
and maybe they don't
have any decent clothes...

1547
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:44,198
Aw, that stupid...

1548
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:47,718
He-Hello, Mrs. Welch.
I-I-I want to apologize.

1549
01:29:47,798 --> 01:29:50,518
Hel-lo... hello...

1550
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:54,118
- She's hung up.
- I-I-I'll hang her up.

1551
01:29:54,198 --> 01:29:56,118
Now, who do you think you are?

1552
01:29:56,198 --> 01:29:57,278
What is that?

1553
01:29:57,318 --> 01:29:59,118
Hello? Who is this?

1554
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:01,078
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1555
01:30:01,118 --> 01:30:02,518
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1556
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:04,758
Gives me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1557
01:30:04,838 --> 01:30:07,758
- George...
- Will you get out and let me handle this?

1558
01:30:07,798 --> 01:30:09,238
Hello?

1559
01:30:09,318 --> 01:30:13,598
Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh?

1560
01:30:13,678 --> 01:30:16,678
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough.

1561
01:30:16,758 --> 01:30:20,398
Hello... any...

1562
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:21,878
Oh...

1563
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,318
Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah?"

1564
01:30:23,398 --> 01:30:25,318
How should I know? What do
you think I am, a dictionary?

1565
01:30:25,358 --> 01:30:26,838
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1566
01:30:26,878 --> 01:30:30,078
Janie, haven't you leaned that silly tune
yet? You've played it over and over again.

1567
01:30:30,118 --> 01:30:31,798
Now stop it! Stop it!

1568
01:30:59,638 --> 01:31:01,478
I'm sorry, Mary.

1569
01:31:04,438 --> 01:31:06,038
Janie, I'm sorry.

1570
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:09,318
I didn't mean...

1571
01:31:09,918 --> 01:31:11,958
You go on and practice.

1572
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:20,638
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1573
01:31:20,678 --> 01:31:22,118
I'm sorry.

1574
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:24,798
What do you want to know?

1575
01:31:24,838 --> 01:31:26,158
Nothing, Daddy.

1576
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:34,758
What's the matter with everybody?

1577
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:37,198
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.

1578
01:31:37,238 --> 01:31:39,558
- Now, go on, play.
- Oh, Daddy...

1579
01:31:44,318 --> 01:31:45,878
George, why must you
torture the children?

1580
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:47,158
Why don't you...

1581
01:31:48,558 --> 01:31:49,718
Mary...

1582
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,638
Bedford
two-four-seven, please.

1583
01:32:05,678 --> 01:32:07,798
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1584
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:11,078
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1585
01:32:11,118 --> 01:32:14,078
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1586
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:16,598
Hello, Uncle Billy?

1587
01:32:16,638 --> 01:32:19,158
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1588
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:21,398
I need help.

1589
01:32:21,438 --> 01:32:24,318
Through some sort of an accident my
company's short in their accounts.

1590
01:32:24,358 --> 01:32:26,278
The bank examiner's got there today.

1591
01:32:26,318 --> 01:32:28,478
I've got to raise eight
thousand dollars immediately.

1592
01:32:28,518 --> 01:32:31,118
Oh, so that's what the reporters
wanted to talk to you about?

1593
01:32:31,158 --> 01:32:32,438
- The reporters?
- Yes,

1594
01:32:32,478 --> 01:32:36,158
they called me up from
your Building and Loan.

1595
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:39,798
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1596
01:32:39,878 --> 01:32:40,958
He's looking for you.

1597
01:32:40,998 --> 01:32:42,838
Please help me, Mr. Potter.

1598
01:32:42,878 --> 01:32:44,638
Help me, won't you, please?

1599
01:32:44,678 --> 01:32:46,518
Can't you see what
it means to my family?

1600
01:32:46,558 --> 01:32:49,518
I'll pay any sort of a bonus
on the loan, any interest

1601
01:32:49,558 --> 01:32:51,198
if you still want the
Building and Loan. I'm...

1602
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:54,878
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1603
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:56,358
No, sir. There's nothing
wrong with the books.

1604
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:57,798
I've just misplaced
eight thousand dollars.

1605
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,478
I can't find it anywhere.

1606
01:32:59,518 --> 01:33:02,758
You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

1607
01:33:02,798 --> 01:33:03,838
Yes, sir.

1608
01:33:06,678 --> 01:33:08,358
Have you notified the police?

1609
01:33:08,398 --> 01:33:10,238
No, sir. I-I didn't
want the publicity.

1610
01:33:10,278 --> 01:33:12,358
Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

1611
01:33:12,398 --> 01:33:14,598
They're gonna believe that one.

1612
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:16,758
What've you been doing, George?

1613
01:33:16,798 --> 01:33:18,478
Playing the market with
the company's money?

1614
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:20,158
No, sir, no, sir. I haven't.

1615
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:21,718
What is it, a woman then?

1616
01:33:21,758 --> 01:33:25,838
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1617
01:33:25,878 --> 01:33:28,198
- What!
- Not that it makes any difference to me,

1618
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:29,398
but why did you come to me?

1619
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:32,198
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1620
01:33:32,278 --> 01:33:33,838
I can't get ahold of
him. He's in Europe.

1621
01:33:33,878 --> 01:33:35,358
Well, what about all
your other friends?

1622
01:33:35,398 --> 01:33:37,158
They don't have that
kind of money, Mr. Potter.

1623
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:39,638
You know that. You're the only
one in town that can help me.

1624
01:33:39,678 --> 01:33:41,478
I see.

1625
01:33:41,518 --> 01:33:45,078
I've suddenly become quite important.

1626
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:47,998
Wha-What kind of security
would I have, George?

1627
01:33:48,078 --> 01:33:51,238
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1628
01:33:51,318 --> 01:33:54,158
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1629
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:58,998
I have some life insurance, a
fifteen thousand dollar policy.

1630
01:33:59,038 --> 01:34:01,238
Yes... how much is your equity in it?

1631
01:34:01,278 --> 01:34:05,078
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars!

1632
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:09,358
And you ask me to lend
you eight thousand.

1633
01:34:09,398 --> 01:34:10,438
Look at you.

1634
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,678
You used to be so cocky!

1635
01:34:12,718 --> 01:34:17,278
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1636
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:21,558
You once called me a
warped, frustrated old man.

1637
01:34:21,598 --> 01:34:25,718
What are you but a warped
frustrated young man?

1638
01:34:25,758 --> 01:34:31,198
A miserable little clerk crawling in here
on your hands and knees and begging for help.

1639
01:34:31,238 --> 01:34:33,238
No securities, no stocks, no bonds,

1640
01:34:33,278 --> 01:34:39,958
nothing but a miserable little five hundred
dollar equity in a life insurance policy.

1641
01:34:40,038 --> 01:34:42,798
You're worth more dead than alive.

1642
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:46,038
Why don't you go to the
riff-raff you love so much

1643
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:48,958
ask them to let you
have eight thousand?

1644
01:34:48,998 --> 01:34:50,118
You know why?

1645
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,878
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1646
01:34:52,918 --> 01:34:56,238
But I tell you what I'm
going to do for you, George.

1647
01:34:56,278 --> 01:34:59,238
Since the state
examiner is still here,

1648
01:34:59,278 --> 01:35:02,078
as a stock holder of
the Building and Loan,

1649
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,478
I'm going to swear out a
warrant for your arrest.

1650
01:35:05,558 --> 01:35:10,198
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance...

1651
01:35:11,078 --> 01:35:13,558
All right, George, go ahead, George.

1652
01:35:13,598 --> 01:35:16,718
You can't hide in a
little town like this.

1653
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:19,158
Bill? This is Potter.

1654
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:34,838
Joe! Merry Christmas!

1655
01:35:34,918 --> 01:35:36,518
- Glad you come.
- Thank you.

1656
01:35:36,558 --> 01:35:39,318
- How about some of that good spaghetti?
- We got everything.

1657
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:52,758
God...

1658
01:35:55,758 --> 01:35:56,998
Oh, God...

1659
01:36:01,838 --> 01:36:03,758
Dear Father in Heaven,

1660
01:36:06,918 --> 01:36:11,038
I'm not a praying man,
but if you're up there,

1661
01:36:11,078 --> 01:36:16,718
and you can hear me, show me the way.

1662
01:36:16,758 --> 01:36:20,878
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1663
01:36:20,918 --> 01:36:23,558
Show me the way, God.

1664
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,678
Are you all right, George?

1665
01:36:29,718 --> 01:36:31,318
Want someone to take you home?

1666
01:36:34,118 --> 01:36:36,478
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1667
01:36:36,518 --> 01:36:40,398
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1668
01:36:40,438 --> 01:36:43,118
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1669
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:45,838
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1670
01:36:49,918 --> 01:36:52,718
And the next time you talk to my
wife like that, you'll get worse.

1671
01:36:52,798 --> 01:36:54,198
She cried for an hour.

1672
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:56,438
It isn't enough she slaves
teaching your stupid kids

1673
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:58,638
how to read and write, and
you have to bawl her out, eh.

1674
01:36:58,678 --> 01:36:59,838
You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1675
01:36:59,878 --> 01:37:01,358
Now wait. I want to pay for my drink.

1676
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:03,918
Never mind the money.
You get out of here quick.

1677
01:37:03,998 --> 01:37:06,478
- All right.
- You hit my best friend. Get out!

1678
01:37:11,758 --> 01:37:13,518
You all right, George?

1679
01:37:13,558 --> 01:37:14,598
Who was that?

1680
01:37:14,678 --> 01:37:16,798
He gone. No worry.

1681
01:37:16,878 --> 01:37:19,478
His name is Welch. He no
come in to my place no more.

1682
01:37:19,558 --> 01:37:22,718
Oh, Welch. That's
what I get for praying.

1683
01:37:22,798 --> 01:37:24,798
The last time he come in
here. You hear that, Nick?

1684
01:37:24,878 --> 01:37:25,958
Yes, you bet.

1685
01:37:26,038 --> 01:37:29,638
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here.

1686
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:31,558
- Oh, no, please, no go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.

1687
01:37:31,598 --> 01:37:34,118
No, no, you no feel so
good. Sit down and rest.

1688
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:36,598
- I'm all right.
- Please no go away. Please!

1689
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:56,478
What do you think you're doing?

1690
01:37:59,598 --> 01:38:00,998
Now look what you did.

1691
01:38:01,038 --> 01:38:03,358
My great-grandfather
planted this tree.

1692
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:06,358
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1693
01:38:07,038 --> 01:38:08,798
Come back here, you drunken fool!

1694
01:38:08,878 --> 01:38:10,638
Get this car out of here!

1695
01:38:18,718 --> 01:38:20,958
Hey, what's the matter with
you? Look where you're going!

1696
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:10,598
Help!

1697
01:39:11,838 --> 01:39:16,398
Help! Help! Help!

1698
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:20,718
Help! Help!

1699
01:39:22,478 --> 01:39:24,718
Help!

1700
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:31,318
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1701
01:39:33,518 --> 01:39:34,878
Help!

1702
01:39:35,998 --> 01:39:40,118
Help! Help! Help!

1703
01:39:56,931 --> 01:39:59,211
I didn't have time to get
some stylish underwear.

1704
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:01,691
My wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1705
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:04,571
I passed away in it.

1706
01:40:08,051 --> 01:40:10,771
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1707
01:40:14,131 --> 01:40:16,931
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1708
01:40:18,171 --> 01:40:20,091
How did you happen to fall in?

1709
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:23,651
I didn't fall in. I
jumped in to save George.

1710
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:26,691
You what? To... to save me?

1711
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:29,931
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't
go through with it, did you?

1712
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:32,091
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1713
01:40:32,171 --> 01:40:35,331
Well, it's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1714
01:40:35,411 --> 01:40:38,211
Yeah, it's against the
law where I come from, too.

1715
01:40:38,251 --> 01:40:41,011
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1716
01:40:45,771 --> 01:40:48,531
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1717
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:51,491
I knew if I were drowning
you'd try to save me.

1718
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:54,451
And you see, you did, and
that's how I saved you.

1719
01:40:54,491 --> 01:40:56,571
Very funny.

1720
01:40:56,611 --> 01:40:58,651
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1721
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:02,971
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in
answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1722
01:41:03,011 --> 01:41:06,851
Oh, no, no, no, George, I'm
the answer to your prayer.

1723
01:41:06,891 --> 01:41:08,891
That's why I was sent down here.

1724
01:41:10,568 --> 01:41:12,008
How do you know my name?

1725
01:41:12,048 --> 01:41:15,648
Oh, I know all about you. I've
watched you grow up from a little boy.

1726
01:41:15,688 --> 01:41:19,408
- What are you, a mind reader or something?
- Oh, no.

1727
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:23,128
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

1728
01:41:23,168 --> 01:41:27,808
Odbody... A-S-2.
Wh-Wh-What's that A-S-2?

1729
01:41:27,888 --> 01:41:29,368
Angel Second Class.

1730
01:41:40,008 --> 01:41:41,728
Cheerio, my good man.

1731
01:41:45,888 --> 01:41:47,368
Oh, brother...

1732
01:41:52,088 --> 01:41:54,288
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks?

1733
01:41:56,808 --> 01:41:59,128
Hey, what's... with you...

1734
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:01,648
wh-wh-what-did you
say just a minute ago?

1735
01:42:01,688 --> 01:42:03,288
Why'd you want to save me?

1736
01:42:03,328 --> 01:42:07,448
That's what I was sent down
for. I'm your guardian angel.

1737
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:09,528
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1738
01:42:09,608 --> 01:42:12,648
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money.

1739
01:42:12,688 --> 01:42:15,448
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.

1740
01:42:15,488 --> 01:42:17,128
Now how do you know that?

1741
01:42:17,168 --> 01:42:19,008
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.

1742
01:42:19,048 --> 01:42:20,808
I know everything about you.

1743
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:25,368
Well, you look about like
the kind of an angel I'd get.

1744
01:42:25,448 --> 01:42:27,248
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?

1745
01:42:27,288 --> 01:42:28,368
What happened to your wings?

1746
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:32,048
I haven't won my wings yet. That's
why I'm an angel second class.

1747
01:42:36,808 --> 01:42:40,248
I don't know whether I like it very much being
seen around with an angel without any wings.

1748
01:42:40,288 --> 01:42:44,008
Oh, I-I've got to earn them
and you'll help me, won't you?

1749
01:42:44,048 --> 01:42:48,848
- Sure, sure. How?
- By letting me help you.

1750
01:42:50,528 --> 01:42:51,528
Only one way you can help me.

1751
01:42:51,608 --> 01:42:53,648
Y-You don't happen to have
eight thousand bucks on you?

1752
01:42:53,688 --> 01:42:56,248
Oh, no, no. We don't
use money in heaven.

1753
01:42:56,288 --> 01:42:58,888
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1754
01:42:58,928 --> 01:43:01,448
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.

1755
01:43:01,528 --> 01:43:04,168
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1756
01:43:04,248 --> 01:43:06,608
I found it out a little late.

1757
01:43:06,648 --> 01:43:08,888
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1758
01:43:08,968 --> 01:43:13,168
Now look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1759
01:43:13,248 --> 01:43:15,728
You just don't know
all that you've done.

1760
01:43:15,768 --> 01:43:16,848
If it hadn't been for you...

1761
01:43:16,928 --> 01:43:19,808
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1762
01:43:19,848 --> 01:43:21,848
My wife, and my kids, and my friends.

1763
01:43:21,888 --> 01:43:25,208
And my... Look, little fellow, why, you
go off and haunt somebody else, will you?

1764
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:27,968
No, no, you don't
understand. I've got my job.

1765
01:43:28,008 --> 01:43:29,808
Aw, shut up, will you?

1766
01:43:33,968 --> 01:43:37,048
Hmmm, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1767
01:43:41,408 --> 01:43:46,328
Yeah! So you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1768
01:43:47,768 --> 01:43:50,168
Oh, I don't know. I
guess you're right.

1769
01:43:51,888 --> 01:43:54,888
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1770
01:43:54,968 --> 01:43:58,328
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1771
01:43:58,408 --> 01:44:01,248
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1772
01:44:01,288 --> 01:44:02,528
You...

1773
01:44:02,568 --> 01:44:04,728
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1774
01:44:04,808 --> 01:44:06,848
That's an idea.

1775
01:44:06,888 --> 01:44:11,648
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.

1776
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:12,768
All right.

1777
01:44:15,768 --> 01:44:17,488
You've got your wish.

1778
01:44:17,568 --> 01:44:19,248
You've never been born.

1779
01:44:24,328 --> 01:44:26,728
You don't have to make
all that fuss about it.

1780
01:44:28,488 --> 01:44:29,848
What did you say?

1781
01:44:29,928 --> 01:44:32,488
You've never been
born. You don't exist.

1782
01:44:32,528 --> 01:44:33,728
You haven't a care in the world.

1783
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:37,288
No worries, no obligations, no
eight thousand dollars to get,

1784
01:44:37,328 --> 01:44:39,088
no Potter looking for
you with the sheriff.

1785
01:44:39,128 --> 01:44:41,968
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure. You can hear out of it.

1786
01:44:42,728 --> 01:44:45,008
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1787
01:44:45,048 --> 01:44:47,528
I haven't heard anything out
of that ear since I was a kid.

1788
01:44:47,568 --> 01:44:49,768
Must have been that
jump in that cold water.

1789
01:44:49,848 --> 01:44:52,008
Your lip's stopped
bleeding, too, George.

1790
01:44:57,328 --> 01:44:58,848
What do you know about that?

1791
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:01,088
What's happened?

1792
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:04,848
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?

1793
01:45:04,928 --> 01:45:07,328
Well, I, uh... What's happened here?

1794
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:09,168
What I need is a couple
of good stiff drinks.

1795
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,208
How about you, angel,
you want a drink?

1796
01:45:13,248 --> 01:45:15,288
Come on, soon as these
clothes of ours are dry...

1797
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:17,488
Those are dry.

1798
01:45:17,528 --> 01:45:19,008
What do you know about that?

1799
01:45:19,048 --> 01:45:20,408
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1800
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:23,888
Now, come on, get your clothes on, and
we'll stroll up to my car and get...

1801
01:45:23,928 --> 01:45:26,328
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll, you fly.

1802
01:45:26,408 --> 01:45:28,728
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1803
01:45:28,768 --> 01:45:30,608
You haven't got your
wings. Yeah, that's right.

1804
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:38,408
What's the matter?

1805
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:41,328
Well, this is where I left
my car and it isn't here.

1806
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:42,528
You have no car.

1807
01:45:42,568 --> 01:45:46,368
Well, I had a car and it was right
here. I guess somebody moved it.

1808
01:45:46,408 --> 01:45:49,048
- Good evening.
- Oh, say... Hey...

1809
01:45:49,128 --> 01:45:50,688
wh-where's my car.

1810
01:45:50,768 --> 01:45:52,688
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1811
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:55,208
I'm the fellow that owns the
car that ran into your tree.

1812
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:57,248
What tree? What do
you mean, what tree?

1813
01:45:57,288 --> 01:45:59,448
This tree. Here. I ran into it.

1814
01:45:59,528 --> 01:46:03,368
Cut a big gash in
the side of it there.

1815
01:46:07,048 --> 01:46:09,408
You must mean two other trees.

1816
01:46:09,448 --> 01:46:10,568
You had me worried.

1817
01:46:10,648 --> 01:46:13,208
One of the oldest
trees in Pottersville.

1818
01:46:13,248 --> 01:46:15,768
Pottersville. Why,
you mean Bedford Falls.

1819
01:46:15,808 --> 01:46:17,568
I mean Pottersville.

1820
01:46:17,608 --> 01:46:19,568
Don't you think I know where I live?

1821
01:46:19,608 --> 01:46:20,848
What's the matter with you?

1822
01:46:27,488 --> 01:46:30,808
Oh, I don't know. Either
I'm off my nut, or he is.

1823
01:46:30,848 --> 01:46:32,008
...or you are.

1824
01:46:32,768 --> 01:46:34,208
It isn't me!

1825
01:46:34,248 --> 01:46:37,848
Well, maybe I left the car up at
Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.

1826
01:46:37,928 --> 01:46:40,088
- Clarence!
- Clarence! Clarence!

1827
01:46:46,168 --> 01:46:48,248
That's all right. Go on in.

1828
01:46:48,288 --> 01:46:50,288
Martini is a friend of mine.

1829
01:46:50,328 --> 01:46:52,248
There's a place to sit down, sit down.

1830
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:01,568
Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

1831
01:47:01,608 --> 01:47:03,768
- You want a Martini?
- No, no, Martini.

1832
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,168
- Your boss. Where is he?
- Look, I'm the boss.

1833
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:07,408
You want a drink or don't you?

1834
01:47:07,448 --> 01:47:09,808
Okay, all right. Double
bourbon, will you? Quick, huh.

1835
01:47:09,888 --> 01:47:11,008
Okay.

1836
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:15,728
What's yours?

1837
01:47:15,808 --> 01:47:17,328
I was just thinking.

1838
01:47:17,408 --> 01:47:21,048
Uh... It's been so long since I...

1839
01:47:21,088 --> 01:47:24,648
Look, Mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1840
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:26,208
That's a good man.

1841
01:47:26,288 --> 01:47:32,928
I was just thinking, uh,
of a flaming rum punch.

1842
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:35,488
No, it's not cold enough for
that. Not nearly cold enough.

1843
01:47:35,528 --> 01:47:36,728
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1844
01:47:36,808 --> 01:47:38,608
I got it.

1845
01:47:38,648 --> 01:47:42,288
Mulled wine, heavy on the
cinnamon and light on the cloves.

1846
01:47:42,328 --> 01:47:44,168
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1847
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:49,128
Hey, look, Mister, we serve hard drinks
in here for men who want to get drunk fast.

1848
01:47:49,168 --> 01:47:54,008
And we don't need any characters around to
give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear?

1849
01:47:54,048 --> 01:47:56,688
Or do I have to slip you
my left for a convincer?

1850
01:47:56,768 --> 01:47:57,808
What's he talking about?

1851
01:47:57,848 --> 01:48:03,328
Nick, Nick, just give him
the same as mine. He's okay.

1852
01:48:03,368 --> 01:48:04,528
Okay.

1853
01:48:05,928 --> 01:48:07,328
What's the matter with him?

1854
01:48:07,368 --> 01:48:09,488
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1855
01:48:09,528 --> 01:48:12,968
You'll see a lot of
strange things from now on.

1856
01:48:13,008 --> 01:48:14,408
Oh, yeah.

1857
01:48:15,688 --> 01:48:21,088
Hey, li-li-little
fellow, you worry me.

1858
01:48:21,128 --> 01:48:24,608
- You know, y-y-you got
someplace to sleep? - No.

1859
01:48:24,688 --> 01:48:26,208
You don't, huh?

1860
01:48:26,248 --> 01:48:28,848
- Well, y-y-you
got any money? - No.

1861
01:48:28,888 --> 01:48:31,408
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1862
01:48:31,448 --> 01:48:35,048
I jumped in the river to save
you so I could get my wings.

1863
01:48:35,088 --> 01:48:37,088
- Oh, that's
right. - Oh-oh.

1864
01:48:39,088 --> 01:48:41,128
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1865
01:48:41,168 --> 01:48:45,688
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1866
01:48:51,008 --> 01:48:58,328
Look, I think maybe you better not
mention getting your wings around here.

1867
01:48:58,408 --> 01:49:01,448
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1868
01:49:01,488 --> 01:49:04,448
A... Yeah, they believe in angels.

1869
01:49:04,488 --> 01:49:07,368
Oh, oh! Why should they be
surprised when they see one?

1870
01:49:10,128 --> 01:49:13,808
Aw, he never grew up. He's...

1871
01:49:13,848 --> 01:49:15,728
How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

1872
01:49:15,808 --> 01:49:21,048
Two hundred and
ninety-three, uh, next May.

1873
01:49:21,728 --> 01:49:23,128
That does it!

1874
01:49:23,168 --> 01:49:26,608
Out you two pixies go, through
the door or out the window.

1875
01:49:26,648 --> 01:49:27,768
Look, Nick, what's wrong?

1876
01:49:27,808 --> 01:49:30,808
And that's another thing. Where
do you come off calling me Nick?

1877
01:49:30,848 --> 01:49:32,288
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1878
01:49:32,328 --> 01:49:36,608
What's that got to do with it? I
don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1879
01:49:36,688 --> 01:49:39,208
Hey! Hey, you, rummy
there! Come here! Come here!

1880
01:49:43,008 --> 01:49:46,128
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1881
01:49:53,688 --> 01:49:55,088
Mr. Gower!

1882
01:49:56,248 --> 01:49:57,488
Mr. Gower!

1883
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:01,288
What... what is he...

1884
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:03,768
Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey!

1885
01:50:05,088 --> 01:50:08,328
- Don't you know me?
- No. No.

1886
01:50:08,408 --> 01:50:11,608
Throw 'em out. Throw 'em out!

1887
01:50:11,648 --> 01:50:14,768
Mr. Gower... Hey, what is...

1888
01:50:14,808 --> 01:50:17,048
Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't
that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1889
01:50:17,128 --> 01:50:19,288
You know, that's another
reason for me not to like you.

1890
01:50:19,328 --> 01:50:22,848
That rum head spent twenty years
in jail for poisoning a kid.

1891
01:50:22,888 --> 01:50:25,448
If you know him, you must
be a jailbird yourself.

1892
01:50:25,488 --> 01:50:28,008
Uh, would you show these
gentlemen to the door?

1893
01:50:28,048 --> 01:50:29,968
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1894
01:50:35,688 --> 01:50:37,608
Stay out! Stay out!

1895
01:50:37,648 --> 01:50:38,848
Hey! Get me!

1896
01:50:39,288 --> 01:50:40,808
I'm giving out wings!

1897
01:50:43,288 --> 01:50:44,888
You see, George, you were not there

1898
01:50:44,928 --> 01:50:47,448
to stop Gower from putting
that poison into the capsule...

1899
01:50:47,488 --> 01:50:50,448
What do you mean I wasn't there?

1900
01:50:50,488 --> 01:50:53,368
I remember distinctly. What the...

1901
01:50:53,408 --> 01:50:56,168
hey, what's going on around here?

1902
01:50:56,248 --> 01:51:00,928
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1903
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:09,048
Look, who are you?

1904
01:51:09,088 --> 01:51:11,728
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1905
01:51:11,808 --> 01:51:13,408
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1906
01:51:19,608 --> 01:51:21,768
What else are you? What are you?

1907
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:23,888
- You are hypnotist?
- No, of course not.

1908
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:26,808
Well, then why am I seeing
all these strange things?

1909
01:51:26,848 --> 01:51:29,048
Don't you understand, George?

1910
01:51:29,088 --> 01:51:31,048
It's because you were not born.

1911
01:51:31,088 --> 01:51:32,928
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

1912
01:51:33,008 --> 01:51:35,768
You're nobody. You have no identity.

1913
01:51:35,808 --> 01:51:38,248
Oh, what do you mean, no
identity? My name's George Bailey.

1914
01:51:38,288 --> 01:51:40,288
There is no George Bailey.

1915
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:50,088
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's
license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1916
01:51:50,168 --> 01:51:51,888
They're not there, either.

1917
01:51:53,328 --> 01:51:56,208
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1918
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:03,968
You've been given a
great gift, George...

1919
01:52:04,048 --> 01:52:07,448
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

1920
01:52:09,928 --> 01:52:12,848
Now wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

1921
01:52:14,528 --> 01:52:17,928
Aw, this is some sort of a
funny dream I'm having here.

1922
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:19,768
So long, Mister, I-I'm going home.

1923
01:52:19,848 --> 01:52:22,408
- Home? What home?
- Now shut up! Cut it out!

1924
01:52:23,248 --> 01:52:26,128
You're... You're... You're
crazy. That's what I think.

1925
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:29,048
You're... You're screwy and
you're driving me crazy, too!

1926
01:52:29,088 --> 01:52:30,408
I'm seeing things here.

1927
01:52:30,448 --> 01:52:32,448
I'm going home and
see my wife and family.

1928
01:52:32,488 --> 01:52:34,848
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone!

1929
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:41,608
How am I doing, Joseph? Thanks.

1930
01:52:42,248 --> 01:52:43,928
No, I didn't have a drink!

1931
01:53:34,688 --> 01:53:36,488
Hey, hey.

1932
01:53:36,528 --> 01:53:39,048
- Where did the Building and Loan move to?
- The building and what?

1933
01:53:39,128 --> 01:53:40,768
The Bailey Building and
Loan. It was up there.

1934
01:53:40,808 --> 01:53:42,968
They went out of business years ago.

1935
01:53:43,008 --> 01:53:44,688
That guy is a liar!

1936
01:53:44,728 --> 01:53:46,728
I know everything's shot in this town.

1937
01:53:46,808 --> 01:53:50,848
- I know...
- Hey, Violet.

1938
01:53:52,088 --> 01:53:54,848
Hey, listen, that's Violet Bick!

1939
01:53:54,888 --> 01:53:57,008
- I know. I know.
- I know that girl.

1940
01:53:57,048 --> 01:53:58,568
Take a walk. Beat it.

1941
01:54:00,928 --> 01:54:02,768
Hey, Ernie, Ernie...

1942
01:54:04,768 --> 01:54:06,608
Ernie, take me home.
I've gone off my nut!

1943
01:54:06,648 --> 01:54:08,248
- Where do you live?
- Aw, now, doggone it,

1944
01:54:08,328 --> 01:54:10,048
Ernie, don't you start
pulling that stuff.

1945
01:54:10,128 --> 01:54:12,248
You know where I live.
Three-twenty Sycamore.

1946
01:54:12,288 --> 01:54:14,288
- Now hurry up. - Okay.
Three-twenty Sycamore?

1947
01:54:14,368 --> 01:54:17,488
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- All right. All right.

1948
01:54:18,568 --> 01:54:20,568
Look here, Ernie,
straighten me out here.

1949
01:54:20,648 --> 01:54:22,328
Look, I-I've got some
bad liquor or something.

1950
01:54:22,368 --> 01:54:24,768
I want you to listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

1951
01:54:24,808 --> 01:54:27,768
and you live in Bailey Park with your
wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?

1952
01:54:27,808 --> 01:54:28,808
You seen my wife?

1953
01:54:28,848 --> 01:54:32,328
Seen your wife! I've been to
your house a hundred times.

1954
01:54:32,368 --> 01:54:33,568
Look, bud, what's the idea?

1955
01:54:33,608 --> 01:54:37,288
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife
ran away three years ago and took the kid...

1956
01:54:37,328 --> 01:54:39,888
And I ain't never seen
you before in my life, see?

1957
01:54:39,968 --> 01:54:42,368
Okay. Just step on
it. Just get me home.

1958
01:55:00,448 --> 01:55:02,448
- Is this the place?
- Of course, it's the place.

1959
01:55:02,488 --> 01:55:05,248
Well, this house ain't been
lived in for twenty years.

1960
01:55:11,848 --> 01:55:12,928
What's up, Ernie?

1961
01:55:12,968 --> 01:55:15,368
I don't know, but we'd better
keep our eye on this guy.

1962
01:55:15,408 --> 01:55:16,368
He's bats.

1963
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:36,928
Mary! Mary!

1964
01:55:39,728 --> 01:55:42,968
Tommy! Pete! Janie!
Zuzu! Where are you?

1965
01:55:43,008 --> 01:55:45,128
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

1966
01:55:45,168 --> 01:55:47,328
Where are they? What
have you done with them?

1967
01:55:47,368 --> 01:55:49,488
All right, put up your
hands. No fast moves.

1968
01:55:49,528 --> 01:55:51,128
Come on out here, both of you.

1969
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,688
Bert! Thank heaven, you're here.

1970
01:55:52,728 --> 01:55:55,408
- Stand back!
- Bert, what's happened to this house?

1971
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,928
Wh-Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

1972
01:55:57,008 --> 01:55:57,968
Watch him, Bert.

1973
01:55:58,048 --> 01:55:59,408
- Come on, come on.
- Bert, Ernie!

1974
01:55:59,488 --> 01:56:00,768
What's the matter with you two guys?

1975
01:56:00,808 --> 01:56:02,488
You-You-You were here
on my wedding night.

1976
01:56:02,568 --> 01:56:05,528
You, both of you, stood out there on the
porch and sung to us, don't you remember?

1977
01:56:05,568 --> 01:56:06,608
- Think I'd better be going.
- Look,

1978
01:56:06,648 --> 01:56:08,688
now why don't you be a good kid
and we'll take you into a doctor.

1979
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:10,728
- Everything's gonna be all right. Now...
- Bert, now listen to me.

1980
01:56:10,768 --> 01:56:12,968
Ernie, will you take me
over to my mother's house?

1981
01:56:13,008 --> 01:56:14,488
Bert! Listen! It's that fellow there.

1982
01:56:14,568 --> 01:56:16,768
He says he's an angel.
He's tried to hypnotize me.

1983
01:56:16,808 --> 01:56:18,808
I hate to do this, fella, but...

1984
01:56:20,448 --> 01:56:22,248
Run, George! Run, George!

1985
01:56:22,288 --> 01:56:26,008
Help! Joseph, help!

1986
01:56:26,048 --> 01:56:30,768
- Oh, shut up!
- Help, oh, Joseph, Joseph!

1987
01:56:36,408 --> 01:56:39,328
Where'd he go? Where'd he
go? I had him right here.

1988
01:56:42,448 --> 01:56:43,528
I need a drink.

1989
01:56:44,448 --> 01:56:46,568
Well, which way'd they
go? Help me find 'em.

1990
01:56:57,048 --> 01:56:58,328
Well?

1991
01:57:01,528 --> 01:57:02,568
Mother.

1992
01:57:04,608 --> 01:57:06,648
Mother? What do you want?

1993
01:57:07,768 --> 01:57:12,608
Mother, this is, this is George.
I... I thought sure you'd remember me.

1994
01:57:12,648 --> 01:57:14,128
George who?

1995
01:57:14,168 --> 01:57:15,688
If you're looking for a
room, there's no vacancy.

1996
01:57:15,728 --> 01:57:17,408
Oh, Mother, listen. Please help me.

1997
01:57:17,488 --> 01:57:19,048
Something terrible's happened to me.

1998
01:57:19,128 --> 01:57:21,888
I-I-I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

1999
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:23,488
Please let me come in.

2000
01:57:23,528 --> 01:57:25,928
- Keep me here until I get over it.
- Get over what?

2001
01:57:26,008 --> 01:57:29,408
I don't take in strangers unless
they're sent here by somebody I know.

2002
01:57:29,448 --> 01:57:33,128
What? Look, I know everybody you know.

2003
01:57:33,168 --> 01:57:35,368
What do you... Your
brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2004
01:57:35,408 --> 01:57:37,168
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2005
01:57:37,208 --> 01:57:39,488
- When'd you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2006
01:57:39,568 --> 01:57:40,568
That's a lie.

2007
01:57:40,608 --> 01:57:43,608
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2008
01:57:43,688 --> 01:57:45,488
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2009
01:57:58,408 --> 01:58:00,488
Strange, isn't it?

2010
01:58:00,528 --> 01:58:03,928
Each man's life touches
so many other lives

2011
01:58:04,008 --> 01:58:06,928
and when he isn't around he
leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2012
01:58:06,968 --> 01:58:08,088
I've heard of things like this.

2013
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:10,208
You've got me in some kind
of a spell, or something.

2014
01:58:10,248 --> 01:58:12,288
Well, I'm going to get out
of it. I'll get out of it.

2015
01:58:12,328 --> 01:58:14,288
I know how, too. I...

2016
01:58:14,328 --> 01:58:17,928
The last man I talked to before all this
stuff started happening to me was Martini.

2017
01:58:17,968 --> 01:58:18,848
You know where he lives?

2018
01:58:18,928 --> 01:58:21,128
Sure I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2019
01:58:25,888 --> 01:58:28,448
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

2020
01:58:28,488 --> 01:58:30,968
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2021
01:58:31,008 --> 01:58:33,408
All I know is this
should be Bailey Park.

2022
01:58:34,728 --> 01:58:36,328
But where are the houses?

2023
01:58:36,368 --> 01:58:38,048
You weren't here to build them.

2024
01:58:43,008 --> 01:58:44,848
Your brother, Harry Bailey,

2025
01:58:44,888 --> 01:58:48,008
broke through the ice and was
drowned at the age of nine.

2026
01:58:48,088 --> 01:58:49,808
That's a lie. Harry
Bailey went to war!

2027
01:58:49,848 --> 01:58:51,488
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor!

2028
01:58:51,568 --> 01:58:53,688
He saved the lives of
every man on that transport.

2029
01:58:53,728 --> 01:58:55,808
Every man on that transport died.

2030
01:58:55,848 --> 01:58:59,728
Harry wasn't there to save them,
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2031
01:59:11,248 --> 01:59:15,208
You see, George, you
really had a wonderful life.

2032
01:59:15,288 --> 01:59:19,608
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2033
01:59:20,008 --> 01:59:22,848
- Clarence...
- Yes, George?

2034
01:59:22,888 --> 01:59:26,208
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I... I... I can't do...

2035
01:59:26,248 --> 01:59:27,528
I don't know how you
know these things,

2036
01:59:27,568 --> 01:59:28,728
- but tell me, where is she?
- I...

2037
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,768
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2038
01:59:30,808 --> 01:59:31,968
I'm not supposed to tell.

2039
01:59:32,008 --> 01:59:33,848
Please, Clarence,
tell me where she is.

2040
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:36,248
- You're not going to like it, George.
- Where is she?

2041
01:59:36,288 --> 01:59:38,648
She's an old maid. She never married.

2042
01:59:38,688 --> 01:59:39,968
Where's Mary, where is she?

2043
01:59:40,008 --> 01:59:41,168
- She is...
- Where is she?

2044
01:59:41,248 --> 01:59:44,168
She's just about to
close up the library!

2045
01:59:47,208 --> 01:59:51,608
Aw, there must be some easier
way for me to get my wings.

2046
02:00:02,928 --> 02:00:04,048
Mary!

2047
02:00:09,608 --> 02:00:10,688
Mary!

2048
02:00:13,288 --> 02:00:15,968
Mary, Mary, Mary...

2049
02:00:16,008 --> 02:00:18,568
Mary, it's George.

2050
02:00:18,608 --> 02:00:20,048
Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2051
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:22,408
- I don't know you, let me go!
- Mary, please!

2052
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:24,688
Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2053
02:00:24,728 --> 02:00:26,688
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary!

2054
02:00:27,528 --> 02:00:30,448
Help me, Mary! Mary...

2055
02:00:30,488 --> 02:00:31,528
Let me go!

2056
02:00:33,568 --> 02:00:37,248
- Mary, don't run away!
- That man, stop him!

2057
02:00:37,328 --> 02:00:39,088
Tom! Ed!

2058
02:00:39,128 --> 02:00:41,928
Charlie! That's my wife!

2059
02:00:44,408 --> 02:00:45,968
- Mary!
- Oh, no, you don't!

2060
02:00:46,048 --> 02:00:48,528
- Somebody call the police!
- Hit him with a bottle!

2061
02:00:48,568 --> 02:00:50,528
He needs a straight jacket.

2062
02:00:50,928 --> 02:00:52,928
Mary! Clarence!

2063
02:00:53,688 --> 02:00:55,208
Get out of here!

2064
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:59,328
- Clarence!
- Where are you?

2065
02:00:59,408 --> 02:01:00,728
Oh, it's you!

2066
02:01:04,048 --> 02:01:05,288
Stand back!

2067
02:01:19,408 --> 02:01:20,608
Clarence!

2068
02:01:25,648 --> 02:01:28,248
Clarence! Clarence!

2069
02:01:29,488 --> 02:01:30,808
Help me, Clarence.

2070
02:01:32,288 --> 02:01:33,408
Get me back.

2071
02:01:34,568 --> 02:01:36,768
Get me back. I don't
care what happens to me.

2072
02:01:37,808 --> 02:01:39,808
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2073
02:01:40,368 --> 02:01:41,808
Help me, Clarence, please.

2074
02:01:42,968 --> 02:01:46,328
Please! I want to live again.

2075
02:01:46,368 --> 02:01:47,888
I want to live again.

2076
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:50,928
I want to live again.

2077
02:01:51,008 --> 02:01:53,608
Please, God, let me live again.

2078
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:03,408
Hey, George.

2079
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:06,368
George!

2080
02:02:07,408 --> 02:02:09,448
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2081
02:02:09,488 --> 02:02:11,928
Now get out of here, Bert or
I'll hit you again! Get out!

2082
02:02:11,968 --> 02:02:13,848
What the Sam Hill you,
you yelling for, George!

2083
02:02:13,928 --> 02:02:18,408
You... George?

2084
02:02:18,488 --> 02:02:19,848
Bert, do you know me?

2085
02:02:19,888 --> 02:02:21,888
Know you? Hum, are you kidding'?

2086
02:02:21,928 --> 02:02:24,128
I've been looking all over
town, trying to find you.

2087
02:02:24,168 --> 02:02:27,208
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2088
02:02:27,248 --> 02:02:29,568
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2089
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:30,728
What did you...

2090
02:02:35,008 --> 02:02:38,408
My mouth's bleeding,
Bert! My mouth's bleed...

2091
02:02:38,448 --> 02:02:41,528
Zuzu's petals,
Zuzu's... There they are!

2092
02:02:41,608 --> 02:02:44,448
Bert! What do you know about that?

2093
02:02:44,528 --> 02:02:46,888
Merry Christmas!

2094
02:02:46,928 --> 02:02:48,768
Well, Merry Christmas!

2095
02:02:48,808 --> 02:02:49,848
Mary!

2096
02:02:50,768 --> 02:02:52,048
Mary!

2097
02:02:53,328 --> 02:02:55,648
Yaa!

2098
02:02:59,248 --> 02:03:00,568
Yaa!

2099
02:03:00,608 --> 02:03:03,008
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2100
02:03:05,568 --> 02:03:08,768
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2101
02:03:08,808 --> 02:03:10,768
Merry Christmas, George!

2102
02:03:10,808 --> 02:03:14,008
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2103
02:03:14,088 --> 02:03:17,168
Merry Christmas, Emporium!

2104
02:03:17,248 --> 02:03:21,208
Merry Christmas, you wonderful
old Building and Loan!

2105
02:03:25,368 --> 02:03:28,488
Hey! Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2106
02:03:28,528 --> 02:03:31,208
Happy New Year to you... in jail.

2107
02:03:31,248 --> 02:03:33,888
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2108
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:36,568
Mary!

2109
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,208
Mary!

2110
02:03:39,968 --> 02:03:41,208
Mary!

2111
02:03:42,048 --> 02:03:45,008
Well, hello, Mr. Bank
Examiner. How are you?

2112
02:03:45,048 --> 02:03:47,328
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know. Eight thousand dollars.

2113
02:03:47,368 --> 02:03:48,568
George, I've got a little paper here.

2114
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,768
I'll bet it's a warrant for
my arrest. Isn't it wonderful?

2115
02:03:50,808 --> 02:03:51,768
I'm going to jail.

2116
02:03:51,808 --> 02:03:53,008
Merry Christmas! Reporters?

2117
02:03:53,048 --> 02:03:54,288
Wh-Where's Mary?

2118
02:03:54,328 --> 02:03:57,248
Mary! Oh, look at this
wonderful old drafty house.

2119
02:03:57,288 --> 02:04:02,088
Mary! Mary! Mary!

2120
02:04:02,648 --> 02:04:04,408
Have you... Have you seen my wife?

2121
02:04:04,448 --> 02:04:07,328
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!

2122
02:04:07,368 --> 02:04:09,968
Kids! Pete!

2123
02:04:10,048 --> 02:04:11,568
Oh!

2124
02:04:14,048 --> 02:04:17,088
Kids! Janie! Janie! Tommy!

2125
02:04:19,128 --> 02:04:20,528
Oh, let me look at you.

2126
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,928
Oh, I could eat you up.

2127
02:04:22,888 --> 02:04:25,608
- Where is your mother?
- She went looking for you with Uncle Billy.

2128
02:04:25,688 --> 02:04:27,928
- Daddy!
- Zuzu! Zuzu!

2129
02:04:27,968 --> 02:04:30,048
My little gingersnap! How do you feel?

2130
02:04:30,088 --> 02:04:34,168
- Fine! Not a smitch of temperature.
- Not a smitch of tempe...

2131
02:04:34,208 --> 02:04:35,568
Hallelujah!

2132
02:04:36,808 --> 02:04:38,448
- George! George!
- Mary! Mary!

2133
02:04:38,488 --> 02:04:40,448
George, darling! Where have you been?

2134
02:04:40,488 --> 02:04:42,328
George, darling! Where have you been?

2135
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:47,208
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary! Let me touch you.

2136
02:04:47,248 --> 02:04:50,088
Let me touch you. Oh, you're real!

2137
02:04:50,128 --> 02:04:52,768
Oh, George... George.

2138
02:04:52,808 --> 02:04:54,688
You have no idea what happened to me.

2139
02:04:54,728 --> 02:04:57,008
You have no idea what happened.

2140
02:04:57,048 --> 02:05:00,448
Well, well, come on, George, come on
downstairs, quick. They're on their way.

2141
02:05:00,528 --> 02:05:02,128
- All right.
- Come on!

2142
02:05:04,848 --> 02:05:06,688
Come on in here now.

2143
02:05:07,648 --> 02:05:11,728
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree.
Right there, and don't move, don't move.

2144
02:05:11,768 --> 02:05:13,808
What's happening? Who's gonna come?

2145
02:05:13,848 --> 02:05:16,848
I hear 'em coming now,
George, it's a miracle!

2146
02:05:16,888 --> 02:05:20,048
- It's a miracle!
- Who's coming?

2147
02:05:20,088 --> 02:05:21,008
Who's gonna come, Daddy?

2148
02:05:21,048 --> 02:05:22,208
- Who, Daddy?
- I don't know.

2149
02:05:22,288 --> 02:05:25,768
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody! In here!

2150
02:05:32,208 --> 02:05:33,848
Isn't it wonderful? So many faces!

2151
02:05:33,888 --> 02:05:35,448
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2152
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:37,488
She told some people you
were in trouble and then,

2153
02:05:37,528 --> 02:05:39,448
they scattered all over
town collecting money.

2154
02:05:39,488 --> 02:05:42,328
They didn't ask any questions - just said:
"If George is in trouble, count me in...

2155
02:05:42,368 --> 02:05:45,808
What is this, George?
Another run on the bank?

2156
02:05:46,408 --> 02:05:48,328
Here you are, George, Merry Christmas.

2157
02:05:50,968 --> 02:05:54,368
The line forms on the right.

2158
02:05:54,448 --> 02:05:57,808
Merry Christmas! God bless you.

2159
02:06:00,968 --> 02:06:04,288
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas!

2160
02:06:04,328 --> 02:06:06,688
Step right up here.

2161
02:06:06,728 --> 02:06:09,048
I busted the jukebox, too!

2162
02:06:12,168 --> 02:06:13,568
Mr. Gower!

2163
02:06:16,168 --> 02:06:18,248
I made the rounds of
all my charge accounts.

2164
02:06:26,088 --> 02:06:29,048
- Violet Bick!  - I'm not going to go,
George. I changed my mind.

2165
02:06:35,048 --> 02:06:39,048
I've been saving this money for a
divorce, if ever I get a husband.

2166
02:06:44,008 --> 02:06:47,448
There you are, George. I got
the faculty all up out of bed.

2167
02:06:47,488 --> 02:06:49,488
And here's something
for you to play with.

2168
02:06:51,248 --> 02:06:54,448
I wouldn't have a roof over my
head if it wasn't for you, George.

2169
02:06:54,528 --> 02:06:56,288
Just a minute. Just a minute.

2170
02:06:56,328 --> 02:06:58,008
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2171
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:01,128
- I just got this. It's from London.
- Oh.

2172
02:07:01,208 --> 02:07:03,888
Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2173
02:07:03,968 --> 02:07:08,328
My office instructed to advance you up
to twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop.

2174
02:07:08,368 --> 02:07:11,328
Hee-haw and Merry
Christmas. Sam Wainwright.

2175
02:07:21,608 --> 02:07:24,248
Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2176
02:07:29,328 --> 02:07:33,648
Hark, the Herald angels sing

2177
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:37,968
Glory to the new-born king.

2178
02:07:38,048 --> 02:07:42,288
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,

2179
02:07:42,328 --> 02:07:46,568
God and sinners reconciled.

2180
02:07:46,648 --> 02:07:50,848
Joyful all ye nations rise,

2181
02:07:50,928 --> 02:07:55,128
Join the triumph of the skies,

2182
02:07:55,168 --> 02:07:59,248
With angelic hosts proclaim

2183
02:07:59,288 --> 02:08:03,288
Christ is born in Bethlehem,

2184
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:07,488
Harry Bailey.

2185
02:08:10,448 --> 02:08:12,728
George, old son of a gun.

2186
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:16,488
- Harry! Harry!
- Looks like I got here too late.

2187
02:08:16,528 --> 02:08:19,168
Mary, I got him here from the
airport as quickly as I could.

2188
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:21,088
The fool flew all the
way up here in a blizzard.

2189
02:08:21,168 --> 02:08:22,848
Harry, how about your
banquet in New York?

2190
02:08:22,888 --> 02:08:25,248
Oh, I left right in the middle of
it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2191
02:08:25,288 --> 02:08:27,288
Good idea, Ernie, a toast...

2192
02:08:27,368 --> 02:08:29,208
to my big brother George.

2193
02:08:29,248 --> 02:08:31,088
The richest man in town!

2194
02:08:32,688 --> 02:08:38,448
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2195
02:08:38,488 --> 02:08:43,208
And never brought to mind,

2196
02:08:43,248 --> 02:08:47,848
Should auld acquaintance

2197
02:08:47,928 --> 02:08:54,568
Be forgot, and days of Auld Lang Syne.

2198
02:08:54,608 --> 02:08:55,568
What's that?

2199
02:08:57,168 --> 02:09:00,448
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2200
02:09:01,688 --> 02:09:02,648
Look, Daddy.

2201
02:09:02,728 --> 02:09:09,048
Teacher says every time a bell
rings, an angel gets his wings.

2202
02:09:09,088 --> 02:09:12,048
That's right. That's right.

2203
02:09:14,048 --> 02:09:15,928
Atta boy, Clarence.

2204
02:09:17,888 --> 02:09:23,328
For Auld Land Syne, my dear.

2205
02:09:23,368 --> 02:09:28,528
For Auld Land Syne

2206
02:09:28,568 --> 02:09:33,968
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2207
02:09:34,008 --> 02:09:40,688
For Auld Lang Syne

2208
02:09:40,768 --> 02:09:45,688
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2209
02:09:45,768 --> 02:09:53,768
For Auld Lang Syne
