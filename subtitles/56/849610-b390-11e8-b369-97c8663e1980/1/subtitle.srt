1
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,928
- I never heard of him.
- Who?

2
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,472
The man you recommended.

3
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,099
The guitar fighter?

4
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:04,229
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,983
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

6
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,277
You should meet him.

7
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,988
Me. Me. That's me.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,162
As long as l'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,998
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,084
No.

11
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,588
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,883
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,846
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.

14
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,724
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

15
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,187
But Marquez, that's a different story.

16
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,231
Marquez.

17
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,276
Marquez. General Marquez.

18
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,656
Powerful, dangerous.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,910
Marquez, he really had it in
for this Mariachi, see.

20
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,298
They called him "Mariachi"
because he used to carry this guitar.

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,884
A guitar?

22
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,929
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

23
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,916
Look, this story is well-traveled.

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,086
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

25
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,173
Just read between the lines.

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,377
Now, he may not have been
the biggest Mexican ever...

27
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,422
- All right.
- ...but she was as deadly...

28
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,924
...as she was beautiful.

29
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,762
- There's a girl?
- Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

30
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,390
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

31
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,146
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

32
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,527
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

33
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,532
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,453
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

35
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,375
...put a bullet in his heart.

36
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,591
Only he didn't die.

37
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,555
- l don't know what happened after that.
- Would you like some?

38
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,726
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

39
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,896
But like l said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

40
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,775
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

41
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,819
Well...

42
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,614
...that is truly unbelievable.

43
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,909
Well, l'm not big on telling stories.

44
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,537
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

45
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,707
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

46
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,127
...for $1 0,000 in cash.

47
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,634
It'll do.

48
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:49,097
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

49
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,309
- Why'd you say no?
- l'm not a greedy man.

50
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,770
Not looking to get rich quick.

51
00:05:54,937 --> 00:06:00,067
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

52
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:04,279
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

53
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,366
But 1 0?

54
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,202
Ten thousand is civilized.

55
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,788
Ten is something
we both can live with.

56
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,044
Ten might still be too much.

57
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,964
You'd kill me over $1 0,000?

58
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:29,888
You wouldn't dare.

59
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,850
Yes, l would.

60
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,599
Would you do me the honor?

61
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,645
You need to learn to play.

62
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,481
That's why you're here.

63
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,642
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

64
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,645
We only make guitars here.

65
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,901
Mariachi.

66
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,819
Which one?

67
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,288
I don't know who you mean.

68
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,729
I'm honored to be in your presence.

69
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,357
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

70
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,159
Keep it. He made that for you.

71
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,896
You know, if l was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

72
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,190
Go back to where l came from...

73
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,652
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

74
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,697
You speak English?

75
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,366
I didn't think so.

76
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,164
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

77
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,877
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

78
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,716
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

79
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,066
I present to you Senor Blascoe.

80
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,757
Please sit.

81
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,596
We hear you want to work for us.

82
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,773
I too am ready to start a new life.

83
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,447
This is your lucky day.

84
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,041
Did you order my pibil?

85
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,255
- Does it have a name?
- They call him "El."

86
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,632
As in "The."

87
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,844
I know what it means. Thank you.

88
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,722
Alert the Barillo cartel...

89
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,059
...that El has come out of hiding.

90
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,104
- l don't think we should--
- Are you a Mexican...

91
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,773
...or a Mexi-can't?

92
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,278
I'm a Mexican.

93
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,196
Good.

94
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,325
Then do as l say.

95
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,462
- Nice tune.
- Something my brother taught me.

96
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,214
I killed him.

97
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,344
Yes, l was privy to that
information already. How charming.

98
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,805
You know, El,
if l may call you that...

99
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,769
...l've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

100
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,021
...have quite a price on your head.

101
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,440
I wouldn't want to be you.

102
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,527
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

103
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,698
You tell me.

104
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,201
I need you to kill a man.

105
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,290
El, you really must try this
because it's puerco pibil.

106
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,336
It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...

107
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:08,925
...and l order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

108
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:14,222
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

109
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,516
In fact, it's too good.

110
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,894
It's so good that when l'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

111
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,897
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

112
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,609
Because that's what l do.
I restore the balance to this country.

113
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,237
And that is what l would like
from you right now.

114
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,656
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

115
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,701
- You want me to shoot the cook?
- No, I'll shoot the cook.

116
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,162
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

117
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,165
...will kill Marquez.

118
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,293
Do you remember General Marquez?

119
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,715
He's being paid by Barillo...

120
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,592
...to kill the President
in an attempted coup d'etat.

121
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,596
- Attempted?
- Oh, no. The President will be killed...

122
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,600
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

123
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,229
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

124
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,566
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

125
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,902
...after he's killed
the President. Savvy?

126
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,906
- So why me?
- You've got nothing to live for...

127
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,409
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

128
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,537
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

129
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,749
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

130
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,044
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

131
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:31,090
And l will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

132
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,060
Was I right?

133
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,354
I guess not.

134
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,334
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

135
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,669
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

136
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:13,508
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

137
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,845
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

138
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,265
With el Presidente's new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...

139
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,685
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

140
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,565
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

141
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,277
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

142
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,574
This is a top priority of el Presidente.
Who wants this?

143
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,702
Romero, it's yours.

144
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,455
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

145
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,041
That's all. Dismissed.

146
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,212
I should take his left nut.

147
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,132
You're with us.

148
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,721
People of Culiacan.

149
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,935
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

150
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,897
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

151
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,066
that is threatening our nation.

152
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,485
People like Armando Barillo.

153
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,196
I invite you to gather our forces...

154
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,074
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

155
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,952
...and our peace.

156
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:29,083
EL Presidente, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...

157
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,211
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

158
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,298
...to take possession of a province.

159
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,759
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

160
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,553
He doesn't own its people.

161
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,264
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

162
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,558
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

163
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,437
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

164
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,649
- He's a folk hero to them.
- He's also a mass murderer...

165
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,776
...and a drug kingpin.

166
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,947
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

167
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,283
...but the people can
see through that.

168
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,954
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

169
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,458
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

170
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,170
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

171
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,216
Then l will die fighting.

172
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,801
Are you with me?

173
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,806
To the death.

174
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,967
What's wrong?

175
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,345
Everything.

176
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,689
This way!

177
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,607
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

178
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,779
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

179
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,032
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

180
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,246
Jump.

181
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,421
Swing, swing, swing.

182
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,633
- Hang on!
- What do you mean, hold on?

183
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,475
Let go now!

184
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,307
Give me that!

185
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,852
Stop the bus.

186
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,961
A vow must be broken.

187
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,547
Forgive me...

188
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,924
for what I am about to become.

189
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,806
- When was your last confession?
- An hour ago.

190
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,726
- And the name of your priest?
- Sands.

191
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:43,564
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter--

192
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,524
- Yeah, I know.
- Failure to appear...

193
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,860
...in locations at assigned times...

194
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:52,448
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

195
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,366
- Yeah.
- You'll be paid.

196
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,745
Coup d'etats, like elections,
don't come cheap.

197
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,248
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

198
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,543
There's more.
You will be a free man...

199
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,631
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the President...

200
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,800
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

201
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,471
- When do l begin?
- Give me a moment.

202
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,513
It's a church, hombre.

203
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,219
I'm sorry.

204
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,800
Are you still standing?

205
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,803
Still.

206
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,182
Good. Well, the Barillo cartel
aren't the nicest of guys, are they?

207
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,602
However, you've passed the test.

208
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,688
You're gonna do just fine.

209
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:15,234
Assemble your team, and l will
call you with further instructions.

210
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,986
Over and out.

211
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:26,453
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

212
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,541
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

213
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,837
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

214
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,673
Why would l want that?
Why would l want bubble gum?

215
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,388
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,977
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

217
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,856
So l don't ever
want to see you again.

218
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,983
Fuck off.

219
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,581
- Hi.
- Hello.

220
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,834
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

221
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:18,255
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, l just don't know what is.

222
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,008
- l'm retired FBI.
- A real agent never retires.

223
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,677
He just takes it a little easier.

224
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:29,349
- Why are we talking?
- You tracked down Armando Barillo...

225
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,853
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

226
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,564
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

227
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,901
Well, he--

228
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:43,739
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

229
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,240
I know.

230
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,452
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

231
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,454
Can't be touched.

232
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,957
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-1 0 criminal...

233
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,045
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

234
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,090
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

235
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,927
Now, retired or not...

236
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,723
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

237
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,142
I'm a civilian now.

238
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,729
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

239
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,023
...Archuleta?

240
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,110
Yes.

241
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,656
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

242
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,826
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

243
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,371
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

244
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:38,293
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

245
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:43,048
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

246
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,967
You must have known that.

247
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,932
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

248
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,643
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

249
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,606
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

250
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,608
For your dead friend...

251
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,528
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

252
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,365
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

253
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:18,000
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

254
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,460
...the world.

255
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,689
(Announcer)
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!

256
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,399
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

257
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,401
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

258
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,112
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

259
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,202
Where the hell have you been?

260
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,037
Far away.

261
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,914
Still fucking around?

262
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,751
Let me get Fideo.

263
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,380
I'm here for my guitar.

264
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,015
It's his last night.

265
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,018
They're firing him.

266
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,604
Hey...

267
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,607
...Fideo, it's me.

268
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,237
- Still drinking.
- Like a fish.

269
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,365
I guess we haven't changed
so much.

270
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,747
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

271
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,375
Neither did l.

272
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,752
Are we on?

273
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,755
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

274
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:37,014
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

275
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,432
...coffee.

276
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,600
Lots of coffee.

277
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,939
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

278
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,274
One...

279
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,945
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

280
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,075
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

281
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,621
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

282
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:07,335
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

283
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,631
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

284
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,800
Of course it is.

285
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,719
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

286
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,929
Creative sportsmanship.

287
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,848
In other words...

288
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,815
...one has to rig the game.

289
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,611
Go collect.

290
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,584
EL Presidente is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...

291
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,294
...in the town of Culiacan.

292
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,921
He's going to be isolated...

293
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,800
...in the main edificio
in the center of the plaza.

294
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,053
Very easy access to him if...

295
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,596
...somebody can get you in.

296
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,766
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

297
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,852
I am not the prince.

298
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,688
I am the man behind the prince.

299
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,608
- l see.
- He's not the first prince l've served...

300
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,361
...nor the first one that l've betrayed.

301
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,532
- You're a good rat. l like you.
- l try.

302
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,202
The rest upon completion.

303
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,664
- Mucho gusto.
- Right. Right.

304
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,798
Every goddamn time.

305
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,535
What do you want in life?

306
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,493
Belini...

307
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,372
...how long have you and l
done business together?

308
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,457
A long time.

309
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,542
And in a way...

310
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,297
...l kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

311
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,174
Almost.

312
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,510
But you need to stop farting around.

313
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,222
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

314
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,641
I have what you need.

315
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,770
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

316
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,563
That make you nervous?

317
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,192
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

318
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,944
...is a serious offense.

319
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,031
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

320
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,827
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

321
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,371
...and skull-fucking you to death.

322
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,209
No.

323
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,213
I'm fine. Go away.

324
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,052
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

325
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,846
Leave me alone.

326
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,141
That spill just cost you your life.

327
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,704
A little help.

328
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,431
Okay.

329
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,350
I know it's on you somewhere.

330
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,101
Somewhere.

331
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,566
All right.

332
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,818
Time to get messy.

333
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,798
Well, l suppose l should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

334
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,220
However.

335
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,523
You're about a quart low.

336
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,750
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

337
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,962
- Why doesn't my key work anymore?
- lt's too small.

338
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,343
- Stand back.
- l just-- I brought you a gift.

339
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,803
I'm still mad at you.

340
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,223
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So....

341
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,393
Come closer and l'll thank you.

342
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,858
- Are you trying to give me a boner?
- Closer, l said.

343
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,068
How about that little tip-off?

344
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:51,614
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

345
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,741
Even from your twisted little agency.

346
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,910
I'm impressed.

347
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,163
- But then what?
- Want to hear my plan?

348
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,999
Either that or I start target practice.

349
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:07,422
Okay. The new President is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

350
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,717
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

351
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,262
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

352
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,056
He wants him
to throw a coup d'etat...

353
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,393
...while the President's
visiting Culiacan.

354
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,605
Now, I have a man inside
as insurance...

355
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,232
...to make sure that Marquez
never takes power.

356
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,027
The last piece of the puzzle...

357
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,907
...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures...

358
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,994
...that Barillo is out of the picture
while the battle ensues.

359
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:42,457
ln the aftermath
of this very healthy revolution...

360
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,754
...I will calmly waltz away with
the 20 million pesos...

361
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,382
...that Barillo is prepared to pay
Marquez for the coup.

362
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,093
- You want me to go with you?
- You detain Barillo...

363
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,555
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

364
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,724
...and share the spoils.

365
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,314
You meet me two nights from now...

366
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,942
...at La Pileta, 1 0 p.m. sharp...

367
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,320
...and bring only
what's important to you.

368
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,741
Oh, yeah.

369
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,537
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So....

370
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,165
- Can you dig it?
- l can dig it.

371
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,626
I want my key back.

372
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,972
Testing. One, two. Testing.

373
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,970
Hello?

374
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,972
Can you hear me now?

375
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,142
Okay-- Fucking bells.

376
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,603
Did you assemble your team?

377
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,563
You know I did.

378
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:33,026
- Why are you having me followed?
- Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...

379
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,320
...guarantee of compliance,
shall we?

380
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,238
Because Cucuy also...

381
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,325
- ...provides protection.
- From what? Mosquitoes?

382
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,411
Oh, gosh, l really wouldn't mess
with him if l were you...

383
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,455
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

384
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,708
And he's not the happiest
that you killed his man.

385
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,128
Oh, yeah, by the by,
I have your next assignment.

386
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,391
You the Mariachis?

387
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,201
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

388
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,884
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

389
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,386
Who are they?

390
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,054
Musicians.

391
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,354
Why so heavy?

392
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,191
Built in amplifier.

393
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,277
Play something.

394
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,989
All right.

395
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,216
Let's go.

396
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,139
- l was afraid you couldn't play.
- Are you kidding?

397
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,190
What we are looking for is support

398
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,066
from the people of this state.

399
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,861
A man can do a lot alone,

400
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,365
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

401
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,119
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

402
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,209
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, cabron.

403
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,762
Hey.

404
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,390
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

405
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,482
Is there a particular song you
would like to hear?

406
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,088
We just played for el Presidente,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!

407
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,799
It was meant as an honor.

408
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,759
Fuck honor.

409
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,221
- We need money.
- The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

410
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,723
Even for you, Lorenzo.

411
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,435
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

412
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,437
Only revenge.

413
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,732
Much delayed revenge.

414
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,031
Go practice.

415
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,450
Practice?

416
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,204
Playing or shooting?

417
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,956
What do you think?

418
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,542
I don't think. l drink.

419
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,303
- Yeah, hello.
- Been following Barillo...

420
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:15,141
- ...and the good Dr. Guevera.
- Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

421
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,145
- Good man. Welcome to the fold.
- l haven't seen illegal activities yet.

422
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,523
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

423
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,025
...on November 2.

424
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,235
The Day of the Dead.
That's tomorrow.

425
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,989
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

426
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,492
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

427
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,621
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

428
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,831
- Bet my badge on it.
- Well...

429
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,792
...whatever they're up to,
I can guarantee you...

430
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,003
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

431
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,839
- So I suggest you--
- What's going down tomorrow?

432
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,050
If you see an opening, take it.

433
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,803
- What do you know?
- Not enough. Get inside.

434
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,395
I've got nothing.

435
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,440
I gotta get in. l got nothing.

436
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,444
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

437
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,074
What are you gonna do, stupid?

438
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,997
Billy Chambers is on the move.

439
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,711
Where are you going?

440
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,050
You're buying a taco.

441
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,135
This is too easy.

442
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,471
Where are the other guys?

443
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,349
This is a setup.

444
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,935
It smells like a setup.

445
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,568
I'm making my move.

446
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,773
Billy Chambers.

447
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,446
- Well, that depends who's asking.
- l thought that was you.

448
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,574
- Here, let me pay for this.
- Oh, well, thanks.

449
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,203
Oh, goddamn it.

450
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,457
- ls that real?
- Yes, it is.

451
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,626
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

452
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,921
Whoa, hey, friend.

453
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,008
You ain't gonna need that.

454
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,803
Believe it or not, man,
I'm ready to go.

455
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,639
Let's talk over there.

456
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,518
After you.

457
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,068
Man, l just wanna get out of here.

458
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,154
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

459
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:19,492
...for the last eight goddamn years.

460
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,121
And l've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

461
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,875
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

462
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,128
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

463
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,547
Jorge Ramirez.

464
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:38,219
I'll take you in under the FBl's
supervision and protection...

465
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:44,266
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

466
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,685
- ln the U.S.?
- ln the U.S.

467
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,399
The things that l've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

468
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,028
- ...unspeakable.
- You don't know what Barillo's up to?

469
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,239
I'm close to the man.

470
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,908
I'm real close.

471
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,828
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

472
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,163
Can you get him close to Barillo?

473
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,294
Him?

474
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,089
I need your help.

475
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,846
Then you get me out of here.

476
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,056
Then l'll get you out of here.

477
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,434
Him too.

478
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,349
There's cartel on every corner.

479
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,271
Sands told me
you handle protection.

480
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,773
I don't work for Sands anymore.

481
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,068
And since l'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever l want.

482
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,031
Then l guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

483
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,742
- Goodbye.
- There's a price on your head.

484
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,829
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

485
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,665
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

486
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,125
And if l don't?

487
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,961
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

488
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,297
What if your whole village was next?

489
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,635
Would you kill them?

490
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,221
Me? They certainly would.

491
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,267
Then l guess I have no choice...

492
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,229
...but to kill you all.

493
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,659
You...

494
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,369
...are last.

495
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,292
That should put him out
for a few days...

496
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,295
...and give him some nasty dreams.

497
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,845
You have to relax your fingers.

498
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,809
Music is pure, from one's soul.

499
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:44,316
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.

500
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,660
And if the soul isn't pure?

501
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,496
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.

502
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,791
I present to you...

503
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,502
...Senor Cucuy.

504
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,216
Get this condescending ass
out of here.

505
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,261
You want me to break his fingers?

506
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,763
No. I want you to chop them off.

507
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,810
- l was just making a joke.
- l wasn't.

508
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,279
Sit, please.

509
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,866
So...

510
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:37,411
...you are the man who brought us...

511
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,288
...the Mariachi.

512
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,208
The man l work for, Mr. Sands...

513
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,546
...he is using the Mariachi
to kill General Marquez.

514
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,882
So you want to join us...

515
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,884
...here's how it works.

516
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,304
There is the bait. There is the trade.

517
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,223
A favor for a favor.

518
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,478
So El Mariachi is the trade?

519
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,189
You are.

520
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,080
This ain't my line of work.

521
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,092
This guy's all fucked up.

522
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:28,040
General Marquez is arriving!

523
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,587
Bring out the Mariachi!

524
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:40,260
Bring him out to the General!

525
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,906
I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.

526
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,368
But l see now...

527
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,287
that blood will spill again.

528
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,460
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.

529
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,420
He escaped.

530
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,923
You too will escape.

531
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,065
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore--

532
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,078
Why?

533
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,414
Practice shooting, not drinking.

534
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,793
We are on.

535
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,189
By order of the President, they
are searching all vehicles

536
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,232
for guns and drugs.

537
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,860
That fucker's been blockading
all the roads.

538
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,486
Take us back another way.

539
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,991
By order of the President.

540
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,493
Who does this guy think he is?

541
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,495
He wants to get rid of me?

542
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,330
Fine.

543
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,374
I'll get rid of him.

544
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,626
Replace him, even.

545
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:41,590
Then I will simply disappear.

546
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,763
Hey, vamonos, man.

547
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,155
Don't put me out completely.

548
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,536
Have my men wait outside.

549
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:59,084
Barillo and Dr. Guevera
must already be inside the building...

550
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:03,129
...having entered
through the back or basement.

551
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,092
They should be midprocedure.

552
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,974
Federal agents.

553
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,936
This is going down now.

554
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:20,475
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities...

555
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,686
...he succeeded.

556
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:30,652
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially completed...

557
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:35,657
...facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.

558
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,606
They switched bodies.

559
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,441
Barillo!

560
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,323
FBI.

561
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,952
He was anyway.
Bring him along.

562
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:10,043
Listen, l cannot do everything
by myself.

563
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,128
I need someone
to go in there with me.

564
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,215
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.

565
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:19,511
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.

566
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,680
Plus, l'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.

567
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:27,602
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army...

568
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,145
...but they've got no guns.

569
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:32,774
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...

570
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,402
...because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?

571
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,904
Hello?

572
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,781
Hello? Are you there?

573
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,700
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.

574
01:08:56,423 --> 01:09:01,678
I would like the puerco pibil
and a tequila with lime.

575
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,397
Yeah, listen, I need a new line.

576
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,149
This one's been compromised.

577
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,402
Okay? Thank you.

578
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,655
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.

579
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,198
That's right.

580
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:25,451
The Flying Cow.

581
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,207
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?

582
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,955
Sorry, baby, I told you l wasn't
interested in your scheme.

583
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,915
Too small.

584
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:59,796
Oh, my Christ. ls that Barillo?

585
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:04,425
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.

586
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,679
What kind of cartel would have you
running its operation?

587
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,431
I'm his daughter.

588
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,688
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.

589
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:21,192
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line...

590
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,946
...and you will have every marine
from here to Guantanamo Bay...

591
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,117
...up your keister, mister.
So just know that.

592
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:34,831
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.

593
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:39,043
You have only seen too much.

594
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:45,091
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

595
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,273
On this day of the dead,

596
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,234
I offer you a chance for a new life.

597
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,289
That sounded a little extreme
for a parade.

598
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,333
Troops are coming up
from the south.

599
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,918
- Whose?
- Emiliano Marquez.

600
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:25,006
- Well, what do we do?
- We stay here. This place is fortified.

601
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:29,969
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.

602
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,973
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!

603
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:39,520
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.

604
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,455
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.

605
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,124
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

606
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,877
I throw shapes. I throw shapes.

607
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:06,547
I set them up. l watch them fall.

608
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,472
I'm living la vida loca.

609
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,407
No!

610
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,498
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.

611
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,708
I will give you this...

612
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,214
...if you'll be my eyes.

613
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,508
It's a dollar.

614
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,009
I meant...

615
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,886
...this.

616
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:57,140
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.

617
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,017
Is someone following you?

618
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,813
It's difficult for me to tell right now
because l'm having a bad day.

619
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,065
Do you see someone?

620
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:10,194
Yes, he's getting close.

621
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,240
Listen, have you ever seen
one of these?

622
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,203
Have you used one?

623
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,581
Don't ever,
because they're bad.

624
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,292
But what I need for you to do
is to aim this...

625
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,463
...at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.

626
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,881
Kill him?

627
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:33,718
Oh, yeah. Very matalo.
Close?

628
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,097
Okay. Smoke him.

629
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:43,561
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.

630
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,064
What?

631
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,318
Okay. Come here.

632
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,907
Right or left?

633
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,373
Was that my right or your right?

634
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,482
Wrong man.

635
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,944
Sorry.

636
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,336
Look me in the eyes...

637
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,090
...and then kill me.

638
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,903
Good boy. Now you're thinking.

639
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:20,575
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.

640
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,849
For you...

641
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:48,686
for our daughter...

642
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,732
for Mexico.

643
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:32,647
In my past, l'd take on evil
from the bottom.

644
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,566
Now I realize...

645
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,401
...start at the top.

646
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:42,114
The President is a good man.

647
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,327
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.

648
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,916
Watch him.

649
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,304
We could torture him.

650
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,141
He's FBI.

651
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,103
He's retired.

652
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:13,938
That doesn't count.

653
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,694
I was tortured once.

654
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,320
I didn't like it.

655
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,490
You know what the fucked up thing is?

656
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,410
They tore out my left nut.

657
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,958
That sort of turned me off of the
whole thing.

658
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,919
What should we do with him?

659
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,175
Let's go eat about it.

660
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,316
Hey Snow White, watch that
fucking pig.

661
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,581
Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.

662
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,177
What the fuck?!

663
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,513
I don't like military.

664
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,068
Get out.

665
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,696
- Why are we stopping?
- We can't go further.

666
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,533
- Why not?
- Look out there. lt's a coup d'etat!

667
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,454
I can't see, fuck-mook!
I have no eyes.

668
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,916
Well, then listen to it, fucker!

669
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:01,545
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.

670
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:04,131
You guys have to get out now.

671
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:13,849
Keep your money because
I'm not moving one inch.

672
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,412
Fuck! Now what?

673
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,498
- Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah.

674
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,626
These are much better.

675
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,901
What do you want in life?

676
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,321
Good choice.

677
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,542
- You ready?
- Yeah.

678
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,919
Okay, let's go!

679
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,721
It's no longer safe to be here.
Let's go.

680
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,991
You have a meeting
with General Marquez, sir.

681
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,796
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.

682
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:57,925
Who are you guys?

683
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,011
Sons of Mexico, sir.

684
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,357
Are we in front of the building?

685
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:24,618
Okay.

686
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,789
This is it, kid.

687
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,045
I don't hear you running.

688
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,599
Why would they want me dead?
I've done nothing but help them.

689
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:13,769
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.

690
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:15,896
Look out there! You see?

691
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,317
Well, don't look too close,
Presidente.

692
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:23,695
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?

693
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:25,405
Take off your jacket.

694
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,491
- This also?
- Yes.

695
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,451
Put this on.

696
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,068
What is this, payoff?

697
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:05,279
This is money someone paid
to kill you.

698
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:08,365
And now it's money
to save your life, Presidente.

699
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,576
Here, get some tequila for yourself.

700
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,990
Leave here and lock the door.

701
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,833
Carolina?

702
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,670
She died.

703
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:06,840
Your daughter?

704
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,801
She died.

705
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:12,929
and you?

706
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:17,934
Dead.

707
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,521
and l?

708
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,107
Alive and well.

709
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:41,458
In hell.

710
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:01,478
Everything in its place...

711
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,837
You fucking little monkey.

712
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,214
Stand up.

713
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:20,056
See anything you like?

714
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:35,489
No.

715
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:05,060
Do you remember a man
named Archuleta?

716
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:07,229
Why?

717
01:32:07,563 --> 01:32:12,234
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.

718
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:19,783
You tortured and murdered
Agent Archuleta. He was my partner.

719
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,660
He was also my friend.

720
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:27,165
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.

721
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,252
Oh, l'm retired.

722
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:34,381
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.

723
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,967
- Mr. Chambers.
- Yes, sir.

724
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:38,927
You're just going to stand there?

725
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:43,056
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.

726
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:48,812
You leave me no choice.

727
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:58,298
Did you get your man?

728
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,716
One of them.

729
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:07,515
If that isn't interagency cooperation,
I just don't know what is.

730
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:10,977
See you later.

731
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,481
Fuck you.

732
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,943
Are you okay?

733
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,571
I don't know.

734
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,824
You will be.

735
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:36,479
What do you want in life?

736
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,025
To be free...

737
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,362
Simple.

738
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,366
No.
