1
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,484
Senator Carroll is here
to celebrate Independence Day.

2
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,945
He is so independent,

3
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:30,991
some say they don't know
which party he belongs to.

4
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:36,747
Austin Tucker is with us today
as a political adviser to Senator Carroll.

5
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:42,043
Austin, we hear that you wanna get
the nomination for Senator Carroll.

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,172
We're jumping the gun there,
Miss Carter.

7
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,216
He's not running for any other office.

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,997
Here come Senator Carroll
and Mrs Carroll. He looks terrific.

9
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,181
Happy Fourth of July!

10
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,683
Happy Independence for us all!

11
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,356
He is the ideal father.
The ideal husband if you're old enough.

12
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:50,070
And I guess the ideal leader
for our country if you're any age.

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,159
- Lee, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

14
00:01:56,326 --> 00:02:02,499
Welcome. You look just as wonderful
as in all the photographs, always smiling.

15
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:09,673
I'm happy to be with my constituents on
this wonderful day, Independence Day.

16
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,843
- Thank you very much, everybody!
- Thank you.

17
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,106
Thank you!

18
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,114
You need a ribbon.

19
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:41,121
- I'm with her.
- Ma'am, is he with you?

20
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,248
No.

21
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:17,866
All right, we'll try to make it.
Schedule it some other time...

22
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,618
How are you?

23
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:28,293
How are you, sir? Good to see you.
You're looking very good.

24
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,547
Hello, how are you?

25
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,930
But I fouled up on that one.

26
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:46,144
I know a bit about your background,
your lovely family. Scotch and water.

27
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:56,780
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much for inviting us today.

28
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,658
Independence Day
is very meaningful to me.

29
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,162
I've been called
too independent for my own good.

30
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,334
Move back, everybody.

31
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,946
You are here
for the official announcement

32
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:24,033
of the inquiry into the death
of Senator Charles Carroll.

33
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,330
This is not a press conference,
therefore there will be no questions.

34
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:34,752
A transcript of the investigation is being
prepared for publication on March 1 st.

35
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,716
At that time, the committee will hold
a full-scale press conference.

36
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:44,971
After four months of investigation,
followed by nine weeks of hearings,

37
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,807
it is the conclusion of this committee

38
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:52,520
that Senator Carroll was assassinated
by Thomas Richard Linder.

39
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:57,275
It is our further conclusion
that he acted entirely alone,

40
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,987
motivated by a misguided
sense of patriotism

41
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:05,241
and a psychotic desire
for public recognition.

42
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,744
The committee wishes to emphasise

43
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,914
that there is no evidence
of any wider conspiracy.

44
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,293
No evidence whatsoever.

45
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,507
It's our hope that this will put an end
to the kind of irresponsible speculation

46
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:25,011
conducted by the press
in recent months.

47
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,597
The complete text of the hearings,

48
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,850
which provides the basis
for these findings,

49
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,519
will be published March 1 st.

50
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,814
When you have
examined the evidence,

51
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,400
you will have every opportunity

52
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:45,323
to ask those questions which
remain unanswered, if there are any.

53
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,117
That is all. Thank you.

54
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,121
<i>You could win this! Take a look. </i>

55
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,918
<i>We are just starting with you. </i>

56
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,004
<i>The package you pick might contain... </i>

57
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,758
Excuse me, but my parrot is loose
on your back porch.

58
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,971
- What?
- My parrot. I wonder if I could...

59
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,725
- What are you talking about?
- My parrot. It's very sick.

60
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,269
Let him go look.

61
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,313
- I haven't seen any parrot.
- He's hiding.

62
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,861
Freeze! Police officers.
Where's the stuff?

63
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,786
<i>- Wendy hits the $25,000....
- Check that, will you?</i>

64
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:18,749
<i>You've won an all-expense-paid trip
to British Columbia! </i>

65
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,839
All right, Frady, you're under arrest.

66
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:29,552
- You didn't see us, did you?
- I did, but I've never seen those two.

67
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,222
- What are you talking about?
- You looking for dope?

68
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:37,518
Maybe one of your men
could tell me what I'm here for.

69
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,897
- Destruction of property...
- Me, destruction of property?

70
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:46,068
- I can't believe I...
- Terrifying people, trespassing...

71
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,947
Hold it, goddammit!
I wanna get something straight.

72
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:54,285
Is there anybody here who can say
I broke into that house,

73
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,331
I was waving my gun around,
I threw his wife on the floor?

74
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,001
If you can, do it in front of
your watch commander.

75
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:09,550
- Shit!
- What were you doing there?

76
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,636
- What was I doing there?
- Yes, Joe.

77
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:17,266
These assholes have been after me
for my sources and you're...

78
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,604
So he told perfect strangers
he was looking for his parrot.

79
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:26,817
- My parrot, that's right.
- Can you imagine that kind of nerve?

80
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,988
You're saying
can I imagine that kind of nerve?

81
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,700
- Can I imagine it?
- Thought you'd teach 'em a lesson?

82
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,870
I don't think I could teach 'em anything.

83
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:41,540
Why don't you go out
and do something worthwhile?

84
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,043
You're not only dumb, you're dirty.

85
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,421
- Look at your shirt.
- Get your goddam...

86
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,050
- Hold it, hold it.
- You're not even...

87
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,095
- Do I post bail?
- What the fuck for?

88
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,973
Malicious mischief, obstructing justice.
Good enough?

89
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,727
I'll forget the whole thing, Bill,
if you shut him up.

90
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:05,189
- Malicious mischief...
- Come on, Joe.

91
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,901
- It isn't good enough.
- Joe, come on.

92
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,949
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?

93
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,412
- You gotta admit it's funny.
- It makes me laugh.

94
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,915
But I don't think it's funny.

95
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,255
What's that supposed to mean?

96
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,385
Ever laughed at a comedian
pretending to stutter?

97
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:40,599
There's nothing funny about stuttering,
but people laugh. They're amused.

98
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,227
But they're not happy about it.

99
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,576
You're not gonna print this?

100
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,164
You're not gonna print it?

101
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:09,920
Not only that, but this is the end
of your series on local drug problems.

102
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:14,675
We're in the business
of reporting the news, not creating it.

103
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,760
Joe.

104
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:21,348
Joe, we went through all this
six years ago.

105
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,227
When I agreed to take you back,
I made two suggestions.

106
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:31,692
One was about your drinking.
You seem to have licked that.

107
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:36,739
The other was that you curb your talent
for creative irresponsibility.

108
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,034
You can start working on that right now.

109
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,371
You're really tired, aren't you?

110
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,793
Joe... go home.

111
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,421
Go to a movie. Relax.

112
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:57,885
Tomorrow you can do a nice dull piece
on the Parks and Recreation hearings.

113
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:03,057
That is, if you feel this job
is interesting enough to stick with it.

114
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:20,407
Hi, Joe, I got a hot one for you.
Lee Carter called.

115
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,660
Four times. She must want it pretty bad.

116
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:32,378
- Did you clean up the room, Schecter?
- Sure. I got some mail for you, too.

117
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,083
I hope I'm not interrupting.

118
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,640
- You've been calling me?
- A lot.

119
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,184
Any particular reason?

120
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:35,065
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Somebody besides yourself?

121
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,485
I've never tried to kill myself successfully.

122
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,614
Last time you were here,
I think you lost your cat.

123
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,703
- I haven't lost my cat.
- The time before, it was your husband.

124
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:53,250
You may find this difficult to accept,
but I'm terrified.

125
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,795
You were always terrified
about something.

126
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:02,134
- That some guy might attack you in bed.
- Not as long as you were there.

127
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,042
OK.

128
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,756
Here. Now, why are you here this time?

129
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:46,178
- I told you. Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Jesus.

130
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,515
I don't think I should be looking at this.

131
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,226
- Just look.
- What?

132
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,982
Come on, I looked at this
three years ago.

133
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,153
Six of these people
have since died in accidents.

134
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,782
Four. Look, nobody's trying to kill you.

135
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:15,499
These people were killed. Whoever
killed them is going to try to kill me.

136
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:20,253
Austin Tucker thinks that
maybe we all saw something up there.

137
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,799
- We did see something.
- I mean something else!

138
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:28,595
What do you mean? Has he ever
indicated what he means by that?

139
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,266
Did he see anything other than
what was in the Commission report?

140
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,727
- Did you see anything?
- No.

141
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,606
Neither did I. Believe me, I looked.
We all looked.

142
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,862
- If you didn't see it, it's not there?
- I know all about these accidents.

143
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,325
Ralph Scaletta hit a piling,
killed three other people.

144
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,454
Joy Holder died of anaphylactic shock
from an antibiotic.

145
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,709
Herbert Moon burned up in bed,
smoking. Harry Lutz had a heart attack.

146
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,922
Harry Lutz was 40.
It's too young for a heart attack.

147
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,424
He was in terrific condition.

148
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,137
He found out his wife
was banging her psychiatrist

149
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,473
and a bulldozer knocked over his house.

150
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,934
That's future shock, Lee.

151
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,437
You no longer believe
there was another assassin?

152
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,858
People were crazy
for any kind of explanation.

153
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:27,654
Some nut was always knocking off
one of the best men in the country.

154
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,408
OK. OK.

155
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,286
But there's 6 out of 18 dead.

156
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,250
- Four.
- That was the last time you looked.

157
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,254
Since then, Norman Lomax has died.

158
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:49,176
- Now Arthur Bridges.
- What are you talking about?

159
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,305
A fishing accident?
Where the hell is Salmontail?

160
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:59,311
Salmontail is where Austin Tucker
is now. I tried to reach him.

161
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:03,523
Why don't you call him?
Looks like a small town.

162
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:09,946
Take me there. We could catch a plane
and be there this evening. Please!

163
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:15,118
Call him up. It's a fishing accident.
I got some real problems.

164
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,331
You son of a bitch!

165
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,502
You don't care!

166
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,340
Lee, don't do this.

167
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,554
Hey...

168
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,724
Lee...

169
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,793
The alcohol and barbiturates
would have killed her in bed,

170
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,045
let alone at the wheel of a car.

171
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:12,801
Would you call that a possible homicide?
Face it, some people wanna die.

172
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,928
Excuse me.

173
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,884
Wait till the cars
come to a complete stop.

174
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,264
That's it. Hop right in there.
Separate seats.

175
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,809
I want you to read
what is over the cars.

176
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:08,398
- "Please keep hands and feet in cars."
- Right.

177
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,568
OK, Frady, what do you know?

178
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:17,490
Will, tell me something.
You still got access to FBI files?

179
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,702
I'll tell you how the FBI feels about me.

180
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,664
Recently, they took my name
off the roster of ex-agents.

181
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:30,211
So now, not only am I not an agent,
I'm not even an ex-agent.

182
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,966
Is it possible to kill somebody
and make it look like a heart attack?

183
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,468
Sure. They got a pill for it. PEP.

184
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,306
- PEP?
- Pulmonary Embolism Pill.

185
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:46,603
It creates an embolism, but
the actual cause of death is biochemical.

186
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:51,608
The man ends up
looking like his heart attacked him.

187
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,278
- What do you know?
- I don't know.

188
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,656
Come on, what do you know?

189
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,952
What I know is I need a good alias
and a good ID.

190
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,955
What kind of ID?

191
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,418
- I've gotta be a hostile misfit.
- For that, you don't need an ID.

192
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:16,382
- Still got friends on the El Monte force?
- Before we get to El Monte...

193
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:22,639
The minute you know what's going on,
I wanna know. Promise me.

194
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,309
I promise.

195
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:30,355
All right, I think I got a guy for you.

196
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,316
Sunshine Homes
hired me to investigate him

197
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:39,739
when he was doing a night-watchman
job for 'em. He's a real nut.

198
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,701
- Richard Partun.
- Richard Partun?

199
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,996
Get a fake ID for him, too.

200
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,707
Make it look like
he's hiding something.

201
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:54,295
If they investigate the first,
they'll be less careful on the second.

202
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,883
You should look like a guy
who's ashamed of something.

203
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:06,641
- Let's make him a weenie wagger.
- A weenie wagger?

204
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:12,772
Anybody would be ashamed of that.
Besides, you look a bit like a flasher.

205
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,449
<i>Hold on to your neighbour, 
it's happy hour in Salmontail. </i>

206
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:28,287
<i>We're here to play a little music
and have a lot of fun. </i>

207
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,585
This boy goes into a bar
down in Texas, see.

208
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:40,883
He goes up to the bartender and he says,
"Give me 12 bourbon and waters."

209
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,306
The bartender goes, "That's a lot
of bourbon and waters." He says...

210
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,017
No, I'll catch it.

211
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:56,524
- Think your date just come in.
- I think you're terrible.

212
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:03,489
- My name's Gale. What can I fix you?
- I...

214
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,452
How about a Martini?
You know what they say about Martinis?

215
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:13,249
A Martini is like a woman's breast -
one ain't enough and three is too many.

216
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:21,716
- That's an amazing joke, Gale.
- Yeah, it is. What can I get you?

217
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:26,137
- Just a glass of milk.
- You're the healthy type, huh?

218
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,954
How are you?

219
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,800
Can I buy you a drink, Miss?

220
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,938
For a moment,
I thought you were a man.

221
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,484
- But you aren't, are you?
- No, I'm a girl.

222
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:29,575
Why don't you go over there
and tell those people, real loud?

223
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,746
Don't touch me unless you love me.

224
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:41,629
I told you to go over there to that table
and tell those people who you really are.

225
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,423
You don't want me to ask you again.

226
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,915
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

227
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,593
Come and sit down. You're all right, son.

228
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,888
You wouldn't be offended
if I call the police?

229
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,100
No, but you don't have to call far,
because Red's a deputy.

230
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,436
I'm the sheriff.

231
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,526
You got some interesting ideas
about law enforcement.

232
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:33,782
Shoulda stopped the fight. I would have,
but I dearly love seeing Red get stomped.

233
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,912
- He's your deputy?
- He's my sister's boy.

234
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,082
He's so damn mean,
he can't get along with anybody.

235
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:47,922
He's a real turkey. You move his plate
five inches, he's gonna starve to death.

236
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,890
He's all right. He does that all the time.

237
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,613
This is Gale, this is Shirley.
You met Red.

238
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,366
Now, where you from, son?

239
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,868
Jesus.

240
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,166
Your friend Austin Tucker's long gone.

241
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:30,047
Did he think that Bridges' drowning
wasn't an accident?

242
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:35,219
- I don't know. What do you think?
- That's the river, that's the dam.

243
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:39,265
Open that dam and that water
comes down like a wall.

244
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:45,271
If you're standing where Bridges was,
you're gonna drown.

245
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,651
Isn't there a warning system or does
the power company love a surprise?

246
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:57,825
They got sirens and bells and signs all
over the place and they got a watchman.

247
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:03,038
- There might be just something there.
- Where?

248
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,083
The watchman. Buster Hinton.

249
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,547
Nah! Hell, I've known Buster
for a long time.

250
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,757
I got no reason to doubt him.

251
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,677
No, go ahead.

252
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,390
This might not have
anything to do with anything,

253
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,227
but old Buster showed up
with a brand new shotgun.

254
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:30,107
- Maybe we ought to talk to him.
- I'd like to do it kinda casual.

255
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:35,237
He's up at the dam in the afternoons.
I'll take you to where it happened.

256
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,448
You could do some fishing.

257
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:42,077
- Come up with anything?
- Nothing but fish. You?

258
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:47,708
I've found out a couple of things, but...
Here, I've brought you some lunch.

259
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,128
You are aces with me.

260
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,591
Look at this! What did you find out?

261
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,395
- That's the warning, huh?
- Yeah, that's it.

262
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,397
Bridges couldn't hear that?

263
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,650
My mother could've heard it
and she's dead.

264
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,000
LD, what's the news
on your friend Buster?

265
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,713
Actually, there is no Buster.

266
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,346
Yeah? Gale! You want LD?

267
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,518
Drowned in what?
The car's right out front.

268
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,119
You gotta be kidding.

269
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,373
Who found the body?

270
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:56,951
<i>Charley, somebody's broken into
LD's house and stole his car. </i>

271
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,128
<i>Get to the intersection and cut him off. </i>

272
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,839
<i>OK, Red, we're on our way. </i>

273
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,359
<i>We got him cut off. </i>

274
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,623
You've been drinking again, haven't you?

275
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,001
Tell the truth, Joe.

276
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,545
Come in, Stanley.

277
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:35,758
The thought of covering that council
meeting was too much for you, wasn't it?

278
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,052
Close the door.

279
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:49,981
Somebody's systematically knocking off
witnesses and you don't care.

280
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:55,153
Sure I care. I care about my kids' future,
this newspaper, my golf handicap.

281
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,449
I've even been known to care about you,
you ungrateful bastard.

282
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,663
Drink your coffee.
Here. Take it! Shit.

283
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,208
Joe, what evidence have we got?

284
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,172
A girl who died of pills and booze,
a sheriff you say tried to kill you

285
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:20,470
- And the poor bastard drowns.
- I got a bank book with $107,000 in it.

286
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:25,016
- The police are after me.
- Why is there no APB on you?

287
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,144
I checked. They say it was an accident.

288
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,607
- They don't wanna answer questions.
- You're damn right.

289
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:41,449
Sheriff LD Wicker and two deputies
were indicted three months ago

290
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:46,412
on a utilities scandal.
It was in every paper in the North-West.

291
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,581
He knew you were a reporter,

292
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:54,295
but it wasn't any national conspiracy
he was covering up.

293
00:36:55,421 --> 00:37:01,302
Remember catching the state senator's
bagman and it was his nephew's bookie?

294
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,847
You're gonna make
a real horse's ass of yourself.

295
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:10,019
He didn't know I was a reporter. I didn't
tell him, I didn't give him my name.

296
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,816
- Did you register at a hotel?
- Yeah, under a phoney name.

297
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:20,696
Boy, you amaze me. You go expecting
these things to happen and they do.

298
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,451
Just advance me two weeks' salary.

299
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,456
- For what?
- I gotta find Austin Tucker.

300
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,459
If anybody knows about this, he does.

301
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,382
I won't advance you a dime.

302
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:47,890
I don't care if your self-serving ambition
gets you the Pulitzer prize.

303
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,269
I'm not gonna have
anything more to do with it.

304
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,902
- Joe...
- Can't help it.

305
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,154
I know.

306
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,369
Good shot. Good shot. You got a point.

307
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,331
Not bad, Riggsy.

308
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,880
- That's good. Hey, babe, you're all right.
- Winning, huh?

309
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,633
Winning? I'm beating the shit out of him.

310
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,470
I'm Schwartzkopf, this is Riggs.

311
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:32,643
Harry Nelson. The Psych department
gave those vocational tests to you?

312
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,731
I'll go and get those tests.

313
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:46,699
We establish a centre for the study of
violence, they send us every nut in town.

314
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,994
- They get mean?
- Yeah. Vicious.

315
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,331
One of them bit the ear
off a colleague of mine.

316
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,960
It was OK, though,
we sewed it back on. Most of it.

317
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,587
I'm glad about that.

318
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:07,094
I'm not sure whoever made this
knew what they were after.

319
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,437
How you doing, Ernie?
It seems to be directing at...

320
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:22,818
...trying to pull out anger, repression,
frustration, stuff like that.

321
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,947
Could it pick up
potentially homicidal characteristics?

322
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,618
You mean a killer? Yeah, sure.

323
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,747
Would you be willing to go through it

324
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:40,378
and tell me what answers would come
from a highly violent personality?

325
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,839
Yeah, but it probably
wouldn't do much good.

326
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:50,096
This stuff's pretty sophisticated.
It's a lot different than my stuff.

327
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:55,226
It's not any better,
but it would be a difficult...

328
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:12,743
Fuck it. We'll let Ernie take it.
He'll blow 'em right off the graph.

329
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,039
He hacked up his great-aunt
and killed two ticket-takers.

330
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,338
Ernie?

331
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,426
Come here, boy.

332
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:36,142
I'd like you to meet somebody.
What's your name again?

333
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,019
Nelson. Harry Nelson.

334
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,481
Harry Nelson, Ernie.

335
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,753
Joe Frady? Looking for Austin Tucker?

336
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,551
D'you wanna see him?

337
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,514
Leave your car here.

338
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,772
- I have to do a skin search.
- A what?

339
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:27,234
You're gonna strip
and I'm gonna search you.

340
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:33,282
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- That's the way Mr Tucker wants it.

341
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,954
And if I don't see you,
you don't see him. All right?

342
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:38,430
All right, Mr Frady,
who sent you to look for me?

343
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,975
- Nobody sent me.
- Now, look...

344
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:47,022
I've come 1,300 miles to get
a straight answer to that question.

345
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:52,444
- My life is in danger just being here.
- Who really sent you?

346
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:56,281
- Nobody sent me.
- Keep your voice down.

347
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,703
Nobody sent me. I'm a writer...

348
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,289
<i>Stop acting like
you're on The New York Times.</i>

349
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:10,212
You're a third-rate journalist from Oregon
or wherever the hell you're from.

350
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,216
You've been asking about things
you know nothing about.

351
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,386
There were two attempts
made on my life.

352
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,889
I don't know what you want,
but if it's money...

353
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,059
...l'll give you
$10,000 to keep me out of it.

354
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,813
You don't mention my name
or come looking for me.

355
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,190
All I want is to stay out of it.

356
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:36,196
Money means nothing to me. This story's
gonna mean more to me than $10,000.

357
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,159
Fella, you don't know
what this story means.

358
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,038
We better talk.

359
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,335
Have you seen this photograph?

360
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,258
It was taken
on the Space Needle that day.

361
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:45,390
There's me, Lee, Bridges...

362
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,147
You know that man?

363
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,943
- The waiter?
- Yeah. You know his name?

364
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:58,278
- No, why?
- Just curious.

365
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:09,748
Lee, Bridges, Joy Holder. Lutz.

366
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,711
Herbie.

367
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,604
Who would have thought?

368
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,531
Sorry, Bill, I didn't mean to scare you.

369
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:55,121
You're supposed to be dead.
Goddammit. You could have called me.

370
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:59,334
I was scared shitless
they'd think I was still alive.

371
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,839
- You mean nobody knows?
- Nobody but you.

372
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:15,934
- Hey, Bill, what's that?
- Tomorrow's lead.

373
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:20,355
I'm demanding a reopening
of the Carroll investigation.

374
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:27,445
- Who are you calling?
- The police, FBI, CIA, somebody.

375
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:30,782
Bill... don't do it.

376
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:41,626
You suggesting they're involved?
Or that they covered up?

377
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:45,630
There is a bureaucratic tendency
to cover up mistakes,

378
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:50,385
but I got no reason to think
any governmental agency was in on it.

379
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,221
Or if they were, that they knew it.

380
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,350
You don't have to infiltrate
the whole agency.

381
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,813
It's not only to do with
the Carroll assassination.

382
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,569
Whoever's behind this
is in the business of recruiting assassins.

383
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,113
Recruiting assassins?

384
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,910
I think I got some of their entrance
exams. If I'm right, I'm gonna enlist.

385
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:19,164
If you print anything now, I'll be exposed.

386
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:23,001
You alone can uncover
what all the agencies couldn't?

387
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:30,133
Maybe. I'm just asking you not to print
anything until I get more evidence.

388
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,887
You'll blow my chance
to find out who's behind it.

389
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:39,851
- What do you expect me to print?
- My obituary.

390
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,521
I wanna pre-date a will,
name you as executor.

391
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:47,442
Pick up my things,
give them to the Salvation Army.

392
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,944
Make a big show out of it.

393
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:53,698
I'm dead and I wanna
stay that way for a while.

394
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,629
It's about $340. It's all I've got here.

395
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,924
You're gonna need the money.

396
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:15,887
Hope you know
how to take care of yourself.

397
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:23,228
I hope you do. You're gonna be the only
person who knows what I'm doing.

398
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:43,164
<i>- Who is it?
- Richard Paley? </i>

399
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,917
<i>- Who is it?
- Are you Richard Paley? </i>

400
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,460
Who?

401
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,300
Who wants him?

402
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:59,514
Congratulations.
You had some very interesting scores

403
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,642
on the first series of tests for Parallax.

404
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,312
- Testing for what?
- The Parallax Corporation.

405
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:10,149
You did apply for our training, didn't you?

406
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:12,777
Oh, Christ, that.

407
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:21,077
As you know, Parallax receives demands
from all phases of industry.

408
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,831
Demands for unusual personnel.

409
00:51:25,456 --> 00:51:28,334
If you qualify, and we think that you can,

410
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:33,089
we're prepared to offer you
the most lucrative and rewarding work.

411
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:38,803
- What do you get out of it?
- We receive a sort of finder's fee.

412
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,931
As I said, the jobs are difficult to fill.

413
00:51:43,474 --> 00:51:46,894
- How tall are you?
- Six-two.

414
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:54,068
- What kind of jobs you talking about?
- Whatever you're cooking is burning.

415
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,916
You might as well come in.

416
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:22,221
I'm Jack. Jack Younger.

417
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:28,478
But we like to be on a first-name basis
with potential candidates.

418
00:52:32,064 --> 00:52:34,442
You look taller than six-two.

419
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,529
What does my height
have to do with anything?

420
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:50,750
Put some ice on it.
It'll stop the sting and the blister.

421
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,923
Your tests suggest
that you have remarkable talents.

422
00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:02,512
- What do you mean by "talents"?
- You have difficulty holding on to a job.

423
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:08,351
I just don't like to take a lot of shit,
so people say I got antisocial tendencies.

424
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,895
Has it ever crossed your mind

425
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:16,025
that it's everybody else's problem
that they don't get along with you?

426
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:20,530
- Why?
- The very quality that gets you in trouble

427
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:23,115
makes you potentially invaluable.

428
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:27,411
- What's that?
- Your aggressiveness.

429
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:31,541
I don't wanna intrude on you
while you're eating.

430
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:36,462
Get in touch with me personally
if you'd like to go further.

431
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,762
It's been a pleasure, Richard.

432
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,707

Senator, here's an editorial
even you can't figure out.

446
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:16,346
Your drink, Senator Gillingham.

447
01:06:16,512 --> 01:06:20,266
This comparison between
you and Carroll is nonsense.

448
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:23,770
Sorry, sir, you'll have to
go back to coach.

449
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:31,819
Point is, he doesn't like Hammond
any better than he likes you.

450
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:00,682
Your name, sir?

451
01:07:00,848 --> 01:07:06,813
- Paley. Richard Paley.
- Is that P-A-I-L-E-Y?

452
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:12,026
- No, it's P-A-L-E-Y.
- Will you be returning with us?

453
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:17,699
- Is Denver your final destination?
- Yeah.

454
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:20,535
That'll be $68.64.

455
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:32,255
$68.64?

456
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:39,846
Out of $70.

457
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,448
- What would you like to drink?
- Just a Coke.

458
01:09:59,276 --> 01:10:03,948
Excuse me. Ma'am?
Would you like something to drink?

459
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:28,032
<i>Attention. Due to technical difficulties, 
we will be returning to Los Angeles. </i>

460
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:32,244
<i>We regret any inconvenience
this may cause you. </i>

461
01:11:34,663 --> 01:11:38,584
<i>Passengers disembarking
from Globe Airlines flight 451</i>

462
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,754
<i>will be met by airport security. </i>

463
01:11:41,921 --> 01:11:47,593
<i>We regret any further delay
that may be caused by the investigation. </i>

464
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,264
<i>All efforts will be made
to have you airborne again quickly. </i>

465
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:59,271
<i>Passengers disembarking
from Globe Airlines flight 451</i>

466
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:01,982
<i>will be met by airport security. </i>

467
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:07,404
<i>We regret any further delay
that may be caused by the investigation. </i>

468
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:40,854
Hello.

469
01:12:43,357 --> 01:12:48,821
We've already received an offer
for your services. $25,000 a year.

470
01:12:48,988 --> 01:12:53,492
- Who from?
- Manufacturers Intelligence Group.

471
01:12:55,995 --> 01:12:58,372
Never heard of them.

472
01:12:59,415 --> 01:13:03,711
They work out of
the Hammond building in Atlanta.

473
01:13:04,795 --> 01:13:10,801
- What do they want me to do?
- Work in their security programme.

474
01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:14,680
- Sounds good to me.
- Good.

475
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:21,103
Just one more thing.

476
01:13:21,645 --> 01:13:23,605
What's that?

477
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:32,740
Who are you?

478
01:13:38,829 --> 01:13:43,500
- Who am I?
- You're not Richard Paley.

479
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:46,754
Your service records don't check.

480
01:13:48,005 --> 01:13:49,631
They don't?

481
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:55,304
There was a Richard Paley
in the 1 st Air Cavalry, but he's dead.

482
01:13:57,681 --> 01:14:02,269
- Gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
- So were we.

483
01:14:03,645 --> 01:14:06,607
Who are you?

484
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:11,528
I don't have to tell you. You're not a cop.

485
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:17,784
I was getting attached to you.
I wouldn't step outside that door.

486
01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:29,671
We simply have to know.

487
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:34,843
All right.

488
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:37,888
My name's Richard Partun.

489
01:14:38,055 --> 01:14:41,725
Why did you want us to think
you were Richard Paley?

490
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:47,648
I needed a job. I got into a little difficulty
in El Monte a couple of months ago.

491
01:14:47,814 --> 01:14:51,902
What kind of difficulty? It's important.

492
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:57,658
I was drinking in this bar and...
I used to drink a lot.

493
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:05,123
Next thing I know, I'm running around
a laundromat with no clothes on.

494
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:09,169
Some old lady
claimed I was trying to...

495
01:15:11,004 --> 01:15:15,133
- You know, molest her.
- Were you?

496
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,138
I don't know. I don't remember
what I was doing there, nothing.

497
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:27,479
All I know is that they arrested me for...
indecent exposure.

498
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:35,737
A thing like that follows you around.
Try to get a job, you're a sex offender.

499
01:15:35,904 --> 01:15:39,616
- I'm no sex offender.
- No, I'm sure you're not.

500
01:15:39,783 --> 01:15:44,997
I think they put something in my beer
that made me take off my clothes.

501
01:15:47,082 --> 01:15:52,671
If that's all there is to it, we'll check it out
with the El Monte police.

502
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:57,843
It'll be no problem... Richard.

503
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:02,973
I've tried to be a friend to you, haven't I?

504
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:10,272
At Parallax, I've found that people
who have had real trouble in their lives,

505
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:13,775
so-called antisocial people,

506
01:16:13,942 --> 01:16:20,490
if I can earn their loyalty, I can give them
a sense of their own worth.

507
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:24,703
That's very rewarding, believe me.

508
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:30,167
I honestly think, with your nature,
you're more reliable for security work

509
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:36,006
than any semi-retired ex-FBI agent
they can come up with.

510
01:16:36,173 --> 01:16:40,927
In a risk situation,
I believe you'll go right down the line.

511
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:45,098
That's something money can't buy.

512
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:50,604
You're invaluable, Richard.

513
01:16:54,441 --> 01:17:00,489
<i>- ... ex-FBI agent they can come up with. 
- Oh, come on, Frady.</i>

514
01:17:00,655 --> 01:17:06,661
<i>... I believe you'll go right down the line. 
That's something money can't buy. </i>

515
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:12,542
<i>You're invaluable, Richard. </i>

516
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:27,474
Come in, Stanley.

517
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:30,310
There you are.

518
01:17:31,895 --> 01:17:33,980
You're new, aren't you? Thanks.

519
01:18:47,762 --> 01:18:52,058
It must have been 5.30.
That's when I come to clean the office.

520
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:56,187
- There he was.
- All the signs of a massive coronary.

521
01:18:56,354 --> 01:19:00,734
- D'you know if he had a heart condition?
- I don't know.

522
01:19:05,947 --> 01:19:10,910
Trusting man. He didn't even
lock the drawer he kept his money in.

523
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:20,336
I'm very pleased with you.

524
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:29,304
Tomorrow, you'll meet with the other
member of your team, Ben Harkins.

525
01:19:29,471 --> 01:19:31,806
He'll have your assignment.

526
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:37,520
I just...
What name am I supposed to use?

527
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:41,941
Richard Partun.
Don't worry, he knows all about you.

528
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:45,153
Good.

529
01:20:41,835 --> 01:20:44,128
Good afternoon. 803, isn't it?

530
01:20:44,295 --> 01:20:48,132
The guy that just checked in,
is his name Ben?

531
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:50,927
I can't remember his last name.

532
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:57,016
Harkins. It's Mr Ben Harkins.
816, right down the hall from you.

533
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,787
Ben Harkins, please. Ben Harkins.

534
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:26,337
Ben?

535
01:21:26,504 --> 01:21:29,424
I got a message for you from Jack.

536
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:33,011
Don't unpack.
There's been a change in plans.

537
01:21:33,177 --> 01:21:35,430
How much money you got left?

538
01:21:35,597 --> 01:21:40,310
<i>- I don't know, maybe $700.
- There'll be another $200 at the desk.</i>

539
01:21:40,476 --> 01:21:45,231
Go back to the airport and
take the 510 American to Honolulu.

540
01:21:45,398 --> 01:21:49,152
<i>- Honolulu? 
- Not bad, uh?</i>

541
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,448
When you get to Honolulu,
take the first flight to Maui.

542
01:21:53,614 --> 01:22:00,163
When you get there, rent a jeep and
drive to a hotel called the Hana Ranch.

543
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,833
<i>- Yeah, Hana Ranch. Got it?
- Right. </i>

544
01:22:18,848 --> 01:22:23,311
- Is Jack Younger here?
- Mr Younger isn't here.

545
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,697
Richard Partun was here. The guy
he sent me to meet didn't show up.

546
01:25:30,706 --> 01:25:32,625
People, let's work now.

547
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:37,254
Would you please
check your cards for sequence?

548
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:45,805
Check your cards carefully
for sequence.

549
01:25:49,058 --> 01:25:53,813
Work smoothly
and it'll be a clean, clear picture.

550
01:25:53,979 --> 01:25:59,193
I'm gonna give you a warning,
"One, two, three" and a command, "Pull".

551
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,492
Get your concentration here.
Make a good, clean, sharp picture.

552
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:08,035
Here we go.

553
01:26:14,834 --> 01:26:18,629
All right. And one, two, three, pull!

554
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:26,387
One, two, three, turn!

555
01:28:16,538 --> 01:28:18,707
One, two, three, lift!

556
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,128
Applause, applause. Here he comes.

557
01:28:23,295 --> 01:28:26,090
Here's the man himself, Mr Hammond.

558
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:35,182
- Quite a surprise.
- Nice to see you.

559
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:38,352
This is Pat Fairfield,
Student Body President.

560
01:28:38,519 --> 01:28:41,855
Marilyn Puttnam,
Student Federation President.

561
01:28:42,022 --> 01:28:44,316
The youth is rallying, sir.

562
01:28:44,483 --> 01:28:47,861
We're at that point
where you'll be coming in.

563
01:28:48,028 --> 01:28:51,740
- If you would make your entrance.
- What I'm here for.

564
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:55,869
- Where do I enter?
- Round the table, up the stair.

565
01:28:56,036 --> 01:28:58,831
- Right to the speaker stand.
- OK.

566
01:29:00,374 --> 01:29:06,213
Card people, we have a tape of the
address Mr Hammond's going to deliver.

567
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,675
We're gonna run that
so you can learn your cues.

568
01:29:09,842 --> 01:29:12,177
I'll be giving cues for applause.

569
01:29:12,344 --> 01:29:16,181
When he comes in,
greet him for everybody here.

570
01:29:16,348 --> 01:29:21,854
Here he comes, making his entrance.
Let's hear it! Come on!

571
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:31,488
That's the man we're working for,
the man people are coming to see.

572
01:29:31,655 --> 01:29:34,575
This is gonna be on television.

573
01:29:48,839 --> 01:29:54,303
Wanna thank you kids for being here,
and the band. See you tonight.

574
01:29:58,348 --> 01:30:02,394
<i>Thank you. 
I am proud to be here tonight. </i>

575
01:30:02,561 --> 01:30:07,024
<i>I can think of no occasion
that has given me more pleasure. </i>

576
01:30:11,528 --> 01:30:14,740
<i>We all ache for the chance
to be proud again. </i>

577
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:19,453
<i>I promise you I will not stop, 
I will not falter, </i>

578
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,581
<i>till that march
has reached its destination. </i>

579
01:30:22,748 --> 01:30:25,292
<i>Until, like Moses, I've returned to you</i>

580
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:29,296
<i>the promised land of liberty
our forefathers created. </i>

581
01:30:36,345 --> 01:30:40,933
<i>I cannot take the honours
you bestow on me as a personal tribute. </i>

582
01:30:41,099 --> 01:30:47,481
<i>You are here to honour me
not as a man but as a representative... </i>

583
01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:52,027
...they're all talking about Jack Nicklaus,
Palmer.

584
01:30:52,194 --> 01:30:54,988
<i>Our cause must become the country's. </i>

585
01:32:51,146 --> 01:32:52,814
<i>I am proud... </i>

586
01:32:58,945 --> 01:33:02,782
<i>Our cause must become the country's. </i>

587
01:33:02,949 --> 01:33:09,456
<i>My life has been blessed with success, 
but that is not why you are here. </i>

588
01:33:09,623 --> 01:33:12,417
<i>My life has been blessed with... </i>

589
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:47,702
There he is! There he is!

590
01:37:21,958 --> 01:37:24,585
I see him!

591
01:38:15,011 --> 01:38:18,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been invited here

592
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:24,395
for the announcement of the inquiry
into the death of George Hammond.

593
01:38:24,562 --> 01:38:29,859
A complete transcript of the investigation
is in preparation.

594
01:38:30,026 --> 01:38:34,614
This committee has spent
six months of investigation,

595
01:38:34,781 --> 01:38:38,075
followed by 11 weeks of hearings.

596
01:38:39,702 --> 01:38:41,954
After careful deliberation,

597
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:48,419
it has concluded that George Hammond
was assassinated by Joseph Frady.

598
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:50,838
An overwhelming body of evidence

599
01:38:51,005 --> 01:38:55,801
has revealed that Frady was obsessed
with the Carroll assassination.

600
01:38:55,968 --> 01:38:59,138
And in his confused and distorted mind

601
01:38:59,305 --> 01:39:04,977
seems to have imagined that Hammond
was responsible for the senator's death.

602
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:10,900
He was equally convinced
that Hammond was plotting to kill him.

603
01:39:11,067 --> 01:39:16,822
It is for those reasons
that Frady assassinated him.

604
01:39:16,989 --> 01:39:22,578
Although I'm certain that it will do nothing
to discourage the conspiracy pedlars,

605
01:39:22,745 --> 01:39:26,165
there is no evidence of a conspiracy

606
01:39:26,332 --> 01:39:30,211
in the assassination
of George Hammond.

607
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:32,421
Those are our findings.

608
01:39:32,588 --> 01:39:38,302
The evidence will be available
to you as soon as possible. Thank you.

609
01:39:38,469 --> 01:39:41,097
This is an announcement, gentlemen.

610
01:39:41,264 --> 01:39:44,308
There will be no questions.
