1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:04,046
- What?
- We gotta go. We gotta go.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,549
- What? Where?
- I have an idea of how to stop this.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,968
Stop what?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,970
- Joely.
- Come on, Clem.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,348
- Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit!
- No!

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,976
- Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you.
- Smell my pits!

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,978
- No.
- Good.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,397
Concentrate, Clem.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,983
We gotta get back to the office.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,569
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,654
Not the picture.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,824
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,535
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,330
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,332
so I can't show you evidence.

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,794
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,715
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

18
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:52,344
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.

19
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,264
- That's what he said. Then...
- What did we see that day?

20
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,266
- No, wait.
- Oh, look! Hey!

21
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,852
- Shit!
- We're going to see my grandma.

22
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,605
- Joel, why... No, I don't want to... Joel, please!
- We're not going on a train.

23
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,441
- Don't make me run anymore.
- Come on!

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,860
Mierzwiak!

25
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,905
- Do we always have to run?
- Mierzwiak!

26
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,208
Please.

27
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,628
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

28
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,797
everything you can remember.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,382
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

30
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,469
Oh, l-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

31
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,555
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

32
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,767
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,770
You're erasing me from her...

34
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,274
I don't know.

35
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,986
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

36
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,988
I'm in my brain.

37
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,950
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

38
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,661
How can I help you
from there?

39
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,248
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

40
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:05,418
Sorry.

41
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,087
Look. Who's that?

42
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,214
Oh, he-he works for us.

43
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,927
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,596
baby boy.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,182
He's stealing my identity.

46
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,643
He stole my stuff.

47
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,439
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,692
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

49
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,694
He stole her underwear.

50
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,156
I could die right now, Clem.

51
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,700
I'm just happy.

52
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:42,371
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.

53
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,916
I want to go home.

54
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,961
Hey. What?

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,009
Clem!

56
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,094
Wait. Clem!

57
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,347
Clem?

58
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,892
They're erasing you.

59
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,894
I'm here!

60
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,646
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?

61
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,648
I'm sorry, I'm so stupid.

62
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,735
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

63
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,155
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

64
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:21,994
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

65
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,331
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

66
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,166
Wake yourself up!

67
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,002
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

68
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,963
- Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,050
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

70
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,260
Yeah. Okay.

71
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,555
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

72
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,183
- Don't! That tickles me!
- Oh, my goodness.

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,685
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...

74
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,687
It's a birthmark!

75
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,236
It did work, for a second,

76
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,863
- but I couldn't... I couldn't move.
- See?

77
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,576
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

78
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,995
It's more important to prove me wrong
than to actually...

79
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,207
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

80
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,627
Fine.

81
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,713
Then what? I'm listening.

82
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,466
I don't know.
You erased me.

83
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,219
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

84
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,221
- I'm sorry.
- You... You!

85
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,723
You know me. I'm impulsive.

86
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,104
That's what I love about you.

87
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,446
- I have another idea for this problem.
- Mm-hmm?

88
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,781
This is a memory of me,

89
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:45,578
the way you wanted to have sex on the couch
after you looked down at my crotch.

90
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,581
- What?
- Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

91
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,625
so what if you take me somewhere else,

92
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,878
somewhere where I don't belong,

93
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,505
and we hide there till morning?

94
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,305
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.

95
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,558
That's very sweet,
but try, okay?

96
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,560
Okay.

97
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:14,940
"Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream"

98
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,234
"Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily"

99
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,946
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

100
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,949
"Row, row, row your boat
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily"

101
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,661
Life is but a dream

102
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,539
Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily

103
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,834
Life is but a dream.
Row, row, row your boat

104
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,961
It's working!

105
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,632
You're a genius

106
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,029
Joel?

107
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,323
Joel?

108
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,202
Where'd you go?

109
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,079
I'm supposed to come too!

110
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,666
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?

111
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,709
- Sure.
- He just likes to be near me.

112
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,711
- Absolutely!
- Clem?

113
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,966
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

114
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,178
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

115
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,850
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

116
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,310
Who am I?

117
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,271
- Mrs. Hamlyn.
- Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

118
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,898
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,277
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

120
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,863
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,616
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

122
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,744
- Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
- No, not at all.

123
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,372
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

124
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,417
- Thank you so much.
- She's not looking at me.

125
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,628
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

126
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:03,048
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

127
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,093
Oh, babyJoel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

128
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:08,721
- Is every little peanut under there okay?
- Mm-hmm! He's fine.

129
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,098
Do you have something to drink?

130
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,851
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

131
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,395
- I would die for a vodka.
- Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that.

132
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,231
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

133
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,233
Uh, Joely.

134
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,904
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

135
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:29,366
- Ice cream.
- No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.

136
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,452
Come on, Joel!

137
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,454
Joel, grow up!

138
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,915
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.

139
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,417
- This is sort of warped.
- I'm scared.

140
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,754
- I want my mommy!
- Don't cry, babyJoel.

141
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:46,133
BabyJoel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

142
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,011
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

143
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,931
Hey, honey, look.

144
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,974
Wait there.

145
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:00,106
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

146
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,108
Yuck.

147
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,280
It stopped.

148
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:12,076
- What?
- It stopped erasing.

149
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,578
Oh, shit.

150
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,622
This is terrible.

151
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,501
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

152
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:24,130
- Where?
- I don't know where! What do you mean?
I don't know where!

153
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,300
This is bad. This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

154
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,928
Okay. Crap.

155
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,764
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

156
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,392
- What shall we do?
- I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

157
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,686
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

158
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,397
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

159
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,067
- I don't know.
- Now, look, you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

160
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,988
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

161
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,074
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

162
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:55,161
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

163
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,163
- Oh, shit!
- I'm hungry.

164
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,165
- Oh, shit.
- Oh! Oh!

165
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,709
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

166
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,712
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

167
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,922
This is my...
I can handle this.

168
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,300
- I can't call Howard.
- He's an unbaked cookie.

169
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,052
He's... There's no time to fuck around.

170
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,638
- I got this under control.
- What are you talking about?

171
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,558
- Stop fucking around!
- Okay, I'll call Howard.

172
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,694
- Hello.
- Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan.

173
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,573
Um, I'm working on this guy down here,
and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

174
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,409
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

175
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,913
Okay, uh,
tell me what happened before he disappeared.

176
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,416
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute...

177
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,169
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

178
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,171
I had to pee.

179
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,925
- Where's Patrick?
- Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

180
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,927
Ah, geez.

181
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,763
- Okay, what's the address?
- I know. I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,558
That's okay. Come on.

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,770
- Yeah.
- Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.

184
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,523
- Mary? He's coming right now.
- Yeah?

185
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,525
I'm staying.

186
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,944
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

187
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,530
- I think you should go.
- Hell, no.

188
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,200
Mary... Shit.

189
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,246
- I am so stoned.
- Please, Mary.

190
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,706
- You have to go.
- Stop being stoned, Mary.

191
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,584
I don't want him to see me stoned.

192
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,797
- Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
- I look like shit!

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,092
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

194
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,975
- Joel!
- I want her to pick me up.

195
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,603
- It's weird how strong that desire is.
- Joel, look at me! Look.

196
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,981
You'll remember me in the morning,

197
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,234
and you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.

198
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,653
Pat? I just... Pat?

199
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,905
I thought we could have a little cocktail.

200
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,450
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

201
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,493
What Patrick guy?

202
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,328
- That guy!
- What?

203
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,289
He's here in my apartment.

204
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,291
He's one of those eraser guys.

205
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,670
He fell for you when they were doing you,
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

206
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,089
and you guys are dating.

207
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,384
Really? Is he cute?

208
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,181
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

209
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,850
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

210
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,853
You... You're kind,

211
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,147
Beautiful...

212
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,483
and smart and funny...

213
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,777
and... nice.

214
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,070
What?

215
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,741
Okay. All right.

216
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,578
Okay. Oh!

217
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,955
- Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go.
- Careful, careful.

218
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,832
Fine.

219
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:50,294
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

220
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,755
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

221
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,428
Be cool. Cool.

222
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,310
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, Howard.

223
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,312
She was just here to help out.

224
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,524
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure as possible.

225
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:15,319
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

226
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,571
of the work that we do.

227
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,366
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

228
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,120
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

229
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,206
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

230
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,875
get to the bottom of this, shall we?

231
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,919
Uh, yeah. Um...

232
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:37,133
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

233
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,970
- Did you try going through the C-gate?
- Yeah, of course.

234
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,847
I mean... yes.

235
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,141
Yeah.

236
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,270
All right.

237
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,773
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.

238
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:55,109
All right.

239
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,820
I already...
I ran the utility programs,

240
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,905
and I had nothing there,

241
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,950
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

242
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,035
- Here, Howard.
- Okay.

243
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,496
- I got you a chair. There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

244
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,124
You're welcome. Whew!

245
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,794
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

246
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,880
see if something comes up.

247
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,300
"Oh, my darling"
"Oh, my darling"

248
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,553
"Oh, my darling Clementine"

249
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,097
I love being bathed in the sink.

250
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,683
Such a feeling of security.

251
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,978
- I've never seen you happier, babyJoel.
- Hmm!

252
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,980
There it is.

253
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:37,401
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

254
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,528
What the heck
was he doing there?

255
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,123
His eyes are open.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,587
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

257
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,216
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

258
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,510
I'm gonna have to...

259
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,512
I'm gonna have to give him this.

260
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,580
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

261
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:34,834
Okay, we're back in.

262
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,130
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

263
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:43,217
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist
or something.

264
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,219
Thank you, Mary.

265
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:49,390
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

266
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:54,019
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?

267
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,105
Hmm. Lucky me.

268
00:14:56,188 --> 00:15:00,568
Lay one on me.

269
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,863
Don't call me Antoine.

270
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,323
- My name is Wally.
- Yes, I know,

271
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,951
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

272
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,412
Oh! Oh! What was that?

273
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,206
- Hey.
- My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

274
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,750
There is?

275
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,379
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

276
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,466
- What, Joel... What are you doing?
- We gotta go.

277
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,218
Go on.
Please, please, go. Please go!

278
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,931
You can run,
but you can't hide.

279
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,808
Clem, come on!

280
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,770
There I am.

281
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,772
That truck.

282
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,775
Doc? Please.

283
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,945
All right,
let's begin by you telling me...

284
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,782
everything you remember...

285
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,786
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.

286
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,915
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

287
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,917
Come on, Clem.

288
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,003
He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.

289
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,672
- I don't want to run anymore.
- Shit.

290
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,261
- Come on, come on.
- Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

291
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:12,098
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.

292
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,851
Humiliation.

293
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,853
I'm sorry, okay?

294
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,235
Let me drive you home.

295
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,737
No!

296
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:30,241
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.

297
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,618
He's disappeared again.

298
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,872
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so sorry, Howard

299
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,958
Humiliation.

300
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,627
Humiliation.

301
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,713
- Hu-mi-lia...
- Joel.

302
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,966
I don't like it either.

303
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,552
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

304
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,596
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

305
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,516
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

306
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:58,394
Good night, sweetheart.

307
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,813
No.

308
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,858
- I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
- Shut up.

309
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,987
Look! Joel!

310
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,989
- Joel, look!
- What?

311
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,991
Look where we are!

312
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,493
Whoo!

313
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,996
Clem, this isn't good.

314
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,916
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.

315
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,422
- Hit it! Hit it!
- I can't! I gotta go home.

316
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,883
I'll do it later!

317
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,556
Come on, you big sissy!

318
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,108
Ooh!

319
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,278
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

320
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,031
- Wait. What am I doing? You know something, Freddy?
- And he loves her!

321
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,283
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

322
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,368
Joel!

323
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,246
- Joely, get up. Come on, it's not worth it.
- Hit him! Hit him!

324
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,876
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

325
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,045
- Come on, Joel.
- Stupid!

326
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,013
- I'm so ashamed.
- It's okay.

327
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,349
- You were a little kid.
- Yeah?

328
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,060
Come on.
That's where I live... lived.

329
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:23,395
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

330
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,149
Do you like my pink hat? Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.

331
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,860
- It's my turn. Go. One, two, three.
- I can? You're really gonna die though.

332
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,154
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

333
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,698
You're dead.

334
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:38,077
Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.

335
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,830
- Hi, Joel's mom. He's killing me.
- It's not real.

336
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,124
Okay, are you dead yet?

337
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,334
You're dead!

338
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,336
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

339
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,631
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

340
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:08,023
Clem!

341
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,318
Clem!

342
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,252
Jo... Joely?

343
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,463
Are you okay, Joel?

344
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,798
Joel? Joel?

345
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,718
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

346
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,720
- Okay, okay.
- That was like three seconds.

347
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,682
- All right. Let me do it one more time.
- One more, then I get to go.

348
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:42,685
Okay.

349
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:54,612
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

350
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,989
- Look at this.
- This is so cool!

351
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,241
Cool. Look out! Look out!

352
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,286
Ah!

353
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,330
- Shit!
- It's fluff.

354
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,917
Our house!

355
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,420
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come on.

356
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,422
Come on. We gotta go!

357
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:16,092
Whoo!

358
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,177
Come on!

359
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,138
We gotta go. Clem?

360
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:24,100
We gotta go.

361
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,060
Aah! Come on!

362
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,354
- No!
- This is a really bad time for this!

363
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,357
Get off me! Oh, God!

364
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,360
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's gonna be fun. Come on.

365
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,946
- It's the best place. No, this way.
- No, this way.

366
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,659
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

367
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,453
What's wrong with you?

368
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:47,706
Let go of me, Joel!

369
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,345
I like watching you work, Howard.

370
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,935
I guess, uh...

371
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,813
I guess I'll go out for...
for some air,

372
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,898
if nobody minds.

373
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,152
It looks like
you have everything under control here.

374
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,154
Yeah, that's, uh...

375
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,156
that's fine.

376
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,877
Do you like quotes, Howard?

377
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,880
What do you mean?

378
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,632
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

379
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,885
I find reading them inspirational,

380
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,847
and in my reading,
I've come across some I thought you might like too.

381
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,601
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

382
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,103
There's one that goes,

383
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,648
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better even of their blunders."

384
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,650
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.

385
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,737
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

386
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,948
Oh, no. It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

387
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,993
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.

388
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,913
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

389
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,457
- Alexander Pope?
- Oh, yeah.

390
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,459
Yeah, shit.

391
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:17,338
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

392
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,423
and then I go ahead and say it.

393
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:23,010
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

394
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,808
The quote goes,
"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?

395
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,145
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.

396
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:37,525
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

397
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:41,153
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."

398
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:46,200
I want to be a great big, huge elephant...

399
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,744
with a huge trunk like that.

400
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,082
Clem? Clementine?

401
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,127
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

402
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,171
I just thought
it would be appropriate, maybe.

403
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:07,513
I really admire the work you do, Howard.

404
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,057
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

405
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:12,685
I-l-l-l-I...
I'm happy to hear...

406
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,442
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,823
I've loved you for a very long time.

408
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,412
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Oh, Mary, no.

409
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,707
It's... It's...
You're a wonderful girl.

410
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,502
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.

411
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,504
You know I have a wife and kids.

412
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,506
Oh, Mary.

413
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,511
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

414
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,523
Oh, whoa.

415
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:07,239
Well,
good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.

416
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,624
- What?
- Oh, my God!

417
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,251
Who is it?

418
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,008
Uh...

419
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,934
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

420
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:41,690
Hollis. Hollis!

421
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:44,193
Hollis!

422
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,445
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

423
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:50,241
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.

424
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:53,661
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

425
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,205
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- Yeah.

426
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,791
I swear I basically forced him into it!

427
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,628
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

428
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,008
Tell me what?

429
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:10,094
Oh, you poor kid.

430
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:13,180
You can have him.

431
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,182
You did.

432
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,693
What?

433
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,490
Oh, uh,

434
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:40,124
we have a history.

435
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,751
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

436
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:45,004
You...

437
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,548
You wanted it done...

438
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,926
so you could get past, uh...

439
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,638
You could... Yeah.

440
00:25:56,098 --> 00:26:01,061
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

441
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:03,147
It's almost morning.

442
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,358
We'll talk later.

443
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,278
Okay?

444
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,208
Hey.

445
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,130
Let me give you a lift home.

446
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,267
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

447
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:43,938
- Hi.
- Hi.

448
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:47,942
Didn't figure
you'd show your face around me again.

449
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:51,237
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.

450
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,280
You did run away, after all.

451
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:56,117
I just needed to see ya.

452
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,494
Yeah?

453
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,288
I'd like to, um,

454
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:04,333
take you out or something.

455
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,961
You're married.

456
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,463
Not yet. Not married.

457
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,465
No, I'm not married, no.

458
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:14,593
Look, man, I'm telling you
right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

459
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:19,223
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

460
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,600
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

461
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:24,812
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

462
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,064
Okay.

463
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:30,025
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

464
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:32,903
or I'm gonna make them alive.

465
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:36,615
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for my own peace of mind.

466
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:41,328
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.

467
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:44,915
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- You had the whole human race pegged.

468
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,959
Hmm. Probably.

469
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,464
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

470
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:53,466
even after that.

471
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,927
Mmm. I know.

472
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,265
It would be different...

473
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,810
if we could just give it
another go around.

474
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:11,150
Remember me.

475
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:13,194
Try your best.

476
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,490
Maybe we can.

477
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,690
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

478
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,360
and, uh,
then we'll take it from there.

479
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,654
Okay.

480
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,615
I liked you immediately.

481
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,201
You didn't come on to me at all.

482
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:05,246
I liked that.

483
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,290
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

484
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:11,043
I wanted you to think I was smart.

485
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,547
I couldn't wait to come to work.

486
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,134
I had these fantasies of
us being married...

487
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:21,554
and having kids and... just...

488
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,348
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

489
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,017
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

490
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,562
Yeah, I know.

491
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,564
Oh, God.

492
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,983
- I'll take the bottom and you...
- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

493
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,985
- I can take that.
- So you want me to carry that?

494
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,529
- Help me with that. Can you get the cooler?
- Honey, the cooler is...

495
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,240
- That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that.
- You can get it.

496
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,242
No, no, no, no!

497
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,453
- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.

498
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,539
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

499
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,502
This is the day we met.

500
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:56,756
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.

501
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,966
I remember being drawn to you even then.

502
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,179
I thought,
"Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back."

503
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:08,100
You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...

504
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,144
and even hate, eventually.

505
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:14,231
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

506
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:15,526
Hi there.

507
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,028
Hi.

508
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,031
I saw you sitting over here...

509
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,033
by yourself,

510
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,994
and I thought,
"Thank God.

511
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,872
Someone normal who doesn't know
how to interact at these things either."

512
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,082
Yeah.

513
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,169
I don't ever know what to say.

514
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,963
I'm Clementine.

515
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:41,217
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

516
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,511
And then you just took it...

517
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:46,097
without waiting for an answer.

518
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:52,144
It was so intimate,

519
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:55,356
like we were already lovers.

520
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:58,234
I'm Joel.

521
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,486
Hi, Joel.

522
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:03,781
So, no jokes about my name.

523
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:08,327
You mean like...
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine

524
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,871
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

525
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,998
Yeah. Like that.

526
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

527
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,796
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

528
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,840
Oh.

529
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,136
I think your name is magical.

530
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,349
This is it, Joel.

531
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:32,601
It's gonna be gone soon.

532
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,064
I know.

533
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:39,066
What do we do?

534
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,988
Enjoy it.

535
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,923
- You married?
- No.

536
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,634
Let's move into this neighborhood!

537
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,595
I do sort of live with someone though.

538
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,056
- Male or female?
- What?

539
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,559
Female. Female.

540
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:19,190
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.

541
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:25,946
- You know these people?
- No, of course not. Come on.

542
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,908
They might have a dog.

543
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:32,620
There's no dog.

544
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,705
What are you doing?

545
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,042
- It's freezing out.
- I can't believe this.

546
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,087
Hoo-hoo!

547
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,965
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

548
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,308
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

549
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,520
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

550
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,191
It's dark.

551
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:06,237
So, uh,
what's your girlfriend's name?

552
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,573
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

553
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,034
- We're...
- Whatever.

554
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:16,205
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches...

555
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,749
and the liquor cabinet.

556
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,086
Oh, God.

557
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,509
I think we should go.

558
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,178
There's no phone line.
What?

559
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:33,431
- I think we should go.
- Why?

560
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:36,100
It's our house...
just for tonight.

561
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:39,145
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

562
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:42,690
- Which one do you want to be?
- Uh...

563
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,277
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

564
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,115
What are you do...

565
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,409
- Alcohol!
- Oh, boy.

566
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,078
So, are you okay with wine?

567
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:58,831
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.

568
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:03,127
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

569
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,300
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- I really should go.

570
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:14,180
I've gotta catch my ride.

571
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,517
So go.

572
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,686
I did.

573
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:23,606
I thought maybe you were a nut,

574
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:26,484
but you were exciting.

575
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,528
I wish you'd stayed.

576
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,281
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

577
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,409
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

578
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,828
Oh, God, I wish I had...

579
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:44,919
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

580
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:49,548
- Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
- I walked out. I walked out the door.

581
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:52,468
- Why?
- I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

582
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,888
I was like...
It was above my head. I don't know.

583
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,890
You were scared?

584
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,892
Yeah.

585
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:03,562
Thought you knew that about me.

586
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,608
I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

587
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:11,320
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.

588
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:16,492
You said,
"So go"...

589
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,036
with such disdain, you know?

590
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,747
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

591
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,255
Joely?

592
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,174
What if you stayed this time?

593
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:37,471
I walked out the door.

594
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:39,473
There's no memory left.

595
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:42,685
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

596
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,687
Let's pretend we had one.

597
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,284
Bye, Joel.

598
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,327
I love you.

599
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,623
Meet me in Montauk.

600
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:12,506
"I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane."

601
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,677
"You were operating the plane
with the remote control, and then it crashed."

602
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:19,096
- "It was fucking windy."
- "Come on, man."

603
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,140
"You're stoned, and you're driving."

604
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,768
"Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up."

605
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,353
"That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it."

606
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:30,065
"It does.
That's a medical fact."

607
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:32,568
"It was proven on the Science Network."

608
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:35,070
- "Honey, just watch the road."
- "I can't see shit."

609
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,659
"I saw you talking to somebody pretty."

610
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,537
- "She was nice."
- "Yeah, man. Who was that?"

611
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,959
"She was, um, just a girl."

612
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:59,345
Okay.

613
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,591
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

614
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:39,760
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

615
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:43,180
We'll talk.

616
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:03,177
Hey!

617
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,180
Hey.

618
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,392
- You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
- Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

619
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,896
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

620
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:17,691
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I-I swear.

621
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:21,362
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not. God, no.

622
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,656
And you never even suspected we were together?

623
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,952
Once, maybe.

624
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,996
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

625
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,666
I saw you two talking.

626
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:37,503
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

627
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,839
How'd I look?

628
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,217
You looked happy.

629
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,553
Happy with a secret.

630
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,889
And after that?

631
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:52,143
I never saw you two together again like that,
so I just...

632
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:55,896
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.

633
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:17,877
"Montauk train now boarding on track B.
All aboard."

634
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:23,174
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

635
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,677
You know that?

636
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:38,689
Thanks.

637
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,433
Let me get my toothbrush.

638
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,977
Yeah. Just...

639
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,118
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

640
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,580
- La-la-la-la-la.
- I feel like you're mad at me,
and I don't know what I did.

641
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:39,416
What did I do?

642
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,961
I love you so much.

643
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,004
I'll do anything to make you happy.

644
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:46,340
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

645
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:50,177
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.

646
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,179
Oh. Whew.

647
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:06,193
Vámonos, señor.

648
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:09,447
I-I had a really nice time last night.

649
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,158
Nice?

650
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,453
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

651
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,455
last night.

652
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,498
That's better.

653
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:26,839
- This is weird.
- "To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak."

654
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:30,384
"My name is Mary Svevo.
We've met, but you don't remember me."

655
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:34,889
"I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

656
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,516
- "I have since decided that this is a horrible...
- Some kind of teaser ad or something."

657
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:42,146
"In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them."

658
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:45,816
"My name is Clementine Kruczynski."

659
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,611
"I'm here to erase Joel Barish."

660
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,905
- What is this?
- I don't know.

661
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:55,576
"He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?"

662
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:59,371
"I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,

663
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,373
and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now."

664
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:05,211
"I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore."

665
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:09,882
"I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile."

666
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:13,135
- "That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?"
- What are you doing?

667
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:15,638
- I'm not doing anything.
- "The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point."

668
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,682
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

669
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:21,227
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

670
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,648
- You clearly are.
- Look! Ok, let's just take a minute and...

671
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,262
Patrick, get the fuck away.

672
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:58,722
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Get the fuck away from me!

673
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:02,017
- Can we talk about it?
- No! Get the fuck away!

674
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,552
Joel Barish.

675
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:39,388
- Hey, Clementine.
- Hey.

676
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,683
Nice to see you. Yeah.

677
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,644
Yeah.

678
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,688
"Really very educated."

679
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:51,192
"I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated."

680
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:54,195
"I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?"

681
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:57,698
"She's more of a magazine-reading girl."

682
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,160
"Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired."

683
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:03,871
"Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public..."

684
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:05,956
- Hi.
- "Because she would pronounce..."

685
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,793
- library "libary".
- Hi.

686
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:12,004
"Libary. Libary."

687
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,006
Look what I found.

688
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:18,385
"I think if there's a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

689
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:22,139
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane."

690
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:25,851
You made me look skinny.

691
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,479
"Amazing, burning meteorite...

692
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:32,858
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting."

693
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,945
"But what you quickly learn is that...

694
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,864
it's really an elaborate ruse."

695
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,908
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

696
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:45,246
- It's okay.
- "So flashy in a kind of obvious way."

697
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,542
- "But still, it seduces you."
- Joel, I really like you.

698
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,836
I hate that I said mean things about you.

699
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:56,340
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.

700
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,677
"Where's the real Clementine?"

701
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,888
"I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit."

702
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,683
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

703
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,977
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

704
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,979
- I do.
- "The world's a goddamn mess."

705
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:13,691
- "Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color."
- You want a drink or something?

706
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,485
Do you have any whiskey?

707
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:21,866
"No, I don't think her sex is...
motivated."

708
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,910
"I saw it clearly the last night we were together."

709
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:28,414
"It wasn't sex. It was just sad."

710
00:46:28,456 --> 00:46:31,542
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

711
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:35,254
"The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...

712
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:38,174
is to fuck 'em...

713
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:42,470
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of'em."

714
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:45,473
"And she's so desperate and insecure...

715
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:50,394
that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody."

716
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:53,481
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.

717
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:56,442
- Because I don't.
- I know.

718
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:59,779
Because it really hurts me
that you said that because I don't do that.

719
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,948
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

720
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,787
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

721
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,628
Um... bye.

722
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,297
Bye.

723
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,967
- It was nice meeting you and all.
- "But I don't know her at all."

724
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:26,639
"What a loss
to spend that much time with someone,

725
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:30,643
only to find out that she's a stranger."

726
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,940
Wait.

727
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,527
- What?
- I don't know.

728
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,779
- Just wait. Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?

729
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:46,367
I don't know. I want you to wait for...
just a while.

730
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:02,633
- Okay.
- Really?

731
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:06,846
I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for my own peace of mind.

732
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:10,850
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

733
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,602
- Right now I can't.
- But you will. But you will.

734
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:17,314
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped...

735
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,442
because that's what happens with me.

736
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,862
Okay.

737
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:28,534
Okay.

738
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:35,833
Okay.

739
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:46,010
"Change your heart"

740
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,932
"Look around you"

741
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,691
"Change your heart"

742
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,447
"It will astound you"

743
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:14,663
"Now, I need your lovin'"

744
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:22,713
"Like the sunshine"

745
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:29,428
"And everybody's gotta learn sometime"

746
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:36,560
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

747
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:44,360
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

748
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:46,904
"Mm-mm-mm"

749
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:03,129
"Change your heart"

750
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:09,260
"And look around you"

751
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,976
"Change your heart"

752
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:23,774
"It will astound you"

753
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:31,740
"I need your lovin'"

754
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:39,707
"Like the sunshine"

755
00:50:42,293 --> 00:50:46,505
"And everybody's gotta learn sometime"

756
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,721
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

757
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:01,395
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

758
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:04,482
"Mm-mm-mm"

759
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:13,324
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

760
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,372
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

761
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:28,005
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

762
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,966
"Mm-mm-mm"
