00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,266
Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.

2
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,604
Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

3
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,192
to make people
feel like crap.

4
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,863
I ditched work today.

5
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,283
Took a train out to Montauk.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,705
I don't know why.

7
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,958
I'm not an impulsive person.

8
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,345
I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.

9
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,764
I gotta get my car fixed.

10
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,766
Hi, Cindy?

11
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,268
It's Joel... Joel!

12
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,272
Listen,
I don't feel very well today.

13
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,274
No,
food poisoning, I think.

14
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,861
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

15
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,489
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.

16
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,202
Page is ripped out.

17
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,788
Don't remember doing that.

18
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,918
It appears this is
my first entry in two years.

19
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,720
Sand is overrated.

20
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,932
It's just tiny little rocks.

21
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,236
If only I could meet someone new.

22
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,156
I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,828
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.

24
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,124
Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.

25
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,877
She was nice.
Nice is good.

26
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,464
She loved me.

27
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,546
Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...

28
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,508
who shows me
the least bit of attention?

29
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,591
Hi.

30
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,593
I'm sorry?

31
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,305
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

32
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,059
Okay if I sit closer?

33
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,104
How far are you going?

34
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,439
Uh, Rockville Center.

35
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,817
Get out! Me too!

36
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,820
- Really?
- What are the odds?

37
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,074
Do I know you?

38
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,787
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

39
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,998
- Sure. Sure.
- That's it!

40
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,458
- Yeah?
- I've seen you, man!

41
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,671
Book slave there for,
like, five years now.

42
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,133
- Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you.
- Jesus! Is it five years?

43
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,260
It might be the hair.

44
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,470
- What might?
- It changes a lot.

45
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,849
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.

46
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,603
- It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
- Right. Yeah.

47
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,980
- Snappy name, huh?
- I like it.

48
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,482
Yeah.

49
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,611
Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

50
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,157
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

51
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,160
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

52
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,163
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

53
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,791
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty, maybe.

54
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,877
Someone's got that job.

55
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,007
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

56
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,968
I apply my personality in a paste.

57
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,970
Oh, I doubt that very much.

58
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,515
Well, you don't know me, so...

59
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,726
you don't know, do you?

60
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,982
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

61
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,819
Yeah. I got it.

62
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,300
- My name's Clementine, by the way.
- I'm Joel.

63
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,719
- Hi, Joel.
- Hey.

64
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,305
No jokes about my name.

65
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,684
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

66
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,688
I don't know any jokes about your name.

67
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,898
Huckleberry Hound.

68
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,526
I don't know what that means.

69
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,737
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

70
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,739
It's been suggested.

71
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,909
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine.

72
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,079
You were lost and gone forever

73
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,706
Dreadful sorry Clementine

74
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,708
No?

75
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,712
I'm sorry. Just... It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

76
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,755
It's, uh...
It means "merciful"

77
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,757
Right? Clemency?

78
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,051
Although it hardly fits.

79
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,429
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

80
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,931
Gee,
l-I wouldn't think that about you.

81
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,185
- Why wouldn't you think that about me?
- I don't know.

82
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,478
I just...

83
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,898
I don't know.
I just, uh...

84
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,900
You seem nice, so...

85
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,985
Oh, now I'm nice?

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,238
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?

87
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
I don't need "nice"

88
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,286
- I don't need myself to be it,
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
- Okay.

89
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,124
Joel?

90
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,461
It's Joel, right?

91
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,963
Yes.

92
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,466
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

93
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,053
I'm a little out of sorts today.

94
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,647
My embarrassing admission

95
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,650
is, I really like that you're nice right now.

96
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,530
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next
what I'm gonna like, but...

97
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,615
right now...

98
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,743
I'm glad you are.

99
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,129
I have so much stuff that, uh,
I probably should, uh...

100
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,300
- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
- L-I'm writing, and...

101
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,469
- No, no. I just...
- Sure. No. That's okay.

102
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,138
- I just have... You know, this is...
- Okay.

103
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,599
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

104
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,643
Jesus!

105
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,910
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

106
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,912
It's cold.

107
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,873
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

108
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,875
It is frosty.

109
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,711
- You're not a stalker or anything, right?
- I'm not a stalker.

110
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,880
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

111
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,215
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

112
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,426
Really?
There's a stalker book?

113
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,720
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

114
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,097
I gotta read that one.

115
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:06,607
Look, I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

116
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,068
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

117
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,785
Did you wanna have a drink?

118
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,038
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um...

119
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,081
Um...

120
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,083
Never mind.

121
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,503
- Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now.
- No, no, no, no.

122
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,546
Good night, Joel.

123
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,151
Two Blue Ruins.

124
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,946
Thank you.

125
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,948
Drink up, young man.

126
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,825
It'll make the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

127
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,081
I'm just kidding!

128
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,124
Come on.

129
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,091
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

130
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,093
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,639
It's just, you know,
my life isn't that interesting.

132
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,309
I go to work, I come home.

133
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,896
Don't know what to say.

134
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,898
You should read my journal.

135
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:34,444
I mean, it's just... blank.

136
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,781
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?

137
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:41,159
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest, you know...

138
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,161
taking advantage of every possibility,

139
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,165
making sure I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

140
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,751
- I think about that.
- Yeah?

141
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,133
You're really nice.

142
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,011
- Ohh!
- God, I have to stop saying that.

143
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,223
I'm gonna marry you.

144
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,225
I know it.

145
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,477
Um... okay.

146
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:17,154
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

147
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,156
It gets frozen this time of year.

148
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,366
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.

149
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,369
I'll pack a picnic.

150
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,372
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

151
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,249
And, um, we could...

152
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,251
Sounds good.

153
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,922
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

154
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,924
You should stay.

155
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,218
No, I really... I'm... I...

156
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,220
I have to get up so early.

157
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,222
I would like you to call me.

158
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,058
Would you do that?
I would like it.

159
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,143
Yes.

160
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,399
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

161
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,360
That'd be nice.

162
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,069
What took you so long?

163
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,071
I just walked in.

164
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,740
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?

165
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,034
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

166
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,036
Oh!

167
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,039
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.

168
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,041
I guess so.

169
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,586
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

170
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,088
It's really solid this time of year.

171
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,007
Whoa! I don't know.

172
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,009
- Come on. Come on.
- Eee!

173
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,011
Come on.
Come on, come on.

174
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,514
Whew.

175
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:11,101
Oh. So beautiful.

176
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,271
Isn't it?

177
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,276
Uh, don't go too far.

178
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,112
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

179
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,365
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

180
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,161
Ohh! Oh, my ass!

181
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,166
- I think I should go back.
- Come on. Come on!

182
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,168
What if it breaks?

183
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,171
- "What if"? Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

184
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,381
Come here. Please.

185
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,175
Come on.

186
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,514
- Ohh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

187
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,517
- Slidy-slidy. Slidy-slidy.
- Whoa!

188
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,853
- This is good.
- Here, let me show you this one thing.

189
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,980
- What are you doing?
- Whoa.

190
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,400
Come on.

191
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,325
Think I heard a crack.

192
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,162
It's not gonna crack or break or...

193
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,206
It's so thick.

194
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,502
Show me which constellations you know.

195
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,171
Um... Oh.

196
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,882
I don't... know any.

197
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,594
Show me which ones you know.

198
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,055
Okay.

199
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,724
Okay.

200
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:36,270
Oh. Here's Osidius.

201
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,272
Where?

202
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,274
Right there.
See?

203
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,151
Sort of a swoop and a cross.

204
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,153
Osidius the Emphatic.

205
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,575
- You're full of shit. Right?
- Nope.

206
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,578
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

207
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,706
Shut the fuck up!

208
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,802
Clementine.

209
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,096
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

210
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,642
- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,770
- Hey.
- Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.

212
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,941
Ahh.

213
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,908
Can I come over to your house...

214
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,619
to sleep?

215
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,580
I'm so tired.

216
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,458
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

217
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,419
- Let me get my toothbrush.
- Yeah. Oh.

218
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,757
Just...

219
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,275
Yes?

220
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,780
- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?

221
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:13,283
Can I help you with something?

222
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,953
No.

223
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,330
What are you doing here?

224
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,958
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

225
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,668
Oh.

226
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,671
Thanks.

227
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:43,188
"I need your lovin'"

228
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:50,320
"Like the sunshine"

229
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,995
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

230
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:05,502
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

231
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,675
"Everybody's gotta learn sometime"

232
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,823
- We're looking for 159.
- What number's that?

233
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,825
I don't know where that is.

234
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,828
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number,
or at least put a number on...

235
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,830
- Is that him?
- I think so.

236
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

237
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,268
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.

238
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,189
Oh, shit.

239
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:53,694
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

240
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,696
How pathetic is that, huh?

241
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,698
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.

242
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,700
She is way cool.

243
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,286
Hey,
you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?

244
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,291
No.

245
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,294
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.

246
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,462
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?

247
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,506
McRomance!

248
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,009
You want some fries with that shake?

249
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,386
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

250
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,638
It's 8:30.

251
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,480
Ohh! Okay.

252
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,982
Okay. Okay.

253
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,402
Whew. Okay.

254
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,490
Showtime at the Apollo.

255
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,377
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

256
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,546
Quiet.

257
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,561
Hey, Joel. What's up?

258
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,563
Oh. Hi, Frank.

259
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,905
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

260
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,908
How pathetic is that?

261
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,910
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.

262
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:10,914
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh,
big Valentine's Day plans with her?

263
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,916
No.

264
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,918
It's only a day away.

265
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,421
Better make a reservation or something.

266
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,423
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.

267
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,967
Oh, no!

268
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,304
Yes! You know, Valentine's Day is three
goddamn days away! I want it resolved.

269
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,515
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.

270
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,935
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

271
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:35,105
So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.

272
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:39,109
I thought you know, I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and...

273
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,738
You won't believe it.

274
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,574
She's there with...

275
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,328
this guy,
this really young guy.

276
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,873
And she looks at me
like she doesn't even know who I am.

277
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,375
Excuse me?

278
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,128
Can I help you find something, sir?

279
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,009
Hey, Clem-ato.

280
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,137
Patrick! Baby boy.

281
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,392
- What you doing here, baby?
- Just came to surprise you.

282
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,354
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.

283
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,526
- How are you?
- Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

284
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,528
Uh-huh.

285
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,739
- I so want what's in your suit.
- Oh, good.

286
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,293
Why?

287
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,838
Why would she do that to me?

288
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,261
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

289
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,930
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

290
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,932
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

291
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,934
- I know, honey.
- For being honest.

292
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,270
- It's horrible.
- I should just go to her house.

293
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,273
No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.

294
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,733
Get off. It's too...

295
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,735
- Right.
- Yeah.

296
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,737
I don't want to seem desperate.

297
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,367
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

298
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,579
Right?

299
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,749
All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.

300
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,751
- Rob!
- Here's the deal.

301
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,963
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

302
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:26,216
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

303
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,802
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

304
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:32,931
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult, okay?

305
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,017
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

306
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,271
What are you...
That's your laundry!

307
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,234
That's great.
That's good.

308
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,246
Okay.

309
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,466
- What is it?
- I don't know. It's some place that does a thing.

310
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,355
Good morning. Lacuna.

311
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,359
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.

312
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:31,281
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

313
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,659
How about on the fifth?

314
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,120
That's a Wednesday. All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

315
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,708
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

316
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:45,379
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

317
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,381
May I help you?

318
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,384
- I'm Joel Barish.
- Excuse me?

319
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:54,012
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

320
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,014
Mierzwiak.

321
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:59,393
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

322
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,478
- You still need to fill the form out, sir.
- Really?

323
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,648
- Thank you.
- Great.

324
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,650
I don't have a pen.

325
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,820
There's a pen right there.

326
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,822
- Good morning. Lacuna.
- Oh.

327
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,742
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

328
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,828
Mr. Barish?

329
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,124
How are we today?

330
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,126
Not too good, actually.

331
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,128
- Boo!
- Oh, my God! Stan!

332
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,131
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just...
- I'm working!

333
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,509
Sorry. Sorry.

334
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,553
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

335
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,514
You should not have seen this.

336
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,558
I apologize.

337
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,898
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

338
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,775
I assure you, no.

339
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:56,950
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

340
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:01,663
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

341
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,208
so I can't show you evidence.

342
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:10,005
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

343
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,132
and she wanted to move on.

344
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,134
We provide that possibility.

345
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:18,263
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

346
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,891
We provide that possibility."

347
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,893
What the hell is that?

348
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,896
Nicest guy she ever went out with.

349
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,898
Oww! Fuck!

350
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,400
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

351
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,402
It's okay.
It's all right.

352
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,155
Carrie,
I am making a birdhouse.

353
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,953
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

354
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,788
She's impulsive.

355
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,416
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

356
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,297
A lark.

357
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,801
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

358
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,139
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

359
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,142
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

360
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,187
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

361
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,649
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

362
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,652
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

363
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,281
- And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
- Yes, of course.

364
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,996
Now, the, uh...

365
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,999
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

366
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,001
is to go home...

367
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:34,506
and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.

368
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,842
Anything.

369
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:42,514
And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.

370
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,184
Okay?

371
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:50,314
So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

372
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:55,360
books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,

373
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,071
journal entries.

374
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,907
We want to empty your home...

375
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,328
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

376
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,874
And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

377
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,294
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

378
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,798
you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...

379
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:19,343
a new life awaiting you.

380
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,849
Wake up, buddy!

381
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,814
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

382
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,026
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

383
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,697
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

384
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,451
Hello. I'm right here.

385
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:48,705
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

386
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,251
Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...

387
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,588
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?

388
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,092
- Mr. Barish.
- Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

389
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,096
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

390
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:08,058
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

391
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,276
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

392
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,903
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

393
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,491
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

394
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,994
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

395
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,996
My name is Joel Barish,

396
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,625
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

397
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:38,755
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

398
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,341
Uh, I was...

399
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:45,220
living with this woman, Naomi,

400
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,848
uh, a couple years ago,

401
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:53,145
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

402
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:56,481
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

403
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,693
and I, uh, met Clementine.

404
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,779
I'm sorry.

405
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,782
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

406
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:09,453
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

407
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,455
There's an emotional core...

408
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,457
to each of our memories,

409
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:17,294
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

410
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,796
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

411
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,592
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

412
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,677
as in a dream upon waking.

413
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:29,056
Is there any risk of brain damage?

414
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,142
Well, uh, technically speaking,

415
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,144
the procedure is brain damage,

416
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,022
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

417
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,024
Nothing you'll miss.

418
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,529
Comfortable?

419
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,199
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

420
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,618
Okay, let's get started.

421
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,413
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

422
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:57,334
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

423
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,422
There's a good story behind this one...

424
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,425
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better emotional readout...

425
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:09,388
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

426
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,390
Just try to focus on the memories.

427
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,017
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

428
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:20,232
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

429
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,569
- Here's another object.
- That's so...

430
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,238
Next item. Okay.

431
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,741
Potato head.

432
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,078
Next item. Okay.

433
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:38,041
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.

434
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,420
- Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
- Yeah.

435
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:45,382
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?

436
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,384
- Uh, voltage looks fine.
- Really?

437
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,430
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...

438
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:59,521
Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.

439
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,067
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

440
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,488
Oh, there you are.
I...

441
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:17,915
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.

442
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:20,792
Why am I
standing here and...

443
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,712
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

444
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,881
Déjà vu.
This is so...

445
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,884
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

446
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,887
Underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

447
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,473
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

448
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,893
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

449
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,938
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

450
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,484
Very good.

451
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,819
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

452
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:51,198
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

453
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,534
Ah, there we go.

454
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,035
- Patrick?
- Yeah?

455
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,788
- Patrick, can you check...
- Patrick?

456
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,291
- I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
- Patrick? Patrick?

457
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:05,295
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.

458
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:09,174
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

459
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,176
- How's that?
- How are you today, Mr. Barish?

460
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,303
- There we are, Mr. Barish.
- That's better.

461
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,723
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.

462
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:18,684
We're almost done now.

463
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,895
Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.

464
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:26,066
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

465
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,694
Her name is Clementine,
and she's amazing."

466
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,321
- Whoa!
- Jesus!

467
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,324
- What? What?
- Come on! Careful! Step back!

468
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,326
Just take it easy.

469
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,203
That's fine.

470
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,122
Let's not roach the guy.

471
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,669
All right, you got that one.

472
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:49,548
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
- It's an apartment, Patrick.

473
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,884
Patrick.

474
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:56,013
Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

475
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,557
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

476
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,187
Patrick, can we just please
get through this?

477
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,857
- We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,364
This is the last time I saw you.

479
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,507
It's 3:00.

480
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:36,178
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

481
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,180
Were you driving drunk?

482
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,516
It's pathetic.

483
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,809
I was a little tipsy.

484
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,811
Don't call me pathetic.

485
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,813
Well, it is pathetic.

486
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,816
- It's fucking irresponsible. Could've killed somebody.
- Oh, God.

487
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,819
- I don't know... Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
- Oh, Christ!

488
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:56,198
- Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or small animals?
- I didn't kill anybody!

489
00:35:56,281 --> 00:36:00,118
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

490
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,621
Well, what are you like?

491
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,623
- A wino?
- A wino?

492
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,626
Jesus,
are you from the '50s or something?

493
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,628
A wino?

494
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,964
Face it, Joely.

495
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:16,468
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

496
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,471
and in your little wormy brain...

497
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:23,559
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

498
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,104
No, see, Clem,

499
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,773
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

500
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:32,276
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

501
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:45,497
I'm sorry. Okay?

502
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,417
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

503
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,841
- Clem?
- Your keys.

504
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:58,844
- I was just... I was just...
- I won't need them anymore.

505
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:02,014
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

506
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,731
Clem?

507
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,696
Mary's coming over tonight.

508
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,406
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

509
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,408
Just thought you'd wanna know.

510
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:24,494
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.

511
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:27,164
She likes you okay.

512
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:30,334
So... Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

513
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,920
- Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have...

514
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,922
Yeah.

515
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,346
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

516
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:44,348
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

517
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,350
Yeah, the thing is,

518
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:49,311
our situation is...
is a little weird.

519
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,355
My girlfriend situation.

520
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,233
I'm sure it is.

521
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,318
You gotta be...

522
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:24,304
Clem, let me drive you home.

523
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,473
Get out of my face, faggot!

524
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,436
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

525
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,897
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

526
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,899
You did it to me first!

527
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:39,945
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.

528
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,948
Clem! Can you hear me?

529
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,617
By morning you'll be gone!

530
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:49,204
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

531
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:58,005
Is there something wrong
with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?

532
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,591
No, I think it's... funny.

533
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:03,760
So, who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?

534
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,804
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

535
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,432
Remember that girl
we did last week?

536
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,643
The one with the... potatoes?

537
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:16,815
That girl?
Yeah, that... that's this guy's girl.

538
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:18,817
- Right.
- Yeah.

539
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,820
Was. We took care of that.

540
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,364
- Oh, God!
- Well, uh...

541
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,326
I kinda fell in love with her that night.

542
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,329
What? You little fuck...

543
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,373
- What?
- She was unconscious, man.

544
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,460
Well, she was beautiful, and...

545
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:39,546
I stole a pair of her panties as well.

546
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,384
- Jesus!
- What?

547
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,386
It's not like...

548
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,473
- I mean, they were clean and all.
- Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

549
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,975
- They were clean!
- What? D-Don't! Stop!

550
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,478
- Okay. Yeah! All right!
- We got work to do.

551
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,412
There's, um...

552
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,791
There's more.

553
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,878
After we did her, I kind of...

554
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:23,382
went to where she works
and asked her out.

555
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,760
You what?

556
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,471
- Jesus.
- Jesus, Patrick!

557
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:33,517
Do you have... any idea...

558
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,394
how unethical...

559
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:38,397
It's not really that bad.

560
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,191
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

561
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:44,570
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

562
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,875
There's someone here.

563
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,878
He stole your underwear.

564
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,090
I don't see anyone.

565
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:23,650
Joel?

566
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,111
Where are my boots?

567
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:29,656
"Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?"

568
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,743
"Potions, I said. Potions."

569
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,126
"Love potion, please."

570
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:44,087
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

571
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,718
Should've left you at the flea market.

572
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:54,014
"First thing to do is...

573
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,100
Sift in a cup of powdered whale heart."

574
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,483
Wanna go?

575
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,819
I want to have a baby.

576
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,781
Let's talk about it later.

577
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,992
No! I want to have a baby.

578
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,080
I don't think we're ready.

579
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,165
You're not ready.

580
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,502
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

581
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,712
What?

582
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,675
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

583
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:32,511
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

584
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,013
- I don't wanna talk about this!
- Fucking ventriloquist!

585
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,516
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- I... don't... want... to...

586
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,143
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

587
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:43,188
- I'm sorry, Clem.
- I'd make a fucking good mother!

588
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,693
- I love children, I'm creative and smart,
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
- Oh, God... Mmm!

589
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:51,113
It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!

590
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,867
- It's going! It's going!
- You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

591
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,870
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

592
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:01,331
- Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
- It's done. This is crap.

593
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,877
- Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
- All the pain, confusion...

594
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,512
- Oh. Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

595
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:18,515
- Hey, you.
- Oh, it's freezing outside.

596
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:20,392
- Find us okay?
- Yeah.

597
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,273
- Mmm.
- Hot!

598
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,401
Poor guy.

599
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,196
Mmm? Oh.

600
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,531
Don't you have anything real to drink?

601
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:37,534
Uh, we haven't really checked... yet.

602
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,536
- Patrick?
- Uh, yeah.

603
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,997
Uh, let me do the honors.

604
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,250
Mary hates me.

605
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,961
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

606
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:49,963
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

607
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,593
- There's more.
- No!

608
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:55,928
- Yes.
- No!

609
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,932
Hey, hey!

610
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,935
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

611
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,562
- Uh, no, that's okay.
- Wait.

612
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:09,942
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better even of their blunders."

613
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:13,946
Oh.

614
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,948
- Oh!
- Oh!

615
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,784
Mmm!

616
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:24,248
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.

617
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,583
I found it in my Bartlett's.

618
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,585
What's your Bartlett's?

619
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,546
It's a quote book, Patrick.

620
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,506
It's a book of quotations.

621
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:35,092
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

622
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,094
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

623
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:42,140
Can you wake him up?

624
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,142
You can't wake him up.

625
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,398
Mmm.

626
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,737
You don't tell me things, Joel.

627
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,199
I'm an open book.

628
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,369
I tell you everything.

629
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,664
Every damn embarrassing thing.

630
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,377
You don't trust me.

631
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,964
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

632
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,427
I don't do that.

633
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,890
I want to know you.

634
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,018
Hmm?

635
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,104
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

636
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,150
People have to
share things, Joel.

637
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:35,152
Mm-hmm.

638
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:37,321
That's what intimacy is.

639
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:40,324
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

640
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,326
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,370
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

642
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,541
I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

643
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,753
What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts or passions or...

644
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,838
Iove?

645
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:06,683
November 19, 2003.

646
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,436
Dinner at Kang's again.

647
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:14,775
Are we like those poor couples...

648
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,569
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

649
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:20,030
Are we the dining dead?

650
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,785
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

651
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,208
I like that.

652
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,461
How's the chicken?

653
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,547
Good.

654
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,926
- More?
- No. No. Thank you.

655
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,390
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

656
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,892
Hey, would you do me a favor...

657
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:51,937
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

658
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,939
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
- It's really...

659
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,066
- Gross.
- Gross.

660
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:00,904
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

661
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:02,614
It's repulsive.

662
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:11,081
Patrick, can we get through this?

663
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:12,916
Patrick.

664
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,918
Hey, Tangerine.

665
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,088
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

666
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,465
I'm so miserable right now.

667
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,926
- Why? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

668
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:24,928
- Excuse me?
- I'm so confused!

669
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,930
Can I help you find something, sir?

670
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,975
Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.

671
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:32,936
Baby, come here.

672
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:34,980
Scared of what?

673
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:42,112
- Do you love me?
- Of course I do.

674
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,114
Where's the self-help section?

675
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,658
Do you think I'm ugly?

676
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,161
No! You're beautiful!

677
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,496
Maybe I should come over.

678
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,499
I don't know.
L- I'm a mess, Patrick.

679
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:57,252
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

680
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,171
Okay.

681
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:02,466
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

682
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,718
Patrick, we're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

683
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,720
Let him go, Stan!

684
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:09,723
Let him go. I'll help.

685
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,725
- See?
- How hard can it be?

686
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:15,479
- She hates me. She wants me to go.
- Go.

687
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:18,482
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

688
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:20,234
You like?

689
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:23,362
Oh, man!

690
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,405
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

691
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,407
- I like it.
- You do?

692
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,701
- You look like a tangerine.
- Ohh!

693
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:33,247
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
- Mmm! Juicy!

694
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,832
- And seedless.
- I like that.

695
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:39,711
I like tangerines!

696
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,922
Can you see me doing ducks?

697
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,883
- Tangerine.
- Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

698
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,886
- How does he know to call you that?
- How did who know?

699
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,722
Oh, my God. Clem?

700
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:52,724
That's what they called themselves.

701
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,227
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.

702
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,229
They called themselves that for a reason.

703
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,691
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Like social justice... Yeah, it's totally incredible.

704
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,277
What Howard gives to the world.

705
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,363
Yeah.

706
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,907
To let people begin again.

707
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,911
It's beautiful.

708
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:17,916
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

709
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:21,420
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

710
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,256
and... phobias.

711
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,384
Howard just makes it all go away.

712
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,271
Oh, my God.

713
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,984
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know!

714
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,445
I'm lost, I'm scared,

715
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,447
I feel like I'm disappearing.

716
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,450
- Disappearing?
- My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

717
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,453
- Nothing makes any sense to me!
- You're not getting old.

718
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,748
- Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
- Ohh, Tangerine.

719
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,125
Nothing makes any sense.

720
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:03,837
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
- It's okay. It's okay.

721
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:07,925
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

722
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,968
- Montauk?
- Yeah.

723
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,722
- No! Come up to Boston with me.
- Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend.

724
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:17,017
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

725
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,520
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

726
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,526
Hi, it's Joel.

727
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:30,781
Um, leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

728
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,327
Pick up! Pick up, man!

729
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:38,163
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

730
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,668
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

731
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,838
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

732
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,674
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

733
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:51,677
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

734
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,305
- He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
- Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

735
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:58,141
Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go.

736
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,979
Charles.

737
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:06,149
Come on, Charles.

738
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:15,075
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.

739
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:19,329
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."

740
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,001
- I'm so excited. Yea.
- I'm excited too!

741
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:27,921
- Cool.
- Oh, uh, I, uh...

742
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,883
I got you this...

743
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:34,011
- What?
- Thing, um...

744
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:36,013
Happy early Valentine's Day.

745
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:38,056
Oh!

746
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:41,518
Wow. What is it?

747
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:44,104
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

748
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,570
Oh.

749
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,572
It... It's gorgeous!

750
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,575
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

751
00:51:56,658 --> 00:52:01,038
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

752
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,081
Thank you.

753
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,049
- Let's go.
- Okay.

754
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:15,385
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?

755
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,556
Am I ugly?

756
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:23,060
- Mm-mmm.
- When I was a kid, I thought I was.

757
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:27,231
Can't believe I'm crying already.

758
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:33,111
Sometimes I think people don't understand
how lonely it is to be a kid.

759
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:36,240
Like you don't matter.

760
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:39,618
So, I'm eight...

761
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,954
and I have these toys,

762
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,956
these dolls.

763
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,752
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

764
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,796
And I keep yelling at her:

765
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:55,175
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

766
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,261
It's weird.

767
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,389
Like if I can transform her,

768
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,100
I would magically change too.

769
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,773
You're pretty.

770
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,985
Joely, don't ever leave me.

771
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:17,114
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

772
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:21,118
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

773
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,120
Just this one.

774
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:26,123
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

775
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:27,875
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

776
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,877
Stop it!

777
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:35,966
I could die right now, Clem.

778
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,219
I'm just...

779
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,182
happy.

780
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,769
I've never felt that before.

781
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:50,856
Mmm.

782
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,900
I'm just exactly...

783
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:57,154
where I wanna be.

784
00:53:58,197 --> 00:54:00,199
Clem?

785
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,916
I wanna call it off.

786
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,001
I'll give you a sign.

787
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,341
I wanna call it off!

788
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:22,679
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

789
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,098
I wanna call it off!

790
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:29,019
"When you ain't got nothing to do

791
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:31,063
I think I'll marry you"

792
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,900
Is anybody there?

793
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:43,825
- Clementine?
- Joel?

794
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:46,119
- Clement...
- Joely?

795
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:48,288
- Clem!
- Joel?

796
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:51,166
Clem!
