1
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,919
Notification

2
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,143
Fire!

3
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,745
Sex is zero

4
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,623
Ah! Rewind.
She's not Christy!

5
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,753
Aaugh! Shit!

6
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,855
Where the hell
Darwhan get this CD?

7
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,297
Who's Christy?

8
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,335
Chansu, Ah!
Shut up, if you don't know!

9
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,530
Waw, what the...
He's like a horse!

10
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,108
Aah, Can't believe! Ugh.

11
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,509
- Aughh! Yucky! Stop it!
- No way!

12
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,248
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Where's he sticking that thing?

13
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,114
Aah! You wanker!

14
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,249
Mouse! Mouse!

15
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,063
I caught it.

16
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:20,309
What are you guys scared of,
be men

17
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,190
I'm a monster!

18
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,552
Coming soon!

19
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,594
What's happening?

20
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,377
I haven't swallowed it yet.

21
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,678
Where'd that mouse
creep out from?

22
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,519
- Ah! Yuck! Quiet!
- Gross, don't even mention it

23
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,655
Hey! How come they have
better food over there?

24
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,388
Hey, Eunhyo!

25
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:39,131
I have to practice with Sungjin later,
so make sure no one uses the gym, ok?

26
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,465
That bitch's always bossing us around,
thinks she's a coach or something!

27
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,070
Then is Sungjin going to
partner with Jiwon?

28
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,413
Probably she did the trick.

29
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,076
What kind of trick?

30
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,814
Just keep eating, bitch...

31
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,658
But Jiwon already has a boyfriend.

32
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,856
- Jiwon has a boyfriend?
- You didn't know? It's Sangok.

33
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,325
- Sangok?
- Yeah.

34
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,765
The hottie at Management school?
That stud?

35
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,334
Fuck!

36
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,702
- Did you see Jiwon's breasts?
- Why should I look at that bitch's tits?

37
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,837
I saw them!
They're really pretty.

38
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,680
Really big!
B cup... or C cup... probably.

39
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,686
Hey! I don't care they are
B cup, C cup or Z cup.

40
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,813
That bitch really gives
me a headache.

41
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,983
That pain in the ass
should be taken to hell!

42
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,291
But... She's really pretty
and has a great body

43
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,955
Stupid! What's pretty
about that bitch

44
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,229
she's got eyes like ET!
Just thinking about her makes me puke!

45
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,430
No, her eyes are large and pretty!
They don't bulge out!

46
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,871
You're talking crap!
Just shut up and eat!

47
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,470
Why are you being so sensitive to her?

48
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,729
- Oh! Yoonkyoung.
- Ah.

49
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,235
- Did you eat yet?
- Yes.

50
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,294
- Ok. Call me later.
- Ok.

51
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,669
Come on!

52
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:34,110
- Chansu, you know them?
- Who? Yes, of course.

53
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,705
Then that one.
That girl in blue, who is she?

54
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,343
Ah, You don't know her?
Eunhyo-she's one of hotties in the school.

55
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,013
- Euno!
- No, man Eunhyo.

56
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,717
She does Aerobics! And she's a scrub
for the national team. You didn't know?

57
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,829
Ugh.

58
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,227
Attention!

59
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,265
Next class, we will
have a criminology quiz.

60
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,803
- Criminology?
- Yes.

61
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,337
Let's go.

62
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,477
Let's go!

63
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,553
Hey, where are you going?

64
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,454
My feet don't work.
I can't move them!

65
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,891
She's so out of herself!

66
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,865
What is she thinking? That bitch is
way too old to act like that.

67
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,161
Hey, no, don't go.

68
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,701
Jeez, really... why doesn't
that crazy bitch get lost!

69
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,532
Right.

70
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,477
- Who's that guy?
- Sangok.

71
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,537
Sangok?
Oh, my god.

72
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,708
- Whaa, He's damn good looking.
- Excellent- In unison.

73
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,877
Those... look at those tits
and her ass.

74
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:27,449
Whew. Their sex must
be damn good.

75
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,857
Hey, what's this?

76
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,555
What're you doing?

77
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,722
Sponge.

78
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,227
Shush! Others have smaller
ones than me.

79
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,460
Don't laugh!

80
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,294
No way, sorry but if
you put 2 raisins on your back

81
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:45,004
no one could tell which side was your chest.
I'd sure be confused!

82
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,704
What did you say, huh?

83
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,371
Yours are bigger!

84
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,438
All big boobed girls are should die.

85
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,882
This is the one
was talking about before.

86
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,925
- Yeah! It’s friggin gorgeous!
- Yeah...

87
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,220
Yeah, it's a killer!

88
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,193
It’s fuckin' expensive!

89
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,254
What kind of a girl talks so filthy?

90
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:50,098
When you do with a guy, you always say
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck bitch?

91
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,036
How can you talk to a virgin
like me that way?

92
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,699
You, virgin!?
Then I'm a nun!

93
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,174
If you're a nun then
I'm a saint!

94
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:01,009
One, two, three!

95
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,827
Gut is all you need.

96
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,229
- Hey! Blood!
- Huh?! Blood! Aaah!

97
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,829
I told you little buggers
to stay out of here.

98
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,206
Hey, have all
the eggs been eaten?

99
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,406
That bitch Taehak ate all
the eggs yesterday.

100
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,377
Aaah!
That useless bitch.

101
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,972
- You want me to make an egg?
- What? You are a fuckin' chicken?

102
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,079
Ah, that friggin' lunatic.
Hey, is that possible?

103
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,447
Ah. Shit, that's really gross.
Damn.

104
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,922
Aaah! Shit!
It does look same!

105
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:55,058
See, see! My professor said that those
are the same ingredients... animal protein.

106
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,063
- Lots shot out.
- I'm tired.

107
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,000
Hey, I bought some rat poison!

108
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,735
Spread it out more, huh?

109
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,209
Even smelling this much will kill it.

110
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,611
Toran, don't eat that.
It'll kill you for sure.

111
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,814
Yeah!

112
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,509
- What...
- Should we add this as well?

113
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,747
Well...

114
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,791
How come there is no yolk?

115
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,828
Today I made lots of money.
Hurry up. Oh?

116
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,022
Can't believe this.

117
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,930
Shut up.
Hurry up and play!

118
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Shut up and play!

119
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,237
Hurry! Please give me a good one!
I win and you're all losers!

120
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,940
- Who's winning?
- Nine... nine!

121
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,479
Yahoo!

122
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,539
You win...

123
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,084
Of course... shit.

124
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:53,948
Take it, take it, take it.

125
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,213
I'm gonna win...
hang on a moment... hang on!

126
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,312
If I get this next card...

127
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,859
What's this! Can I eat it?

128
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,727
No! Don't!
It’s rat poison!

129
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,960
No way.

130
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,763
My child is there too!

131
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,336
No...!
There's fried eggs too!

132
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,176
Tasty. It’s delicious.

133
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,519
Why do I have to pay out everybody.

134
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,954
Oh, Mother Mary!

135
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,789
- Why?
- Oh, My God!

136
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,866
Get me if you can!

137
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,734
Hey! Grab him!

138
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,677
Tasty!

139
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,155
Losers!

140
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,495
Tasty.

141
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,479
Open the door! Door!

142
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,106
Open the door!

143
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,648
Open the door!
There's rat poison in there!

144
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,847
One, two and three!

145
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,217
Hey! You idiot!
Spit it out! Spit it out!

146
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,393
- Stay still.
- Don't move.

147
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,996
- Try a little harder and again.
- Just a little more.

148
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,239
- Did you hear?
- What?

149
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,713
- He tried to kill himself with poison.
- Who?

150
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:08,412
Chansu's roommate, the one who
jumped out the window!

151
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,478
How can he be so stupid?

152
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,650
I also heard that
he ate sperms too!

153
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,558
- What?! Sperms?
- What's that?

154
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,823
What a stupid prick.

155
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,195
Oh!

156
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,430
Enjoy that?

157
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,100
You wanna do
something really good?

158
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,641
The x- Ray on the left is what it should look like.
And on the right is the patient.

159
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,949
He appears to
have testicles like a bull.

160
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,856
The swelling hasn't subsided for 38 hours.
But we haven't found the reason yet.

161
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,553
Isn't that dangerous?

162
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,962
If it doesn't subside by tomorrow
we'll have to cut them out.

163
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,766
The T.V. is empty.
Can you give me another one.

164
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,840
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,707
It’s ok. I'm all right.

166
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,043
- Are you in first year law?
- Yes.

167
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,745
Did you transfer?

168
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:51,255
No, I had to delay classes to do my military duty,
and I had a few setbacks as well.

169
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,116
That's why I'm still in 1st year.
I am 28 - You're 22?

170
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,718
So?

171
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,239
Hey?! Didn't you say that
you do a favor for me?

172
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,276
Yes!

173
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,113
Use here until you guys find
your own practicing room.

174
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,457
If the coach finds out...
I'm dead. Got it?

175
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,621
Don't worry.

176
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,686
We'll even clean this room.

177
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,597
- I'm a pro at cleaning.
- Here's the key.

178
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,259
When you leave,
make sure to lock up.

179
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,272
- Yes!
- Thank you very much.

180
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,970
How big is this room?
Hey! You!

181
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,311
Eunsik.

182
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,311
Hey... Excuse me!

183
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,327
Thanks!
I'd like to thank you.

184
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,945
Bitches! It's already
the middle of the semester!

185
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,581
How come nobody brings
guy members?

186
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:38,520
Until next week, each of
you brings 10 guys here!

187
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,088
I don't care whether you have to
kidnap them or not!

188
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,067
I should've not treated
you bitches so well!

189
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,765
Dare you stare?

190
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:53,135
She thinks we're sluts?
Was she a brothel madam or something?

191
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,112
1, 2, 3, 4

192
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,275
1, 2, 3, 4

193
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,616
1, 2, 3, 4

194
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:09,025
Clench your fists
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

195
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:15,329
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Hey, Hips!

196
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:23,397
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

197
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,911
Left, left!

198
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,946
Change!

199
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,931
What are you doing now?

200
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,492
- Are you a law student?
- Yes.

201
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:24,160
- Then, I want to ask something.
- Ask me anything you want.

202
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,967
I know someone who is studying law!
Yoon Chong Shin

203
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,872
- Ahh, Yoon Chong Shin!
- Do you know him?

204
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,877
Of course.
He's a well known singer.

205
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:43,616
I know you better than
anybody in the world so pure

206
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,787
Isn't that him?

207
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,260
No, he's not...

208
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:57,998
Anyway! He was arrested
for violence

209
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,766
but he was relieved as the judge
was his junior in university.

210
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,239
That's good.

211
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:09,042
Yes, and when he appeared
in court the judge spoke to him.

212
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,376
What did he say...

213
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:18,788
He said, "The jail will be your frat
house, moron." Would it be true?

214
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:33,896
Knee up! Kick high! Do 10 times.
Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8! 1, 2!

215
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,739
Something must've got into her!
I'm almost throwing up!

216
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,245
Good, so good!

217
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,952
That's good, waist, waist.
Good, very good! Yes, good, very good

218
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:53,548
Keep your backs straight
and your toes pointed!

219
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:58,726
Ok... ok-keep up the good work!

220
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,896
Let's go to a club today.

221
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,169
Club? What time?

222
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,908
It was one.
Was two. Was three.

223
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,351
Was four.

224
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,658
Carrot carrot carrot carrot,
bani bani bani bani

225
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,293
It’s ok. It’s ok.
Everything's ok. Drink up!

226
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,424
Somebody drinks this for me!

227
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,316
When did you come?

228
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,912
A little while ago.

229
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,253
Hey, where's Jiwon?

230
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,295
I don't know.
I came here with my friends.

231
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:57,062
Hey! Here's Sangok!
Let's drink! Bottoms up!

232
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,229
- Party goes on!
- Cheers!

233
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,465
Nice to meet you!

234
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,970
Hey, you look good!

235
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,212
You girls are so pathetic!

236
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,943
Did you find a good girl?

237
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,316
Only appearance matters
to you? Hey, Hyunhee.

238
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,187
Are you seeing someone?

239
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,389
- You mean a boyfriend?
- No. A lover.

240
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,058
Lover? Nope.

241
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,260
Oh, yeah?

242
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,324
Why?

243
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,429
Do you want to go out with me?

244
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,236
- Are you always like this?
- What?

245
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,004
Do you always sweet talk girls?

246
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,743
What are you talking about?

247
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:53,011
What about, Jiwon! Aren't you guys
still seeing each other?

248
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,448
We broke up. Now!

249
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,050
When did I ask for a drink?
I never ask!

250
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,284
You just gave it to me.

251
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,553
You already drank it.

252
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,460
- Yeah, I drank it.
- You drink, you pay! Understand?

253
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,794
Told you I never ordered it.

254
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,466
You drink-you pay, you fucker!

255
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,832
I told you to never
let in guys dress like this.

256
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,871
Fucker? Fucker?

257
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:17,271
Yes! Fucker! A real fucker!

258
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,539
How could you...
Come on, I will take you all!

259
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,581
When did I order this drink?

260
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,906
You little bastard...

261
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,257
Taehak... Taehak...

262
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,453
- Hey, guys. We're leaving now.
- Going where?

263
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,756
Shut up.

264
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:46,093
You started to
push me first, you fucker!

265
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,880
Okay.

266
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,726
Eunsik! Wake up! You should go home!
Gather yourself! Go home!

267
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:13,853
Eunhyo.

268
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,456
- Jeez!
- What can I do?

269
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,661
Do what? Wake up!

270
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,072
Eunhyo...

271
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,143
- I love you.
- I'm going.

272
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,317
I've got a headache!

273
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,690
- Headache?
- Yes.

274
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,730
Then we should take a rest.

275
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,761
Rest? Where?

276
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:56,102
Oh! Somewhere nearby.

277
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,045
Chansu!

278
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,049
Yoonkyoung, you don't trust me?

279
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,843
You think I'm some sort of
creep or something?

280
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,322
I'm just gonna hold your hand.

281
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,154
I promise! Signed and sealed!

282
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:21,426
Oh! My head is splitting!

283
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,059
Headache? Do you want a painkiller?

284
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:30,734
No! I just want to... relax somewhere.

285
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,670
Relax? Where?

286
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,270
Well! Somewhere nearby...

287
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,577
Hmm! You want to go in here?

288
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,382
Oh! My head...

289
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,131
You drank too much.

290
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:12,679
W- Wait!

291
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,326
I don't want to go home tonight.

292
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,507
Oh! You bastard!
Get away from me!

293
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,612
You said you only
gonna hold my hands!

294
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,084
Yoonkyoung...

295
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,644
You said only hold hands!
You did!

296
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,622
- Didn't you?
- I did.

297
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:07,121
Then why did you grab my boob?
Is my boob my hand?

298
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,257
What are you groping
my boobs for you little shit?

299
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:14,396
A little shit? Jeez!
Are you 3 years old? Are you an idiot?

300
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:19,603
If you come to this sort of place!
Doesn't that say something?

301
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,838
What did you come here for?

302
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,347
You said we were going to
just hold hands.

303
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,712
Ahh! This is crazy!

304
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,808
You Bastard!

305
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:32,822
Ask anybody on the street if
you're the bitch or I'm the bastard!

306
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,324
You're not an idiot so
why do you act like one.

307
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:43,390
Oh! My head! What is this
sort of creep doing on the streets?

308
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,729
Aughh! My back's itchy.

309
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:54,809
My back!
Aughh, it's irritating.

310
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:02,047
I can't scratch my back!
I wish somebody would.

311
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,854
Stop that!

312
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,495
Hmm? What's this? Ow!

313
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,031
Harder.

314
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:46,393
Hey! Are you going to spend all day sucking those?
I'm going to get blisters!

315
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:53,733
- Now! Doing it?
- Want to do it tomorrow?

316
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,582
Don't you know
where it is, you stupid!

317
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,432
No!

318
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,107
I'm... not there!

319
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:40,344
Breasts are ok!
But I can't go down? Don't move.

320
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,981
Anyway, not there.

321
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:48,389
I'm going crazy! Then you shouldn't have
started in the first place.

322
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,757
You get me excited for nothing?

323
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,195
When did I get you excited?
You came on to me first.

324
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:07,972
Oh, god! All right! So you're saying
everything but intercourse is okay?

325
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,157
Why?

326
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,732
My arm! It hurts!

327
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,037
You hurt your arm?

328
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,098
Ah... No, it's nothing.

329
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,746
What's the matter?

330
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,840
What? It’s nothing...

331
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,794
My stomach is killing me!
I drank too much last night.

332
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,390
I don't remember anything.
What happened?

333
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,331
No problems getting home last night?

334
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,064
I'm ok. How about you?

335
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,130
I made it home ok. Last night.

336
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,801
That's good. I was worried.

337
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,493
Bitch! How dare you are!

338
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,296
You don't even know who your father is.

339
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,502
Did your mother teach you to
steal other woman's man?

340
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,268
No doubt she knows very well what to do!
It is genetic thing?

341
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:22,635
You know what?
You are a real asshole!

342
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,006
I'll pretend that nothing
happened last night.

343
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,214
Don't play with that poor thing and come
back where you are belong!

344
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:38,488
I'm embarrassed to even
have to speak like this.

345
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,393
Finished?

346
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:51,340
A new concentration exercise!
Ready! Begin!

347
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,787
This one drop is like 10 tablets of Viagra!
It works for 3 days.

348
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,092
Oh, Yeah? It can't be.

349
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:52,069
Hey, bitch! My professor said
the ingredients are the same.

350
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,129
If these make pigs go in rut,
they could work for men, too!

351
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,697
That dirty bitch! Oh, God!

352
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,263
- She's crazy!
- You have to drag her away!

353
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,674
How can she act like that? God!

354
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,235
That bitch is a little insane.

355
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,074
- Hey! Let's drink.
- Yeah! Hurry and drink up! What are you waiting for?

356
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,051
Drink it up! Bottoms up!

357
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,781
Let's get started.

358
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:50,951
Hyunhee!

359
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,497
Hey there... My ungsuk!

360
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,623
What are you doing here?

361
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,132
I have something to do here.

362
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,500
You look great!
Did you get a nose job?

363
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,268
Oh! And your breasts are pretty too!
Are they silicone?

364
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,472
You guys are here...

365
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,796
Come over and take a look at this.

366
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,781
What's up with that?

367
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,263
Hello? Is this customer service?
My computer's crashed.

368
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,860
Yes. Close the window.
Ok, just a moment.

369
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,835
What'd they say?

370
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,633
They said to close the window.

371
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,298
Window?

372
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,275
Then close it, you bastard.

373
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,748
- Does it work?
- No, it doesn't. Lock it!

374
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,897
Damn...

375
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,431
Why the hell doesn't
this piece of crap work?

376
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,630
Lock the window and it's still like this
It said to put in something?

377
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,854
- It’s not special.
- It’s special.

378
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,887
Ahh how many spoons of sugar?

379
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,401
Do you have brown sugar?
Brown sugar? Yes?

380
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,402
Whew! We almost got caught!

381
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,099
That's why I said when you're
working-don't do anything else!

382
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,834
What's this?

383
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,808
I'm going crazy!

384
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,612
- Where to?
- This way.

385
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,884
Are you all right?

386
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,582
I'm all right.

387
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:45,117
The one who lives here went to the countryside
and he'll probably be back the day after tomorrow.

388
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,902
Don't you trust me?

389
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,702
Hurry back.

390
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,033
I'll be back soon.

391
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,421
Well...

392
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,795
I'm thirsty.

393
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,503
If you keep acting like this,
it makes more difficult for me, Jiwon.

394
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,140
I love Eunhyo.

395
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:43,908
How can you sleep with someone one time and
think that you're in love?

396
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:51,520
Don't talk like that.
I'm being very honest about my feelings.

397
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,574
Oh! Yoomi...

398
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,116
Wait. Just a minute.

399
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,516
I'm not ready...

400
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,098
- Hell, who's...
- Hey! Yoomi. You and me!

401
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,509
The! The... there.

402
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,550
Hey!

403
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,413
Ah! Jeez!

404
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,888
Bring back my clothes and handbag.

405
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:39,989
Why?

406
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,416
Clothes.

407
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:52,858
Clothes? Yes, yes, ok.
Come here.

408
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,030
Aaah! Look over there!

409
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,754
- Whoa!
- What the hell do you want?

410
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:55,389
I am gonna tell
you right now! Yeah?

411
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,023
First! Put on some clothes!

412
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,240
Hey, fucker. What are you
looking at me for? Come on up here!

413
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,039
Nothing's happening here.
Just go. Just leave. Please!

414
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:12,240
If you don't back away in 1 minute!
I'm gonna push him off!

415
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,984
Push? Push?

416
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,088
- This is hilarious!
- Which broadcasting company did you come from, you fuckers?

417
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,658
Just take it easy.

418
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:33,598
That's why I said to leave here.
We'll be down soon.

419
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,073
- Hey, bastard! You still don't have your pants on?
- I'm wearing them.

420
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,245
What are you bastards doing?

421
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,755
- Don't move fuckers!
- Everybody's going to die, fuckers!

422
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,958
Help me!

423
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,622
Help me!

424
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:08,334
Help me!

425
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,468
Help me!

426
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,374
This bastard is the one with
the bull's testicles?

427
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,416
Yes.

428
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,973
What kind of fool is
this character?

429
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,612
It says in his chart that
he's a student but!

430
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,852
38 hours ago he came in with
an erection and he's still got it!

431
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,756
Isn’t that dangerous?

432
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:35,628
If it doesn't go down by tomorrow
we'll have to cut it out.

433
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,734
I'm sorry.

434
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,607
It’s ok.

435
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,111
You hurt there twice now.

436
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,355
I've got to go now. Take care.

437
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,418
Yes.

438
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,178
When did you meet him?

439
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,980
Not too long ago.

440
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,577
Tell me about him.

441
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,588
He's the best looking hottie on campus.

442
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,089
What's a hottie?

443
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:40,095
Oh, you know it's all right.
He's very kind to me.

444
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,655
Strange guy.

445
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,196
What?

446
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,963
Why would such a handsome guy
be interested in a girl like you?

447
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,560
What's so special about you.

448
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,004
I'm very popular in school.

449
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,871
That's crap!

450
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,639
Can't you see that I'm a hottie too?

451
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:01,116
B.S. Does a hottie have
tiny breasts like you?

452
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,175
I can't even recognize where they are!

453
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,016
- Let's see!
- No.

454
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,817
Let's see.

455
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,120
Mom, show me yours first!

456
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,667
No! Let me see if you're
a hottie or not-let's see yours.

457
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,542
No! Look at that! Look at that bitch!
That bitch has a hickie. She always
has a souvenir from her nights out.

458
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,708
She really embarrasses me.

459
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,377
What is a hickie?

460
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,751
It’s a love bite.
A bruise on your neck you bitch!

461
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,518
How do you get that?
A mosquito bite?

462
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:54,390
Hello? If a mosquito bites you
do you put on a bandage?

463
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,659
This bitch is so stupid.

464
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,894
Aah! Next week is your birthday!

465
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,959
Right!
Do you want anything?

466
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,299
Why?
You gonna buy me something?

467
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,397
Well~ We'll see how you
act in the next few days.

468
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,542
Let's eat some Ramen.

469
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,219
- Did you check out that ring?
How much is it?
- How much do you think it is?

470
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,182
How much?

471
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,690
More than a 1000 bucks.

472
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,159
Hey, fucker! What kind of
a ring costs more than a grand.

473
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,287
Not even a championship belt
would cost that much! Fuck!

474
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,991
How can I get a 1000 bucks
in one week.

475
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,082
Older hey, take off your pants!

476
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,985
Take your shirt off!

477
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,930
5, 6, 7, 8. Look ahead!
Look at your hands! Hands!

478
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,942
Don't move your legs!

479
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,408
Back straight!
Keep your backs straight!

480
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:24,449
Stand up bitch, or I'm gonna
whack you on your head!

481
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,415
How can we win
a championship like this?

482
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,425
The competition is
in less than a week.

483
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:36,363
Don't you guys think!
Don't you have brains?

484
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,637
Are you sure?

485
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,300
What?

486
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,208
Don't you use birth control pill?

487
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,774
See! Those bitches are all alike!

488
01:00:55,852 --> 01:01:00,812
How can you tell if the baby is yours?

489
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,254
Did you check?

490
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,956
Just give her a couple of hundred bucks
and tell her to get rid of it. Okay?

491
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,102
Can't you just do it?

492
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,539
No. You'll have to come back
tomorrow with your guardian.

493
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,149
- What's up?
- Do you have time tomorrow?

494
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,774
Why?

495
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,580
I've made an appointment.

496
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,120
Appointment?

497
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:10,884
Why?

498
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,593
What is this?

499
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,432
You need money to do that, uh?

500
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:27,866
Why? You want me to go with you?

501
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,169
Today is my birthday.

502
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,412
You and me have birthdays.

503
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,920
But this baby will never have one.
It’s just waiting to die.

504
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,581
When did I ask for money from you?

505
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,149
Why do you have to
make me so pathetic?

506
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,128
What's this?
Change it.

507
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,606
Look at this one more time.
Look at the finish on this.

508
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,336
No, no, Miss!

509
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,778
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

510
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:47,016
Dear Eunhyo
Happy birthday to you.

511
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:21,045
Surprise!

512
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,726
Yeah, I bought an expensive stuff for her.

513
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:43,206
But next thing I know she popped me and then
she's giving me a nasty look.

514
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,505
Where the hell is it?
Jeez...

515
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,015
Yeah, so I pulled it out.

516
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:53,454
I gave it to her and thought
she would be happy! Fuck!

517
01:04:53,522 --> 01:05:00,121
But she slapped me and
fuck I fell down so hard. Fuck!

518
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,864
Excuse me...

519
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,726
Is that possible?

520
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,106
Listen Eunsik.

521
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:18,272
What do you mean she popped you?

522
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,447
Is that some new language?

523
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,385
Do you know what
you're talking about?

524
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,554
I don't know.

525
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,657
You don't know
then it's not important.

526
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,334
- Hello.
- Eunsik.

527
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,868
Eunhyo?

528
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,911
What are you doing today?

529
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,709
A date?

530
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:30,947
Are you her guardian?

531
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:32,945
Yes.

532
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:37,615
You're not kids!
Why aren't you more responsible.

533
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,455
Sex is not a game to play with.

534
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,929
You should think about the consequences!
Your enjoyment can ruin a woman's life!

535
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,557
Do you understand what I'm saying?

536
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,359
Yes...

537
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,969
Lee Eunhyo.

538
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,103
Yes.

539
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,112
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

540
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:20,997
Lie down.

541
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,107
What are you doing?
Hurry up and lie down.

542
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,308
- Are you ok?
- Move aside.

543
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,279
What are you doing?

544
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:32,130
We're almost there, easy, easy!

545
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,796
Do you want something to drink?

546
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,177
Relax. I'll be back soon.

547
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,311
Where are you going?

548
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,874
I'll be right back.

549
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,720
Eunsik.

550
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,150
Don't tell Sangok.

551
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,666
Please, I really need to
refund this ring.

552
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,032
Sorry, I can't help.

553
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,971
I paid you $1000,
just give me back $950.

554
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,030
Sorry, sir. We can't do that.

555
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:17,977
I will give up $50.
Please I just need to get the money back.

556
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,738
Are you awake?
Just a minute.

557
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,197
Here you are.

558
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:17,197
- It’s painful!
- Ok. I know.

559
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,901
Don't move!
Just stay still.

560
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:28,974
My mother said abortions are
just as difficult as giving births.

561
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,812
You have to keep your body warm
for at least 15 days

562
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,119
afterwards otherwise it hurts
even more when you're old.

563
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,200
This hand.

564
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,509
What are you crying for?

565
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,580
Do you want me to show
you my exercise routine?

566
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,191
Hup! The basis of these
exercises is patience and gut.

567
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,461
Say it! Gut!

568
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:27,968
Are you kidding?
Say it! Louder! Gut!

569
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,270
Gut!

570
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:25,020
One! Two! Longer One, two,
three, four! One, two, three, four!

571
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,328
Five, six, seven, eight.

572
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,764
One, two... Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

573
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:32,459
Yahoo!

574
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:36,402
What's that? Keep your legs straight!
Look at your feet!

575
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:49,808
Hey!

576
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:56,085
You little shit, what time is it now?
What are you thinking?

577
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,852
You don't remember that
tomorrow is the big competition?

578
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,518
Have you finished goofing around?

579
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,663
I'm sorry. Don't worry about me.
Let's practice!

580
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:10,796
One, two, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

581
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,901
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Aaugh, What's the matter?

582
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:19,346
We are invited to the national
championships to perform tomorrow.

583
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:22,178
- It’s going to be broadcast on TV.
- Really?

584
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:22,910
Hello, where were you?

585
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,078
- He said internet!
- Really!?

586
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:59,345
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

587
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:00,353
1, 2, 3...

588
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,083
Oh, no, no!

589
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,684
Not this bastard again!
What's up with him?

590
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,128
What's all this about?

591
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,789
What are you doing here?

592
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,562
What did you hit me for?
Didn't you say Taehak had no stamina?

593
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:15,466
Stop talking shit, you bitch.

594
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,801
What the fuck! It’s annoying.
I can't keep doing this!

595
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,341
Fuck!? How dare you could
say such a word to me?

596
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,071
What are you hitting me for?
What are you hitting me for?

597
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:56,344
Enjoy a great performance of the
National University Aerobic athletes!

598
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,643
- Hold on.
- Why are you so late?

599
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,185
Songguk is really pissed!

600
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,242
You're dead!

601
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,982
Hurry up and get changed.
We're in trouble.

602
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,752
- Hold on.
- You have to hit in the center.

603
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,918
Hold here! It’s ok.

604
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,359
Hey~

605
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,123
How are you?

606
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,637
We're gonna lose
because of you!

607
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,302
Waaaa! Ok!

608
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:43,172
We'll now take
a ten minute intermission!

609
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,238
Until then the Sunjong University
Concentration Power Team will entertain us!

610
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,876
Our team's first performance!

611
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,148
Yippie! Yea!

612
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,194
Hup!

613
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:37,094
Hup!

614
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,670
- Hup!
- Hup!

615
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,158
Oh! Look at that!

616
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,197
Oh, damn!

617
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:48,801
Wha!

618
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,712
Great! Fantastic!

619
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,348
Excellent! Fantastic!

620
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,420
Thank you, thank you!

621
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,194
That's great! Terrific!

622
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,336
I knew you guys could do it!

623
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,036
It’s ok it won't make any damage.

624
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,475
What's going on!
After eating it'll be ok.

625
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,877
- Songguk, Songguk.
- Yoomi, Yoomi.

626
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,416
- Songguk, Songguk.
- Yoomi my Yoomi! How were we?

627
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,577
Perfect! Everything was perfect!

628
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,422
- Songguk, Yoomi
- The next competition is for Solo Female Routines.

629
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,458
Competitors be prepared.

630
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:51,625
Lee Eunhyo! Eunhyo!
Lee Eunhyo Where is Eunhyo!

631
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,294
Where is that bitch?
Where is she?

632
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,269
That brainless bitch!

633
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,471
Lee Eunhyo. Lee Eunhyo.

634
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,337
What time is it!

635
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:29,798
Next is Lee Eunhyo,
a junior from Sunjong University.

636
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,593
Go for it, Eunhyo!

637
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,244
I'm losing my voice.

638
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,176
Where's Eunhyo?

639
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,809
Eunhyo? In the restroom.

640
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,512
- Restroom?
- Yes.

641
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:29,518
Why is he panting for?

642
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,321
Eunhyo, where are you?

643
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:39,593
Eunhyo, what's wrong?

644
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,176
I'm bleeding.

645
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:52,776
Eunhyo.

646
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:57,307
Eunhyo! Eunhyo! Eunhyo!
Eunhyo wake up! Wake up!

647
01:25:57,385 --> 01:26:07,158
Eunhyo wake up! Wake up!

648
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:12,223
Where should we go?
Where! Where! Where?

649
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:34,854
Eunhyo! Hang on.
We are almost there!

650
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:43,488
You can't come in here.
You must wait.

651
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,119
Mother!

652
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:25,762
Bitch, you can't do this!
How can you do this to me you bitch?

653
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:34,612
Why don't you die you bitch!
How could you do this to me?

654
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:38,118
How can you do this to me
after how I raised you?

655
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:44,819
Bitch! I didn't raise you like this!
Is that all you are? Huh?

656
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,951
Why?
What are you doing?

657
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:51,226
How could you after I raised you so well!

658
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:52,493
What are you doing?
Please calm down!

659
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:58,904
What! Did you do this?
Did you to this to my daughter?

660
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,377
My Eunhyo! What are you
going to do? My Eunhyo!

661
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:07,041
You bastard! You did this to my Eunhyo!
You bastard!

662
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:11,484
No! Stop it!
Mother! Mother! Mother...

663
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:14,919
- Congratulations! Yea!
- Thank you.

664
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:24,656
Eunsik!

665
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,597
Why are you still wearing you uniform?

666
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,192
- Our performance finished long ago.
- Sit down.

667
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:29,531
It’s just a joke!

668
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,538
No! Don't!
Stop him! Stop!

669
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,284
Leave me! Leave me alone!
You motherfucker!

670
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:47,744
What's with all the language?
Sit down and chill out.

671
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:50,450
Fuck you!

672
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,015
Fuck you!

673
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:54,926
Have you been drinking?

674
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:59,799
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Love is not a fucking joke!

675
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,370
Your one time enjoyment!
Fuck!

676
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:13,370
It hurts the woman and now that woman'll have
to spend the rest of her life with that pain.

677
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:18,478
Fuck you!
You've learned only shit!

678
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,316
You don't know what love is!
Fuck you!

679
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:24,818
What can of crap is going on here!

680
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:32,990
Take out your hand and go in.

681
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:59,246
Hit me anywhere you want.

682
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:01,986
Hup!

683
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,419
One, two.

684
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:12,131
Hit me on three!

685
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:14,993
Wha!

686
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:19,306
One, two, three!

687
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:32,915
Now this is how it should be!
Come on, Eunsik.

688
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:40,887
Hit me anywhere!
Anywhere.

689
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:42,896
Really? I can hit anywhere?

690
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:47,365
My body is like a stone!
A stone!

691
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:02,406
Who put a real balk in here?

692
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,456
I'm so fucking embarrassed!
Shit!

693
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:16,554
Hey...

694
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,654
Maybe the exterminator is spraying again.

695
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:20,523
Exterminator?

696
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,393
Yeah, it's a monthly thing.

697
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:24,954
I see.

698
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:33,140
Eunsik!

699
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:35,703
Yes?

700
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:41,509
Have you changed your mind?

701
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:45,115
Changed what?

702
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:49,222
You said you love me?

703
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,758
When did I say that?

704
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,987
If not! Never mind.

705
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,781
What shit's going on!

706
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,884
Fire!
