1
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:27,682
In the early regime of Kang-Hsi in the

2
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:29,715
Ching dynasty, emperor Hsuan-Hua
was too young to rule the country.

3
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,651
So 4 regents were appointed
to help him.

4
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,989
Among them, Ao-Bye was the most cruel,

5
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:37,251
threatened the emperor
in order to call the shots.

6
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:40,292
And persecute men of letters.

7
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,963
So eight nobles hated him very much.

8
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:46,534
Especially, Chang Chin Nan, the
chief of the Tien-Dee Association.

9
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,501
Day and night,
he thought about how to kill him.

10
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:07,975
Killing atmosphere!

11
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,336
Lord, it's the Tien-Dee Association.

12
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:39,609
Stop!

13
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:29,561
Your Kung-Fu is second to none,
my Lord.

14
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:34,429
You're asking for death.

15
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:37,037
I have my orders to.
Arrest the head of clan-Chang Chin Nan.

16
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,299
Yes!

17
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:12,126
Ha-Da-Fu kneel to Your Majesty.

18
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,036
Stand!
Yes!

19
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,510
How's the plan going?

20
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,749
Chiefs of seven banners
ordered me to tell Your Majesty.

21
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:31,045
They'll arrive at Li Chun House on time.

22
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,717
What's your opinion on this?

23
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,760
Your Majesty!
Ao-Bye covered the White Banner and

24
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:42,830
Led them to oppress your other subjects.
They hate him.

25
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,423
Yet, Ao-Bye has so many members that

26
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,901
they dared not stir against him.

27
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:49,594
This time, Your Majesty,

28
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:50,728
you went outside to discuss

29
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,672
how to deal with him with seven chiefs.

30
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,834
They thank for your blessing.

31
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:03,511
This is a big case.
I went out in plain clothes

32
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,084
to discuss this with them.

33
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:09,056
It's not a good thing to appear here.

34
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:14,324
Listen carefully.
Except for the seven chiefs,

35
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,764
all who know of this must die.

36
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,797
I'm an adult.

37
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:20,959
I don't want to be
controlled like a puppet.

38
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,601
Your Majesty, you're very wise!

39
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,685
Look! They are so pretty!

40
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:46,789
Girls, up stairs, down stairs,
come to see our guests.

41
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:49,590
Go away!

42
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,599
Thank you for coming so close.

43
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,364
Standing so straight to me
is a kind of respect.

44
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:57,564
Today, my topic is the

45
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,575
general chief of the TDA-Chang Chin Nan.

46
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:05,137
People say it's useless to be here
without seeing Chang Chin Nan.

47
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,676
He is 8 feet tall.
And his waist is 8 feet, too!

48
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,375
Wow! A square?

49
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:11,783
Square is square. It's real!

50
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,115
People are different.

51
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,089
There is even an octagonman!

52
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,028
His Kung-Fu is called,

53
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,495
"God afraid,

54
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
flashing palm."

55
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:30,805
One push of the hand,
and within hundred of miles!

56
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,040
People, animals, shrimp
crabs fleas, of all kinds,

57
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,200
all become dust.

58
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:42,149
Yet, it's hard to find him.

59
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,210
But, accidentally,

60
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,255
I saw half his face.

61
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,780
using a saw or Not,

62
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,687
there's no use seeing half a face!

63
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:51,819
That's right!

64
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,692
Jerk! He covered the other half!

65
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,624
You heard the song "With Balloon-guitar
to shelter half-face"?

66
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,730
You didn't go to school. Pig!

67
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:08,575
Although I just saw his half-face,
but gave my heart at once.

68
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,611
Immediately, I cut a chicken's head,
burned yellow paper,

69
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,146
and became his brother.

70
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,409
You, shut up! S.O.B.
What're you talking about?

71
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:16,882
They wouldn't call girls!

72
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,215
They're willing to

73
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,754
Iisten my story.

74
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:23,257
And to call girls is harmful for health.
There's a good thing.

75
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,190
Good thing?
Your sister is a prostitute, too.

76
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,956
No one dare call her that, you eat shit!

77
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,187
It's good for health.
Keep it for yourself!

78
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:31,024
For me? I'll settle you!

79
00:08:34,404 --> 00:08:35,393
Thanks! Blind!

80
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,427
Why are you so upset?

81
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,530
Sorry! Sir. Please don't mind.

82
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,766
Little S.O.B. Stay!

83
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,605
You apologize first!

84
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,040
Me? You need fists?

85
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,610
Help! Someone is sick!

86
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:46,442
Find someone to help him.

87
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,847
Someone! Call for my sister!

88
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,050
Who's your sister?

89
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,813
the love making candidate in town!
The most beautiful woman, Wei-Chun-Hua.

90
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,158
I'm shy!

91
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,971
It's mess here.

92
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:14,539
Waste no time here.

93
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:17,039
Seven chiefs wait for us upstairs.

94
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,444
It's him! He is sick!

95
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:25,884
What's the condition? Let me see.

96
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,015
Where?

97
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:33,594
Is he dead? lf he is, throw him out.

98
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,719
Don't make this place dirty!

99
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,026
Who? It's not easy to die.

100
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,095
It's Tun-Men-Chi.
Dead or not, I have no idea.

101
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,935
It's easy. Lift him!

102
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:42,901
For what?

103
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:44,371
According to my experience,

104
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,202
if man is sick, take a hairpin,

105
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,608
hit the spine point!
Then it will bounce out.

106
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:50,871
Lift his ass.

107
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:01,850
I was almost hit by the stick.

108
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,649
Don't watch! Go away!

109
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:11,158
Don't move! Stay!

110
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:13,031
What's up?

111
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:14,125
All stand still!

112
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,568
We're going to arrest Chang-Chin-Nan.

113
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,730
Search!
Yes!

114
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,802
Your Majesty!

115
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,772
What happened?

116
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,346
Four men with great Kung-Fu were here
looking for Ao-Bye.

117
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:31,513
For me?

118
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:33,046
I don't think so.

119
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:36,419
What are you up to do?

120
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:38,082
Who knows where Chang-Chin-Nan is?

121
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:39,455
Him! Here he is.

122
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,789
I'm just telling the story, guys.

123
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,089
Take him back
for investigation.

124
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,193
Don't kill innocent people.

125
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,092
I'm Chang-Chin-Nan.

126
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:53,741
You?

127
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,010
Chief Jou, take the chance to go!

128
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,648
Chief General, see these dogs?

129
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,588
They won't scare us away!

130
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:14,288
You see? Great!

131
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,419
Stop talking!

132
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,430
Follow me!

133
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,028
Go to hell!

134
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,031
Oh dear!

135
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,115
Don't be afraid! I come to rescue you.

136
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,724
Please follow me.

137
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:51,362
Climb into there.

138
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,661
Where?
The hole for dogs.

139
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:55,164
Even me? No way!

140
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,260
They saw I rescued you,

141
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,931
they won't dream that we'll turn back.

142
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:00,269
Heroes know when to bow to circumstances.
Life is the most important thing.

143
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,775
Hurry up!

144
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,548
What happened to the
Greenwood party chief?

145
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:13,947
Dead!

146
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:16,819
I'll fetch water to clean your eyes.

147
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,051
No!

148
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:21,225
Lime will become hot and burn my eyes.

149
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:22,195
What should I do?

150
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,764
Use vegetable oil!

151
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,232
OK! I'll take it.

152
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,130
Wait! You...

153
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,931
Anything?

154
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:35,169
I'm Hai-Da-Fu. Eunuch General in Palace.

155
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,003
Oh, Lord Hai, l...

156
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:41,315
I have the Emperor's order here.

157
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:48,946
Evacuate all soldiers here.

158
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:49,923
Yes!

159
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,756
The order is that we cooperate
to defeat Ao-Bye.

160
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:54,885
Yes.

161
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,186
Lord Hai!
Your Majesty!

162
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,161
How's everything?

163
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,860
All evacuated.
Your Majesty may go back.

164
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:01,432
Fine.

165
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,128
The Lord ordered us to evacuate.

166
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,036
Fine! Go!

167
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,119
They left.

168
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,148
Well, I've got to go, too.

169
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,191
It's ok. But take him with you.

170
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,951
For everyone knows that
he saved your life.

171
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:30,655
This is to prevent trouble.

172
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:34,001
Hero Chang! I admire you!

173
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,070
Please accept me as your apprentice.

174
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:37,503
You?

175
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:40,006
He saved your life.
I should reward him, right?

176
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,840
If you don't want, I'll kick him out!

177
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:46,073
To prevent being killed for his sake.
Is that right?

178
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,642
It's dangerous to a be member of TDA,

179
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,181
will you regret it?

180
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:52,884
When,

181
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:55,048
you teach me the best kung-fu,
I won't be afraid.

182
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:57,214
What's your name?

183
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,349
Wei-Shew-Bao.

184
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:02,557
You are my apprentice.

185
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,226
Thanks...

186
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:40,362
After paying money, killing the chicken
and burning the yellow paper,

187
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:43,236
You will become a member of the TDA.

188
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,530
I enroll you into the Greenwood.

189
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:49,105
We have 10 Party Principles
and 20 Disciplines.

190
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:52,542
30 strict rules, 80 loose rules.

191
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:56,507
If you commit one of them,
even if you are my apprentice.

192
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,110
You still have to suffer 81 knife stabs!

193
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,522
Don't fuss about it! One is enough.

194
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,857
Nonsense. Stand up!

195
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:07,695
The Greenwood Chiefwas killed by Ao-Bye.

196
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,453
We should follow the Chief's will

197
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,257
to kill him.

198
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,493
And kick the Emperor and
his subjects out of this country.

199
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,935
Restore Ming dynasty!

200
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,136
Anti-Ching, For-Ming!

201
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:26,208
I have a dangerous task for someone.

202
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:30,412
And expect a volunteer!

203
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,453
What task?

204
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,681
To steal "42 Chapter Classic"
from the Palace.

205
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,789
In that book,

206
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,919
there is a vital secret.

207
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,028
If we know that secret,

208
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,527
we can restore the Ming dynasty.

209
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,192
All the citizens' property
can be regained.

210
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,262
And we can disconnect
the dragon's figure.

211
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,139
Then, their days are numbered.

212
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:57,871
We can restore our country quickly.

213
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:02,040
So, I'll appoint someone to steal it.

214
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,685
Yet, it's hard

215
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,384
almost suicidal.

216
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,551
People who don't want to go,
please sit down.

217
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:12,883
You took half and I the other half!

218
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,974
Bao, you just joined in TDA

219
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,633
and want to take credit.

220
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,035
OK! I allow you to.

221
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:33,147
But the truth is that, the chair...

222
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:35,106
A promise is a promise.

223
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:36,909
Do you know breaking your word and
disregarding loyalty to friends break

224
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:39,543
the Eighth Party Principle? The punishment
is to cut one of your hand and leg.

225
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:41,919
Is this the TDA,
or a place to fool people around?

226
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,256
Come in with me.

227
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:49,796
Bao. You are smart.

228
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,094
I can use an intelligent way
to talk to you,

229
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,700
but not to them.

230
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,762
I don't understand.

231
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:58,338
Most of the intellectual
and reasonable men

232
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,465
are government officials now.

233
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,676
So, to fight against Ching subjects,

234
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,802
we should use slow people.

235
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,574
To them, you cannot tell the truth.

236
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,377
Use religion to amaze them.

237
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:12,748
Make them believe, whatever they do
is for a righteous cause.

238
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,382
So, "Anti-Ching, For-Ming"
is just a slogan.

239
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:17,717
Just like Amen.

240
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,058
They oppress us, robbed our money

241
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:23,063
and women from us.

242
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,393
So, overthrow Ching dynasty.

243
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,058
To get the money and women back,
right?

244
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:29,703
To restore the Ming dynasty or not
is none of my beeswax!

245
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,396
OK! We are all smart.
Understand and continue!

246
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,200
To sum up, if we succeed

247
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:36,143
we'll have countless money and women.

248
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,479
Are you willing to go?
Yes.

249
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:42,111
But you said it's a suicidal task
it really scares me!

250
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,913
I can teach you
the best Kung-Fu in the world.

251
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:48,655
Such a big book? I think it would
take months to practice it.

252
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,757
It's just the catalogue.

253
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:52,919
That pile over there the secret book.

254
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:57,564
Wow! It would take at least one year
to read it!

255
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,561
I read for 3 years,
practiced for 30 years.

256
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,464
And become what I am.

257
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,766
30 years? How much time
do I have left then?

258
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:05,771
One night!

259
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,101
One night to practice?
That's demented!

260
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,477
No! After read it, sure win.
But if you don't, fated to die.

261
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,517
What's up?

262
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:21,953
You go as an underground operative.
Maybe will meet our members.

263
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,251
I have a mark for you.

264
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,257
I will tattooed "Anti-Ching, For-Ming"

265
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,386
on your foot.

266
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:31,091
Tenderly... OK!

267
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:35,929
"Ching" "Ming".

268
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:36,935
The other.

269
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:38,667
Again? Later!

270
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,002
The other words. I'll tattoo myself.
Is that ok?

271
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,036
Don't forget!

272
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,839
Or you'll be killed by our people,

273
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,378
that's not worth it.

274
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:51,115
Bao, you go to the palace
to apply to be an errand boy,

275
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:55,246
There is someone to pick you up.
The gesture is to wink.

276
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,523
Wow! The line is long!
When it's my turn, I may die.

277
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:04,159
Why does no one line up here?

278
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,266
Brother,
is this also the registration stand?

279
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:07,527
Yes! Come in!

280
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:08,534
OK! Thanks!

281
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:19,045
What kind of bed is it?

282
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,341
Why do you tie me up?

283
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,475
To be an eunuch, you have to castrate.

284
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:24,518
Castrated of course, you have to be!

285
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,111
Who wants to be an eunuch?
You, Of course!

286
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,621
Your mother wants to be that!
I'm applying to be errand boy.

287
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:33,387
We're short handed. It's promising.

288
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:37,362
And it has a lot of advantages.

289
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,661
We are on the same boat. No kidding.

290
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:41,596
Who's kidding?

291
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,969
Believe me! I'm really applying for that.

292
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,405
That way!
You let me go, and I line up there.

293
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,474
Sorry to bother you.

294
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,542
Anyway, no one goes out
without being shipped.

295
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,645
Forget it! Hold him. I'm going to snip.

296
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,447
Stop! Stop that! Don't snip now.

297
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,114
Lord Ah! No way!

298
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:02,551
Why not?

299
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,949
Castrate him. Then he can't
walk for two months.

300
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:07,024
But I need workers.

301
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,825
Give him to me. I'll bring him to palace.

302
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,023
I'll castrate him at palace.

303
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,633
But...

304
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:14,996
But what? Untie him!

305
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:17,869
Sorry! A mistake.

306
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,199
We met before right?

307
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,739
If there's any opportunity
be my guest at night.

308
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:28,044
You want to run?
Kuei can change clothes with him.

309
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:32,212
And you can't use your real name.

310
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,779
I'll call you Chun.

311
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,782
Don't call me Chun!

312
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:43,821
Chun! ln the palace,
the soldiers patrol very strictly.

313
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,831
Five steps a stop,
ten steps, stop again.

314
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:49,331
So, you can't walk around.

315
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,133
Or you will be decapitated. Understand?

316
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:09,349
Are you afraid?

317
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:10,981
No!

318
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:12,992
Then, why are you holding on to me?

319
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:16,389
I think you liked it. Sorry!

320
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:17,530
Kuei!

321
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,363
Lamp!
Yeah!

322
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:33,312
What's up?

323
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,174
This way my Lord?

324
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:38,411
No! I admine your dark glasses!
Not bad!

325
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:39,679
You know how to appreciate things?

326
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:40,880
A little bit.

327
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,989
You are so handsome, and promising.

328
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,558
That beard, it's so creative.

329
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,720
Without these, you're still cool.

330
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:51,126
You're kidding, Chun!

331
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,325
I dare not!

332
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,162
This bunch are phony.

333
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:04,237
Eunuch is not a complete man.

334
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,974
This fake beard

335
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,309
could give me a little respect.

336
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:12,843
What are you up to?

337
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:14,585
My Lord!

338
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,112
What is that

339
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,715
in the glass?

340
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:18,985
Penis!

341
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,255
Penis?

342
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:22,691
This one is a deer's!

343
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,933
This a Tiger's!

344
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:31,004
This a cow's!

345
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,439
Wow! This must be an elephant's!

346
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:39,069
No! A human being's.

347
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,881
I was only a baby when I was snipped.

348
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:47,280
Wow! Yours is so big!
Wish I had one.

349
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,685
When I polished it, I put it in
the wrong place. That's the one,

350
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:53,224
this is a turnip.

351
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,626
Let me have a look.

352
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,899
I can't see anything!

353
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,232
Use this, you can see more clearly.

354
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:10,007
I see it! Wow! So delicate!

355
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:14,005
I was snipped when I was one.
Really something.

356
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,878
I think the one who snipped for you
is really something.

357
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,384
Good eyesight!

358
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,215
Everyone's penis is in Penis' Room.

359
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:26,088
I'm afraid of losing it.
So, I put it here.

360
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,857
Don't worry!
I'll keep an eye on it.

361
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,958
Want to pee!

362
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:38,903
Lord! You stand to pee or squat?

363
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:39,803
What did you say?

364
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,674
I think you'll lie flat on the ground.

365
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,379
Have to line up just to pee?

366
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:49,606
Who cares?

367
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,414
You don't mind peeing together,
do you?

368
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,653
You're the first person
who pees and bleeds at the same time.

369
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,348
What kind of kung-fu
are you practicing?

370
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:26,579
You're so powerful
your pigtail has become straight.

371
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:29,620
There...
What?

372
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,485
Many...
Many corpses.

373
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:33,955
How do you know?

374
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,831
How do you know my pigtail
has turned straight?

375
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,400
I've got eyes to see.

376
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,195
Aren't you blind?

377
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:44,003
Who told you I'm blind?

378
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,366
No one did.

379
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,310
If the eunuchs were not all dead,

380
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:52,304
I wouldn't make this exception.

381
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:54,540
To let you come in
without being snipped.

382
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:59,979
Tonight, you and Kuei
go to the Queen Mother's room,

383
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,847
find out something important for me.

384
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:04,150
My Lord, spare my life!

385
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,658
Everyone goes into her palace and

386
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:07,226
next morning,
they will be found dead in the garden.

387
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:08,659
All their veins frozen!

388
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:11,197
Please spare my life. Please!

389
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:14,899
Don't be a chicken like that.

390
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,469
I'm a new comer. I can refuse.

391
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:18,505
But you worked here for so long.
Want to escape?

392
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,937
You couldn't.

393
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:20,906
Lord! Don't worry!

394
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,408
I'll persuade him. Let him go alone.

395
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,446
Real! lf you don't want to go,
I'll hit you.

396
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,442
Lord! I got hurt.
I want to take leave for two days.

397
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:32,850
Tonight, I can't go.

398
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:37,415
Kuei! You thought, to use this method,

399
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,857
to escape?

400
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,189
Go: die! Not go: die, too!

401
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:42,285
I have to fight!

402
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,105
De-bone palm!

403
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,315
Want to run?

404
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,182
Yet, my Lord, you don't have to flush.

405
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:08,288
You can hit him at such a long distance.
You're really good.

406
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,381
Your Kung-Fu is better than mine.

407
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:14,417
What's the matter?

408
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:32,407
What happened?

409
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:36,249
De-bone palm?

410
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,013
I hit you twice, too.

411
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:43,657
I couldn't dream about this!

412
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:57,794
What are you doing?

413
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,339
I was hit by his palm.
My bone softened.

414
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,169
That's a slow one.

415
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,505
Slow?

416
00:27:05,046 --> 00:27:06,638
You see your left hand.

417
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,452
After that green air passes your elbow,

418
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:16,723
your bones will break completely.

419
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,953
But, at least,
you have one more month to live.

420
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:20,493
Lord! There's no grudge between us.

421
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,128
Why did you do this?

422
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:26,266
If you find the thing for me

423
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,665
in her palace,

424
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:30,534
then, I'll cure this.

425
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,799
Aaargh! That palm again.

426
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,337
This is not that palm.

427
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:36,534
What do you want me to do?

428
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:38,773
Steal "42 Chapter Classic"!

429
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:40,875
"42 Chapter Classic"?

430
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,416
No more talking! Go right away!

431
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:51,057
Don't be afraid.
There is her Ts-Nin palace.

432
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:53,524
Now, she must pray to Buddha,
at Shang-Ha Palace.

433
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:56,153
It takes at least 2 hours.
You have enough time.

434
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:58,731
After fetching it,
hand that to me at once.

435
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:01,592
If she comes back at once,
what should I do?

436
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:03,794
I'll protect you. Get down.

437
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,099
It's so high. How to get down?

438
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:08,169
Use my palm to send you there.
It'll be OK.

439
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:16,711
It's really OK.

440
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:20,715
What a coincidence.

441
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:41,201
Welcome the Queen Mother back.

442
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,135
So quick!

443
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,125
The Queen Mother is quite well.

444
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:06,027
Queen Mother! Since you feel sick,

445
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,534
I'll help you to change clothes.

446
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:19,207
See! It's not easy to get it.

447
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:20,873
Let me try!

448
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:42,433
Take off!

449
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:21,605
Wow! She has Kung-Fu?

450
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:35,485
It's impossible! So easy to get it.

451
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:41,318
You damn eunuch. You want to steal?

452
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:45,064
What's your name?

453
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:48,625
You don't know me? New here?

454
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,170
Yes. Sir, may I have your title?

455
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,036
Sir? Who do you think I am?

456
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:58,175
So, you're an eunuch, too?

457
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:00,545
Yes.

458
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:02,944
Don't monkey around. We're all friends.
Give it back.

459
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:04,850
I won't!

460
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,278
If you won't, I'm going to punch you.

461
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:11,750
Even if you give it to me now,
I'll still punch you!

462
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:15,886
You sleazeball! I'm going to kill you!

463
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:18,522
Help! Brother!
Don't run!

464
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,328
Nothing! Just an accident.

465
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:22,134
Stop! Don't run!

466
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:27,504
Help! Someone's chasing me!

467
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:29,933
Who are you?
It's none of your business!

468
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:30,974
What's up?

469
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,979
Don't think I'm scared
because there are two of you!

470
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:34,411
Hand it down to me quickly.

471
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:35,471
If you have the guts, come here.

472
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,675
If you have the guts, come up to take it.

473
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,477
Who is his direct supervisor?

474
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:41,347
Let me tell him to punish him.

475
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:44,114
No! He is ajerk!

476
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,352
He thinks both of us as real eunuchs.

477
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,653
Really?

478
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:49,526
And usually, when they see us,

479
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:52,360
they are just like chickens. But not him.

480
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:56,267
He hit me with all he could!

481
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,697
If you have the guts, come here.
I'll punch you!

482
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:05,075
Must be a trap! I'm not stupid!

483
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:07,945
If you are a man, come down and fight.

484
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:08,981
You like to fight?

485
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:11,611
No! But someone likes me to beat him.

486
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:22,118
How do you want to fight?

487
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,720
I have three rules.

488
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:25,627
First, you can't hit my face.

489
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,700
Second, we can only hit your face.

490
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:30,598
What a cunning eunuch.

491
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:42,541
Stop.

492
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:43,606
What now?

493
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:44,810
He took my book.

494
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,819
I'll fight with you
after he returns the book.

495
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:49,517
It's painful...

496
00:32:49,724 --> 00:32:50,918
Did you take his things?

497
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,720
No, I didn't.

498
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:53,953
Beat him up now.

499
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,325
You've got it in your hand and
you deny it.

500
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:59,098
I'll return with more people.
You'll know you're wrong then.

501
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,189
My master is powerful.

502
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:02,132
You'll lose your blood
just by a sneezing.

503
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:03,831
Who's your master?

504
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:07,371
That's because in your life time,
you didn't see Chang... Lord,

505
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,636
it's sad to be a hero.
Ha-Da-Fu. Lord-Hai.

506
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,273
He's your master?

507
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:15,942
You're too scared to laugh.

508
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,049
Isn't it funny?

509
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,687
Yes. But his Kung-Fu is rather poor.

510
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,679
I think...

511
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:30,894
You don't have to write a letter
to apologize.

512
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:33,330
Anyway, you can just surrender
and give it back.

513
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:36,393
Call it a day. Tomorrow, continue.

514
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:38,035
If you can win tomorrow

515
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:39,798
I'll give it back to you.

516
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:41,533
And give you another one.

517
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:42,665
You have one?

518
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:46,269
Of course. Its boring!
I don't know its usage.

519
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:49,047
Brother.

520
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,014
In the Queen Mother's palace

521
00:33:55,156 --> 00:33:58,853
there is a eunuch who is close to you
in terms of age and Kung-Fu?

522
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:01,621
Yes, I've experienced many hard times.

523
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,526
Now he took away the 42 Chapter Classic.

524
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:04,928
And I have to fight with him tomorrow.

525
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,024
He'll give it back to me
but only if I can beat him.

526
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,067
Another slap.

527
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:13,332
How dare you lie
to me after my slapping you.

528
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:16,500
No, he hit me again
after I mentioned your name.

529
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:19,604
And he gave you a letter.

530
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:30,716
This eunuch is funny,
but his kung fu is terrible.

531
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,655
Please teach him the best kung-fu.

532
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,422
So that I can keep him company.

533
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:36,724
Remember, don't ever punish him.

534
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,230
And don't ever treat him badly.

535
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,731
And listen to him. Don't disobey.

536
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:43,030
Or, I'll be unhappy.

537
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,599
What? ls that OK?

538
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,613
Lord Chun.

539
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:59,710
What kind of Kung-Fu
do you want to practice?

540
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:05,253
See what he looked like.
Does he owe someone money?

541
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:10,389
Want to practice?
Then De-Bone Palm is OK.

542
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:11,721
OK!

543
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:15,030
If you practice for 30 to 50 years,
you may succeed.

544
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,294
Wow! Why does it take hundreds of years
to practice great Kung-Fu?

545
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,339
From even half of it, I will die.

546
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:23,171
You are kidding,
I couldn't even melt phlegm!

547
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:26,042
That's right! And it is too powerful.

548
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:27,306
I'm afraid of hurting you...

549
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:29,274
What?

550
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,946
The atmosphere here.

551
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:34,981
Then, what's your best technique.
Show me so that I can choose.

552
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,054
OK!

553
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:37,120
What are you doing?

554
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:38,850
I'm starving!

555
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,257
Fetch something for me.

556
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:13,490
You use this to carry dung?

557
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:15,856
You look tired, change to a lighter one.

558
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:36,509
It's really something. Help me! Thanks.

559
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,449
You sleazeball!

560
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:47,186
One is big and one is small.
How it be shown publicly?

561
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,420
Change!

562
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,276
Flying up and down isn't interesting!
You aren't a child!

563
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:07,737
You saw I was eating hot-pot
but you still knocked these leaves down,

564
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:09,782
you made me angry!

565
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,980
Chun! You're picky.
What are you up to?

566
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:18,791
You asked me to practice Kung-Fu.

567
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:20,425
What do you want to do?

568
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,462
Want to run away?

569
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:31,799
You're really bothering me.

570
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:33,396
Go to hell!

571
00:37:39,147 --> 00:37:40,341
Wait!

572
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,610
What?

573
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:46,314
What's that movement called?

574
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:49,484
"Without fail heart-piercing hand".

575
00:37:49,657 --> 00:37:52,251
"Without fail breast-catching hand"?

576
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,416
What?

577
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,358
I'm a cultivated person. I'll learn this.

578
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:56,452
This one?

579
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,054
Even with no sleep, I'll practice.

580
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,925
Fine.

581
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:02,434
Where did you learn this?

582
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:03,902
None of your business.

583
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,266
Usually, I use this on women.

584
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:07,773
I think you are a good man,

585
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:09,900
I make an exception
to let you know its greatness.

586
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:42,701
Brother! You are lousy today.

587
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:44,038
You couldn't win.

588
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:46,338
Don't come here. He's playing seriously.

589
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:47,639
Definitely, it will snap here!

590
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,339
Watch yourself.

591
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:56,820
No face-beating.

592
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:58,080
But you seized my breast!

593
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,854
So what?
You don't make a living with them.

594
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:01,360
Or my face.

595
00:39:01,762 --> 00:39:03,354
You are an eunuch. So glib. So mean.

596
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:04,556
You are not an eunuch?

597
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:06,562
Only the Emperor has this!

598
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:07,690
Who do you think you are?

599
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:11,096
What can be said now?

600
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,127
Are you surrendering or not?

601
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:19,836
Let go...
Surrender or not?

602
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:21,709
I surrender.
I win.

603
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,245
Your kung-fu is so bad.

604
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,580
What? It's painful, don't do that.

605
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,553
You want me to grab you.

606
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,454
How's that...
Of course it's painful.

607
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,090
Why do you have...

608
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,426
You said only the Emperor has...

609
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,271
The Emperor...

610
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:57,783
Your Majesty,
Auo-Bye ask for permission to see you.

611
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:58,783
What should I do now?

612
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:00,376
This old turkey!

613
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:03,149
He dares to enter my study directly.
He's going too far!

614
00:40:04,392 --> 00:40:05,984
Take him aside!

615
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,355
Hurry! Hurry!
Hide!

616
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:10,589
Under there!

617
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,106
Subject Ao-bye knees to Your Majesty!
Your Majesty.

618
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,374
Stand!

619
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,176
Thank Your Majesty.

620
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:38,217
Why do you and the other subjects
want to meet me?

621
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:42,686
Please give an order to arrest Sony!

622
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:45,354
Ao, he and you

623
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:48,334
are appointed to be
the four assistant subjects.

624
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:53,038
He's a credit to the country,
why arrest him?

625
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:57,505
For he committed a terrible crime!
The citizens complain about that!

626
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,636
The defence department isn't satisfied
with what he did.

627
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:03,807
If let him get away with it, the outrage
is going to be hard to pacify.

628
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:09,748
So we ask Your Majesty to do it.

629
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:11,757
Please let us have your command.

630
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:16,188
No evidence! I couldn't do it.

631
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,962
My words are evidence!

632
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,830
I control so many soldiers.

633
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,870
My words are powerful.

634
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:28,166
Wave the flag, then chop the head!

635
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,800
You think I'm a liar?

636
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,173
Even if I lied to you,

637
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,805
do you think they'll lie to you, too?

638
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,406
Have a second thought.

639
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,010
I'll consider it.

640
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:43,555
People live poor lives,

641
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:46,516
Please waste no time.

642
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:48,856
I need...
Your Majesty!

643
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:52,188
Your Majesty! I work for you.

644
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:56,630
You...

645
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:58,566
He's Ao-Bye?
Yes.

646
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:02,004
So rude?
Yes.

647
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:05,468
What are you doing? I'm not a woman.

648
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:09,343
I know. And you're not a man, either.

649
00:42:20,094 --> 00:42:21,493
Don't fiddle with it!

650
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,355
Who's that?

651
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:29,599
It's me!

652
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:32,729
An eunuch! Why you hide there?

653
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:36,940
You guess!

654
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:39,811
Aides! Pull him out to be beheaded!

655
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:41,241
No! No!

656
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:43,406
Why not?
He is my confidential subordinate!

657
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:48,078
Confidential subordinate!

658
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,589
I haven't heard about that?

659
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:54,250
You talked to His Majesty so loudly,
you want to go to hell?

660
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:56,457
Your Majesty! You see me!

661
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:57,595
He goes too far!

662
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,288
What's your name? How old are you?
Where do you work?

663
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,797
Don't look! Speak!

664
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:03,163
Why are you all standing up? Kneel!

665
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:06,905
What are you looking for? Speak!

666
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:10,867
Your Majesty! I don't care who he is,

667
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:14,139
I want you to make the command
to arrest Sony.

668
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:16,613
Why listen to you?
His Majesty has his plan!

669
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,049
You don't have to nag!

670
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:19,842
Basically,
Sony didn't pay for his meals,

671
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:21,444
flirted with old woman and
seduced your wife,

672
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:22,544
we know that.

673
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,987
Baloney!
I haven't finished!

674
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:27,586
Actually, I'm a inside man!

675
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:29,786
Yes.
Golden lnside Man.

676
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,727
Especially, around you!

677
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:34,493
To watch Sony and his colleagues appear.

678
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:37,162
You, maybe, are in the same group
so that you want to kill him so urgently!

679
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:42,174
Baloney! I control millions of soldiers.

680
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,004
Do I have to?

681
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:52,015
What?
Go on!

682
00:43:53,788 --> 00:43:54,777
Threats

683
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,649
to His Majesty! You all heard!
Threats His Majesty!

684
00:43:57,858 --> 00:43:59,849
No! No!

685
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,886
His Majesty and I heard that.
That's contempt.

686
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,520
Aides! Pull him out to behead him!

687
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:07,690
Wait! I think you are all right,

688
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:10,063
I'll give you a chance. You go!

689
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:11,596
I'll kill you!

690
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:13,798
Thank you, but it's not your business.

691
00:44:14,074 --> 00:44:17,373
Everybody has to die
if the Emperor wants them to die.

692
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:20,245
But I don't know if you'll die first
or I'll die first.

693
00:44:20,514 --> 00:44:24,006
Auo-Bye, I know how to deal with Sony.

694
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:26,518
I will give you gifts tomorrow.

695
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:28,587
You and other officials can leave now.

696
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:31,284
Auo-Bye, we'll leave first.

697
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:39,591
What a young hero.

698
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,463
Your Majesty, I'll leave now.

699
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,253
Brother.

700
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:09,987
This time Chun's braver than you were.

701
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:12,895
You were so scared.

702
00:45:14,034 --> 00:45:15,228
We all depend on you.

703
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:16,768
No need to mention it.

704
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,337
I grabbed Your Majesty by mistake.

705
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,032
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

706
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:24,805
You didn't do it on purpose.

707
00:45:25,145 --> 00:45:26,339
Thank you, Your Majesty.

708
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,477
Chun is funny,
would you offer Chun to me?

709
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:35,013
Stop fooling around.

710
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,691
I need capable men to help me now.

711
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:42,125
You are clever and brave,

712
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,560
do you want to serve me?

713
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:45,828
It's my pleasure.

714
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,700
Good, now you are my spy.

715
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:52,235
Yes.

716
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:55,365
You have to spy on Auo-Bye
and Ha-Da-Fu.

717
00:45:56,243 --> 00:45:57,437
Lord Ha.

718
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,112
Ha-Da-Fu is an important person.

719
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:04,681
He's been acting strangely lately.
He may have some evil plot.

720
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,610
Moreover, he dislikes the Queen Mother.

721
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:10,686
You have to follow him closely and
let me know what he's up to.

722
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:12,047
Yes.

723
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,954
Our relationship and
what happened today,

724
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,531
Should only be known by three of us.
If you let the cat out of the bag,

725
00:46:20,768 --> 00:46:22,463
your head will be on the ground.

726
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:25,236
Yes. If it is her?

727
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,067
The same.

728
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:32,001
Your Majesty is just.
I worship Your Majesty heartily.

729
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,876
Whenever I call for you, see me at once.
Help me to spy on those wicked persons.

730
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,449
Yeah!

731
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:39,984
Watch me by the way.

732
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,760
This is called "Old Tree Roots",

733
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:51,687
I turn over to control his under part.

734
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,431
He looks back.

735
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:57,126
Then a "Lion steals peaches" suddenly.

736
00:46:57,204 --> 00:46:58,603
The is "Monkey steals peaches", right?

737
00:46:58,872 --> 00:47:01,466
Lion wouldn't. It doesn't eat fruit.

738
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,666
No interrupting. Sleazeball!

739
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:08,106
That "Lion steals peaches"
didn't work well. I stole nothing.

740
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:11,183
Just got a bunch of hair.

741
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:13,013
Guess why?

742
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:14,743
Is that the hair at armpit?

743
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:16,921
No!

744
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,217
Baloney!

745
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,100
You think you are the first one
to stir up fighting?

746
00:47:28,202 --> 00:47:29,601
I'm prepared.

747
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,569
Besides De-bone palm, I have other sorts
of Kung-Fu that you don't know.

748
00:47:33,841 --> 00:47:36,139
"De-fry leg"!

749
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:45,279
Where are the "42 Chapter Classics"?

750
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:47,443
I forgot where I put them.

751
00:47:48,322 --> 00:47:50,813
Did the green air pass your elbow?

752
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:59,662
Soon... if you heal me from this hurt!

753
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:00,859
I maybe, can think about it.

754
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:03,027
Want to play dirty?

755
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:07,605
Who is that?

756
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,608
Lord Hai!
Queen Mother told us to come here.

757
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:13,941
I was sick
and so I couldn't welcome you outside.

758
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,480
Are there any bids?

759
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,541
Queen Mother asked Chun to come over.

760
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:20,819
Did Chun do anything wrong?

761
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:21,750
No more talking!

762
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:24,153
Ask him out. We have to take him back.

763
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:27,590
Why is she looking for you?

764
00:48:27,728 --> 00:48:29,423
For I'm a lady-killer.

765
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:33,628
Fine! There is a powder bag.

766
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:37,498
Put it into her tea or wine
if you get the chance.

767
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:38,729
It's dangerous!

768
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:42,674
I'll cover you secretly. Go!

769
00:48:45,145 --> 00:48:46,544
Another one again!

770
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,938
Are you Chun?

771
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:52,084
Yes. The Queen Mother wants to see me?
Please lead me there.

772
00:48:53,987 --> 00:48:55,181
I didn't say I won't go.

773
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:07,096
What're you up to?

774
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,801
Rape me! But don't kill me!

775
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:20,707
Why killing? ls it right?

776
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:35,053
Did she know my secret - No snipping?

777
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:37,257
If she does, oh, fudge!

778
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:39,454
Who is that?

779
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:54,710
You...?
You don't recognize me?

780
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:57,744
Try! Try!

781
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:01,083
You think you can escape me

782
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:03,712
for my brother didn't give you to me?

783
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:07,054
I could ask Mother's maids to catch you.

784
00:50:07,161 --> 00:50:08,958
Mother? Queen Mother is...

785
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:13,523
My mother. My brother is the Emperor.

786
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,396
You are...

787
00:50:14,601 --> 00:50:16,193
Seeing Jian-Ning Princess,
you should kneel.

788
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,368
Too late. You show contempt to me.
Behead him!

789
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:21,532
Don't be so impulsive.
I'm bound, I can't move!

790
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,801
I don't care! Behead him!

791
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:28,072
Dig out your eyes or cut your nose?

792
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:32,349
Or snip that?

793
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:34,943
If you ask my opinion,
let me free first.

794
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:37,482
Then, do whatever you like.

795
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:42,490
Try to make yourself look cool.

796
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:44,493
Not necessary. I always am.

797
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:48,397
Then the ugliest one,
just like Y.C Chu!

798
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:50,560
No! It's impossible for me.

799
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:54,737
Or the sexiest one.

800
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:56,741
No! Have a look in the mirror. You are.

801
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,502
Me?

802
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:04,509
It's fun.

803
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:05,882
Okay, I'll let you get out.

804
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:11,050
You pretend to be a tortoise.

805
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:16,327
Sorry,
I don't know how to be a tortoise.

806
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,728
Why?
It's my principle.

807
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,566
Okay, I'll have to hit you then.

808
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:23,532
Alright, I'll be a tortoise.

809
00:51:23,737 --> 00:51:27,138
Now I don't want that now.
Laugh...

810
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:31,543
Stop.
Keep on laughing...

811
00:51:31,612 --> 00:51:33,910
I'd rather be a tortoise now.
It's fun.

812
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,606
Then...
Trust me.

813
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:38,383
Pretend to be a tortoise and
let me hit you.

814
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,611
Do it now.

815
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:44,155
Okay, little horn...

816
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,361
Why do you have to force me?

817
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:58,461
Come on, please, hit me.

818
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:00,996
Are you kidding?

819
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:06,436
Please use the terrible one to beat me!

820
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:08,442
Totally, just once.

821
00:52:08,882 --> 00:52:12,682
Then that one. Please. Beat me!

822
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,218
No! I don't feel natural to do it.

823
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:16,979
Hurry! Beat me!

824
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:17,988
OK! I fear nothing.

825
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:21,924
Princess! Please pay attention

826
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:44,510
Silly! Why crying? I'll treat you well.

827
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,015
You couldn't lie to me.

828
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,578
I have make up my mind.

829
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,615
Put on the new clothes,

830
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:55,021
or someone will see you nude.

831
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,265
Jian-Ning, what were you doing?

832
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:06,238
Hide-and-seek.

833
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,132
Ya? Right.

834
00:53:08,175 --> 00:53:11,167
You are naughty by nature.
I don't blame you.

835
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:13,404
Why do you mess around with an eunuch?

836
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:14,741
Although nothing will happen...

837
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:16,974
it's shameful for us if
other people get to know about this.

838
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:24,147
Queen Mother,
I'll never do it again.

839
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:26,415
Don't do it anymore.

840
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,549
I'll leave now.
Stay.

841
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:28,559
What?

842
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:32,521
You'll have to suffer for the Princess.

843
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:34,125
No.

844
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:44,604
Release him,
or I will kill the Princess.

845
00:53:44,711 --> 00:53:47,111
Who are you?
You get into my Palace time after time.

846
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:48,646
Do you know you and your family members
must die for this?

847
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:52,010
You pretend to be the Queen Mother,
you and your family have to die too.

848
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,050
You lie.

849
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,017
I'm not lying.
Last time when I fought with you,

850
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:56,919
I knew you're using the Kung-Fu
of the Dragon Gang.

851
00:53:57,023 --> 00:53:59,617
Why do you come to the Palace?
Tell me!

852
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:01,826
Let's see if you can
force me to tell you.

853
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:13,095
The gold snake trapping
the lion's hands.

854
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:25,280
How dare you fight with me!

855
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:35,689
You're not as experienced as I am.

856
00:54:36,196 --> 00:54:39,188
God, why does it have to
end up like this.

857
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:43,629
Chun, help me kill this evil woman.

858
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:47,169
I've never even killed a chicken.
I can't help you.

859
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,639
How dare you to offend a superior?

860
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:50,437
Chun, take my sword

861
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,807
and pierce his forehead.

862
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,209
I'll make you a major official.

863
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,874
I'll just be happy if you don't kill me.

864
00:54:54,948 --> 00:54:56,848
Making me an official?
I don't trust you.

865
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,344
Don't trust her.

866
00:54:58,552 --> 00:55:01,544
She can't move now or
she'll lose control.

867
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,452
Take that pick
and poke the top part of her head.

868
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:07,220
It's none of my business.
Just pretend you haven't seen me today.

869
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:09,487
Chun, kill her.

870
00:55:09,596 --> 00:55:11,393
If I die

871
00:55:11,498 --> 00:55:13,489
No one can heal you.

872
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:15,728
I'll do it.

873
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:18,930
Baloney! She cannot.

874
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:21,334
His Majesty is arriving!

875
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,504
Under this circumstance,

876
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:27,545
He won't trust you and
will kill you first.

877
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:32,312
Even if I go crazy, I want to kill you!

878
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:35,818
Don't be so impulsive!

879
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:40,316
Cure me first. I'm afraid of you.

880
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,654
Go away!

881
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:43,828
Indeed. I mean it.

882
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:52,403
You...

883
00:55:52,606 --> 00:55:53,903
Not on purpose.

884
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,072
Mother!

885
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:03,972
Your Majesty!

886
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:06,915
I just passed your palace and
I heard the loud sound.

887
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,214
What happened?

888
00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:10,522
There is a assassin in a black suit.

889
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:12,648
This eunuch saved my life.

890
00:56:12,826 --> 00:56:14,225
I'm alright.

891
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,754
Chun! Did you see that assassinator?

892
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:19,692
Did you see him?

893
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:22,028
Yes, but not clearly.

894
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:24,393
The princess was struck and she fainted.

895
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:26,964
Aides! Send for
the doctor for the princess

896
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:28,367
and sound the alarm!

897
00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:29,600
Yes!

898
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:32,944
Mother, you were scared! Have a rest.

899
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:34,207
OK.

900
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,773
You don't have to help me!

901
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:41,853
Find anything?
Not yet.

902
00:56:41,988 --> 00:56:45,389
Go to watch Hai-Da-Fu at once. Quick!

903
00:56:52,832 --> 00:56:56,427
Please. Lord Hai, even if you die,

904
00:56:57,003 --> 00:57:00,097
don't scare me like that. Please!

905
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,252
It's not my concern

906
00:57:16,423 --> 00:57:18,721
You should go to Queen Mother
or anyone else.

907
00:57:18,825 --> 00:57:19,917
Not me.

908
00:57:20,026 --> 00:57:21,516
Every year, in July the 14th,
I will burn paper money for you.

909
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:23,060
You should go to your enemy, not me.

910
00:57:23,163 --> 00:57:25,256
Indeed it's not my concern.

911
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:28,459
Penis! You are the penis.

912
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,060
Here! Penis!

913
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:32,770
Your tongue is like that, right?

914
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,271
No! It's the way you look.

915
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,967
Lord, you said my tongue
looks like a penis, I don't care.

916
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,807
But my look, I could not agree with it.

917
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:43,581
Nonsense. Is he crazy?

918
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:45,981
Penis!

919
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:47,847
You want to find that! Follow me.

920
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:53,186
Here it is.

921
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:55,193
No! It's here.

922
00:57:55,695 --> 00:57:56,787
Here!

923
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,622
You drink it now. And you'll have one.

924
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:04,266
And I fetched some medicine for you.

925
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:07,067
After that,
it will become as big as pomegranate!

926
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,966
So big?
This Big!

927
00:58:12,178 --> 00:58:13,076
Great!

928
00:58:19,919 --> 00:58:21,511
Escape is the best policy.

929
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:26,751
Finished. But I don't have that.
Where is the penis?

930
00:58:27,027 --> 00:58:29,325
You said there's medicine for me.
Give me that. Hurry!

931
00:58:29,396 --> 00:58:32,490
Hurry up! Give me that.

932
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,260
Here it is!
No! That is the powder.

933
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:36,494
Lord!

934
00:58:51,384 --> 00:58:52,874
Is he crazy?

935
00:59:04,664 --> 00:59:05,562
Lord! Lord!

936
00:59:11,604 --> 00:59:13,401
Lord! Are you all right?

937
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,734
I'm asking you.

938
00:59:14,908 --> 00:59:17,103
Why imitate me?

939
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,641
So obedient.

940
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,115
I make a killing now.

941
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:32,688
Please heal me.
I was hit by De-Bone Palm.

942
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:33,986
No...

943
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:37,188
I'll heal you.

944
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:40,326
Let you be healthy again.

945
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:45,434
Your Majesty please forgive me.

946
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:46,766
What do you want to tell me?

947
00:59:47,674 --> 00:59:50,074
I follow Ha was ordered by Your Majesty.

948
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:51,575
He discovered my plan.

949
00:59:52,278 --> 00:59:53,472
How could that happen?

950
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,447
He heard me talking about my plan
when I was asleep.

951
00:59:56,516 --> 00:59:57,813
He tried to kill me.

952
00:59:57,884 --> 01:00:00,580
Fortunately, I was calling Your
Majesty's name when I fought with him.

953
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,621
I hit him on his weakest spot.

954
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:07,886
Now Ha turned mad,
please forgive me Your Majesty.

955
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:11,491
How dare you.

956
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:13,555
Yes, I'm daring.

957
01:00:15,535 --> 01:00:17,127
You dared to disguise as an eunuch
to cheat me?

958
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:19,034
I dare not.
Lie!

959
01:00:19,272 --> 01:00:21,570
I saw the record.
Your name was not on it.

960
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:24,108
Nor the snipping record.
Where are you from?

961
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:28,341
To tell you the truth. I was forced.

962
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:30,910
I came here to apply for servant
in the kitchen.

963
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,076
Yet, when Lord-Hai saw me,

964
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:33,551
I don't know why,

965
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:35,677
he forced me to be an eunuch.

966
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:38,080
I didn't cheat you on purpose.

967
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:42,684
OK! Stand.

968
01:00:43,396 --> 01:00:44,693
Thank you, Your Majesty.

969
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:47,396
Tell me the truth,

970
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:50,525
are you snipped?

971
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:52,663
No!

972
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:56,834
Good deeds good ends.

973
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:59,274
All are just.

974
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:00,811
I caught your penis by mistake.

975
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:02,108
Now you catch me,

976
01:01:02,248 --> 01:01:04,648
this is meaningful.

977
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:08,252
I admire Your Majesty like the river,

978
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:09,480
that never ends.

979
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:12,819
It's like the Yellow River.
No one can stop it from flooding.

980
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:13,890
That's enough.

981
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:16,584
You grabbed me last time.
Now I repay you with this.

982
01:01:16,763 --> 01:01:18,560
Now we are even.

983
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,798
Thank Your Majesty for grabbing me.

984
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:22,228
It's fine that you're not a eunuch.

985
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:24,265
Accoring to tradition

986
01:01:24,504 --> 01:01:26,495
Eunuchs cannot intervene in politics.

987
01:01:26,706 --> 01:01:29,504
Now I can make you an official.

988
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:30,935
What is your name.

989
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:35,940
My name is Wei-Shew-Bao.
I'm from the capital city.

990
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,440
Auo-Bye killed Sony.

991
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:39,807
What?

992
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:43,116
Auo-Bye is always pushing me.

993
01:01:44,023 --> 01:01:48,016
Now I'm pushed to the corner.

994
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:52,459
I won't forgive Auo-Bye.

995
01:01:52,632 --> 01:01:54,327
Auo-Bye has the most powerful troops.

996
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,732
If I do anything openly,
I'm afraid he will...

997
01:01:57,003 --> 01:01:58,197
overthrow the Court.

998
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:01,171
But he can't get his troops to
accompany him every day.

999
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,705
I can attack him when he's alone.

1000
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:05,805
That's what I was thinking.

1001
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:07,769
Duo Long...

1002
01:02:07,914 --> 01:02:09,211
Your Majesty.

1003
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,277
Where did you come from?

1004
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:13,148
It's a secret. Why should I tell you?

1005
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:14,151
You're right.

1006
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:17,188
Duo long is a loyal guard.

1007
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:18,517
Wei-Shew-Bao is...

1008
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:21,983
My dear friend.

1009
01:02:22,528 --> 01:02:23,825
I've asked you both to come here

1010
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:27,062
to discuss how to...

1011
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:31,659
create some opportunities for you
to kill Auo-Bye.

1012
01:02:34,474 --> 01:02:35,668
Are you scared?

1013
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:39,777
No... not scared.

1014
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:42,346
If other people know about
what happened today

1015
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,040
You two have to die.

1016
01:02:44,183 --> 01:02:46,174
I've already asked Auo-Bye
to go to my study room.

1017
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:49,077
Think about how to kill him.

1018
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:58,057
We copy Jing-Ke's way,

1019
01:02:58,097 --> 01:03:01,191
wrap a knife in a map and kill him
when presenting it.

1020
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:12,302
Or give him a drink.

1021
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:20,284
If he won't die by that,

1022
01:03:20,453 --> 01:03:23,445
use 12 great Kung-Fu masters
in an ambushment,

1023
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:24,888
and kill him.

1024
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:27,925
His Kung-Fu is wonderful.
I'm afraid it won't work.

1025
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:32,257
Not really. I set up a trap.

1026
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:46,743
OK!

1027
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,872
And still we have a great master.

1028
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:50,347
Who?

1029
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:52,313
The sick Lord Hai.

1030
01:03:52,485 --> 01:03:53,474
Lord Hai!

1031
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,917
He went crazy copying
my every movement.

1032
01:03:55,989 --> 01:03:57,081
We can disguise him

1033
01:03:57,223 --> 01:03:59,623
to kill Au-Bye.

1034
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,258
Disguise whom?

1035
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,221
Guan!

1036
01:04:06,432 --> 01:04:10,334
Invite Ao-Bye here,
sentence him for treason

1037
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,768
ask him to kneel before Guan to swear.

1038
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:16,033
He makes oaths randomly, like farts!

1039
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:17,234
If he won't kneel, it's ok.

1040
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:22,679
If he does, I kill him.

1041
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,247
No!

1042
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:31,913
You scared me.

1043
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,352
You have my permission.
Start tomorrow. Kill Ao-Bye.

1044
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:39,430
Thank Your Majesty.

1045
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:45,160
Lord Wei, you look painful.

1046
01:04:45,705 --> 01:04:48,196
His Majesty caught me 4 times
and hit 8 times.

1047
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:53,843
You can stand it.
You are really something.

1048
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,679
My admiration for you is like

1049
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:59,081
the River, never ends.

1050
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:02,210
Like the Yellow River,
couldn't to be stopped.

1051
01:05:04,991 --> 01:05:06,390
I want to do this...

1052
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:10,728
to burn yellow paper
to become blood brothers.

1053
01:05:13,232 --> 01:05:14,927
Good brother.

1054
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:16,863
Buy some roasted pork and chicken.

1055
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:19,337
Isn't it better to ask a lady
to buy roasted pork?

1056
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,423
Lord Auo-Bye has arrived.

1057
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,126
Auo-Bye,
the Emperor would like to see you.

1058
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:52,096
Your Majesty.

1059
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:56,140
What may I do for Your Majesty?

1060
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:57,670
Sit down.

1061
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:05,008
The boundary between my country and
Russia has always been unclear.

1062
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:07,048
They have sent us a map recently.

1063
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,511
We have to decide
where to put the boundary.

1064
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:11,884
I'd like to have your advice.

1065
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,657
I'd like to see the map first.

1066
01:06:17,864 --> 01:06:20,162
There is no need to hurry.

1067
01:06:20,633 --> 01:06:22,032
Give him some wine.

1068
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:35,710
Auo-Bye,
this is the map sent by the Russians.

1069
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:38,077
Take a look.

1070
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:58,061
Historically, this kind of plan
has proved a failure.

1071
01:06:58,371 --> 01:06:59,770
I can't believe it.

1072
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:03,031
His Majesty has employed a dumb plan.

1073
01:07:05,344 --> 01:07:08,245
You dared to despise me!

1074
01:07:08,748 --> 01:07:10,648
Sheesh! You have trouble.
Don't you know that?

1075
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,645
Do you know? What did you drink?

1076
01:07:13,753 --> 01:07:17,655
I used kung-fu to protect myself
from the poison in the wine.

1077
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,215
You try.

1078
01:07:25,998 --> 01:07:28,193
Help me! Antidote!

1079
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:31,835
Start the device.

1080
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:37,474
Oh, fudge!

1081
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:41,275
Locked him!
Now I won't feel so frightened.

1082
01:07:43,115 --> 01:07:44,412
Help! Your Majesty.

1083
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:50,218
Normally speaking.
I should die, if you want me to.

1084
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,890
But you treated me this way,
it's not just.

1085
01:07:56,829 --> 01:07:58,729
You...

1086
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:01,565
How daring you are.
Knowing your Kung-Fu is good,

1087
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,066
I'd like to examine it.

1088
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:06,060
You dared to talk to me like that!

1089
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:09,397
Examine my Kung-Fu?

1090
01:08:09,942 --> 01:08:11,034
Surely.

1091
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:15,103
Fine. Since you said "you are loyal".

1092
01:08:15,748 --> 01:08:19,240
Kneel before Guan to make an oath.

1093
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:20,817
Promise me of your loyalty.

1094
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:22,610
Sure.

1095
01:08:31,297 --> 01:08:34,892
Ao-Bye will be loyal to the country
till I die.

1096
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:38,493
If I lie to you, I'll be hit by thunder.

1097
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:53,383
Guan's spirit appears!

1098
01:08:53,886 --> 01:08:56,480
He's snorting. Heard that?

1099
01:09:00,693 --> 01:09:02,593
Cut!

1100
01:09:13,272 --> 01:09:15,570
13 bodyguards practice Golden Cover.

1101
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:21,776
Protection!

1102
01:09:25,251 --> 01:09:26,946
Protection!

1103
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:46,503
It seems they won't die from being hit.

1104
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:48,672
13 bodyguards practice Golden Cover.

1105
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,298
Invulnerable.

1106
01:09:50,776 --> 01:09:52,073
Then, no one could defeat him?

1107
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:54,602
Attack his under part! Open his legs.

1108
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:56,413
Are you crazy?

1109
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:24,205
Chun!

1110
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,801
Don't mind me! Fight him first. Coming!

1111
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:43,019
Go to hell!

1112
01:10:43,062 --> 01:10:45,860
The ultimate Golden Cover technique,
"Draw back the penis!"

1113
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:52,469
De-bone palm.

1114
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:02,043
Protect His Majesty!

1115
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:04,205
Your Majesty,
please forgive me for being late.

1116
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,542
Still so talkative!

1117
01:11:05,684 --> 01:11:07,584
I protect Your Majesty all the time.

1118
01:11:15,528 --> 01:11:17,519
De-bone palm.

1119
01:11:24,403 --> 01:11:26,894
Penis!

1120
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:34,735
Protection!

1121
01:11:37,616 --> 01:11:38,412
Protection!

1122
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:42,279
Protection!

1123
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:50,590
Save His Majesty!
Penis!

1124
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:53,520
Wait for me!

1125
01:11:58,771 --> 01:12:00,170
No! You cannot kill me.

1126
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:03,468
Under this circumstance,
I have to tell you the truth.

1127
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:06,841
I am your son. Father!

1128
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:08,106
Catch breast Dragon Hand!

1129
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:21,055
Help! Ao-Bye rebels.

1130
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:25,923
Aides! Damn! Where are they going?
Help!

1131
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:29,163
Fire! Put out the fire, quickly!

1132
01:12:31,103 --> 01:12:35,301
Queen Mother! Help! Help!

1133
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:39,202
So brave. I didn't go to see you,

1134
01:12:39,378 --> 01:12:40,868
you ask for it?

1135
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:43,947
Listen to me, Ao-Bye rebelled.

1136
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:46,276
He killed His Majesty!
He is looking for you.

1137
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:48,843
He said he'll rape you before
killing you. Rape then kill!

1138
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:50,386
What did you say?

1139
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,359
Queen Mother, don't mind me,
you go first.

1140
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:24,481
Silk!

1141
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:47,842
Protect!

1142
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:54,248
Protect! Queen Mother!

1143
01:13:57,089 --> 01:13:58,181
Bao!

1144
01:14:01,493 --> 01:14:02,391
Are you OK?

1145
01:14:02,528 --> 01:14:04,325
Your Majesty! After the hard fighting.

1146
01:14:04,463 --> 01:14:07,159
I defeated Ao-Bye, the traitor
to keep Queen Mother safe.

1147
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:09,257
Even if I die, I feel content.

1148
01:14:09,368 --> 01:14:10,266
Are you hurt?

1149
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:13,169
Inside! lf you give me millions of money

1150
01:14:13,238 --> 01:14:15,331
to buy medicine,
then I will be all right.

1151
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:16,771
Put Ao-Bye into prison!
Yeah!

1152
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:18,206
Mother!

1153
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:23,037
It's my fault to have frightened you.

1154
01:14:23,849 --> 01:14:26,443
Fortunately, Bo save my life.

1155
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:30,487
Or I would have been
killed by the traitor.

1156
01:14:30,756 --> 01:14:32,246
My duty!

1157
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:36,617
You deserve great credit, again.

1158
01:14:37,463 --> 01:14:40,660
What a pity! His is an eunuch,
and cannot be an official.

1159
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:43,993
Indeed, he is not.

1160
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:46,527
He is my spy for investigating Ha-Da-Fu.

1161
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:48,538
He is a man.

1162
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:51,803
He didn't cheat you on purpose.

1163
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,708
For this sake,
please forgive him.

1164
01:14:55,147 --> 01:14:56,637
Then, Lord Wei can become an official!

1165
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:00,050
Wei-Shew-Bo. Listen your title!
Yeah!

1166
01:15:00,252 --> 01:15:02,152
Titled as a failed Scholar.

1167
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:05,155
Gift yellow suit.
Responsible for killing Ao-Bye's family.

1168
01:15:05,724 --> 01:15:08,318
Duo-Lung, you assist him.

1169
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:10,191
Thank Your Majesty!

1170
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:39,188
Worry about the country, and feel sad.

1171
01:15:42,261 --> 01:15:44,252
Lord, don't cry
just because of singing badly.

1172
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:47,397
Suck egg! I cried for I felt sad.

1173
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:48,693
Ao-Bye, the traitor robbed

1174
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:50,131
so many things from our people.

1175
01:15:50,302 --> 01:15:52,896
I cried for the country and
for the people.

1176
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:57,636
Lord Wei, you are so great.

1177
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,802
Lord Duo!

1178
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:04,778
Primarily counting,

1179
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:07,374
his property is worth 380,000 totally.

1180
01:16:09,154 --> 01:16:12,055
This traitor grafted so much money.

1181
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:14,386
I hate that most in my life.

1182
01:16:14,493 --> 01:16:17,894
I'll report to Your Majesty to kill him.

1183
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,859
Lord, I read it wrong.

1184
01:16:23,068 --> 01:16:26,560
It should be 3,800,000.

1185
01:16:27,973 --> 01:16:33,172
Hatred, deep like sea... Unforgettable!

1186
01:16:33,312 --> 01:16:34,711
I'll report to Your Majesty.

1187
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,973
To cheat people,
just like the old Ming dynasty.

1188
01:16:37,116 --> 01:16:38,310
Do you know how to do it?

1189
01:16:38,517 --> 01:16:39,814
How?

1190
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,618
First, bury the man in the sand.

1191
01:16:44,156 --> 01:16:46,056
Keep his head above ground,

1192
01:16:46,358 --> 01:16:49,156
then use a knife to slice his head.

1193
01:16:49,328 --> 01:16:50,522
Open his head,

1194
01:16:50,763 --> 01:16:53,561
put cement in.

1195
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:56,700
Then, he will feel unbearably itchy!

1196
01:16:57,136 --> 01:16:58,330
So what?

1197
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:00,132
Then,
he'll try to find a hole desperately.

1198
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:01,364
Coincidentally, there's a hole on
the head. No skin on it.

1199
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,338
Shoot!

1200
01:17:02,474 --> 01:17:04,066
It comes out!

1201
01:17:04,476 --> 01:17:09,175
I don't know when
I can fulfil this ambition.

1202
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:11,212
Feeling itchy?

1203
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:16,711
Yes. Lord. I counted carefully.

1204
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:21,182
In sum it's 13,800,000.

1205
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,390
Still some are not listed.

1206
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:25,555
I suggest to send these to your place.

1207
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,622
After counting, then present it.

1208
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,789
Fine.

1209
01:17:32,504 --> 01:17:33,801
Why are so many people kneel here?

1210
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:36,270
They're all Ao-Bye's wives.

1211
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:42,942
So young? Must have been
taken by force! What a pity.

1212
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,040
I know she needs sleep.

1213
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,278
Send her to my place to sleep with me
for 2 nights.

1214
01:17:51,924 --> 01:17:53,323
Ao-Bye was cruel!

1215
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:55,017
You see.
Beat her face to swell like this.

1216
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,060
Send her to my house. I will heal her.

1217
01:17:59,798 --> 01:18:01,288
Golden Hair Lion King?

1218
01:18:02,034 --> 01:18:04,525
Ao-Bye's betrayal must be influenced
by this spy.

1219
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:06,433
Send her to my place. I'll torture her.

1220
01:18:09,074 --> 01:18:11,269
Even a black one. This one, too.

1221
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:14,101
Even a black one couldn't escape.
They're all the same in the dark.

1222
01:18:17,282 --> 01:18:18,374
Ao-Bye, the sleaseball.

1223
01:18:18,517 --> 01:18:20,917
From 8 to 80,
he wanted them all.

1224
01:18:20,986 --> 01:18:23,386
Lord! A mistake. She's

1225
01:18:23,488 --> 01:18:25,581
his mother! I don't want them all.

1226
01:18:26,258 --> 01:18:27,452
Send her to your place.

1227
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:28,615
What for?

1228
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,159
An old woman
in a family is like a treasure.

1229
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:33,127
Send you the treasure.
You should treat me to midnight snack.

1230
01:18:33,465 --> 01:18:34,557
OK!

1231
01:18:34,933 --> 01:18:36,230
Why ok? I'll beat you.

1232
01:18:39,271 --> 01:18:41,364
Lord Wei, in Ao-Bye's storage,

1233
01:18:41,473 --> 01:18:43,964
A gun and a silk vest were found.

1234
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:47,235
Invulnerable vest

1235
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,878
and a gun.

1236
01:18:51,149 --> 01:18:53,140
You use this gun to shoot the vest,

1237
01:18:53,352 --> 01:18:54,842
what'll happen?

1238
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,818
It's simple.
A brave soldier wears this vest.

1239
01:18:57,956 --> 01:19:00,049
Then you shoot. The answer will be clear.

1240
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:01,651
That's right.

1241
01:19:06,064 --> 01:19:07,964
Lord! Aim on target.

1242
01:19:13,038 --> 01:19:14,027
Lord,

1243
01:19:14,206 --> 01:19:16,504
in his secret room
a "42 Chapter Classic" was found.

1244
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:24,679
This is not!

1245
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:26,273
It's "Chin-Kang Classic". Understand?

1246
01:19:26,385 --> 01:19:27,283
Yes. Lord.

1247
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:28,716
I'll take it back for my mother.

1248
01:19:30,822 --> 01:19:32,221
It's really on target!

1249
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:33,856
Yes, Lord.

1250
01:19:34,026 --> 01:19:36,722
That shot hit Duo-Lung.

1251
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:41,832
Even the vest is not reliable.

1252
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:43,366
Bury him for me.

1253
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:44,433
I know what to do.

1254
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:46,198
And, don't mess things around.

1255
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:47,568
In two more days, I'll kill them all.

1256
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:48,831
Yes. Lord.

1257
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:54,139
Bao!

1258
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:56,510
Lord Wei!
Let me tell her something! Excuse me!

1259
01:19:56,648 --> 01:19:58,047
Give me a little space!

1260
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,150
Bao, you've become an official, right?

1261
01:20:00,485 --> 01:20:02,885
Yes. And grafted away millions of money.

1262
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:08,224
But now I have to run away!

1263
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:09,919
I'm here to take you with me.

1264
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:15,296
Sister!

1265
01:20:16,268 --> 01:20:19,169
Fainted! Not dead yet!
Find someone to save her.

1266
01:20:19,304 --> 01:20:20,396
Bao!

1267
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:22,572
Too close!
I couldn't recognize who he is.

1268
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,205
Master! Why you?

1269
01:20:28,146 --> 01:20:30,740
I know what you did in the palace.

1270
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:33,078
I don't quite understand.

1271
01:20:33,352 --> 01:20:35,752
Between your eyebrows, there's black hair.
Are you poisonous?

1272
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:39,015
Yes. Slow De-Bone Palm! So sad!

1273
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:43,618
Master! Help me!

1274
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:56,501
What?

1275
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:57,835
Cured!

1276
01:21:01,013 --> 01:21:03,709
I knew that you could. Thanks Master.

1277
01:21:03,849 --> 01:21:05,339
Go back with me
I got something to tell you.

1278
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:09,853
I Chang-Chin-Nan as the Chief General

1279
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:13,721
Now promote Wei-Shew-Bao to be the chief
of Greenwood Party.

1280
01:21:14,026 --> 01:21:15,823
Congratulations to ChiefWei...

1281
01:21:16,061 --> 01:21:17,050
Greenwood Chief.

1282
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:20,158
This is the official plate of
the Greenwood Party.

1283
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,734
Chief Wei has caught our enemy Auo-Bye.

1284
01:21:24,803 --> 01:21:26,202
He's now in prison.

1285
01:21:26,638 --> 01:21:27,832
But I've heard that...

1286
01:21:28,073 --> 01:21:31,167
Auo-Bye's disciples and seven monks
will come to rescue him.

1287
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,805
Chief Wei must do something first.

1288
01:21:34,146 --> 01:21:36,137
Auo-Bye must be killed

1289
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:38,781
and the king of Chin Dynasty.

1290
01:21:38,817 --> 01:21:42,514
They must both be killed.

1291
01:21:42,654 --> 01:21:43,552
That's right.

1292
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:45,986
Yet, my power is limited.

1293
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:48,181
You suck!

1294
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,554
Collect so much money.

1295
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,856
Now you have money and women.
You should do something.

1296
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:54,056
I have some money! Just for a living!

1297
01:21:54,132 --> 01:21:55,929
But no women.

1298
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:58,466
Come out!
Who's that?

1299
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:05,908
Shuang!

1300
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:07,238
They're twin sisters!

1301
01:22:07,412 --> 01:22:08,504
Connected together when born.

1302
01:22:09,114 --> 01:22:13,608
After magic doctor's operation,
separated them.

1303
01:22:13,685 --> 01:22:15,585
So, their every movement,
even their speech, are the same.

1304
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,517
Eating, sleeping together.

1305
01:22:17,956 --> 01:22:19,355
Even fighting,

1306
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:22,389
better than two people.

1307
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:25,226
Now, I give them to you to protect you.

1308
01:22:25,764 --> 01:22:29,063
To help you to kill Ao-Bye and
the Emperor.

1309
01:22:29,935 --> 01:22:31,630
Master! Let's have a chat there.

1310
01:22:32,838 --> 01:22:35,432
Obviously, you appoint them to spy on me!

1311
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:38,065
Frankly, you have half and me, too.

1312
01:22:38,176 --> 01:22:39,973
Don't ask me to go into the palace again.

1313
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,104
Or you sixty percent, me 40.

1314
01:22:43,515 --> 01:22:46,507
Want 70 to 30? Too greedy!

1315
01:22:47,652 --> 01:22:51,554
You meant 20 and 80?
Where's your humanity!

1316
01:22:52,157 --> 01:22:54,455
Is that 10 and 90?
I'd rather go to the palace!

1317
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:56,493
You said that, not me.

1318
01:22:59,397 --> 01:23:02,093
Buddy! Assemble all the members.

1319
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,098
Tomorrow, midnight, outside the door.

1320
01:23:05,203 --> 01:23:07,194
Wei uses firework as his signal.

1321
01:23:07,339 --> 01:23:09,432
Then we invade the palace and

1322
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:11,906
kill Ao-Bye and the Emperor.

1323
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,501
Decapitate him.

1324
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:18,313
Oh, fudge!

1325
01:23:22,888 --> 01:23:25,379
I promised I won't escape.
Why tie me up?

1326
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:28,584
We went in. By the way,
do you trust me?

1327
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,852
Please respect yourself.

1328
01:23:29,995 --> 01:23:32,896
If you will, I'll untie you.

1329
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:34,787
Wei-Shew-Bao, nickname,

1330
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:37,161
Mr "Keep A Promise".

1331
01:23:37,235 --> 01:23:39,032
Honest and reliable. I'm no phony.

1332
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,698
I follow my words, people know that.

1333
01:23:41,873 --> 01:23:42,669
OK!

1334
01:23:51,049 --> 01:23:53,540
You don't want to let me free
because you're loyal.

1335
01:23:53,685 --> 01:23:55,778
And you have to prove me that to me.

1336
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:57,413
What?

1337
01:23:57,822 --> 01:23:59,813
I want to know
do you have mental telepathy.

1338
01:23:59,925 --> 01:24:02,325
You feel itchy, then you feel painful!
You, painful, then you get impulsive.

1339
01:24:04,829 --> 01:24:06,922
Saying it is useless.

1340
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:08,526
Want to try?

1341
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:11,065
OK! You sit here. Don't move!

1342
01:24:11,469 --> 01:24:15,872
You come up with me. Don't move!

1343
01:24:28,353 --> 01:24:29,650
No! Sir!

1344
01:24:37,195 --> 01:24:39,186
No! No!
Real!

1345
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:45,799
Harder! Harder! No stop!

1346
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:51,876
Harder! Harder! No stop!

1347
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:53,404
It's the right time.

1348
01:24:53,545 --> 01:24:54,842
Don't stop!

1349
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:09,689
I proved it.

1350
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:11,556
You have mental telepathy.

1351
01:25:11,596 --> 01:25:14,087
And my Dragon Hand is

1352
01:25:14,266 --> 01:25:16,166
without fall.

1353
01:25:19,537 --> 01:25:22,131
The meaning General Chief
handed us to you.

1354
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:25,832
Indicates that we are yours.
Please treat us with respect.

1355
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:28,969
After Ming's restorations,
we'll marry to you.

1356
01:25:33,585 --> 01:25:34,779
Why didn't say that at the beginning?

1357
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,113
Sit here! Don't move!

1358
01:25:37,289 --> 01:25:40,690
I do another experiment! For study!

1359
01:25:40,759 --> 01:25:41,657
Bao!

1360
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:43,120
Who is that?

1361
01:25:43,295 --> 01:25:44,785
Bao, where are you?

1362
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:49,065
Emperor's sister! Hide! Quickly!

1363
01:25:49,534 --> 01:25:50,728
Remember! Don't make noise.

1364
01:25:57,809 --> 01:26:01,802
Bao-Bao! You hid here.

1365
01:26:05,483 --> 01:26:08,077
Where have you been? Don't mind me.

1366
01:26:09,354 --> 01:26:10,844
I'm busy.

1367
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:15,522
I took tigers' Penises and

1368
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,551
cooked soup for you.
Really?

1369
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:23,058
OK! Let me use my hand
to take your bowl and drink.

1370
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:29,766
Left! Right! Forward! That's it! Thanks.

1371
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,338
No thanks!

1372
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,607
House is big it echoes.

1373
01:26:33,945 --> 01:26:35,344
Naughty!

1374
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:44,546
Wait for it to cool.

1375
01:26:46,691 --> 01:26:47,885
You may drink it.

1376
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:51,785
OK! I take my bowl.

1377
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,066
Why put that on your head! What a waste!

1378
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:01,369
No! I'm kinky. So I make my neck harder.

1379
01:27:02,741 --> 01:27:03,833
Baloney!

1380
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:07,842
Finished? I give it to you.

1381
01:27:11,015 --> 01:27:12,812
You are a duke now.

1382
01:27:13,385 --> 01:27:15,785
Tell my brother about the marriage.

1383
01:27:16,554 --> 01:27:18,044
Don't you remember

1384
01:27:18,223 --> 01:27:20,817
we had sex that night!

1385
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:22,954
You want to deny it?

1386
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,756
I'll ask him to execute you!

1387
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,796
You don't have to.
Why not?

1388
01:27:29,234 --> 01:27:30,531
You have other women!

1389
01:27:30,635 --> 01:27:32,626
No! Are you crazy? Except for you.

1390
01:27:32,804 --> 01:27:35,500
Other women to me, are shit!

1391
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:40,340
What are you doing?

1392
01:27:40,745 --> 01:27:42,440
There's a mosquito.
Mosquito?

1393
01:27:42,614 --> 01:27:45,515
If you have the guts, fly to my chest!
I'll kill you!

1394
01:27:45,617 --> 01:27:47,812
That should scare it. Come here!

1395
01:27:48,586 --> 01:27:51,487
Why not mention this to my brother?

1396
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:54,988
You vomited blood!

1397
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:58,025
Hot inside!
Hot inside?

1398
01:27:59,063 --> 01:28:01,554
Of course! Three penis soup causes this.

1399
01:28:02,233 --> 01:28:04,633
You incriminated me!...

1400
01:28:04,736 --> 01:28:06,033
No more talking!

1401
01:28:06,304 --> 01:28:08,602
Fetch a cup of cool tea for me.

1402
01:28:08,706 --> 01:28:11,402
Go! I'm vomiting to death!

1403
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,678
No more beating! Or I'll die.

1404
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,110
You are so bad.

1405
01:28:20,885 --> 01:28:22,477
You hide two women here!

1406
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:23,884
I asked Queen Mother to kill you!

1407
01:28:24,222 --> 01:28:25,018
Trace!

1408
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:33,563
With that lousy Kung-Fu,
you want to fight with me!

1409
01:28:40,004 --> 01:28:41,198
Two against one! Not a hero?

1410
01:28:41,339 --> 01:28:42,237
No more quarrels!

1411
01:28:42,373 --> 01:28:44,364
Queen Mother invited Lord Wei.

1412
01:28:48,413 --> 01:28:49,607
Catch her. Put on the bed.

1413
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,342
What for?

1414
01:28:54,552 --> 01:28:56,247
Lord Wei, Queen Mother invited you!

1415
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:58,480
Again? lf nothing important...

1416
01:28:58,656 --> 01:29:00,647
Queen Mother ordered it.
If you don't go, we'll bring you

1417
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:02,783
by force!

1418
01:29:04,195 --> 01:29:05,184
Wait a moment!

1419
01:29:08,099 --> 01:29:09,088
What's the matter?

1420
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,895
Those two outside have good Kung-Fu,

1421
01:29:11,035 --> 01:29:12,832
don't risk it!
What should we do?

1422
01:29:13,104 --> 01:29:14,901
I'll go with them and will be back soon.

1423
01:29:15,006 --> 01:29:16,200
Sir, be careful.

1424
01:29:16,808 --> 01:29:17,900
Watch her carefully.

1425
01:29:28,887 --> 01:29:31,481
Wei-Shew-Bao asks after Queen Mother.

1426
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:32,778
Queen Mother!

1427
01:29:32,891 --> 01:29:34,188
Congratulation! Duk Wei.

1428
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:37,893
You've searched Ao-Bye's family, you must
have some treasures in your house.

1429
01:29:39,063 --> 01:29:42,157
I'm loyal to the country,
I'd never do things like that.

1430
01:29:42,267 --> 01:29:45,168
If I took any money from Ao-Bye,

1431
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:47,031
I'll be seized to death by Ao-Bye.

1432
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,833
If it were not me,

1433
01:29:51,009 --> 01:29:52,499
you would be killed by him.

1434
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:56,009
Queen Mother's Kung-Fu is second to
none. And I'll never forget your favor.

1435
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,274
The "42 Chapter Classic" of Ao-Bye

1436
01:29:59,384 --> 01:30:00,874
is now in your hands, right?

1437
01:30:01,386 --> 01:30:03,183
What's that?

1438
01:30:04,489 --> 01:30:06,980
Don't play around with me!

1439
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:10,693
You and Hai Da-Fu made a plan

1440
01:30:10,795 --> 01:30:13,491
to steal the "42 Chapter Classic"
of Red Banner.

1441
01:30:13,631 --> 01:30:15,622
And I know His Majesty gave

1442
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,098
the book for White Banner to you.

1443
01:30:18,336 --> 01:30:20,429
Now in National House, I found nothing,

1444
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:22,665
no "42 Chapter Classic" for Blue Banner.

1445
01:30:22,941 --> 01:30:24,238
It must be you.

1446
01:30:24,876 --> 01:30:26,366
Except one for Yellow Banner

1447
01:30:26,511 --> 01:30:29,002
in Wu-Shang Kuei's hand.

1448
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,871
Among of these four books,
you've got three of them.

1449
01:30:32,584 --> 01:30:35,678
You must know the secret exactly.

1450
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:39,922
It's hard to understand!
Could you please repeat it?

1451
01:30:43,962 --> 01:30:45,156
What are you doing?

1452
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:51,324
Right sole,"Chin-Ming". Left "Anti-For".

1453
01:30:51,502 --> 01:30:53,299
Do you want to deny
you are a member of the TDA?

1454
01:30:53,438 --> 01:30:54,530
Queen Mother! Don't be angry!

1455
01:30:55,907 --> 01:30:58,398
Yes, I am!

1456
01:30:58,943 --> 01:31:01,241
But, you are a member of the Dragon Gang.

1457
01:31:01,346 --> 01:31:02,540
In fact, we don't have to uncover it.

1458
01:31:02,714 --> 01:31:05,615
But you spoke out so loudly, it stand
to reason you want me to tell them this?

1459
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:07,483
To tell whom?

1460
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:09,016
If I kill you,

1461
01:31:09,387 --> 01:31:11,287
are you going to turn up
in His Majesty dreams?

1462
01:31:12,557 --> 01:31:15,754
No! lf you want,
you'll kill me at the beginning.

1463
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,158
I want to know the whereabouts of
the three books? Talk!

1464
01:31:20,365 --> 01:31:22,060
I followed you knowing.

1465
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:25,064
You hid them in Li-Chun-House

1466
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:27,066
and met Chang-Chin-Nan.

1467
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:29,469
I took them away.

1468
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:32,132
Took them! Then, that's fine!

1469
01:31:32,243 --> 01:31:34,438
Excuse me! I'm leaving.

1470
01:31:38,883 --> 01:31:40,976
Do you thing I didn't read
"42 Chapter Classic"?

1471
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:43,815
You and His Majesty's books,
I've read a hundred times!

1472
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:46,183
Still,
I don't know what the secret is.

1473
01:31:46,491 --> 01:31:47,583
Yet, if you let out the secret,

1474
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:50,018
I may spare your life.

1475
01:31:50,828 --> 01:31:54,127
Now then, you'd better kill me.

1476
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:57,163
But, remember! I'm a Duke.

1477
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:59,226
More than 90,000 people know I'm here.

1478
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:01,032
And your daughter,
Jian-Ning Princess, too.

1479
01:32:01,506 --> 01:32:03,804
Kill me! They'll suspect you!

1480
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,365
Should I believe what you said?

1481
01:32:05,643 --> 01:32:07,042
Then, bet on it.

1482
01:32:08,413 --> 01:32:12,008
Don't worry! Today is the feast day
of the Dragon Gang,

1483
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:13,811
So we don't kill anyone today.

1484
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:15,577
You should say that at the start.

1485
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,518
You scared me to death! You are really...

1486
01:32:18,856 --> 01:32:22,348
But I know someone
who would be glad to kill you.

1487
01:32:27,298 --> 01:32:29,095
Speak out! What's the secret?

1488
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:32,329
What's what? I don't know.

1489
01:32:32,437 --> 01:32:35,133
Don't know?
You want to go to hell to talk to him?

1490
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:38,839
No! We have nothing to talk about.

1491
01:32:40,044 --> 01:32:42,239
You could try to be more cultivated.

1492
01:32:50,154 --> 01:32:51,348
Please don't kill me!

1493
01:32:53,758 --> 01:32:55,658
I'm going to kill you, bastard!

1494
01:32:56,461 --> 01:32:57,758
I'll kill you!

1495
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:01,688
Kill you!

1496
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:03,630
Here! Come over!

1497
01:33:05,269 --> 01:33:07,760
Kill you!
Kill me! I'm waiting.

1498
01:33:08,106 --> 01:33:09,698
Push me around?

1499
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:11,297
You think I'm afraid of
your "drawing back"?

1500
01:33:11,509 --> 01:33:13,704
If you have the guts,
draw it and put it in your mouth.

1501
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:16,905
You S.O.B. without humanity! Eat shit!

1502
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:18,173
Later on!

1503
01:33:18,316 --> 01:33:19,806
I'll choke you with that!

1504
01:33:19,951 --> 01:33:21,851
Your father be prostituted!
Mother got sexual disease!

1505
01:33:21,986 --> 01:33:23,180
Don't think I don't know?

1506
01:33:23,254 --> 01:33:24,653
When three,
you peeked at a woman bathing.

1507
01:33:24,756 --> 01:33:27,156
When four, you forced women to have sex.
When five...

1508
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:30,025
What happened? It took so long!

1509
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:46,866
Help!

1510
01:33:47,879 --> 01:33:52,373
Mother!

1511
01:33:58,756 --> 01:33:59,848
A great man is liberal.

1512
01:34:00,525 --> 01:34:03,119
Don't grudge me. I'm just playing.

1513
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:16,596
Till 70, you want to cut the foreskin.

1514
01:34:17,508 --> 01:34:19,601
When 71,
you take young girls to watch gold fish.

1515
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:21,007
Indeed, you want to rape them!

1516
01:34:22,113 --> 01:34:23,910
When 72, you are gay.

1517
01:34:24,048 --> 01:34:26,141
Whenever people want to be your mates,
you give them 1,000 and a bun.

1518
01:34:28,886 --> 01:34:30,285
Finished?

1519
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:31,419
No yet!

1520
01:34:31,722 --> 01:34:33,917
I think it's not mean enough
at the age of 40!

1521
01:34:34,225 --> 01:34:36,716
Then from that year on, I try again!
Schmuck!

1522
01:34:39,197 --> 01:34:40,186
Go to hell!

1523
01:34:43,201 --> 01:34:45,294
Brother! We came to rescue you
from the Temple.

1524
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,608
Are you ok? Who is he?

1525
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:54,605
Spare my life, please!
It's not my business.

1526
01:34:54,846 --> 01:34:57,838
He is the apple in His Majesty's eyes.

1527
01:34:58,616 --> 01:35:00,106
Take him as a hostage.

1528
01:35:00,218 --> 01:35:01,515
Go!

1529
01:35:07,091 --> 01:35:08,183
Stay!

1530
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:10,924
There's a lookout post in front of us.

1531
01:35:11,095 --> 01:35:14,496
Many great Kung-Fu masters are there.
You seven,

1532
01:35:14,532 --> 01:35:16,124
are impossible.

1533
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:17,566
Brother, you meant...

1534
01:35:17,768 --> 01:35:18,962
You protect me.

1535
01:35:19,103 --> 01:35:21,594
After I force the nine dragon
throngs out

1536
01:35:21,772 --> 01:35:23,467
and make the air move around.

1537
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,236
There will be no
competitors in the Palace.

1538
01:35:25,343 --> 01:35:27,140
OK! We protect you.

1539
01:35:33,451 --> 01:35:34,645
TDA?

1540
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:41,588
Master!
Bao!

1541
01:35:42,059 --> 01:35:43,151
Ao-Bye?

1542
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:46,023
Don't let him make it.

1543
01:35:46,163 --> 01:35:47,960
Or no one can defeat him.

1544
01:35:48,866 --> 01:35:50,663
Kill Ao-Bye first. Then, the Emperor.

1545
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:25,690
Master! I'm glad to help you.

1546
01:37:28,799 --> 01:37:30,198
Stamp on that. Leave me alone.

1547
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:42,931
Master!

1548
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,134
Fudge! Ao-Bye couldn't be hurt.
And is impotent.

1549
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:47,807
Impotent!

1550
01:38:47,945 --> 01:38:49,435
Then, take a hairpin

1551
01:38:49,647 --> 01:38:52,946
And stab at his spine point.
It'll bounce out.

1552
01:38:53,017 --> 01:38:54,006
Penis!

1553
01:38:57,521 --> 01:38:58,613
You've still alive?
You've still alive?

1554
01:38:58,722 --> 01:38:59,518
Going crazy again?

1555
01:38:59,657 --> 01:39:01,557
Yes, I'm crazy!
Oh, Poon!

1556
01:39:02,726 --> 01:39:04,023
Bao! Be careful!

1557
01:39:05,563 --> 01:39:06,962
Don't hurt my penis!

1558
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,295
No! You couldn't defeat him.

1559
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:17,271
Lord, be careful!

1560
01:39:44,101 --> 01:39:45,693
Master! You killed Ao-Bye.

1561
01:39:49,006 --> 01:39:50,405
You killed him finally!

1562
01:39:51,108 --> 01:39:52,598
If not for your friends' help.
I couldn't.

1563
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:55,005
Thanks. He is my good friend.

1564
01:39:55,713 --> 01:39:57,510
Master, you're hurt seriously.

1565
01:39:57,615 --> 01:39:58,707
It's better not to kill the Emperor now.

1566
01:39:58,849 --> 01:40:01,443
To summarise, you take revenge for them.

1567
01:40:03,921 --> 01:40:05,411
Go to see him.

1568
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:07,790
Master! You go first. I'll handle this.

1569
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:09,448
Bao. Be careful.

1570
01:40:09,593 --> 01:40:10,389
You too.

1571
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:16,696
Lord!

1572
01:40:21,872 --> 01:40:23,169
Chun!

1573
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,534
You're sober again.

1574
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:29,175
Don't be afraid.
My veins are broken entirely.

1575
01:40:29,747 --> 01:40:31,738
I have no power to kill you.

1576
01:40:34,251 --> 01:40:35,548
It's all my fault.

1577
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:37,245
Forget it!

1578
01:40:38,088 --> 01:40:41,683
But I couldn't heal
the palm print on you.

1579
01:40:41,926 --> 01:40:43,723
My master did it to me.

1580
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:48,857
By the way,
do you know Queen Mother's secret?

1581
01:40:49,033 --> 01:40:51,024
Sure. A long time ago. She is...

1582
01:40:53,437 --> 01:40:54,734
The holy girl of Dragon Gang!

1583
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:58,030
Holy girl of Dragon Gang?

1584
01:40:58,242 --> 01:41:01,837
Chun! Don't worry!
She cannot touch you.

1585
01:41:01,912 --> 01:41:03,607
Except if I die.

1586
01:41:03,714 --> 01:41:07,013
Sure? Go now! When she starts,
you have no chance to live.

1587
01:41:08,352 --> 01:41:10,843
No! My Lord!...

1588
01:41:12,556 --> 01:41:15,650
Go at once! When he becomes a ghost,
you'll die quickly.

1589
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,458
Wei-Shew-Bao, you are lucky.

1590
01:41:18,562 --> 01:41:20,154
Put in jail with Ao-Bye, and

1591
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:21,323
you are still alive!

1592
01:41:21,365 --> 01:41:23,162
Don't mess around.

1593
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:25,233
It's passed midnight.

1594
01:41:25,336 --> 01:41:28,237
If you don't hand me
"42 Chapter Classic",

1595
01:41:28,405 --> 01:41:30,703
you're going to see
Hai-Da-Fu and Ao-Bye.

1596
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,699
His Majesty has arrived.

1597
01:41:41,085 --> 01:41:43,076
Fine! You come here.

1598
01:41:43,287 --> 01:41:44,083
Mother!

1599
01:41:44,188 --> 01:41:46,179
Wei-Shew-Bao wanted to hurt me.

1600
01:41:47,725 --> 01:41:49,420
Mother, why are you here?

1601
01:41:49,593 --> 01:41:52,585
Wei-Shew-Bao and Hai-Da-Fu
are members of the TDA.

1602
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:54,391
They kidnapped me.

1603
01:41:54,498 --> 01:41:56,796
On the way, we met Ao-Bye's comrades.

1604
01:41:56,867 --> 01:41:59,165
They fought, and all died.

1605
01:41:59,236 --> 01:42:01,636
Wei-Shew-Bao wanted to kill me!

1606
01:42:01,772 --> 01:42:02,864
What?

1607
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,538
I don't want to go on.

1608
01:42:05,643 --> 01:42:07,338
The fact is that she pretended to be
the Queen Mother,

1609
01:42:07,478 --> 01:42:09,070
actually she is holy girl
of Dragon Gang.

1610
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:11,973
I don't think so.

1611
01:42:12,082 --> 01:42:14,175
Soldiers, are you armed?
Yes!

1612
01:42:14,685 --> 01:42:15,982
Your Majesty! All TDA members

1613
01:42:16,153 --> 01:42:17,745
have tattooed on their soles.
"Anti-Chin, For-Ming".

1614
01:42:17,888 --> 01:42:20,379
If you don't believe that,
ask him to take his socks off.

1615
01:42:22,026 --> 01:42:23,823
Bao!
That's not true! Your Majesty.

1616
01:42:24,495 --> 01:42:26,690
Aide! Take his socks off!

1617
01:42:27,765 --> 01:42:28,959
Your Majesty!

1618
01:42:29,967 --> 01:42:30,763
Wait for a moment!

1619
01:42:33,437 --> 01:42:34,426
"Chin-Ming"?

1620
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:36,368
The other, "Anti" and "For".

1621
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,732
It shows those four letters.

1622
01:42:40,411 --> 01:42:43,107
Take the other sock off!
No!

1623
01:42:46,684 --> 01:42:47,878
Old Man Day?

1624
01:42:50,287 --> 01:42:51,584
Though I didn't go to school

1625
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:53,154
having filial piety.

1626
01:42:53,257 --> 01:42:55,555
There are days to hold
memorial ceremony for ancestors.

1627
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:57,025
Bao tattooed this, just

1628
01:42:57,127 --> 01:43:00,028
to remind himself to sweep the tomb.
Your Majesty.

1629
01:43:00,364 --> 01:43:01,456
Queen Mother!

1630
01:43:01,532 --> 01:43:04,126
I told you she's not! She's a fake one.

1631
01:43:06,804 --> 01:43:08,396
You don't trust me?

1632
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:11,533
No! Of course not!

1633
01:43:14,678 --> 01:43:16,077
Mother! Jian-Ning!

1634
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,474
One more?

1635
01:43:17,614 --> 01:43:19,912
Don't trust him! This one is real.

1636
01:43:20,317 --> 01:43:23,616
She is a fake one,
she imprisoned me at the palace and

1637
01:43:23,754 --> 01:43:26,154
disguised herself as me for half a year.

1638
01:43:27,024 --> 01:43:29,015
Your Majesty! The evidence is
in front of you. No need to more think.

1639
01:43:29,593 --> 01:43:30,685
Fire the arrows!

1640
01:43:34,998 --> 01:43:37,796
Wei-Shew-Bao. I won't forget you.

1641
01:43:40,104 --> 01:43:42,902
Not me! It's him...

1642
01:43:44,908 --> 01:43:46,705
It's me who makes you suffer.

1643
01:43:46,877 --> 01:43:48,276
Queen Mother! Blessed!

1644
01:43:48,812 --> 01:43:51,610
Luckily, those two eunuchs and the
princess come to rescue me.

1645
01:43:51,682 --> 01:43:53,081
Bao told me.

1646
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:54,442
Bao?

1647
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:57,810
Mother, he's my undercover man!

1648
01:43:58,655 --> 01:43:59,849
Bao.

1649
01:43:59,957 --> 01:44:02,255
You killed Ao-Bye and uncovered her plot.

1650
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:05,318
What a great deed!
I give you the title "Lu-Ding Duke".

1651
01:44:07,464 --> 01:44:08,863
Thanks. Your Majesty!

1652
01:44:09,066 --> 01:44:11,364
Wei-Shew-Bao. I'll come back.

1653
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:12,901
Next time I show up,

1654
01:44:13,103 --> 01:44:15,697
you may not recognize me.
