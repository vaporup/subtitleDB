1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:01,144
I was thinking.

2
00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:02,615
You have doubts?!

3
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:03,488
Objection!

4
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:04,514
Don't hound him.

5
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:07,259
Rephrase the question.

6
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:10,327
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

7
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,600
And was the bus always in sight?

8
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:14,925
For a while my view

9
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,197
was blocked by the hill.

10
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,973
Could it be that another bus

11
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,640
overtook the first one at that point?

12
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,073
There was only one bus!

13
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:25,235
You're lying!

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,178
Sustained!

15
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:29,844
Defence should rephrase his question.

16
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:32,713
Could you be mistaken?

17
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:33,944
No!

18
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,521
There are four different bus routes
on that road.

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,987
On two routes,

20
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,389
the buses run every five minutes.

21
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:44,325
The other two,
the buses run every six minutes.

22
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:45,863
So 88 buses run back and forth

23
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,627
on that road every hour.

24
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,799
That's more than one bus a minute.

25
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:52,662
So what?

26
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,767
How long did it take you

27
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:56,066
to go down the hill?

28
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:57,367
About two minutes.

29
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,468
Exactly?

30
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,569
Two minutes and half.

31
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:01,105
So at most eight or night buses

32
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:03,212
could have passed by.

33
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:06,318
But you said there was one.
I say you're lying.

34
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,722
Don't you know the buses are always late?

35
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,696
All right. Let's give you the benefit of the
doubt.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,365
Assume there was one bus

37
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,398
and you could see it

38
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:22,627
all the time.

39
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:26,505
Which part was clearly visible
to you?

40
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:27,564
The body.

41
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,598
How much of the body?

42
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,000
All of it!

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,503
You're lying!

44
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:34,137
What's he doing?

45
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,344
You could see only one side of this bus.

46
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:38,983
At most, only half of it.

47
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:40,548
You couldn't see the other half.

48
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,688
Am I right?

49
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,147
Yes.

50
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:45,655
And anything

51
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,895
could have happened

52
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,119
on the side you couldn't see.

53
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:50,062
Yes.

54
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,566
So if someone jumped off,

55
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,394
you couldn't see him, could you?

56
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,559
No.

57
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,660
Speak louder.

58
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:58,896
I could have jumped off, he couldn't.

59
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,502
Just answer the question.

60
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:03,569
I mean it!

61
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:04,734
You try jumping from a moving bus!

62
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,080
Control yourself!

63
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:09,340
If that's not him
why did he bribe me?

64
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,507
Why would he do that?

65
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,780
He offered me money to let him go.

66
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:14,479
If it was you and

67
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:16,223
someone pointed a gun at you,

68
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:17,752
what would you do?

69
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:18,725
Objection!

70
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,658
Objection overruled!

71
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:20,684
Answer him!

72
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,860
I'd give him all my money.

73
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,760
That's what happened

74
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,091
to my client.

75
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:27,791
Am I right?

76
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,698
No, I'd already identified myself.

77
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:31,701
There are many cases where

78
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:32,896
criminals pose as policemen.

79
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,030
Sustained!

80
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:35,765
Court will ignore that remark.

81
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:37,909
Confine yourself

82
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,910
to this case.

83
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:41,304
I'm sorry!

84
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,939
Consider this,

85
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:44,207
a businessman

86
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:46,477
is carrying company cash on a bus.

87
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:49,689
A policeman chasing robbers stops

88
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:51,047
the bus and points a gun at him.

89
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,826
So the businessman thinks
the policeman is a crook.

90
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,152
So he tells the policeman

91
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,358
to take the cash and let him go.

92
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,825
Inspector Chan, isn't that right?

93
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:03,960
Objection!

94
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,133
The witness needn't answer.

95
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,568
We already know the answer.

96
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:11,176
He doesn't need to say it.

97
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,036
I conclude.

98
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:18,675
Wonderful!

99
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,516
Now what?

100
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,544
I know what to do.

101
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:21,884
He'll get off the hook.

102
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,180
He won't.

103
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:30,056
Your Honour, we request an adjournment.

104
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,527
Our prime witness was delayed.

105
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,689
Objection!

106
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,632
The Crown has failed

107
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,000
to establish a case.

108
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,030
There is insufficient evidence
to convict my client.

109
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,467
I request a dismissal.
Your Honour.

110
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,769
We have taped evidence

111
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:43,934
from our witness.

112
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:45,912
Tapes can't be accepted as evidence.

113
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:48,078
That tape is key to this case.

114
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,239
Objection.

115
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,177
I will not adjourn or postpone

116
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,520
the hearing.

117
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,316
That would be unfair to the defendant.

118
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,483
I will grant him bail.

119
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,423
But we will

120
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:02,119
hear that tape first.

121
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,943
Please turn up the volume.
It's a cheap tape.

122
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:16,333
Thanks.

123
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,092
Wait! I didn't erase that.

124
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,327
Just let it play!

125
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:47,932
It's coming up!

126
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:54,838
Oh, you! That hurts!

127
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,339
What did I do?

128
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:59,252
You really poked me!

129
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,852
You're breaking it!

130
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:04,583
Don't push too hard!

131
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,528
What an ugly thing!

132
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:08,788
Go away!

133
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,261
It's the only one I got. It's my treasure.

134
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,455
It's only a cactus!

135
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,890
What's happening?

136
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,960
You got me all wet!

137
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,466
Let me wipe it for you.

138
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,435
Please, no more! No, don't!

139
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,605
That was only orange juice!

140
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,715
That wasn't what you think.

141
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,951
Be gentle! That hurt!

142
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:35,818
The sofa's hard. It's not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

143
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,456
Let's go to bed.

144
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:39,783
OK. But where can I sleep?

145
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:41,518
On my bed.

146
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,719
And you?

147
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,291
Next to you.

148
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,064
You're so protective.
It's exciting!

149
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:50,763
Come on!

150
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:56,533
Please be cooperative.

151
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,068
Stand back, please.

152
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,274
No photographs!

153
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,639
Ka-kui!

154
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,417
I want a written report.

155
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,548
Boss!

156
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:12,321
Here!

157
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:14,329
No pictures!

158
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:15,518
Get back.

159
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,725
John, reserve a room

160
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,102
at the country club.

161
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:26,772
We're going to celebrate.

162
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:28,932
I'm leaving now.

163
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,266
Thank you very much!

164
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,057
Next time let's hire him as prosecutor.

165
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:51,698
This is Crime Story.
I'm so happy to see you all again.

166
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,366
Our guest today is

167
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,797
a brave police officer.

168
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:57,694
Sitting next to me is

169
00:06:57,873 --> 00:07:01,206
Inspector Chan Ka-kui.

170
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:02,665
Hello!

171
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:03,473
Hello!

172
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:04,501
Hello! Hello everyone!

173
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:08,806
After cracking down on the biggest
drug racket in Hong Kong,

174
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,206
you've become very popular

175
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,784
amongst the people.

176
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,884
Would you share this particular

177
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,647
experience with us?

178
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,918
The success of this operation

179
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,721
was due to team work.

180
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:24,260
I was just a part of it.

181
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,998
We were well prepared for the operation.

182
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,369
What makes your department so special

183
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:31,329
in the police force?

184
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,972
To be one of us,

185
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,198
you have to be

186
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,308
strong, alert,

187
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,136
smart, and...

188
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,045
Boss.

189
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,070
What's up?!

190
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,572
His photo is all over

191
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:45,753
the papers and magazines.

192
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,722
And he had won the
Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon

193
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,668
and our Thai source is out of stock.

194
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,997
What? Are they crazy?

195
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:08,768
They've sold everything to Uncle Joe.

196
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:10,539
They want hard cash.

197
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:13,709
Boss, Mr Cheung is here.

198
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,538
Please come in.

199
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:18,374
Mr Chu, I've received your cheque,

200
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,080
thanks a lot!

201
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,412
I should thank you!

202
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:24,881
How's my case now?

203
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,954
All evidence must remain

204
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:28,754
with the court

205
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,626
until the case ends.

206
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:32,265
What does that include?

207
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,501
Your passport and bank account.

208
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,294
You can't use them now.

209
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:37,867
If you're found guilty,

210
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,801
your assets will be confiscated.

211
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:44,110
And besides, the bastards could jail me.

212
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:45,435
Phone call for you, Boss.

213
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,537
Excuse me!

214
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,042
Salina.

215
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,112
It's boring here.
I want to go somewhere else.

216
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:56,583
Not just yet.

217
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,487
Can I come and see you?

218
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:01,457
Not now. You should stay where you are.

219
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:03,930
The police are looking for you.

220
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,258
I'm planning a trip to Europe for you.

221
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,100
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

222
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,702
You just have to wait.

223
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,998
It's for your own good.

224
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:25,642
Where were we?

225
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:27,984
We were lucky

226
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,178
to bail you out.

227
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:30,814
It would have been different

228
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,256
if they had found Salina.

229
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:36,263
I doubt they'll ever be able to find her.

230
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:37,554
Very well.

231
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,226
I must leave. See you.

232
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,061
Bye.

233
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:45,063
Your lawyer is right.

234
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,964
Salina's a big problem.

235
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,902
You can't hide her forever.

236
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,768
True.

237
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,813
Snake Eyes says that stupid cop
is looking for Salina everywhere.

238
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:56,873
We should send her abroad.

239
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,081
On a one-way ticket.

240
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,153
Let's use that stupid cop

241
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,651
to kill Salina.

242
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:10,825
Be sensible.

243
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:13,500
Chicks like her aren't difficult to get.

244
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,604
Inspector Man wants to see you.

245
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,096
Let him in.

246
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:22,200
You paid him off, didn't you?

247
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:23,700
Yes, I did.

248
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:26,906
But he says he wants
to retire and start a business.

249
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:28,705
What does that mean?

250
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:30,614
He wants more money!

251
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,011
This way, Inspector Man.

252
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,210
Hello!

253
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:34,914
Hello.

254
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:35,752
Sit down.

255
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,779
I'm OK.

256
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,147
I came to see you about...

257
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,282
Yes, I know.

258
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:42,160
You want to retire and start a business.

259
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:43,686
Good idea.

260
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:44,921
Thanks for your money.

261
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,530
I know you're a smart guy.

262
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,334
But I want one more favour.

263
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:51,794
What is it?

264
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,603
I want Chan Ka-kui to disappear for good.

265
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,750
You want to be a hero.
I'll make you a tragic hero.

266
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:38,975
I'll book you for that!

267
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,057
Hi, there! Follow me.

268
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,049
Inspector Chan!

269
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,257
If anything happens,

270
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,419
you can reach me...

271
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,486
Reach you with telegram.

272
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:51,521
My home.

273
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:52,755
But you're on patrol.

274
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,663
That doesn't mean
I can't pass by my house.

275
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:11,346
I'm going to the toilet, you stay here.

276
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,016
Don't stay there for too long.

277
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:18,381
Hello, Police Station.

278
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,918
You called, Inspector Chan?

279
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,291
Of course, any news?

280
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,761
On Salina? I need more time.

281
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,158
It's not easy, you should know.

282
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,234
Then you won't get paid.

283
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:31,864
I know.

284
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:33,796
I'm doing my best.

285
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,272
What?

286
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,699
Wait a second!

287
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,138
Police Station, hold the line.

288
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:44,744
Three more days, Snake Eyes.

289
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:46,242
What?

290
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,421
That's not enough time.

291
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,124
What?

292
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:53,416
I'll give you four days.

293
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,725
Or you'll be in trouble,
when I get back to town.

294
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,357
I'm hanging up now!

295
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:01,924
Can I help?

296
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,733
I've been waiting for ages.

297
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,269
You want to speak Inspector Chan? Hold on.

298
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:10,542
Phone, Inspector Chan.

299
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,769
Right, thanks!

300
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,041
Hello, this is Inspector Chan.

301
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:17,173
It's me.

302
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:17,775
May.

303
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,309
Who was that?

304
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,149
That rude guy?
Wait. I'll give him a lesson.

305
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:25,485
Didn't I tell you to be polite on the phone?

306
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,682
You're so rude!

307
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,985
I'm really sorry!

308
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,128
Right. I just told him off.

309
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:32,691
How's it going?

310
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:33,990
What are you doing now?

311
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,758
Me?

312
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,229
Now? Now I'm talking to you.

313
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,428
Have you had lunch?

314
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,938
Not yet.

315
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,339
I'm cooking some noodles.
Have you eaten, then?

316
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:45,601
No.

317
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,141
Wait a minute.

318
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,144
Police Station, hold the line.

319
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:54,911
May. I'm back.

320
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,686
Mum wants to have dinner
with us on Sunday.

321
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,983
Is that so? That sounds great.

322
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,184
Hold on.

323
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,059
Police Station.

324
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,085
My husband...

325
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,220
Your husband what?

326
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,525
He's beating me up.

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,558
Who's beating who up?

328
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,134
My husband's beating me up!

329
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:10,768
You husband's beating you?

330
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,371
Don't cry. I'll put you through
to a different department.

331
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,206
I'm coming on Sunday,

332
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,502
wait a second.

333
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,673
The line's busy.

334
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,979
Police Station, how can I help?

335
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,439
I'm missing a cow.

336
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:27,917
Hold the line.
I'll get you the right department.

337
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,412
The line's still busy.

338
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,082
Police Station.

339
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:30,886
I was raped!

340
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,950
Really?!
I have to write down the details.

341
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:40,590
When were you raped?

342
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,363
I wasn't raped, but my husband's mad.

343
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,068
Oh! It's you,

344
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:46,264
I'm still connecting your call.

345
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:47,001
It's taking so long!

346
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,407
This is a big police station. Wait!

347
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,302
Who's been raped?

348
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:54,474
Me!

349
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,205
I'm missing a cow!

350
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,376
When were you raped?

351
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,575
Last year!

352
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,279
Why didn't you report it?

353
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,623
Are there any pills I can take?

354
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:04,917
Pills?!

355
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,749
I'll find out for you.

356
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,623
Hello, Police Station.

357
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:10,753
I'm missing a cow.

358
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:11,765
All right.

359
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,664
But you need to bring in
a photo of the cow first.

360
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,337
Hello.

361
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,067
May, I'm very busy.

362
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,300
She wants me to name a place for dinner?

363
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:25,902
Give me a minute first.

364
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,043
Hello.

365
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:29,947
Where shall we go?

366
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:30,973
The Family Planning Clinic.

367
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,678
Take a double portion of contraception pills.

368
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:34,981
Free.

369
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:37,613
May.

370
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,684
Tell your own mum to take
contraception pills!

371
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:42,263
What?! May!

372
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,188
I was saying that to someone else.

373
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,527
Hello?

374
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:54,931
Hello?

375
00:15:58,446 --> 00:15:59,743
Tell my mum to take contraception pills.

376
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,006
My mum doesn't need those pills.

377
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,379
Police Station.

378
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:18,282
I'm testing the line, bye!

379
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,549
What?!

380
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,099
Stuck in traffic?

381
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:37,868
No, not traffic.

382
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,535
You're late.

383
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,844
If the roads were congested,
I wouldn't be here at all.

384
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,717
You're having dinner with us.

385
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:46,419
Mum hates it when anyone's late!

386
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,247
May, listen.

387
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,550
I've been waiting all day.

388
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,555
You're off that case.

389
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,649
Forget about it.

390
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:54,683
I can't.

391
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:58,354
I need to make a phone call.

392
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,599
Hold on to the car.
The hand brake doesn't work.

393
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:04,760
Don't let go.

394
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,078
It's me, Snake Eyes.

395
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,275
Chu Tu's hiding that witness

396
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:20,784
you're looking for

397
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,020
in his Kowloon villa.

398
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:24,914
You sure?

399
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:27,116
Better hurry.

400
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:29,826
They don't plan to keep her alive.

401
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:31,253
Is it true?

402
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,631
Would I lie to you? Hurry up!

403
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,228
May.

404
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,171
Are you coming?!

405
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,073
That was Snake Eyes.

406
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:43,265
I know where they're hiding Salina.

407
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:45,568
Don't go!

408
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,440
If Chu Tu kills her, he'll go free.

409
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,979
I've got to save her.

410
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:51,274
I can't let her die.

411
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:52,775
What's up?

412
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,344
Your car!

413
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:02,485
What now?!

414
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,519
Taxi!

415
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,296
Call someone to tow the car away.

416
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,365
And say sorry to your mum for me.

417
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:12,332
Be careful!

418
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,503
Keep the change.

419
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:21,537
Thanks!

420
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,743
What happened?

421
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,189
I don't know what they're up to.

422
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:38,347
Is anyone else here?

423
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,383
No one. They just disappeared.

424
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,485
Now you know what Chu Tu is like.

425
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,628
If you had listened to me,

426
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,598
you wouldn't be in danger.

427
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,327
It's lucky I got here.

428
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,472
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

429
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:59,101
Let's get out of here.

430
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,070
Go.

431
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:51,923
Stop!

432
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,828
Step aside.

433
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:04,600
How did you know I was here?

434
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,514
I have my ways.

435
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,179
You can't be...

436
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,781
Surprised?!

437
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,019
That's not the only surprise.

438
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,657
We were supposed to kill him.

439
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,527
That's right.

440
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,359
The boss wants us to use a police gun.

441
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:33,530
One cop kills another.

442
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:35,499
What a perfect set-up!

443
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:38,734
Who's killing who?

444
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,514
Let's get out of here!

445
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:00,422
Move it.

446
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,841
No, I can't do it!

447
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:12,601
No!

448
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:16,645
Jump!

449
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:24,122
Move it!

450
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:30,686
Stop!

451
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,125
Go get her!

452
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:42,670
You little prick! We'll teach you.
You'll wish you'd never interfered.

453
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:51,607
That's enough!

454
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,245
Take care of him. I'll go down.

455
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,854
Ka-kui didn't shoot Inspector Man.

456
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,454
We can't take your word for it.

457
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:01,750
We need evidence.

458
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:02,728
If he didn't do it,

459
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:03,957
Where did he go with his gun?

460
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:05,959
The bullet that killed Man was fired

461
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,395
from Ka-kui's gun.

462
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:08,402
Explain it.

463
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:10,495
Policemen make lots of enemies.

464
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,365
Someone is trying to frame Ka-kui.

465
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,537
If it were anyone else but Ka-kui,

466
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:16,732
would you feel the same?

467
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:20,538
You're the boss.
Don't always go by the book!

468
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:22,408
Show some feelings for your men.

469
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:23,772
I don't want people thinking if a cop kills,

470
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:25,345
he gets away with it.

471
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,487
There'll be no cover up!

472
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:29,485
One law for all.

473
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,385
You want to nail him

474
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,751
even more than the crooks!

475
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,150
Enough!

476
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:40,130
If you were me, what would you do?

477
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,269
Hi, May.

478
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,399
I know.

479
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:29,011
I'll wait for you.

480
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:38,755
One Cop Kills Another. Policeman Is Killed

481
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:41,917
What should we do?

482
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,397
My mum is really worried about you.

483
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:04,380
Ka-kui, be careful!

484
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:21,390
Ka-kui's back!

485
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:33,835
Ka-kui!

486
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:34,870
Ka-kui!

487
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,109
Ka-kui!

488
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:44,351
I didn't kill him.

489
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:45,547
We believe you.

490
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:47,584
But where have you been?

491
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,919
I don't know.

492
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,225
You must remember something.

493
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,431
Were you drunk or with your girlfriend?

494
00:26:57,805 --> 00:26:59,602
I was fighting Chu Tu's men.

495
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:02,107
Inspector Man appeared
and pointed his gun at me.

496
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:05,344
They took my revolver
and shot Man with it.

497
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,146
That's all I remember.

498
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:09,638
Nothing else?

499
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:11,284
You disliked Man,

500
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,247
and the bullet was from your gun.

501
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,443
Don't you know?

502
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:15,946
I wouldn't kill him over

503
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:18,692
some petty differences.

504
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:19,884
Who would believe that?

505
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:21,254
We must have proof!

506
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:22,895
That's how the law works.

507
00:27:24,932 --> 00:27:25,921
But I'm glad you're back.

508
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:27,260
Give me your gun.

509
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:31,660
Call Homicide.

510
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,864
Tell them

511
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:35,063
we have the suspect.

512
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,005
Ka-kui, don't worry.

513
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,477
We'll do our very best to help you.

514
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,740
Lock him up.

515
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,415
And charge him... with murder.

516
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,649
How could you?!

517
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:57,853
Freeze!

518
00:27:57,898 --> 00:27:59,263
Ka-kui, what are you doing?

519
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:01,763
I didn't kill anyone!

520
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:05,002
Don't you believe me?

521
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:06,495
I believe you.

522
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,668
But based on the evidence,

523
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:09,831
I must charge you.

524
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,569
Can't you see I was framed?

525
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:13,810
You're bloody stupid!

526
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:15,640
I'll conduct a very thorough investigation!

527
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,144
Don't give me that!

528
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:19,478
Let him go!

529
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,211
What?

530
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,353
What you are doing is dangerous!

531
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:26,887
Dangerous for him!

532
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:28,893
While we risk our lives out there,

533
00:28:29,163 --> 00:28:31,188
he's sitting back thinking of chicks.

534
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:32,692
We've arrested so many bad guys,
but he's never satisfied.

535
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,456
He just considers the result.

536
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,094
And he uses dirty tricks to catch Chu Tu

537
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,704
and that stupid idea of protecting the witness.
So easy?!

538
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:43,343
You only have to open your mouth
and we have to risk our lives!

539
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:44,139
Ka-kui!

540
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,167
Shut up!

541
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,911
You got promoted at our expense.

542
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:49,781
Have you ever thought of us?

543
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:51,811
If any of us dies,

544
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,649
you need only write a report
and turn up for the funeral.

545
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:57,990
We have families, too.

546
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,554
If it wasn't for us, you'd never have

547
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:02,790
this office and all this other crap!

548
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:04,394
Ka-kui.

549
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,394
Go away!

550
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:08,196
Come any closer and I'll blow his head off!

551
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,135
Ka-kui, don't do that!

552
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:11,931
Open the door!

553
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:14,296
Don't move!

554
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,198
Don't push me!

555
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,008
Keep back!

556
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,140
Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing!

557
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:29,652
Ka-kui's holding the Super hostage!

558
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:31,780
What?

559
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:32,723
Calm down!

560
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,749
Stay cool! Ka-kui, calm down.

561
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:34,816
Stay back!

562
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:35,419
Ka-kui, calm down.

563
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:36,827
Let's talk about this.

564
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:38,987
Don't come over.

565
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,659
Don't do that.

566
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:44,963
Let's talk.

567
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:47,572
We'll sort this out.

568
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,174
Put your hands on the table.

569
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:51,700
Now!

570
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,508
You're being stupid.

571
00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:56,907
Give up before it's too late!
We'll help you.

572
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:58,273
Calm down!

573
00:29:58,585 --> 00:29:59,574
Trust us!

574
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,780
We'll sort this out.

575
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,213
I trust all of you,

576
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:04,153
but I can't depend on you.

577
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,447
You're making it worse!

578
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:06,515
Stop!

579
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,649
Don't move!

580
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:12,554
Ka-kui.

581
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,657
Don't push him!

582
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,058
Don't push him.

583
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:20,368
Call in the snipers. Alert all units.

584
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:41,352
Easy, everybody!

585
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:47,722
Ka-kui!

586
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:56,965
Get in!

587
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:00,602
Ka-kui!

588
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:01,636
Drive out.

589
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,373
Let them go!

590
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,542
Don't go after them!

591
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:10,912
It's more important to keep Super safe.

592
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:16,985
Where are we going?

593
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,290
Stop.

594
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:26,561
Get out.

595
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:37,049
I wouldn't have shot

596
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:38,306
even if you had run.

597
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:39,808
I'm not sure how to help you,

598
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,180
but you'll have a head start.

599
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,457
They'll start hunting for you once I get back.

600
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:48,754
I'll get Chu Tu

601
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:50,787
before your men get me.

602
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,990
Be careful!

603
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:55,624
Thank you, sir.

604
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,910
No one knows where this Salina is.

605
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:09,539
Let's get a couple of chicks
and have some fun.

606
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,824
I didn't set you up, Inspector Chan!

607
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,333
It wasn't me.

608
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,196
I had no part in it!

609
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:36,531
It's for you.

610
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:43,447
I'll have it then. I'm starving.

611
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,829
Boss,

612
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:42,842
I heard that stupid cop
is on the run.

613
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,402
Wasn't he arrested?

614
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:46,303
He's run away!

615
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,148
He's got some nerve!

616
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:52,377
We should have killed him, too,

617
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:53,541
once and for all.

618
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:55,210
Where is Salina?

619
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:57,254
Mad Wing and Snake Eyes
are looking for her.

620
00:33:57,824 --> 00:33:59,655
We've heard nothing from them.

621
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,051
Salina could be with that stupid cop.

622
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:10,959
What's up, boss?

623
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:18,572
Someone's stealing my data.

624
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:19,801
Who is it?

625
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,369
It must be Salina.

626
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:23,607
Only she knows the password.

627
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,839
Go get her.

628
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:26,107
Alert our men.

629
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:26,881
Call Mr Cheung.

630
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,909
Yes.

631
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:43,691
How long do we need to wait?

632
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:44,993
You're impatient.

633
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:47,495
I'm not,

634
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:49,335
but I'm scared.

635
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:02,777
You two stay here.

636
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:18,026
Up there.

637
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:22,597
What?

638
00:35:22,776 --> 00:35:24,107
Call Inspector Chou!

639
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,744
Get that briefcase
or we're doomed!

640
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:29,676
Quick!

641
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:09,844
That way!

642
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:15,119
Ka-kui!

643
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,120
Why didn't you go to the police?

644
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,456
Chu Tu's men are here.

645
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:20,024
You witnessed Man's murder.

646
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,055
I'm counting on you.

647
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,193
I've got evidence on Chu Tu.

648
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:43,611
They're here!

649
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,709
Take her back to the office. Quick!

650
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,577
What's going on?

651
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,009
Not your business.

652
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,319
Let's go.

653
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:52,747
Beat him.

654
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:49,207
Off.

655
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,200
Come on!

656
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:53,234
I'm not going.

657
00:39:58,385 --> 00:39:59,374
Kill him!

658
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:16,521
Catch!

659
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:20,031
It's there! Go and get it!

660
00:41:23,703 --> 00:41:24,692
May!

661
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:25,960
Are you all right, Ka-kui?

662
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:27,538
Don't worry about me.
Get the briefcase!

663
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:29,597
OK.

664
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:33,234
Go to hell!

665
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:42,947
Chu Tu!

666
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,418
Quick!

667
00:41:58,938 --> 00:41:59,927
Hurry!

668
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,889
Ka-kui, stop!

669
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:28,832
Don't do it!

670
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:29,857
Calm down!

671
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:35,396
Put that down.

672
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:36,430
We'll sort this out!

673
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:37,565
Ka-kui!

674
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,599
This is between him and me.

675
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,843
He's not worth it.

676
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,481
There's no justice. I have to take
the law into my own hands.

677
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:44,672
I'm helping the weak ones.

678
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:46,651
Don't do anything foolish.

679
00:42:46,786 --> 00:42:48,651
I'm going to kill him right here.

680
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:50,379
It was Danny Chu who killed Inspector Man.

681
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,792
All the evidence is in the briefcase.

682
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,389
Are you all right?

683
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:03,425
May is hurt, Ka-kui.
Take care of her first!

684
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:13,468
Take all the suspects
back to the station!

685
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,207
You're abusing your power
as police officers.

686
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:16,972
You're hurting innocent people.

687
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:18,410
You're not above the law.
Justice is for everyone.

688
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:23,351
I'm going to sue you for kidnapping,
threatening and assaulting my client.

689
00:43:23,756 --> 00:43:24,814
I'm not going to let you

690
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:26,423
get away with this!

691
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:28,453
You threaten,

692
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:30,692
beat up good citizen.

693
00:43:31,264 --> 00:43:32,253
I'll sue you..

694
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:33,822
You lot are a menace to society!

695
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:39,927
He just proved it.

696
00:43:40,006 --> 00:43:41,098
Ka-kui, let go of him.

697
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:42,330
This is entrapment!

698
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:44,000
You're going to jail.

699
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,677
How dare you treat a lawyer like that?

700
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:48,012
We're so glad you're here, Mr Cheung!

701
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:53,874
You...

702
00:44:09,836 --> 00:44:11,030
You'll have to help me with that report.

703
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,160
Pardon?

704
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:14,695
Let's write it together.

705
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:16,731
I didn't see anything.

706
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:31,153
That's enough!
