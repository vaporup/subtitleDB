1
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,833
This is Chu Tu.
He's in his mid to late forties.

2
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:21,109
He's a nightclub owner, trader,
and property developer.

3
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,415
But we've found out all his companies

4
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,641
are losing money.

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,046
Hey, how are things up there?

6
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,983
This is Mad Wing, his bodyguard.

7
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,890
All of his employees

8
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,628
are actually hit men.

9
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,260
Be careful!
I'll see you at the dye factory.

10
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,556
Wait for me up there.

11
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,590
Yes.

12
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,105
This is Danny Chu, his nephew.

13
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,342
He's always surrounded by bodyguards.

14
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,375
This is John Ko, the brains
behind Chu Tu's organisation.

15
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,015
This lady's name is Salina Fong.

16
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,349
She's only joined Chu Tu recently.

17
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,892
It's hard to tell how much she knows

18
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,052
but she is involved.

19
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,831
Our mission is to arrest
all these drug dealers.

20
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,136
The code name is Operation Boar Hunt.

21
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,099
Have you got that?

22
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,767
Yes, sir!

23
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,678
Read your orders.

24
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,679
You all have specific duties.

25
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,624
Memorise then destroy.

26
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,887
It's crucial that you stay in position.

27
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,266
Hurry, come on!

28
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,822
Attention! Crime squad!

29
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,225
The Operation is underway!

30
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,640
Would you like a cup of tea?

31
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,612
Two teas please!

32
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,646
OK!

33
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:32,994
I'll be back for them.

34
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,565
There is a suspicious looking guy.

35
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,671
Two teas please!

36
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,837
Tell the others, I'll check it out.

37
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,079
Kim!

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,422
Are you buying me a tea?

39
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
We've been discovered.

40
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,825
What?!

41
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,329
Follow the guy in the red top.

42
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,666
What is it?

43
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,372
This is Salina.
There's a suspicious looking guy...

44
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,274
What are you doing?

45
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,247
Police!

46
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,271
It's the police!

47
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,973
The police are here!

48
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:33,921
Freeze! Police!

49
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,898
I just heard some gunshots.

50
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,093
They've opened fire!

51
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:39,763
What to do?

52
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,068
Let's break up the crowd first.

53
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,874
Leave this area now!

54
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,680
Crime squad.
What's happening?!

55
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,009
Police! Get out of here!
Go on! Hurry!

56
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,107
Quick

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,178
This way.

58
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,386
Listen! Mind the residents

59
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,953
and get the kids inside.

60
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,289
Hurry up! Go on!

61
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,695
This way.

62
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,143
Move in and help.

63
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,514
But we're supposed to stay out.

64
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,089
The situation's changed.

65
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,883
Move it!

66
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,226
Let me go!

67
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,260
It gets tighter if you move.

68
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,531
Let me go!

69
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,911
I'll keep you covered,
you make a break for it.

70
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,178
Protect the boss!

71
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,413
Go.

72
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,407
There's a female suspect up there.
Take her back to the station.

73
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,473
It's only me!

74
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,912
Why did they open fire?

75
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,213
Don't ask me.

76
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,791
Calm down!

77
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,940
Help me... Tak!

78
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,170
Cover me!

79
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:32,307
Tak!

80
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,202
You must stay calm.

81
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,945
It hurts.

82
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,718
Help me.

83
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,449
You stay here and take care of him.

84
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,599
They mean business!

85
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,573
Don't forget the warning.

86
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,941
Mind the villagers.

87
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,281
But will the bad guys
give a damn about them?

88
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,276
Who made you a cop?

89
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,810
Come here!

90
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,952
Be careful, Ka-kui.
These guys are really mean!

91
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,172
Boss! This way!

92
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,878
Get in!

93
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,726
You're blocking the road!
Get out of the way!

94
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,151
Reverse!

95
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:03,857
Not this way!

96
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,192
You OK?

97
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,431
This way's blocked, go back.

98
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,171
Go back! Quick!

99
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,932
Go back up!

100
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,941
The road below is blocked!

101
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,874
We're stuck, boss! Now what?!

102
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,272
Go that way!

103
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,805
Let's go!

104
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,712
Boss! Quick!

105
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,846
Quick!

106
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,696
This way!

107
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,142
Freeze!

108
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,521
Mind the civilians!

109
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,582
Where have you been?

110
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,685
They've all escaped.

111
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,085
We went up to help.

112
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,825
Who gave that order? They're gone!

113
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,823
You can't blame me for that.

114
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,036
Hurry, go!

115
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,137
Can I borrow this?

116
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,316
Tell them to get down.
Stop that.

117
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,215
Get down!

118
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,219
Don't let them see my face.

119
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,117
Tell the driver to step on it!

120
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,143
Quick!

121
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,784
Get down!

122
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,730
Turn here, turn!

123
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,338
Keep going!

124
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,606
Keep going!

125
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,158
Easy, boss, we'll make it.

126
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,321
Look!

127
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,107
Get up there, and get rid of him.

128
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,638
Tell the driver to go faster!

129
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,145
Come down here and get him.

130
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,715
Come down!

131
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,531
Turn the bus! Go down the hill!

132
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,108
What are you doing?

133
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,878
Police. Stay back!

134
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,346
Boss, the bastard's right in front!

135
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,177
Run over him!

136
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:24,848
Yes.

137
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,879
Step on it, run over him.

138
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,921
We'll be all right.

139
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,451
Freeze!

140
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,959
You're under arrest,
but you have the right to...

141
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,361
If you let me go...
this is all yours.

142
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,974
There is a lot of money here,

143
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,344
no one will ever find out.

144
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,409
Smart guy!

145
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,877
Stop!

146
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,297
Well done, you guys.

147
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,998
Give him credit if he praises you

148
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,737
and don't let it go to your heads.

149
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,572
I know what to do. Ka-kui is the one
who needs your advice.

150
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,268
I didn't do it alone.

151
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,676
It was a success because of careful planning.

152
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,338
That's a great line.

153
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,751
Don't forget to say it
when the Super comes.

154
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,488
He'll be very happy to hear that.

155
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,228
Operation Boar Hunt
was carefully planned.

156
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,452
You were told to go in

157
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,588
and make the arrest.

158
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,791
You almost let the prime suspect
get away.

159
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,392
What happened?

160
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,630
Didn't he give you clear orders?

161
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,533
Yes, but he said the operation
was very well planned.

162
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,865
What?!

163
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,644
This operation was carefully planned.

164
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,939
But it had a few flaws.

165
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,104
Why were there flaws?

166
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,040
That's because Ka-kui

167
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,279
couldn't handle the woman.

168
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,618
Before we even got to the store,
they heard her screaming.

169
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,187
How did Chu Tu get through
your men, then?

170
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,484
What do you mean by that?

171
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,390
Don't point your fingers at each other.

172
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,154
What?!

173
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,063
The PR lady is here.

174
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,089
Let her in.

175
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,572
The press is here, Superintendent.

176
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,834
Tell them no comment!

177
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,068
Hold it. I asked them to come.

178
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,767
Then, tell them to wait.

179
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,510
Ka-kui, you'll be our spokesman.

180
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,075
Me?!

181
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,717
I can't possibly.

182
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,148
The speech is ready, just read it.

183
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,946
Learn your lines.

184
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,252
You can go now
and don't botch them.

185
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,097
The Chief is well pleased

186
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,495
with Ka-kui's performance.

187
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,093
A promising lad.

188
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,967
After the speech, take him
to do a police recruitment poster.

189
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,635
And arrange for him to appear on TV.

190
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,003
A role model?!

191
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,878
The Chief thinks
he's a model policeman.

192
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,408
He'll be really good for it.

193
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,749
What are the charges on Salina?

194
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,781
Drug dealing, resisting arrest
and assaulting police officers.

195
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,614
Drop all the charges.

196
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,519
Really?!

197
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,393
You played a big part
in this operation.

198
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,937
The success of this operation
depended on skilful planning.

199
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,896
He means you.

200
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,439
Will you get a promotion?

201
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,935
As a police officer,

202
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,807
I don't fight crime to get promoted.

203
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,542
I'm not worried about promotions.

204
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,917
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you?

205
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,686
He sure did, with millions.
He could have bribed the whole force.

206
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,856
Just kidding! Don't put that down.

207
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,384
Can you two sit closer?

208
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,584
What are you doing?

209
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,425
Just saying hello.

210
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,721
Don't sit too close.

211
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,056
Let me sit here.

212
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,928
He'll come this way, right?

213
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,366
Yeah!

214
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,531
Let's start!

215
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,243
Straighten up your back.

216
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:51,978
Open your eyes a bit more.

217
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,850
Open your mouth. Wider.

218
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,048
Wider still!

219
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,424
More.

220
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,627
Forget it,

221
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,821
just be yourself!

222
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,924
Ready?!

223
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,764
The handcuffs in the middle.

224
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,539
Try to be more energetic.

225
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,489
Your plan wouldn't work.

226
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,248
Why not?

227
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,252
Remember, she's Chu Tu's secretary,

228
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,326
not just anyone can get that job.

229
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,924
Chu Tu's been arrested

230
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,835
and once he knows
his secretary is going to be a witness,

231
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,459
what will he do?

232
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:45,099
He'll do everything he can
to stop her appearing in court.

233
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,942
Whoever we send to protect her
will be in danger.

234
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,148
Don't be a cop if you're not

235
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,253
willing to risk your life.

236
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,251
Put that line on one of our
recruitment posters.

237
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,450
We don't have enough evidence to
prosecute him.

238
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,419
We must push him into a corner.

239
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,062
Then we can put him behind bars.

240
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,727
Who's going to protect her?
I suggest...

241
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,895
I have someone in mind already.

242
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,269
Great minds think alike.

243
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,202
Good luck to him.

244
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,712
You're the only one who got bail.

245
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,210
You're really lucky.

246
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,053
They're here to see the Super.

247
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,215
Please wait.

248
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,552
Please wait. Right.

249
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,859
You can leave after you've seen him.

250
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,492
You can go in now.

251
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:46,926
Thanks!

252
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,434
Please sit down!

253
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,507
You can leave now, Miss Fong.

254
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,186
Wait a second.

255
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,014
Please keep this subpoena,

256
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,780
you'll need it to appear in court.

257
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,716
What's the charge?

258
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:10,750
Nothing!

259
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,865
But you'll be acting
as our witness.

260
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,535
I'm sorry!
My client isn't going to do that.

261
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,062
We're not asking her.

262
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,600
According to law, she has to do it.

263
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,901
Inspector Chan!

264
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,773
Your job is to protect Miss Fong

265
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,006
until she appears in court.

266
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,908
Me? Protect her?

267
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,612
Why not?

268
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,916
Great!

269
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,144
I don't need his protection.

270
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,325
As long as he doesn't harass you,
you can't refuse.

271
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,485
Inspector Chan.

272
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,256
As an escort of the witness,

273
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,158
you must be aware that
the witness is often faced with threat,

274
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,325
disturbance, and assault,

275
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,134
or irritated

276
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,270
by the intentions of such.

277
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,509
It is your duty to see her safety

278
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,075
and personal rights are intact.

279
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,371
Yes, sir!

280
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,608
But can you send someone else?

281
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,751
You'll get expenses

282
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,177
for this assignment -

283
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,578
HK$32 per day.

284
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,685
It's an old tradition,

285
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,047
unchanged for years.

286
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,784
I know it's very little. That's all.

287
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,822
Can we talk to you alone, Miss Fong?

288
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,056
My client doesn't answer questions

289
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,198
without the presence of her lawyer.

290
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,492
We won't ask her any questions.

291
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,865
We just want some advice
for her own good.

292
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,176
You have the right to refuse this.

293
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,611
Let me see what they have to say.

294
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,618
Mr. Cheung! Please excuse us.

295
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,278
You don't have to answer

296
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,382
if they ask you any questions

297
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,924
about the case or others.

298
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,489
Get out of here!

299
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,524
I have to go, too?

300
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,093
What is your rank?

301
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,408
What do you want to talk to me about?

302
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,409
Nothing, you can go now.

303
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,279
See you in court.

304
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,115
Did they ask... Let's go.

305
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,587
Ka-kui.

306
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,755
Your tape recorder.

307
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,768
OK.

308
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,791
What did they say to you?

309
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,761
They didn't say anything.

310
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,273
I'm your lawyer, you can trust me.

311
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,776
They didn't say a word to me.

312
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,203
Why was it only her...

313
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,338
They're coming!

314
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,410
How's boss and the others?

315
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,780
I can't bail them out.

316
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,752
What about Salina, then?

317
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,187
She's their witness.

318
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,621
What? Really?!

319
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,022
They want me to do it.

320
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,894
You should have turned it down.

321
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,867
Stop bothering our witness!

322
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,561
Who are you?

323
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,199
I'm a cop!

324
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,865
My duty is to protect her.

325
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,401
If you keep doing that, I can charge
you with interfering with the police.

326
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,201
Salina...

327
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,276
You can only say goodbye or bye-bye.

328
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,983
One more word and you're under arrest.

329
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,677
I'll take you home.

330
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,090
That's part of my job.

331
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,090
I'll tell them nothing!

332
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,697
Now what, Mr. Cheung?

333
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:08,922
I'll see your boss this afternoon.

334
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:10,924
All right! Let's go!

335
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,561
It's dangerous for you
to hang around outside.

336
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,641
Let's go home, shall we?

337
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,341
It's none of your business.

338
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,579
It's for your own safety.

339
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,413
I don't need your protection, you fool!

340
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,753
You know what happened to the last

341
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,251
witness who said that?

342
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:33,546
What happened?!

343
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,048
Were they shot?

344
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,694
Don't try to scare me.
It won't work.

345
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,186
You're right!

346
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,391
They were fine in the end.

347
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,993
You can say whatever you want.

348
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,290
You can't scare me!

349
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,097
All the evidence

350
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,597
points to the defendants.

351
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,534
Only your situation is better.

352
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,339
We're depending on you, Mr. Cheung.

353
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,636
I'll do my best.

354
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,414
You'd better be prepared for bad news.

355
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,048
The chances are slim.

356
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,814
If I walk away free,

357
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,518
I'll take good care of you.

358
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,889
There's still something
we need to worry about.

359
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,623
Salina is their witness.

360
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,154
Is she really?!

361
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,355
She's been granted bail.

362
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,597
The police even gave her an escort -

363
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,166
the guy who arrested you.

364
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,567
Salina doesn't know much.
She's new.

365
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,201
That doesn't concern me.

366
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:28,977
But she could say something bad

367
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,545
about us in court.

368
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,473
I don't think she would...

369
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,315
All right.
Call Danny for me.

370
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,421
Tell him to take care of Salina.

371
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,618
All right.

372
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,757
Thanks a lot!

373
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:51,958
Keep the change!

374
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,126
See you later!

375
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,573
It's dangerous to stay home alone.

376
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,607
I always live dangerously.

377
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,386
John? I just got back.

378
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,583
The phone is tapped.

379
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,660
All right, I'll meet you later.

380
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,454
I'm really scared!

381
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,065
You think you can scare me like that?

382
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,132
Help!

383
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,917
Help!

384
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,281
I'm going to kill you!

385
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,820
Don't go.

386
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,321
I'll get you!

387
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,291
You have to die!

388
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,202
I'm going to kill you!

389
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,500
Go to hell!

390
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,604
Go to hell!

391
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,739
I got you!

392
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,718
I'm going to kill you!

393
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,664
Don't run away!

394
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,806
I've got you now!

395
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,642
Go to hell!

396
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:39,592
Here I come!

397
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,620
Hide no where!

398
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,589
There's no way out. You're finished.

399
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:48,138
I'm going to kill you!

400
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,438
Don't worry! I'm here!

401
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,814
She's terrified. Can I go now?

402
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,181
You can leave right now.

403
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,321
Hold on to him, I'll call the police.

404
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,954
I knocked him out!

405
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,767
Not yet! He's still conscious.

406
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,296
He's fighting me!

407
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,661
Keep away from us!

408
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,835
Please go now.
You can't stay here any longer.

409
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,065
Don't faint!

410
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,077
Go!

411
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,306
I go...

412
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:06,772
He's passed out!

413
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,452
No! He's still conscious. See?
Look at me.

414
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,085
Don't!

415
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,264
Please leave here right now!

416
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,454
Go now! Go on!

417
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,688
Go! Hurry!

418
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,660
No more acting. Let\92s go!

419
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,664
Leave him to me!

420
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,272
He's fainted.

421
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,536
This time is real.

422
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,108
Let me hit him one more time!

423
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,744
Stop, or we won't be able
to identify him.

424
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,890
I don't want to do this any more.

425
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,963
I don't know him.

426
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,864
They'd use a stranger to kill you.

427
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,128
Why kill me?

428
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,068
Of course, Chu Tu's a ruthless man.

429
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,512
Inspector Chou, it's Ka-kui.

430
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,914
I just realised this is a tough case.

431
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,338
Can you send a replacement?

432
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,706
No?!

433
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,979
I'm not risking my life

434
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,213
for a few thousands.

435
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,186
I've had enough of her!

436
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,623
I don't give a damn about her any more.

437
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,127
I quit! Enough is enough!

438
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,924
Where are you going?

439
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,594
Home!

440
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,071
You're supposed to protect me!

441
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,070
But you're not cooperating.

442
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,230
How can I protect you.

443
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,344
What if I cooperate?

444
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,014
It's too late! I quit.

445
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,651
I can't believe it!

446
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,848
You cops have no sense of duty.

447
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,294
I have.
But there's nothing I can do.

448
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,021
If I stay here, I'll get killed, too.

449
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,860
I'll cooperate.

450
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,631
I'm not forcing you.

451
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,608
I'm doing it of my own free will.

452
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,266
You should come to my house,

453
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,467
it's much safer there.

454
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,768
Great!

455
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:16,802
Look at you!

456
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,137
I'll get changed!

457
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,412
Chu's men could be back any time.

458
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,941
I won't change my clothes, then.

459
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,344
Now what?

460
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,520
What is it?!

461
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,788
I'm checking to see if everything's OK.

462
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,999
Go back!

463
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,798
Come out.

464
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,472
Why are you holding that?

465
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,578
This is your jacket.

466
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,251
I told you to put it on.

467
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,777
Yes.

468
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,379
Follow me!

469
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,387
Use my car.

470
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,122
Which one is yours?

471
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,323
Over there.

472
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:20,968
Why are you not nervous at all?

473
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,178
I'm used to situations like this.

474
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,078
I told you to stay quiet, didn't I?

475
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,308
Now what?

476
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,922
My son!

477
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,145
Yours?

478
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,315
Close the car door!

479
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,168
It's me!

480
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,396
Give me my gun!

481
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,575
It's in my jacket pocket.

482
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,612
Help!

483
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,388
I've got you!

484
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,366
Freeze!

485
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,403
Freeze!

486
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,677
Stay calm! Give me the gun.

487
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,313
Stay calm! Keep away!

488
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,882
Go.

489
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,027
Give me the gun! It's me!

490
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,201
Are you all right?

491
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,670
Where are they?

492
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,439
You scared them off with that shot.

493
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,976
We must get you away from here,
those guys are for real.

494
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,448
Who was the guy at my house, then?

495
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,180
He wanted to kill you, too.

496
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,988
But these are professionals.

497
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,124
I see why you're nervous now.

498
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,653
Get in the car.

499
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,365
You're crying?!

500
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,303
How could Chu Tu do this to me?

501
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,072
You can't be that naive.

502
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,979
Your boss is capable of anything.

503
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,844
He can't have you in that courtroom!

504
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,344
What should I do then?

505
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,820
You should tell the judge everything

506
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,786
so he can put Chu in jail
and then you'll be safe.

507
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,517
What should I say to the judge?

508
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,724
What rackets Chu Tu's involved in,
who his contacts are,

509
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,232
who the dealers are.

510
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:35,894
Why are you taping this?

511
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,272
It's for my own reference.

512
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,104
How long have you worked for him?

513
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,633
Four years.

514
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,813
He's a family friend.

515
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,483
He used to give my mother
money to buy me food.

516
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,582
Now you help him deal drugs.

517
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,085
I hardly know anything.

518
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,321
You can still tell me what you do know.

519
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,322
If you remember anything else,

520
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,899
don't forget to tell me.

521
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,968
Do you have enough to prosecute him?

522
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,431
That's for the court to decide.

523
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,661
What you've told me is very useful.

524
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,711
Come in.

525
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,577
Let me turn on the lights.

526
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:31,884
It's May.

527
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,929
I almost forgot today's my birthday.

528
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,389
Are you all right?

529
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,235
Let me introduce you,

530
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,533
this is Miss Fong.

531
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,007
Let's go.

532
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,577
Are you all right?

533
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,979
I'm fine.

534
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,247
May!

535
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,297
They've all gone? That was quick!

536
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,429
It's all my fault.
She wanted to surprise you,

537
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,393
but you brought me here.

538
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,064
And I'm dressed like this.

539
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,729
Of course she's angry.

540
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,167
I'm angry, too.

541
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,401
I didn't even have the chance to explain.

542
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,044
She dumped the cake on me!

543
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,541
I won't answer

544
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,738
if she calls to apologize.

545
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,407
I doubt she will.

546
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,084
I knew she would be back!

547
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,357
What so happy about it?

548
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,691
I saw May. What's wrong?

549
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,931
She saw me with our witness.

550
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,331
I'll go and explain to her.

551
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,868
No need. Tell her to curb her temper.

552
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,040
Why do I have to explain everything

553
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,804
to everyone?

554
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,412
I'm sick and tired of it.

555
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,873
Do you want some cake?

556
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:02,941
What about a drink, then?

557
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,351
Orange juice, please!

558
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,511
Help yourself!

559
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,922
Do you live alone?

560
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,258
It's too big, they'd get me
for corruption.

561
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,799
I rent it with a friend.
And he's away.

562
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,826
I'm really sorry.

563
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,840
Your girlfriend was furious when she saw me.

564
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,397
Don't worry.

565
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,411
I was doing my job.

566
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,978
Come on! Come in!

567
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,375
You'll be all right. I'm leaving.

568
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:37,914
See you!

569
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,689
I'm just a cop now.

570
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,592
But I might become a movie star

571
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,961
and have to kiss ladies passionately.

572
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,131
What would she do then?

573
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,433
She loves you, so she's jealous.

574
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,338
I'll explain to her.

575
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,479
What for?

576
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,738
She'll never understand me.

577
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,118
Aren't you going
to say something nice to her?

578
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,786
No way!

579
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,180
If I started sweet-talking,

580
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,685
I'd have a million girls.

581
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,857
You love her a lot, don't you?

582
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,060
To be honest, I do love her a lot!

583
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,763
But loving her is one thing,

584
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,004
apologizing is another.

585
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,335
When she gets home,

586
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,338
she'll call and apologize to me.

587
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:34,833
What a waste of food!

588
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,012
Am I right?

589
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,957
She couldn't wait to call me.

590
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,949
Hello.

591
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,189
Hello?

592
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,556
Is that your girlfriend?

593
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,793
It's her. She's crying!

594
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,403
Stop crying. You shouldn't
humiliate me in front of people.

595
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,363
What?!

596
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,868
If I was with a man,
you'd think I was gay.

597
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,611
You're so childish!

598
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,669
Curb your temper!

599
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:11,442
Let me explain to her.

600
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,471
No need!

601
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,512
Curb that temper of yours!

602
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,945
You should show me some respect.

603
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,180
Stop crying. Talk to you later.

604
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,985
It's time to teach her a good lesson.

605
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,130
When did she come back?

606
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,732
Right after you went in the shower.

607
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,434
So she heard everything?

608
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,167
The phone call?!

609
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,088
Not again!

610
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,588
May!

611
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,525
Let me explain.

612
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,431
She's our witness,
my job is to protect her.

613
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,332
I'm mad about what you just said!

614
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,335
I was just kidding.

615
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,199
Don't be mad.

616
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,328
Why are you angry?

617
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,068
Why?

618
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,507
You just insulted me in front of her.

619
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,540
How dare you?!

620
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,309
Go away!

621
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,640
Please listen to me! May!

622
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,608
May...

623
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,542
Are you all right?

624
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,212
No! Are you happy now?!
I hurt.

625
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,983
Of course I'm not.
I didn't mean to do that!

626
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,282
Your shoe.

627
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,052
Here, put it on.

628
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:33,985
Go away!

629
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:34,963
May, please listen to me!

630
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:35,987
No, I don't want to!

631
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,457
Don't be so childish.

632
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:40,600
Listen to me, will you?

633
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,005
Let me go.

634
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,899
Be careful!

635
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,903
I hate you!

636
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,583
Where is she?

637
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,144
I accepted her apologies,

638
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,686
and she went home.

639
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,180
Oh, you! That hurt?

640
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,615
What did I do?

641
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,524
You really poked me!

642
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,127
You're breaking it!

643
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,858
Don't push too hard!

644
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,867
What an ugly thing!

645
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,062
Go away!

646
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,598
It's the only one I got. It's broken.

647
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,140
You got me all wet!

648
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:01,840
Let me wipe it for you.

649
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,387
Please, no more! No, don't!

650
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,084
Not there, here.

651
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,881
Here?!

652
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,528
Be gentle! That hurt!

653
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,835
This sofa's hard, it's not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

654
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,441
Let's go to bed.

655
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,870
But where can I sleep?

656
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,471
On my bed.

657
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:32,904
And you?

658
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,375
Next to you.

659
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,681
You're so protective.
It's exciting!

660
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:54,960
I'm going to bed.

661
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,665
Don't wake me up.

662
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,608
Women are weird!

663
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,117
Hello?

664
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,254
Ka-kui? Wait!

665
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,622
He's on the line.

666
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,364
You're late. We're waiting for you!

667
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,366
He's not here.

668
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,901
I know it's you. Quick!
Get that witness here.

669
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,815
What was your duty on that day?

670
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,149
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

671
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,355
The suspects were trying to escape,

672
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,926
and I arrested two of them.

673
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,319
Thank you!

674
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,362
Can I ask the witness a question?

675
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,191
Inspector Kim,

676
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,404
you said you saw the suspects escaping.

677
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,034
Did they pass in front of you
one by one?

678
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,879
Or did you have a special device

679
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,102
to allow you see them

680
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,479
escaping at the same time?

681
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,611
I object!

682
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,756
I object! The question played
with the witness's wording.

683
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,147
Overruled!

684
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,754
Thank you! No more questions!

685
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,386
Bring on the next witness.

686
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,984
That's my spot.

687
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,178
I'm in a hurry!

688
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,853
I want that space!

689
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,583
Nice parking, though.

690
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,566
What?! She's gone?

691
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,531
What have you been up to?

692
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,233
Now what? We might lose.

693
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,245
I don't know.

694
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,268
We'll lose.

695
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,941
How could you be so sure that one of

696
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,414
the escaping suspects was my client?

697
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:25,813
He had the same clothes.

698
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,688
In other words, you didn't have a

699
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,188
clear view of the suspects' faces.

700
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:31,783
I would say so.

701
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:34,953
Are you short-sighted?

702
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,521
No, I'm not.

703
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,925
All right. No more questions.

704
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,268
Next witness.

705
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,742
I swear to tell the truth.

706
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,699
I was at the squatter huts
for the operation.

707
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,597
The first, second, third

708
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,833
and fourth defendants opened fire.

709
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,611
I saw them jump on a bus.

710
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,404
So I took a short cut
and went down the hill.

711
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:26,775
A citizen helped me

712
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,779
to stop the bus with his car.

713
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,985
After the bus stopped,

714
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,347
I arrested the first defendant.

715
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,421
He tried to bribe me,

716
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,954
but I refused.

717
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,861
That was very clear. Thank you!

718
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,863
You were at the squatter house.

719
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:48,893
What time was that?

720
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,095
About 6:00 a.m.

721
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,266
What time exactly?

722
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,497
5:55 a.m.

723
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,734
Let's say 6:00 a.m.

724
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,474
In December in Hong Kong,

725
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:59,375
sunrise is at 6:23 a.m.
Did you know that?

726
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,272
I didn't know.

727
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,307
Is that true?

728
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,284
I don't know.

729
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,912
Do you know the saying

730
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,350
Darkness before dawn?

731
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,946
No, I don't.

732
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,253
The saying means that it's dark

733
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,723
before the sun rises.

734
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,420
I might have heard of it.

735
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,454
All right.

736
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,395
If there wasn't much light,

737
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,900
should we believe
you could actually see my client?

738
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,537
Believe what you like.
I did see him.

739
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,366
It's your business.
You shouldn't ask me.

740
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,010
You said you ran down the hill

741
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,381
to stop the bus.

742
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:33,750
Was the bus always in sight?

743
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,516
Yes.

744
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:37,425
Why hesitate?
