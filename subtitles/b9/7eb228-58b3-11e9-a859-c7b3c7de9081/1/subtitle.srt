1
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,754
''From Arthur Kahn to Tom Sanders.

2
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,392
''Product Name: Arcamax CD-ROM.

3
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,328
''Considering the merger, l thought
you should get this at home:

4
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,836
''Arcamax production lines running
at 29% despite all efforts.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,904
''Spot-checks on dada dada....

6
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,902
''Speaking of the merger, are
you rich and famous yet?

7
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,073
''Congratulations in
advance on your promotion.

8
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,511
''Arthur.''

9
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,586
Dad, you got E-mail.

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,794
l`m not a pain in the ass,
l`m being a lawyer.

11
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:12,590
There`s a difference.

12
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:16,858
No more computer games, Matt, it`s time
for school. Eliza, where are you?

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,866
You got E-mail.

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,801
Tom, Matt`s got toothpaste
all over himself!

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,811
lf you can`t get them ready for
school, don`t say you`ll do it.

16
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:29,038
You`re welcome.

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,442
l`m here.

18
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:33,106
- And Liza needs a jacket.
- l know she needs a jacket!

19
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,377
A jacket doesn`t go, dad.

20
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,182
Wear a sweatshirt.

21
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:39,390
That`s for girls, a white sweatshirt.

22
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,888
Since when?

23
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,393
Leave me alone.

24
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,891
Put your jacket on.

25
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,469
Ariel doesn`t have a father.
She has two mothers.

26
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,128
That`s interesting.

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,969
He`s in a hotel with his secretary
patched in from New York...

28
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:02,079
...while l`m brushing Cheerios
from my file folders.

29
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,339
lt`s insanity.

30
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,971
Put your jacket on.

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,913
Put this on, sweetie.

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,076
You can take it off at school.

33
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,245
Listen to your mom.

34
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,357
Matt, did you pee?

35
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:17,928
l don`t know why you said you`d
help me today, with your promotion.

36
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,996
What`s dad got around his neck?

37
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,928
You don`t know what this is?

38
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,495
lt`s a tie.

39
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,101
Dad`s getting a promotion.

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,101
- Dad, you got an E-mail.
- Thanks, honey. Let`s go.

41
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:28,597
We`re late.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,444
Did you get the Disneyland tickets?

43
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,606
With everything l have to do?

44
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,615
lt`s just one call.

45
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,878
Who are they for?

46
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,286
Mohammed Jafar. He`s foreman
of the Malaysian plant.

47
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,894
You`re the one person l know who
sucks up to the people below you.

48
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,692
Matt, don`t kick the seat.

49
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,957
- What`s on your tie?
- Toothpaste.

50
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,194
- Let`s go.
- Your tie shouldn`t look like a bib.

51
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,553
Hi, Cindy, what`s up?

52
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,063
Garvin came by the office this morning?

53
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,934
About the promotion?

54
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:34,068
Matt, will you stop that?

55
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,499
He was surprised l was late?
What does that mean?

56
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,941
Did he say it in passing,
or like he really meant it?

57
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,750
l wonder why Garvin came by
the office at 8 in the morning?

58
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,252
To congratulate you.

59
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,755
He treats everyone like dirt--

60
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,950
Except the top guys.

61
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,596
Except the top guys.

62
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:06,764
When this merger with
Conley-White goes through...

63
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,201
...and they spin off our division...

64
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,035
...we`re going to be rich.

65
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,608
We`re already rich.

66
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,039
No, l mean...

67
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,871
...really rich.

68
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,779
My grandmother used to say:

69
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:22,544
''Don`t climb up there too close
to God, He might shake the tree.''

70
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,063
Tom!

71
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,295
Thanks for this morning.

72
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,030
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

73
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,262
Remember
lugging the first ones around?

74
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:14,164
People were amazed. lt was like
showing a Polaroid to a bushman.

75
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,433
Now, if it`s bigger than a credit
card, it`s too inconvenient.

76
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,099
Keeps you on your toes.

77
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,837
Eddie, it`s Tom. Cindy said you called.

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,545
Sure, l can hold.

79
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,339
How`s the job search?

80
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,549
28 years at lBM. Did l
tell you what they told me?

81
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:33,452
l was ''surplussed.''
Ever hear that word?

82
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:36,185
What`s going on down there?

83
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,455
What? That`s crazy.

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,461
They should`ve said, ''sodomized.''

85
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:45,467
They`re not going to sell the
Austin plant. That`s just a rumor.

86
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,698
You don`t see it coming. You go along,
and then one day there`s no room.

87
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,705
No more room for you.

88
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,973
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

89
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,878
l won`t mention names. l`m just telling
you, it`s not true. lt`s a rumor.

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,711
l was making 150 a year. Big money.

91
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,314
lt`s probably what you make, huh?

92
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,821
Hang on.

93
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,982
Why don`t you call Cindy...

94
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,091
...make an appointment.
l`ll see if l can help.

95
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,989
Eddie, they are not
going to sell Austin.

96
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,102
lf l`m telling you, who else
are you going to believe?

97
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:19,896
Cindy.

98
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,895
Pretty name.

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,607
Used to have fun with the girls.
Nowadays they want your job.

100
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:07,314
Good morning.

101
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:10,216
- What did Garvin say? Should l see him?
- He didn`t say.

102
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,780
He growled.

103
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,220
He was flirting. Did you get Arthur?

104
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,223
He`s standing by on the DVL.

105
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,453
Lunch with Conley-White is at noon.

106
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:22,292
We`ll probably have those
sandwiches with the crusts cut off.

107
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,958
Their jaws were wired shut
at the same prep school.

108
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,966
The merger`s still happening?

109
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,061
You heard something?

110
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,404
No.

111
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,167
Just, l....

112
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:33,967
What`s on your tie?

113
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,903
Garvin didn`t mention my promotion?

114
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,742
You said you`d be early today.

115
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,316
People from ''Father of the Year''
didn`t call?

116
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,811
No.

117
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,687
That`s a joke.

118
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,182
5 seconds to Malaysia.

119
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,819
Should l close the door?

120
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:52,087
Do l ever ask that?

121
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,419
Never.

122
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,998
Malaysian video linkup.

123
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,761
You look good. Awake.

124
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,337
What`s wrong with Arcamax?

125
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:07,001
The drives are very slow. We`re
getting seek times in the 140-160 range.

126
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,772
140 isn`t a sexy CD player anymore.
Everyone has 140.

127
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,439
My guys think there`s a
compatibility problem...

128
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,212
...between the controller chip
and the driver`s software.

129
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,288
That`ll put us back a year.

130
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,223
The screen flickers. The current cuts
in and out. lt`s a design problem.

131
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:26,455
What do you mean?
All laptops have the same design.

132
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,032
l sent you out some drives.
You should get them today.

133
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:33,294
This is bad, Arthur.
How could this happen?

134
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,632
Going to bury it until the merger?

135
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,799
Don`t you say anything.
Does anyone else know?

136
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,968
l`m a grave. What,
are you kidding, Tom?

137
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:46,139
l still think, really, that
Arcamax will be a major, major hit.

138
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,751
l`ll call you when l see the drives.

139
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,547
Did you get the macadamia nuts?

140
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,154
Good night, Arthur.

141
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,151
They are so good.

142
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,759
He`s off the phone. l got to go.

143
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,827
Do you know a Meredith Johnson?

144
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,660
- Yes, years ago.
- She wanted to see you.

145
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,166
She`s here for the lunch.

146
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,566
The entire company came for this lunch?

147
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,070
Garvin brought up the Operations Group.

148
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,273
Meredith is in Operations?

149
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,573
What should l tell her?
Bad day, in-laws in town?

150
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,772
l`m going to see Lewyn about
the 900s. Stop worrying.

151
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,579
lf there was bad news Garvin
would`ve sent Phil Blackburn.

152
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:29,656
Phil.

153
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,921
Are you coming to see me?

154
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,922
No. Why?

155
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,794
Nothing. How are you?

156
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:40,028
How are you, Tom?
You look all beat up.

157
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,193
l do?

158
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,103
You`re letting it get to you.
Don`t take it personally.

159
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,867
Take what personally?

160
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,035
Maybe it`s just a rumor.

161
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,441
What`s a rumor?

162
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,051
l don`t want to spread rumors.
That`s how these things get started.

163
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,207
You mean Austin?

164
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,375
Who said that?

165
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,612
What am l missing?

166
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,055
l can`t believe he didn`t tell you.
He`s so perverse.

167
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,192
Tell me what?

168
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,220
So, how`s Susan?

169
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,620
Susan`s good.

170
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,322
- How`s Lonnie?
- Great.

171
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,834
- Did you know she got tenure?
- That`s great.

172
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,968
Here`s my stop.

173
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,238
l tried to explain to Garvin.

174
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,642
You know him, he`s like a child.

175
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:31,413
Fuck your feelings if they
interfere with his surprise.

176
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,081
- What surprise?
- Rumor is you`re getting passed over.

177
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,527
So l`m not getting the VP job?

178
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,654
That`s the rumor.

179
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,855
Rumors are always true.

180
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,364
Garvin didn`t say anything?

181
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,493
Came by the office. l was late,
Susan had a conference.

182
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,105
- You were late? Today?
- Why`re you in Seattle?

183
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,865
Good to see you again.

184
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:01,614
Somebody tells Garvin l was talking to
you.... You know how he is about leaks.

185
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,116
Leak? l thought it was a rumor.

186
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,951
lt was different before.
l could watch your back.

187
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,525
Who gets the job, Stephanie Kaplan?

188
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,890
Rumor is he went outside the group.

189
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,624
You`d still head up Manufacturing...

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,028
...presumably.

191
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:20,796
Wait a minute.

192
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,901
l might be out of a job?

193
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,631
Don`t get paranoid.

194
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,970
l`m a quick learner.

195
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,308
You wouldn`t make someone VP and
not let them appoint their own team.

196
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,211
How would that look?

197
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,051
Am l out of a job?

198
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,649
Come on, Tom.

199
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,821
l`m already out on a limb.

200
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,434
Are you okay? You want a Prozac?

201
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:55,664
No, l`m fine.

202
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:58,667
l`m disappointed, but l`m fine.

203
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,506
You sure?

204
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,013
Don`t worry about me. l`m a
stockholder. Whatever`s...

205
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,745
...best for the company...

206
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:38,209
Leave a message for Susan, Tom,
Matt and Eliza, after the beep.

207
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,043
Thanks for calling. Bye.

208
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,288
- Obviously, he`s disappointed.
- But he took it well?

209
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,620
Overall, l`d say yes.

210
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:55,232
No bumps before the merger.
l don`t want him quitting.

211
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,889
lt`s up to you.

212
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,502
Just one big happy family.

213
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,899
You got that?

214
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:06,141
l have to say, going down to see
him this morning was a masterstroke.

215
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,808
lt really put him on the defensive.

216
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,742
l`ll keep an eye on him.

217
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,644
He`ll get on the program.

218
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,581
When push comes to shove,
he has no guts.

219
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,324
Let me ask you something.
You know Susan.

220
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,528
lf l heard a rumor about the...

221
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,658
...future of the company...

222
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,664
...my future...

223
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,768
...you know, nothing crazy,
a real rumor...

224
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,102
...what would Susan say?
You think she`d say to see Garvin?

225
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:01,789
Here`s someone you should meet.

226
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,364
Tom Sanders. He heads up Manufacturing.

227
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:07,128
Steven Chase, Crescent Capital.
John Conley.

228
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,464
You`re John Conley?

229
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,367
Junior. Dad`s coming on Friday
with members of the Board.

230
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,474
- Catch you at the lunch.
- Tom, come in.

231
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,375
You wanted to see me.

232
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:21,642
Yeah, sorry about this morning.
You know how kids are.

233
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,310
Have you met Meredith Johnson?

234
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,716
What`s wrong? That`s a
hello you`d give to a rash.

235
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,156
l`m preoccupied. lt`s not you.

236
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,659
We go way back. He broke my heart.

237
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,388
She`s making that up.

238
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:37,226
l thought your heart
was made of plastic.

239
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,232
He said l could be anything l wanted.

240
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,394
- He was right.
- lt was a line.

241
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:44,005
- lt wasn`t a line.
- l didn`t know you were acquainted.

242
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,838
Wilde said, ''l like a man with a
future and a woman with a past.''

243
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,673
l heard you were in Operations.

244
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:53,012
l don`t know. Am l?

245
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,617
The last few years l`ve been cleaning
up the mess Bob made of this company.

246
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:01,523
lf it`s such a mess, why am l so rich?

247
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,683
Yes, but you`re a lot richer now.

248
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,852
We should catch up. Get together.

249
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,122
l`d love that.

250
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,925
Plenty of time now.

251
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,529
Flying over Wyoming, l
thought the merger was dead.

252
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:17,265
Conley was choking on the valuation.
The spin-off was Meredith`s idea.

253
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,932
Conley thinks it was their idea.

254
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,941
- Really?
- Lit them up like a Christmas tree.

255
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,375
She saved the merger.

256
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:27,640
You have money now.
You can even buy a new tie.

257
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,884
So, what was it you
wanted to see me about?

258
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,160
Meredith-fucking-Johnson!
Son-of-a-bitch. Goddamn Garvin.

259
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,355
- What happened?
- l didn`t get it.

260
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,591
- You`re not the new VP?
- He announced it?

261
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,702
lt was a secret. He`s got
her installed in the office...

262
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,862
...bouncing quips back and forth.

263
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,869
Who?

264
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,440
- Who`s she?
- Will this affect the spin-off?

265
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,376
She doesn`t know the difference
between software and a sweater.

266
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,037
What aren`t you telling us?

267
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:02,276
l might be out of a job.
You know what it`s like out there?

268
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:03,943
What about the spin-off?

269
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:08,387
They didn`t tell me about me!
Would they tell me about the spin-off?!

270
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,385
l`m sorry.

271
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:16,464
This is the worst day of my life.
All right?

272
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,394
Who is she?

273
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,400
Let me guess: attractive?

274
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:22,071
What does that matter?

275
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,139
Nipples like pencil erasers?

276
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:26,469
She`s attractive. Very attractive.

277
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:27,906
Sleeping with Garvin?

278
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,807
That`s why he got a Nordic Track.

279
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,642
lt`s a curse to be me.
Life holds no surprises.

280
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,647
This is such a cliche.

281
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,479
How do you think a
cliche becomes a cliche?

282
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,748
You mean like, ''Size doesn`t matter''?

283
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,419
l have a thing for you.

284
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:45,585
All right, please, can
we get some work done?

285
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:48,254
We got a small problem with Arcamax.

286
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:50,332
- lt`s not the design.
- lt`s not the code.

287
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,938
Any woman must be twice as good as
a man and work harder for less pay.

288
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,936
Cliche grande.

289
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:59,007
How does a cliche become one?

290
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:02,612
lt is very weird. We know
nothing about this woman.

291
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,610
l do.

292
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,508
l had a thing with her.

293
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,781
You are amazing.

294
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:09,942
lt was years ago.

295
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:12,618
You`ve seen more ass than a rental car.

296
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:16,019
Get a few more women in your
life so you can be a census.

297
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,123
Maybe you can sleep your way up.

298
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:19,451
Right.

299
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,690
Wait, why? Why her and not Tom?
He`s not attractive?

300
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,697
Men and women are different.

301
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,460
Not in a way that matters to you.

302
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,029
Are you saying l`m a virgin?

303
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,082
Meanwhile, you were asking
me about the spin-off.

304
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,681
Garvin said it was her idea.

305
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,593
lt`s always such a
pleasure to come here...

306
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,291
...and be with the
Advanced Products Group.

307
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,200
l feel such a warmth
for the people here.

308
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,207
l feel a kinship. And l`ve
always wanted to give you...

309
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,867
ls this seat taken?

310
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,204
...the most advanced original
leadership that l could.

311
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,816
How are you?

312
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,614
- Sorry you didn`t get the promotion.
- l`m sorry you didn`t get it either.

313
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,220
How long have you known?

314
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,218
Really? That long?

315
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:27,392
Every time l`ve wanted
to promote a woman...

316
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,464
...to break the glass ceiling...

317
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:31,828
...it`s always the same story:

318
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:34,233
''But, Bob.... But, Bob....''

319
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:40,076
l`ve thought about it often since my
daughter`s death, that had she lived...

320
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,474
...it would be extremely rare...

321
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:44,910
...that she ever got to run a company.

322
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,847
So it has a special meaning
for me when l tell you...

323
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,147
...that when we announce the merger...

324
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,490
...we will also announce the new VP
for Advanced Operations and Planning...

325
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,752
...in Seattle...

326
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,987
...will be Meredith Johnson.

327
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,998
Unbelievable.

328
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:16,005
Thanks, Bob. Can l have the lights?

329
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:27,489
The Advanced Products Group has been the
heart of DigiCom for the last 10 years.

330
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,689
Advanced Products has historically
consisted of 4 divisions:

331
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:35,392
You seem to be spending
more time up here.

332
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:39,525
My son`s a freshman at the university.
This way l get to see more of him.

333
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:42,137
l thought it had to do with the merger.

334
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,130
This merger means everything to Garvin.

335
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,643
Give a man a $100 million and you
create a frustrated billionaire.

336
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,780
The new compression algorithms
will shift industry standards...

337
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,011
...to full-res digitized
video at 60 fields a second...

338
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,518
...with platform-independent
RlSC processors supported by...

339
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,352
...a 32-bit color-active...

340
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,016
Conley`s a conservative company.

341
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,686
ls Meredith conservative?

342
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,462
l don`t know.

343
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,695
l thought you knew her.

344
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:14,468
ls there anything you don`t know?

345
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,363
We offer, through technology...

346
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,136
...what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered:

347
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,142
Freedom from the physical body.

348
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,040
Freedom from race and gender...

349
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:30,312
...from nationality and personality,
from place and time.

350
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:33,251
Communicating by cellular
phone and hand-held computer...

351
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,755
...PDA and built-in fax modem...

352
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,951
...we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness.

353
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,360
Smart, touching base with
all the division heads.

354
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,029
She didn`t name them in her speech.

355
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,874
Does it mean something?

356
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:56,712
Only if she plans to make changes.

357
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,048
Phil said she wasn`t planning
on making any changes.

358
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,686
You know Meredith.

359
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,218
Wait a minute.

360
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,553
l must know, am l out of a job?

361
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,060
What was she bending your ear about?

362
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,495
Stephanie? Nothing. Just small talk.

363
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:19,397
What, all of a sudden
there`s Stephanie Lite?

364
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,801
She was talking about her
son at the university.

365
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:25,304
Sorry l didn`t get to mention you.

366
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,407
That`s fine.

367
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,637
l`m jammed all day but why
don`t you come up at 7?

368
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:32,509
We`ll have a drink and
catch up on business.

369
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,076
Great.

370
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,015
l remember how you liked a good
bottle of wine. l`ll get one.

371
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,654
What`s she want
to see you at 7 about?

372
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,597
Probably the Arcamax problems. We must
discuss it before Conley asks questions.

373
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,668
She doesn`t give you a boner?

374
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:56,829
Because, you know,
l definitely have lift-off.

375
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,940
What about you? You got a woody?

376
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,542
She`s very nice.

377
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,168
- l`ll let you know what happens.
- Don`t do that.

378
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:07,181
You have a sexual urge every
20 minutes. lt`s a physical certainty.

379
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,681
lt`s hard-wired into your brain.

380
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:13,619
You can`t fight it. Why would
you want to? Live a little.

381
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,782
Ten years from now you`ll need
a forklift to get a hard on.

382
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,621
l`ll call you.

383
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,126
l`ll count the minutes.

384
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,299
Where`ve you been all day?

385
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,363
l didn`t get it.

386
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:34,476
No, they went outside the division.
Someone from Operations.

387
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,873
What can l say? l got passed over.

388
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,715
What can l say?

389
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,714
So, did you get the
tickets for Disneyland?

390
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,988
No, l know, but l promised
the guy and it`s...

391
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,491
Mohammed Jafar.

392
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,828
Thanks a lot. Probably won`t
be home for dinner tonight.

393
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,164
l love you too. Bye.

394
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,024
Are there any asset sale triggers?

395
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:57,885
ln the indenture?

396
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,290
Will you do me a favor?

397
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,663
Alan, Brown will go 250 on this, easy.

398
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:09,169
Let`s just do this thing.

399
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,675
Not a bad idea for a girl.

400
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,312
Let`s talk first thing.

401
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:18,675
`91 Pahlmeyer.

402
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,476
l`ve looked all over for it.

403
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,413
l like all the boys
under me to be happy.

404
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:25,420
Congratulations.

405
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:26,914
Thank you.

406
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,428
l brought the files up for
Arcamax if you want to see them.

407
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,429
Show me your pictures.

408
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,931
The diagrams?

409
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,194
Your family. You have pictures?

410
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,599
Yeah, sure.

411
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,935
Here`s.... Here.

412
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,008
That`s Matthew.
That`s Eliza at Halloween.

413
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:57,345
And here`s Susan with the kids.

414
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,518
She looks like she always
has food in the refrigerator.

415
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:04,455
- She never lost the baby weight--
- She doesn`t look like a refrigerator.

416
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,789
l mean, she`s made a home for you.

417
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,627
ln my fridge l`ve got some
champagne and an orange.

418
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,359
Doesn`t Eliza look pretty?

419
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,126
She looks like Susan.

420
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,866
lt can be inhibiting.

421
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,475
- What`s that?
- Domesticity.

422
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:22,242
You`d be surprised.

423
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:24,741
You can`t jump her from behind...

424
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:29,045
...because you get excited by the
way she bends to pick up the soap.

425
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,247
Remember that?

426
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:33,887
l remember that.

427
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,388
And you miss it.

428
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,159
There`s compensations.

429
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,560
Of course. Life`s a
series of trade-offs.

430
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:44,825
l wouldn`t trade what l have.

431
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,835
l wouldn`t want you to.
That`s exactly why l can trust you.

432
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,398
You have more to lose than l do.

433
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,416
l`ll bring you up to speed on
the problems with the drives.

434
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:04,019
You kept in good shape, Tom.

435
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,083
Nice and hard.

436
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,421
Thank you.

437
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:22,896
lt`s different now.

438
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,831
You`re my boss.

439
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:27,676
lt`s different.

440
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:32,670
Okay.

441
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:36,016
Rub my shoulders and l`ll
listen to your problems.

442
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:53,766
The specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds.

443
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:57,771
We have that on the prototypes.
But the drives coming off-line--

444
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,375
- Are the drives here?
- lt might be a chip.

445
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:02,876
- Answer my question.
- l`m trying to.

446
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:07,774
Understand the controller chip
positions the split optics.

447
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:09,282
l`ll show you the schematic.

448
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:11,215
No, no, no, no. Rub.

449
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:18,784
You can`t understand the problem--

450
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:21,055
- Do you have the drives?
- Arthur sent 5--

451
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,957
- l said no calls.
- lt`s Mr. Garvin.

452
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,625
But after that, nobody.

453
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,131
ls it all right if l leave for the day?

454
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:30,967
That`s fine, Mrs. Ross.

455
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,582
You`d rather talk about other things...

456
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,583
...than answer my question
because you don`t know.

457
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:47,814
You don`t know what the problem is.
But you can`t say, ''l don`t know''...

458
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:52,655
...because in your mind that means
you lose. You`re worthless. Men!

459
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:55,764
- What will you tell Conley?
- l can`t lie to them.

460
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:59,095
Talk about the prototypes. They work.

461
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:00,827
Focus on the positive.

462
00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:03,768
We`re on-line. lt`s not
about the prototypes.

463
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,774
- They want to know if you can build it.
- l understand that--

464
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,105
Do you have a problem working for me?

465
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:12,337
No.

466
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:15,849
Hi, Bob.

467
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,283
You don`t want to hear
about my hard day.

468
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,191
Yes, that`s hard work.

469
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,860
Let me get my docs together.

470
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:32,193
The merger is about people, not Arcamax.
They`re comfortable with me and Bob.

471
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:36,203
This isn`t about some CD-ROM
that`ll be obsolete in a year.

472
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,399
lf they ask, then you
tell them you don`t know.

473
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,199
Hi, Bob, l`m here.

474
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:43,537
l`ve got a great idea about that.

475
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:45,203
Go ahead.

476
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:49,641
Lewyn, this is Sanders.

477
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:54,722
l`ve discussed the drives with Meredith.
She says don`t tell the Conley people...

478
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:57,826
...until we know exactly
what the problems are.

479
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:01,486
That is the line for the 8 a.m.
meeting tomorrow--

480
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,061
Let`s get down to business.

481
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:08,164
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Meredith, wait a second.

482
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:16,906
- There, was that so bad?
- That`s not so bad, it`s just--

483
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:21,509
Come on, while there`s still
a chance we might get caught.

484
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:24,743
No, no.

485
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:27,088
Oh, yes, l think so.

486
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,022
Some things never change, and
some things just get better.

487
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,758
Meredith, come on.

488
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,369
- Remember all the things we did?
- l remember.

489
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:50,875
Things nobody knows about you but me.

490
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,543
All our secrets.

491
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:01,450
Just lie back and let me take you.

492
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,783
l could have anybody and l picked you.

493
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:08,123
Now you`ve got all the power.

494
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,567
You`ve got something l want.

495
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:23,070
Doesn`t that make you feel good?

496
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:27,406
Don`t stop me. Come on.

497
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,651
Don`t worry, l`m not going to bite.

498
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:34,646
Let me do whatever l want.

499
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:39,258
You just lie back and
let me be the boss.

500
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:03,116
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

501
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:05,783
What?

502
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:08,515
Look, nobody has to know.

503
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:10,352
Nobody gets hurt.

504
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:14,119
lt`s just a meeting
between two colleagues.

505
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:17,858
Just another dull day in
the computer business.

506
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,469
No, honey.

507
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:33,871
Don`t!

508
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,312
Here.

509
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,315
- Want to get fucked?
- Do it.

510
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:43,982
ls that what you want?

511
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:46,655
Come on.

512
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:48,887
ls that what you want?

513
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,069
You just stay hard.

514
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,669
Oh, God.

515
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:20,586
You bad boy.

516
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:24,093
Come on, baby.

517
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,715
Come on. You going to fuck me?
You going to fuck me?!

518
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:46,112
Put it in.

519
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,458
God, look at us.

520
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:54,454
Go inside me.

521
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:55,953
Come on.

522
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,294
- l can`t do this.
- Do it.

523
00:32:58,468 --> 00:32:59,400
l won`t.

524
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:00,398
Now!

525
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,629
- l`m not going to do this!
- Now!

526
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,295
You can`t just stop!

527
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,806
- Come on.
- No! Goddamn!

528
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:21,087
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

529
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:25,657
This never happened.

530
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,490
You never used to be this way.

531
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:35,832
l have a family now.

532
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:38,505
A family made you stupid.

533
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:43,938
You take those two champagne
bottles in your refrigerator...

534
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:45,444
...and fuck them.

535
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:50,008
You son-of-a-bitch.

536
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:54,118
You get back here and
finish what you started.

537
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,450
You hear me?

538
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:56,624
Do you?

539
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:59,961
Come back and finish what
you started or you are dead!

540
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:02,290
You are fucking dead!

541
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:14,763
Shit, it`s dead.

542
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,475
You are hereby notified that we
will hold your client liable--

543
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:57,137
l didn`t hear you come in.

544
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,142
l`m going to take a shower.

545
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:02,250
- No kiss?
- l just feel kind of shitty, you know.

546
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,817
Screw them.

547
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:07,818
- They don`t deserve you.
- Can you get me a beer?

548
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:30,109
Thanks. Before l forget,
could you do me a favor?

549
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,008
The cellular`s battery`s dead.

550
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,275
Sure. l thought they were
supposed to last all day?

551
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:36,611
l thought so.

552
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:39,116
Who`s Meredith Johnson?

553
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:40,346
What?

554
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,615
Meredith Johnson.

555
00:36:43,192 --> 00:36:45,626
She called just before you got home.

556
00:36:46,863 --> 00:36:48,194
She called?

557
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:50,525
Yeah, about 10 minutes ago.

558
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:56,968
She said the 8 a.m.
had been pushed back to 8:30.

559
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,871
- Who is she?
- She`s the one, the new VP.

560
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:02,806
She`s the one?

561
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,970
She came from the Valley.

562
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:06,474
How old is she?

563
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:09,209
l don`t know. 33, maybe.

564
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,376
That`s young for that job.

565
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,883
- Had you ever heard of her?
- She`s a face guy.

566
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:19,892
She made the merger happen. Now
she`s Garvin`s fair-haired...whatever.

567
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:25,729
Where`d she come from?
Has she any technical background?

568
00:37:25,902 --> 00:37:29,338
No. That`s the thing with the merger.
Everything`s changed.

569
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:33,334
That`s not the worst thing in the world.
She`ll crash and burn.

570
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,067
Then they`ll appreciate you.

571
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:37,405
Things aren`t easy out there.

572
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,172
So quit...

573
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,912
...rather than let them treat you badly.

574
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:45,019
We might lose everything,
including the stock options.

575
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,247
l don`t care about stock options.

576
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:48,685
l`ll work full-time.

577
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:51,349
l`m capable of supporting our family.

578
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:52,858
Just trying to help.

579
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,363
You`re too nice sometimes.

580
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,932
l don`t need you to fight
my battles for me, thanks.

581
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:04,600
Right now some lucky girl in
the building will come after me.

582
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,772
l deserve that, but ask yourself...

583
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:13,047
...why does a man go with another
girl? He`s unhappy at home.

584
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,116
Because he`s lonely.

585
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:18,444
But that was before you, Fran.
l`ve stopped running.

586
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:23,392
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?
You never do.

587
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:26,119
l don`t know. Just a little cold.

588
00:38:27,964 --> 00:38:29,795
What are you going to do?

589
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:33,795
Grin and bear it, like l usually do.

590
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,337
And hope it doesn`t get worse.

591
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,547
Morning.

592
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:54,951
Morning, Bob.

593
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,117
That`s a nice suit.

594
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:02,360
Nice fabric.

595
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,296
Can l feel it?

596
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:07,863
What is that? Wool?

597
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,061
With a little bit of viscose.

598
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:13,669
That`s what makes the
pants drape so well.

599
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:17,710
You work out?

600
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,646
When l get a chance, Bob.
lt`s been busy lately.

601
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,644
l`ve always liked you.

602
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,660
Now you have the power.

603
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,327
You have something l want.

604
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,430
Come on.

605
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:58,486
The computer takes the
information from the database...

606
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:02,055
...and constructs an environment
that is projected in the headset.

607
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:05,216
When the user walks on
the pad, he or she...

608
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:10,161
...feels like they`re walking in a hall
with drawers of files on all sides.

609
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,665
The user can stop, open any file...

610
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:17,499
...and look at the data. The laser
scanners are for body representation.

611
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:19,903
- That`s amazing.
- lt`s cool, isn`t it?

612
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:27,407
Where is everyone?

613
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:30,916
They left 15 minutes ago.
Don Cherry`s demo-ing the Corridor.

614
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:32,679
The meeting`s at 8:30.

615
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:36,518
No, 7:30. lt got pushed up.
Nobody told you?

616
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:41,095
lf someone wants to log on with a
regular computer, what they`ll see...

617
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:46,694
...is a model of themselves with a
photo that`s pulled up from a data file.

618
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,262
Hey, l know you.

619
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:52,430
The photo bears some
resemblance to me, l admit.

620
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,275
An inside joke here at the company.

621
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:57,776
We`ve also constructed virtual help.

622
00:40:57,947 --> 00:41:00,211
Users always need on-line help.

623
00:41:00,383 --> 00:41:02,283
We created an angel to help you.

624
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:08,287
Welcome to the Corridor.

625
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:11,283
The same face.

626
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:13,121
Angel...

627
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:16,126
...how do l open this drawer?

628
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:18,126
What`s the angel saying?

629
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,131
That`s between them.

630
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:23,895
We don`t see the Corridor as a
product in the marketplace now.

631
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:27,634
This is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential...

632
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,801
...of virtual reality technology.

633
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,470
This looks good.

634
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,482
Hold on. What`s that?

635
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:38,745
l believe it`s your financial records.

636
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,822
Turn that damn thing off.

637
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:42,821
Sorry.

638
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:47,756
ln the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access.

639
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:52,990
So glad you could join us.

640
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,102
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.

641
00:41:56,272 --> 00:42:01,005
Did the ferry hit an iceberg? You were
going to call me after meeting Meredith.

642
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:04,442
l called you from her office.
Left a message.

643
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:08,447
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you`re late again.

644
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:10,847
Thank God Meredith
led the discussion.

645
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:15,518
Hey, pal, l left a message
on your machine, all right?

646
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:17,181
Check it out.

647
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:19,454
Did you get my message?

648
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:23,290
You told Susan the meeting
had been moved to 8:30.

649
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:28,301
l said 7:30. lf your wife can`t take
a fucking message, get a machine.

650
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:39,537
- There you go, Mr. Sanders.
- Thank you.

651
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:41,046
You`re welcome.

652
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,382
Full house today.

653
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:52,322
Meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the Arcamax.

654
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:54,486
We`d like your read on it.

655
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,394
Meredith said there are problems.

656
00:42:57,566 --> 00:43:00,160
You might have to go back
to the drawing board.

657
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:04,905
l`m sorry if l conveyed that
impression to Meredith.

658
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,904
l`m convinced we can
manufacture them.

659
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:10,341
How many of the drives meet specs?

660
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,238
l don`t have that information with me.

661
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:17,909
Meredith told us the line is running
at 29%. ls that approximately right?

662
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:20,746
The seek times are off-specs.

663
00:43:20,923 --> 00:43:23,915
There`s a power flicker in the screen?

664
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,089
- Right?
- That`s right.

665
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:29,527
With the merger impending,
shouldn`t you have told someone?

666
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:33,361
The merger isn`t about a CD-ROM
that might be obsolete in a year.

667
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:35,367
lt`s about people.

668
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:39,269
- lt`ll be obsolete in a year?
- The promise of the Arcamax...

669
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:42,103
...was a central factor in this merger.

670
00:43:42,278 --> 00:43:45,873
l may be at fault. Tom said the
problem with the drives was serious.

671
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:46,946
Not so serious.

672
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:48,105
Don`t cover up.

673
00:43:48,284 --> 00:43:51,276
- l`m not covering anything up.
- Give us worst case.

674
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:55,389
We go back to the drawing boards
and we`re down for 9 months.

675
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,047
Nine months?

676
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,716
Meredith said 6 weeks.

677
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:04,059
Nobody likes to go back to the board,
but it can be an advantage.

678
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,063
ls there a problem?

679
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:09,227
This isn`t an inquisition.
l feel like l`m pulling teeth.

680
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:13,569
John just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines.

681
00:44:15,077 --> 00:44:18,569
- l don`t know is the honest answer.
- Wait a minute.

682
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:21,641
You are head of Manufacturing.

683
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:25,412
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...

684
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:29,922
...that could take 9 months to fix,
which l assume means a year.

685
00:44:30,092 --> 00:44:31,753
And the bottom line is...

686
00:44:32,428 --> 00:44:34,259
...you don`t know?

687
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:36,964
Goddamn it!

688
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,290
Goddamn it!

689
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,026
Jesus Christ!

690
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:50,201
l wanted to see you. lt`s not
going to work out with Meredith.

691
00:44:50,412 --> 00:44:52,642
- Evidently not.
- She set me up.

692
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,543
l saw.

693
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:55,650
- She set me up.
- Sit down.

694
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,981
- Why? What`d l do?
- Please, would you just sit.

695
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:05,217
Meredith told me about
your meeting last night.

696
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:06,416
What?

697
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,064
What`d she say?

698
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:15,062
She wants to handle the intervention
internally, which is best.

699
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:18,502
- She still cares about you.
- Wait a minute.

700
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,566
What`d she say?

701
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:25,075
Not to put too fine a point on it,
she said you sexually harassed her.

702
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,176
l sexually harassed her?

703
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,951
- What would you call it?
- She jumped me.

704
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,452
She jumped you? You`re in denial.
That`s typical.

705
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:37,252
She almost raped me.

706
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:40,257
You need help. You must
accept responsibility for--

707
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:41,690
What about this?

708
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,195
What about that?

709
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,258
Looks like she defended herself.

710
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:50,871
Defended herself? The woman can
kick the shit out of both of us!

711
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,873
- lt may have seemed different to you.
- l didn`t harass her.

712
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,601
She harassed me.

713
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:58,474
l`ve never heard of a
woman harassing a man.

714
00:45:58,614 --> 00:45:59,876
Why`re you here?

715
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,109
- l`m here as your friend.
- My ass, you`re my friend.

716
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:08,120
When Garvin finds out about this, he`ll
want to throw you out on your ass.

717
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,383
Let`s keep this quiet.

718
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:15,256
That`s what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.

719
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:17,262
Want your wife to find out?

720
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,424
We`ll have to tell her at some point.

721
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:23,367
They`ll get the whole thing and it`ll
be on the front page of the paper!

722
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:26,269
l`m offering you a chance
to make a new life.

723
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:29,275
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.

724
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:33,210
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.

725
00:46:33,382 --> 00:46:36,613
When you say lateral, you
mean out of the division.

726
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:38,716
You can`t stay here.

727
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:41,614
She`s scared out of her wits.

728
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,727
l`m not leaving this division. l spent
10 years here. l built this place.

729
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:49,554
Now, we got a spin-off going on--

730
00:46:49,798 --> 00:46:52,130
We`re thinking, you know, Austin.

731
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:53,961
Austin?

732
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:56,737
l told him what she said.

733
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:58,735
He said the opposite happened.

734
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:01,568
He said she harassed him.

735
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:03,744
What?

736
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:04,970
He denies it?

737
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:07,581
You know, the man always denies it.

738
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,081
ls he crazy?

739
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,242
l offered him a move to Austin.

740
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,652
To Austin. That`s like a duck making
a lateral move to ''à l`orange.''

741
00:47:15,924 --> 00:47:17,824
He`s too smart for that.

742
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:20,985
Let`s hope he`s smart enough
to see he has no options.

743
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:22,653
Take care of this.

744
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:27,325
This is a bomb we`re sitting on
that can blow everything sky-high.

745
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:32,338
Meredith is key to the merger. l can`t
have her involved in a sex scandal.

746
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:36,103
And l won`t say good-bye to
$100 million. You got that?

747
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:38,610
l get the picture, Bob.

748
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:35,295
10th floor. Down the hall and right.

749
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,896
There were no witnesses?

750
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,563
Her assistant left earlier in the night.

751
00:49:46,742 --> 00:49:50,974
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
l don`t know what she heard.

752
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:54,309
- Did you report that to anyone?
- ln the morning, yeah.

753
00:49:54,483 --> 00:49:56,576
What was the company`s response?

754
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:59,653
They believed her.
They suggested l transfer to Austin.

755
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:01,482
l heard they`re selling Austin.

756
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:06,321
The point is, if l go to Austin,
l lose everything, all right?

757
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:09,658
My stock options,
everything that l worked for.

758
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:11,822
Did you call anyone
after the incident?

759
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,932
No.

760
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,762
Did you tell your wife?

761
00:50:14,937 --> 00:50:15,926
Oh, boy.

762
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:17,162
Why not?

763
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:22,443
l didn`t want to upset her. l felt
guilty being in that situation at all.

764
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:25,511
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?

765
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:29,947
She`s very pretty. She was
Miss Teenage New Mexico.

766
00:50:30,118 --> 00:50:31,517
So you kissed.

767
00:50:32,354 --> 00:50:35,687
Yes. And then she began to...rub me.

768
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:37,188
Rub you where?

769
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:40,860
You know....

770
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:44,460
Your penis?

771
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,860
Yes.

772
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:47,799
And?

773
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:52,804
l`m uncomfortable talking about it.

774
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:57,040
- Because l`m a woman?
- You act like it`s a game.

775
00:50:57,212 --> 00:51:00,545
- Why are you here?
- l want to know what my options are.

776
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:02,047
What your options are?

777
00:51:02,217 --> 00:51:05,983
l want to know whether l can
sue her for sexual harassment.

778
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:08,213
To do that you must convince a jury...

779
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,326
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said, ''no.''

780
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:14,656
Sexual harassment...

781
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,889
...is not about sex.

782
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,566
lt is about power.

783
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:21,163
She has it...

784
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:22,735
...you don`t.

785
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:26,336
lf you sue, you`ll never get
another job in computers.

786
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:31,411
lf you don`t, you`ll go to Austin. Sue,
and it`s news. Don`t sue, it`s gossip.

787
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,572
lf you sue, no one will believe you.
lf you don`t, your wife won`t.

788
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,244
They`ll make your life hell for the
3 years until the case goes to trial.

789
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:44,256
And, for that privilege, it`ll
cost you a minimum of $100,000.

790
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:47,860
Do you not think it`s
a game, Mr. Sanders?

791
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,691
lt`s a game to them.

792
00:51:50,098 --> 00:51:52,259
How do you feel about losing?

793
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,539
That`s what Meredith wants.

794
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:08,444
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.

795
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:20,125
They said she`s not going
to press charges. Why?

796
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:24,129
She`s accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?

797
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:27,291
Meredith didn`t press charges...

798
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:29,297
...because she couldn`t.

799
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:31,962
DigiCom is planning a
merger with Conley-White.

800
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,574
lt is supposed to happen Friday.

801
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:38,406
They think that we are as
conservative as they are.

802
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,313
With a scandal, Conley goes to bed with
Katie Couric, wakes up to Jessica Hahn.

803
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:45,749
Garvin is out $100 million.

804
00:52:46,088 --> 00:52:48,989
l think we might make a
plaintiff out of this guy yet.

805
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:53,821
No, a potential plaintiff. l don`t
have to sue. l just threaten to sue.

806
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:57,658
That`s a dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?

807
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,828
Fuck them.

808
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,093
Now you`re talking my language.

809
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:02,934
For the next 3 days...

810
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:07,337
...this loose cannon is in a
position to apply a lot of pressure.

811
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:11,172
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.

812
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,414
Call security. Throw
him out on the sidewalk.

813
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,485
We have to appear to be impartial.

814
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,420
Keep him in his job, keep
paying him, no hassles.

815
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,926
l made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?

816
00:53:28,063 --> 00:53:30,224
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.

817
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:34,994
He`ll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don`t fire Meredith.

818
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:39,068
lf he files, it becomes public.
lt`d blow the deal.

819
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:42,836
We realize that. So does he.
He`s blackmailing us.

820
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,172
This is America, goddamn it.

821
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,680
The legal system is supposed
to protect people like me.

822
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,511
lt gets worse.

823
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:52,686
His lawyer is...

824
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,344
...Catherine Alvarez.

825
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:59,460
Great. She`d change her name to ''TV
Listings'' just to get it in the paper.

826
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:03,189
l`m trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.

827
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,962
Mediate?

828
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,467
l want you to cut his balls off.

829
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,695
Did he say mediate or
split the difference?

830
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:15,604
l`m just hoping he`ll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.

831
00:54:15,777 --> 00:54:18,473
He`ll agree.
He doesn`t want this public.

832
00:54:18,613 --> 00:54:21,707
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.

833
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,541
Really? He hasn`t told his wife yet.

834
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:27,783
How do you know?

835
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,287
l know Sanders, remember?

836
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:31,982
He likes secrets.

837
00:54:41,002 --> 00:54:43,061
- l`ll be in diagnostics.
- Where were you?

838
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,001
They`re pulling the drives apart.

839
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,574
- John Levin called.
- John Levin with Sematach?

840
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,902
He said it`s important.

841
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,245
- Why didn`t they come this morning?
- Susan called about the benefit.

842
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,077
- Call her and say--
- She said don`t try to cancel.

843
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,085
- The Lewyns paid for the tickets.
- l`ll be there at 7:30.

844
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,314
Ask her to bring me
a shirt and jacket.

845
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,756
ls everything okay?

846
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,588
Everything is fine, thanks for asking.

847
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,524
l`ll kill Arthur.

848
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:16,535
We must solve this before Friday
and you just got the drives?!

849
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:18,662
What is Arthur doing over there?

850
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,103
All he does anymore is give
macadamia nuts to people.

851
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,541
ls he a manager or a stewardess?

852
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,342
- He gave you nuts?
- What`s slowing it down?

853
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,349
Over here.

854
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:32,179
Let me show you something.

855
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,615
Arthur was right.

856
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,849
There`s a compatibility problem
with the controller chip.

857
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:39,287
ls it a bug?

858
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,555
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.

859
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:44,460
Fabrication problem?

860
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,360
What`re you doing?

861
00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:51,134
This is a sophisticated piece of
electronics, not a pickup truck.

862
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,867
How bad is it? We have 4,000
of these. Should l junk them all?

863
00:55:55,577 --> 00:56:00,480
l told Arthur to send 10 in heat-sealed
plastic bags. lt`s a hunch l have.

864
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,209
Do what you can.
l don`t understand it.

865
00:56:03,385 --> 00:56:07,651
ln prototypes, no problem.
ln manufacturing, it falls apart.

866
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,383
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.

867
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,985
Catherine Alvarez on two.

868
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,491
Thanks. Could you close the door?

869
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,612
How are you?

870
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:37,178
Let`s agree to mediate.
l don`t want this getting out either.

871
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,863
lf we get this all over in a week,
my wife needn`t know.

872
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,772
l do not want to tell my wife. l don`t
want to upset her if l don`t have to.

873
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:25,227
Wait a second.

874
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:43,310
Guess what?

875
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,248
They locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files.

876
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:50,586
l guess it`s starting.

877
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,594
Come in.

878
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:57,823
l`m not interrupting?

879
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,694
No, not at all.

880
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:13,947
Going down?

881
00:58:16,518 --> 00:58:19,112
Don`t tell me you`re scared of me.

882
00:58:27,862 --> 00:58:29,625
l don`t want it to be this way.

883
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,232
Yeah, we could be fucking right now.

884
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,359
- l think of you as a friend.
- Oh, come off it!

885
00:58:35,537 --> 00:58:36,469
You called Blackburn--

886
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,539
Only to beat you to the punch.
l knew you`d play that card.

887
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:42,869
l wasn`t playing a card.
You were the one that--

888
00:58:43,044 --> 00:58:44,739
Alarm.

889
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,810
This isn`t a game.

890
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:53,646
You`d have a great job, the spin-off
would make you a millionaire.

891
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,256
We`d have fun.
lt`s not like breaking rocks.

892
00:58:56,558 --> 00:58:58,048
You don`t get it.

893
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,826
Poor Sanders. You have no
idea what you`re up against.

894
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,662
As usual.

895
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,896
By this time tomorrow you`ll
wish you took the Austin job.

896
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:09,497
We`ll see.

897
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,604
We`ll see.

898
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:17,272
l`m trying to figure out whether
to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.

899
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:19,573
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?

900
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:22,011
lt`s called ''Happy to Be Me Barbie.''

901
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,175
Does she come with the
''Happy to Be Divorced Ken''?

902
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,014
l`m serious.

903
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,917
Which is more stigmatizing?

904
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,422
Yeah, Barbie`s stigmatized.

905
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:35,427
lt`s that whole male,
36-24-36 image of beauty.

906
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:37,292
Women are oppressed.

907
00:59:37,432 --> 00:59:39,195
Women are oppressed?!

908
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:44,270
80% of suicides are committed by men.
They`re dropping from heart attacks.

909
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:47,203
- You`re not as tough.
- Sorry. We`re just fighting the wars.

910
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:49,103
You start the wars.

911
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:52,541
l`m sorry. l don`t have
my own crisis hot line.

912
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:56,815
- You`re taking the Meredith thing well.
- That has nothing to do with it.

913
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:59,886
What was today`s rumor?
She was once a man?

914
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,214
Just tell her.

915
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,720
Tell her what?

916
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,826
Tell her a lot of us have
worked as hard as you...

917
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,953
...and you`re blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up.

918
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:13,058
What happened?

919
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,903
Who got to you?

920
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,736
lt`s not that simple.

921
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:23,344
The thought of losing millions happens
to stick right here in my throat.

922
01:00:23,478 --> 01:00:27,642
This was my big shot. lt`s not
like l`m being scouted by the NBA.

923
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,407
What happened?

924
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:34,150
Who knows? An old girlfriend, a
bottle of wine, a late meeting...

925
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:35,983
- Fill in the blanks.
- Thanks.

926
01:00:36,658 --> 01:00:41,595
You`re like women who think they`re in
the hotel room, drunk, to watch TV.

927
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,357
Could you possibly be more lame?

928
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:47,366
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.

929
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,093
Everything that happened.

930
01:00:50,672 --> 01:00:52,663
And l support him 100%.

931
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,268
That is so sweet, but l don`t think--

932
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,933
Let`s not discuss it.

933
01:00:58,012 --> 01:00:59,877
Let`s just enjoy the evening.

934
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:15,018
Obviously, something happened.

935
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:16,886
Did you have sex?

936
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:19,966
- Think first. Because if you`re lying--
- No, l said, no.

937
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:25,037
She kissed me, and she unzipped
my pants, and-and-and-and-and--

938
01:01:25,206 --> 01:01:25,900
And?

939
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,701
And that was it.

940
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:29,536
How did it get that far?

941
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:32,805
- You think l encouraged her?
- Her hand was in your pants?

942
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,040
- Nothing happened.
- How did that happen?

943
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,707
Then she accuses me of
sexual harassment--

944
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,546
- She harassed you?
- You don`t believe me?

945
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:41,313
Mark doesn`t believe you.

946
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,481
He`s got stock options on the brain.
He`s back-stabbing.

947
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,492
Everybody`s sure you`re
having an affair with Cindy.

948
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,927
- We`re not having an affair.
- How could you let this happen?

949
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:53,659
- Nothing happened.
- Something happened.

950
01:01:56,237 --> 01:01:58,330
She`s an old girlfriend of yours.

951
01:01:58,573 --> 01:02:02,441
Like l`m surprised. That club`s
as exclusive as the white pages.

952
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:12,019
- l was going to tell you.
- l can`t believe everyone knew but me.

953
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:16,020
- Nobody knows it.
- You`re so naive. Of course they know.

954
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:20,751
l`m old-fashioned. l greet my
inferiors with a handshake.

955
01:02:20,962 --> 01:02:22,190
l`ll handle it.

956
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,455
Jesus.

957
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,592
What does she look like?

958
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:29,964
She`s attractive.

959
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:31,966
One to ten.

960
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,465
Eight.

961
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,198
Nine.

962
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:40,604
What does the company say?

963
01:02:40,782 --> 01:02:44,047
They want me to transfer to
Austin, do some therapy.

964
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,480
Austin?

965
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,119
l`m not moving there.

966
01:02:47,288 --> 01:02:49,119
We`re not moving to Austin.

967
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,491
- l`m pressing charges.
- For what?

968
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:54,789
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.

969
01:02:54,996 --> 01:02:56,987
When were you going to tell me?

970
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:01,064
That`s brilliant.
Show up without your wife.

971
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:04,237
- l`ll handle it.
- Are you crazy? They`ll destroy you.

972
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,067
- lt won`t go that far.
- lt`ll take over our life.

973
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:11,735
Depositions and whispering and legal
fees for some damn personal vindication.

974
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:16,247
And all people remember is that
you were involved in something sleazy.

975
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,310
- Do you have a lawyer?
- Catherine Alvarez.

976
01:03:19,387 --> 01:03:21,617
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?

977
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:24,147
But if it had happened to you--

978
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:26,520
You know how many times
it`s happened to me?

979
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:29,755
- You never said this ever happened--
- You`re so narcissistic.

980
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,024
Nothing happens until
it happens to you.

981
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:35,761
- You should`ve said something.
- l do what women always do.

982
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:40,169
l deal with it. Now go in
there tomorrow and work it out.

983
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:42,935
Right. l should shut up and fuck her.

984
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,341
Apologize and get your job back.

985
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:47,104
Apologize?!

986
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,272
The children are sleeping.

987
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:53,680
Wait, l got a better idea.
Why don`t l just admit it?

988
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:58,622
l`ll be the evil male you all complain
about. Then l can fuck everybody.

989
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,192
Tom, stop it.

990
01:04:00,361 --> 01:04:02,295
Come, l want to dominate you!

991
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,293
You`re scaring her.

992
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,624
l have a urge!

993
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,561
The children!

994
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,363
My children that l
provide for and protect.

995
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:14,074
They can come between me and my
wife, move us, take my job...

996
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,299
...and take the house we have made! ! !

997
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,877
And l apologize to them, Susan?

998
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,477
They call me a rapist and l
apologize. This is a joke.

999
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,217
Sexual harassment is about power.

1000
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,717
When did l have the power?

1001
01:04:32,727 --> 01:04:33,716
When?

1002
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:44,690
Good morning, l`m Judge Murphy.

1003
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,027
This is a mediation.

1004
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:52,104
Our proceedings are confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.

1005
01:05:52,273 --> 01:05:55,208
Our goal is to determine
the nature of the dispute...

1006
01:05:55,376 --> 01:05:58,038
...and how best to resolve it.

1007
01:05:58,379 --> 01:06:01,712
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...

1008
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:04,283
...and be cross-examined
by Mr. Heller.

1009
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:08,445
Ms. Johnson will speak next, and
be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.

1010
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:09,954
Any questions?

1011
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:11,722
Let`s get started.

1012
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:15,451
l had my cellular phone with me,
so when she called Garvin...

1013
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:20,226
...l called Mark Lewyn to give
him the upshot of our meeting.

1014
01:06:20,468 --> 01:06:21,901
Then she approached you?

1015
01:06:22,136 --> 01:06:25,799
Correct. She took the phone
from me and she kissed me.

1016
01:06:25,973 --> 01:06:26,735
Where?

1017
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:29,906
She kissed me in my ear...

1018
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:31,803
...on my neck...

1019
01:06:31,979 --> 01:06:33,412
...on my mouth.

1020
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:35,975
She put her tongue in my mouth.

1021
01:06:36,317 --> 01:06:38,649
When you asked her to stop, did she?

1022
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,079
No, no.

1023
01:06:41,422 --> 01:06:43,322
She unzipped my pants...

1024
01:06:43,491 --> 01:06:45,482
...and massaged my penis.

1025
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,651
- Were you aroused?
- Yes.

1026
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:49,326
Then she slid down...

1027
01:06:49,997 --> 01:06:51,089
...and she...

1028
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:53,161
...put my penis in her mouth.

1029
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:54,926
Did you climax?

1030
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:59,102
l grabbed her by the wrists.
l threw her on the ground.

1031
01:06:59,273 --> 01:07:01,264
Then l wanted to leave.

1032
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:03,672
Then what did Ms. Johnson do?

1033
01:07:03,945 --> 01:07:05,503
She threatened me.

1034
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:07,780
She said, ''You`re dead.''

1035
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:12,010
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn told me that...

1036
01:07:12,186 --> 01:07:16,179
...she said that l had
sexually harassed her.

1037
01:07:19,126 --> 01:07:20,024
Mr. Heller?

1038
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:23,288
- Mr. Sanders, would you like a break?
- No, l`m fine.

1039
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:27,127
You say the bottle of wine
was Ms. Johnson`s idea?

1040
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:28,359
Yes.

1041
01:07:28,536 --> 01:07:32,370
But when you were living
with Ms. Johnson...

1042
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,974
...didn`t you discover wines together
on trips to the Napa Valley?

1043
01:07:37,144 --> 01:07:38,133
Yes.

1044
01:07:38,312 --> 01:07:39,643
Romantic trips?

1045
01:07:40,715 --> 01:07:41,545
Yes.

1046
01:07:41,716 --> 01:07:45,311
But you didn`t expect any
romance in her office?

1047
01:07:46,153 --> 01:07:49,486
Did you have a conversation
after lunch about how...

1048
01:07:49,724 --> 01:07:52,318
...seeing Meredith gave you a...

1049
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,720
...boner?

1050
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:56,890
Someone else said that.

1051
01:07:57,064 --> 01:08:00,056
lsn`t the term ''boner''
a slang for erection?

1052
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:02,492
You had a conversation about...

1053
01:08:03,404 --> 01:08:05,668
...having an erection? A boner?

1054
01:08:06,107 --> 01:08:07,699
Yes, but l didn`t say it.

1055
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:09,732
But you laughed.

1056
01:08:10,244 --> 01:08:11,404
Yes.

1057
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:13,069
So you condone it.

1058
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:15,575
lt was harmless.

1059
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,340
lf it`s harmless...

1060
01:08:18,185 --> 01:08:19,914
...why are we here today?

1061
01:08:20,588 --> 01:08:22,522
Well, it was just...

1062
01:08:22,923 --> 01:08:24,515
...what guys talk about.

1063
01:08:24,692 --> 01:08:26,182
About their boners?

1064
01:08:26,594 --> 01:08:28,084
Not generally, no.

1065
01:08:28,262 --> 01:08:32,926
Yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation...

1066
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,193
...you weren`t thinking of sex?

1067
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:36,529
That`s correct.

1068
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:42,107
How would you characterize your
prior relationship with Ms. Johnson?

1069
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:43,876
Highly sexual?

1070
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:45,939
l don`t know how to rate it.

1071
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:48,379
Every day?

1072
01:08:48,616 --> 01:08:51,380
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.

1073
01:08:51,552 --> 01:08:52,541
Sodomy.

1074
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,948
Viewing of pornography.

1075
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:57,451
Vibrators and
other mechanical devices.

1076
01:08:58,793 --> 01:09:01,785
Sometimes we sat on the
couch and watched television.

1077
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:07,233
But when you became reacquainted, you
no longer saw her as a sexual object?

1078
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:09,961
- She was just your boss now?
- That`s correct.

1079
01:09:10,638 --> 01:09:14,130
And do you admit having an
erection during your meeting?

1080
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:18,978
She had her top open.
lt was an involuntary reflex.

1081
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:20,477
Reflex.

1082
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:26,146
Do you think her gynecologist gets an
erection when he examines her breast?

1083
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,083
That`s completely different.

1084
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,917
Do you admit putting
your penis in her mouth?

1085
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:32,648
She did.

1086
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,659
Oh, l forgot.

1087
01:09:35,496 --> 01:09:36,986
You resisted.

1088
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:43,096
Mr. Sanders, during your
rather fantastic testimony...

1089
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,433
...there was one moment
that rang true.

1090
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:49,105
You said, and l quote:

1091
01:09:49,276 --> 01:09:50,675
''l was angry.

1092
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:53,505
l felt l was being pushed around.''

1093
01:09:53,681 --> 01:09:54,511
Correct.

1094
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:57,116
The truth is,
you felt that way all day.

1095
01:09:57,451 --> 01:10:01,945
You`d been expecting a promotion and
she got it. You got angry about it.

1096
01:10:02,123 --> 01:10:03,954
l felt l deserved the job.

1097
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:06,787
You took that anger up to her office.

1098
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:08,792
You`d show her who`s boss.

1099
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,191
That`s not true.

1100
01:10:10,698 --> 01:10:14,862
Did you tell your wife about your
7 o`clock meeting with Ms. Johnson?

1101
01:10:15,035 --> 01:10:17,367
l had a meeting and l`d be home late.

1102
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:19,037
You expected to be late?

1103
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:23,643
No, but if l got home earlier my
wife would be pleasantly surprised.

1104
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:27,144
So you make it a rule
to lie to your wife?

1105
01:10:27,314 --> 01:10:28,645
l didn`t lie.

1106
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:31,808
When you called your wife,
did you tell her that...

1107
01:10:31,986 --> 01:10:34,887
...Ms. Johnson was a
former lover of yours?

1108
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:38,556
When you got home, did you
tell her what happened?

1109
01:10:39,994 --> 01:10:42,224
No, l hoped it would go away.

1110
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:45,058
You hoped you`d get away with it?

1111
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:50,236
Do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably.

1112
01:10:50,471 --> 01:10:51,495
That`s okay.

1113
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,501
l have no further questions.

1114
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:02,676
l asked to see pictures.
l thought if we put it on that basis...

1115
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,842
...it would be clear that
things had changed between us.

1116
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,578
Do you have those pictures now?

1117
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:09,916
l`d like copies for my file.

1118
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,681
You can continue.

1119
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,196
He said his wife hadn`t lost all
the weight gained from pregnancy.

1120
01:11:17,364 --> 01:11:19,264
His children were beautiful...

1121
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:21,528
...but they made him feel old...

1122
01:11:21,702 --> 01:11:25,604
...and seeing me reminded him of
what it was like to be young...

1123
01:11:25,773 --> 01:11:28,105
...and marriage was a tough trade-off.

1124
01:11:28,275 --> 01:11:29,264
Go on.

1125
01:11:30,544 --> 01:11:33,775
My assistant, Mrs. Ross,
asked if she could go home.

1126
01:11:33,948 --> 01:11:36,041
l wanted her to stay, but felt guilty.

1127
01:11:36,217 --> 01:11:39,209
l`d kept her late for weeks
preparing for my new job.

1128
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:42,044
And where was Mr. Sanders
at that point?

1129
01:11:42,223 --> 01:11:44,623
He began to rub my shoulders.

1130
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:48,125
And you let him?

1131
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:50,724
lt was awkward...

1132
01:11:50,898 --> 01:11:54,231
...but l thought we`d end the
meeting and leave it at that.

1133
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:56,232
Then he tried to kiss you?

1134
01:11:56,403 --> 01:12:00,066
No, Mr. Garvin called and
then l came back to Tom...

1135
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:03,802
...and said that was it, and
then he began to kiss me.

1136
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:05,309
Did you try to stop him?

1137
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:10,143
Yes. l struggled with him and
told him to stop. But he didn`t.

1138
01:12:11,585 --> 01:12:13,644
Did he attack you physically?

1139
01:12:17,091 --> 01:12:18,080
Yes.

1140
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:21,091
He grabbed me by my hair...

1141
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:24,921
...and forced me down on my knees.

1142
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:27,998
And...

1143
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,328
He put his...

1144
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:33,336
...penis in your mouth?

1145
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,272
This is making me uncomfortable.

1146
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,840
Want some water?

1147
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,348
Thank you.

1148
01:12:58,299 --> 01:13:01,132
He put his penis in my mouth...

1149
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:04,864
...and said that he was going to...

1150
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:08,373
To fuck you? Were those his words?

1151
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,642
He said, ''Do you want to get fucked?''

1152
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:14,542
And then he reached down
and tore off my panties.

1153
01:13:15,816 --> 01:13:17,716
What did you do then?

1154
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:22,552
He threw me down on the scaffold
and l kneed him in the groin.

1155
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:24,486
And that was the end of it?

1156
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:29,892
lt`s strange. l`d think my instinct
would be to run, but l became angry.

1157
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:33,727
l yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him l`d kill him.

1158
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:35,391
Just yelling.

1159
01:13:35,903 --> 01:13:37,837
How did he react?

1160
01:13:38,005 --> 01:13:42,237
He seemed to realize what he`d done.
He pulled up his pants and left.

1161
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:46,335
Did you call anyone afterwards?

1162
01:13:47,748 --> 01:13:48,737
No.

1163
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,679
l didn`t know what to do.

1164
01:13:51,852 --> 01:13:55,185
l kept going over the day in my
mind trying to figure out...

1165
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:58,018
...if somehow this thing was my fault.

1166
01:14:00,527 --> 01:14:02,188
You reported it the next day?

1167
01:14:03,197 --> 01:14:04,255
Yes.

1168
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:08,695
But you didn`t bring
formal charges. Why not?

1169
01:14:10,604 --> 01:14:12,367
l talked to Phil Blackburn.

1170
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:14,598
l knew he was Tom`s friend.

1171
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:16,766
l didn`t want to destroy...

1172
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:20,937
...Tom`s marriage or career, but it`s
clear we couldn`t work together.

1173
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:23,272
l would be too scared.

1174
01:14:23,717 --> 01:14:25,708
l`m scared just sitting here.

1175
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:31,790
Nothing further.

1176
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:33,384
Ms. Alvarez.

1177
01:14:34,895 --> 01:14:38,626
Ms. Johnson, l just want
to be clear on one thing.

1178
01:14:38,966 --> 01:14:42,458
Mr. Sanders suggested
the bottle of wine?

1179
01:14:42,636 --> 01:14:44,797
- That`s right.
- But you bought it.

1180
01:14:44,972 --> 01:14:47,736
l sent my assistant Mrs. Ross
out to buy a bottle.

1181
01:14:47,908 --> 01:14:49,398
That afternoon?

1182
01:14:49,977 --> 01:14:51,808
Did you tell her what kind?

1183
01:14:52,312 --> 01:14:56,078
l said to get a nice Chardonnay.
l knew Tom liked white wine.

1184
01:14:56,250 --> 01:15:00,152
From those trips to Napa that
he was an amateur connoisseur.

1185
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,413
He`d be impressed by a nice bottle.

1186
01:15:02,589 --> 01:15:03,578
Yes.

1187
01:15:03,757 --> 01:15:05,418
Do you remember the wine?

1188
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:06,656
No.

1189
01:15:07,494 --> 01:15:09,428
The `91 Pahlmeyer?

1190
01:15:10,664 --> 01:15:11,756
That`s right.

1191
01:15:11,932 --> 01:15:14,662
Do you know where your
assistant got that wine?

1192
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:18,164
l assume she got it at a liquor store.

1193
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:20,270
Would it surprise you to know...

1194
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:23,672
...that no liquor store in
Seattle carries that bottle?

1195
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:27,610
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.

1196
01:15:27,848 --> 01:15:29,281
Very resourceful?

1197
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:33,284
A bottle of wine you can`t find
within 500 miles of Seattle.

1198
01:15:35,022 --> 01:15:38,014
l have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine.

1199
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:43,119
lsn`t it true, Ms. Johnson, that
you told Mrs. Ross 3 weeks ago...

1200
01:15:43,297 --> 01:15:46,789
...that you wanted a
bottle of `91 Pahlmeyer...

1201
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:48,628
...for this meeting?

1202
01:15:48,802 --> 01:15:50,133
That`s not true.

1203
01:15:50,304 --> 01:15:53,137
And when she couldn`t
find it, you said--.

1204
01:15:53,974 --> 01:15:56,966
What was that? lt had
such managerial brio.

1205
01:15:57,211 --> 01:15:58,701
Here it is.

1206
01:15:59,146 --> 01:16:01,706
''lf you don`t find the wine...

1207
01:16:01,882 --> 01:16:03,975
...find a replacement.''

1208
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:06,813
Do you have testimony
from Mrs. Ross?

1209
01:16:06,987 --> 01:16:08,147
Yes, l do.

1210
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,150
Ms. Johnson?

1211
01:16:11,725 --> 01:16:15,161
The fact is Mrs. Ross
has personal problems.

1212
01:16:15,395 --> 01:16:17,158
She has a drinking problem.

1213
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:20,664
She makes up stories to make
herself seem more important.

1214
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:24,393
l told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after Tom and l spoke...

1215
01:16:24,571 --> 01:16:26,334
...at the luncheon.

1216
01:16:26,507 --> 01:16:28,907
Maybe she had that bottle at home.

1217
01:16:29,743 --> 01:16:31,574
Maybe in her wine cellar.

1218
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:35,843
Any more questions?

1219
01:16:36,016 --> 01:16:37,745
No, not for now.

1220
01:16:40,254 --> 01:16:42,745
l think this is a good time
for a break.

1221
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:48,090
l got some information on Meredith.
You won`t believe it, or maybe you will.

1222
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:51,192
Alan gave me a list, we
can`t verify any of this.

1223
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:53,925
- You said you didn`t have sex.
- l didn`t.

1224
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:55,932
l didn`t have sex with her.

1225
01:16:56,103 --> 01:16:58,867
What is it, Tom?
She`s trying to quit smoking?

1226
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:01,200
- lt`s true.
- How could you do this?

1227
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,036
She did it. That`s the point.

1228
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,871
You saw this woman alone.

1229
01:17:05,045 --> 01:17:09,277
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.

1230
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:11,940
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.

1231
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:13,211
So what?

1232
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:17,221
- That doesn`t happen unless you want it.
- l was cornered.

1233
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:19,552
- You let it happen!
- l did not!

1234
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:23,218
How could you? How could you
let that woman into our lives?

1235
01:17:24,398 --> 01:17:25,729
Get this.

1236
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:30,233
Ten of her subordinates transferred
in the last 5 years. All men.

1237
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:31,564
What a red flag!

1238
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:32,727
Can you see them?

1239
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,133
Yeah, but no one will talk and we can`t
subpoena them just for a mediation.

1240
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:43,074
- Do you want to have lunch?
- l must go back to work.

1241
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,450
How about you? Are you hungry?

1242
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:53,421
How are you holding up?

1243
01:17:53,827 --> 01:17:55,260
Are you married?

1244
01:17:55,429 --> 01:17:57,420
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.

1245
01:17:57,598 --> 01:18:00,260
- l married Chandler.
- You married your boss?

1246
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:04,427
Classic case of sexual harassment. He
asked me out 5 times before l said yes.

1247
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:08,166
Today, if l had said no once, he
would have been afraid to ask again.

1248
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:10,939
Tom said you`re a lawyer.

1249
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:12,442
Ten years.

1250
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:16,515
- Let`s switch hats. What do you think?
- l don`t look good in hats.

1251
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:19,350
You`re afraid she`s telling the truth.

1252
01:18:20,687 --> 01:18:21,779
Yes.

1253
01:18:22,522 --> 01:18:25,355
What he did, he did out of weakness.

1254
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:27,617
Hardly makes it better, does it?

1255
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:31,854
l can`t get in the middle of
your relationship with Tom...

1256
01:18:32,032 --> 01:18:36,128
...but she did break the law
and that makes the difference.

1257
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:41,206
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hrs ago, my husband`s
penis was in another woman`s mouth.

1258
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:45,204
There`s nothing in the law
that`ll help me deal with that.

1259
01:18:50,317 --> 01:18:51,978
When did these arrive?

1260
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:53,983
Came in an hour ago.

1261
01:18:54,988 --> 01:18:59,891
Garvin had me send the Corridor to the
hotel for the Conley people to use.

1262
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:01,319
lt`s at the hotel?

1263
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:04,828
Yeah. The Conley people had
such fun with it yesterday...

1264
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:07,728
Getting anywhere with the drives?
l`m counting on you.

1265
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:10,165
- l have a hunch.
- What is it?

1266
01:19:10,337 --> 01:19:12,066
- l don`t know.
- What is it?

1267
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,729
l don`t know.

1268
01:19:16,243 --> 01:19:18,234
She got to you, didn`t she?

1269
01:19:19,913 --> 01:19:24,350
What else? They`re stronger, they`re
smarter and they don`t fight fair.

1270
01:19:24,518 --> 01:19:27,248
lt`s the next step in
the human evolution.

1271
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:30,185
Keep some of us for
sperm and kill the rest.

1272
01:19:30,357 --> 01:19:31,415
What do you have?

1273
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:37,196
lf l know something for a fact,
l won`t withhold it.

1274
01:19:37,364 --> 01:19:40,595
But l can`t go out on a limb,
it`s too intense around here.

1275
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:46,702
l`m 23. l can`t wake up tomorrow and
find l`m out of the computer business.

1276
01:19:55,215 --> 01:19:56,944
Why aren`t you at the mediation?

1277
01:19:57,117 --> 01:20:01,713
l just came back to--. This was
the last thing l needed this week.

1278
01:20:01,888 --> 01:20:02,877
Come in.

1279
01:20:05,892 --> 01:20:07,951
Something`s come up.

1280
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:11,222
l need to know exactly
what happened that night.

1281
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:14,060
Well, it`s exactly like l told Phil.

1282
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:16,735
You`re not talking to Phil.

1283
01:20:18,138 --> 01:20:23,075
We have Sanders` phone records. lt`s
possible someone overheard you two.

1284
01:20:33,253 --> 01:20:34,982
John Levin called again.

1285
01:20:35,422 --> 01:20:37,481
Find out what it`s about.

1286
01:20:37,657 --> 01:20:39,989
He must talk to you personally.

1287
01:20:41,161 --> 01:20:42,992
l don`t want to talk to him now.

1288
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:46,664
Can l talk to you?

1289
01:20:50,337 --> 01:20:51,429
Cindy...

1290
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:53,764
Are you ''a friend''?

1291
01:20:56,276 --> 01:20:57,436
A friend?

1292
01:20:58,445 --> 01:20:59,673
You know...

1293
01:21:00,113 --> 01:21:02,343
...''a friend.'' A friend.

1294
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:06,183
l depends on what you
mean by ''a friend.''

1295
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:11,788
All right, never mind.

1296
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:48,226
He`s heading for the elevator.

1297
01:22:04,911 --> 01:22:07,072
Heading back to the mediation?

1298
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,011
- Yeah, l must get back.
- l`ll give you a lift.

1299
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:14,080
Don`t you think it`s time we talked?

1300
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:26,058
l understand you both had a
chance to get it off your chest.

1301
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,066
Your version of what happened.
Now l want it to stop.

1302
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,069
What l got off my chest
was not a version.

1303
01:22:32,372 --> 01:22:36,274
lt`s always a version. That`s
the legacy of the modern age.

1304
01:22:36,443 --> 01:22:40,777
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.

1305
01:22:40,947 --> 01:22:42,539
l`m telling the truth.

1306
01:22:43,116 --> 01:22:46,552
- You must look at this from all sides.
- How many sides are there?

1307
01:22:47,621 --> 01:22:50,715
All right, let`s say she
made a mistake. So what?

1308
01:22:50,891 --> 01:22:53,052
She made a pass, that`s all.

1309
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:56,787
You could have decided
it was flattering.

1310
01:22:56,963 --> 01:23:00,956
You could have handled it many
ways, but this vindictiveness...

1311
01:23:01,134 --> 01:23:02,726
...l must say, l`m surprised.

1312
01:23:02,903 --> 01:23:04,734
lt`s against the law.

1313
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:06,236
l work for her.
l`m employed by her.

1314
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,139
No. You work for me.

1315
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:10,242
That`s what l`m saying.

1316
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:15,313
After all these years, why didn`t you
come to me? Not hire this lawyer!

1317
01:23:15,482 --> 01:23:16,813
Maybe l should have.

1318
01:23:16,983 --> 01:23:19,645
l mean, why can`t you just forget it?

1319
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:23,585
Work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money.

1320
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:26,248
- What`s wrong with that?
- lt`s gone too far.

1321
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:28,485
Things can go back.

1322
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,022
Why would he offer to settle now?

1323
01:23:32,232 --> 01:23:34,462
He realized how much they got to lose.

1324
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,625
No, it doesn`t add up.

1325
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,966
Maybe there`s a vulnerability
we don`t know about.

1326
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:45,143
l`m still getting messages from
''a friend''. l printed out the address.

1327
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,371
Maybe you can check it out.

1328
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:52,474
l hope DigiCom doesn`t find him first.
Remember the cleaning lady?

1329
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:56,053
She`s out of town. No one knows
where or when she`s coming back.

1330
01:23:56,256 --> 01:23:59,555
The Bahamas, probably, with
Mrs. Ross soon to join her.

1331
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:01,818
These guys play hardball.

1332
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:56,706
Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

1333
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,373
He`s not aware of it.

1334
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:00,712
Just answer the question, please.

1335
01:25:01,454 --> 01:25:02,386
Yes.

1336
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:03,715
How?

1337
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:06,951
He`ll pat me on my behind or...

1338
01:25:07,127 --> 01:25:08,890
...rub my shoulders.

1339
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,393
Rub your shoulders?

1340
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,058
l don`t think he means
anything by it.

1341
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,461
You don`t like it.

1342
01:25:15,468 --> 01:25:17,629
l just feel it`s inappropriate.

1343
01:25:17,971 --> 01:25:19,905
l don`t see the relevance of this.

1344
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,906
We`re trying to establish
a pattern of behavior.

1345
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,068
Sexual harassers generally
follow a pattern.

1346
01:25:26,346 --> 01:25:27,472
l`ll allow it.

1347
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:31,340
Do you have chiropractic problems?

1348
01:25:31,651 --> 01:25:34,745
Any neck problems, or your back?

1349
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,910
No.

1350
01:25:36,156 --> 01:25:39,990
So you would characterize
this behavior as flirting...

1351
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,488
...or sexual?

1352
01:25:43,163 --> 01:25:45,859
- l suppose so.
- But you never said anything.

1353
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,358
He`s my boss.

1354
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,166
You didn`t report it?

1355
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,763
He`s your boss. l understand.

1356
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:55,169
Your job is at stake. Rumors.

1357
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,366
Whether people would believe you.

1358
01:25:57,677 --> 01:26:02,614
And if l ask you if you ever had any
sexual relations with Mr. Sanders...

1359
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:03,942
...same answer?

1360
01:26:04,884 --> 01:26:05,942
No, l didn`t.

1361
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:07,175
Didn`t report it?

1362
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:10,312
- lt never happened.
- l understand.

1363
01:26:10,757 --> 01:26:12,657
l have no more questions.

1364
01:26:13,827 --> 01:26:15,055
Barbara called...

1365
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,492
- about the Disneyland tickets for...?
- Jafar.

1366
01:26:18,665 --> 01:26:22,157
He`s got the tickets and
an upgrade at the hotel.

1367
01:26:22,335 --> 01:26:24,269
Thank you, l appreciate it.

1368
01:26:26,339 --> 01:26:27,670
They gave me your photos.

1369
01:26:32,445 --> 01:26:33,776
l`ll see you later?

1370
01:26:34,013 --> 01:26:35,446
Yes, l`ll see you later.

1371
01:27:15,655 --> 01:27:16,553
You know...

1372
01:27:16,723 --> 01:27:19,715
...it`s funny how you always
assumed you`d get the job.

1373
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:22,054
Lewyn assumed
it would be him or you.

1374
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:26,993
But nobody ever thought for
a second it might be me.

1375
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:28,498
lsn`t that funny?

1376
01:27:30,403 --> 01:27:32,496
That`s not true. You were on the list.

1377
01:27:32,672 --> 01:27:33,730
Really?

1378
01:27:33,907 --> 01:27:37,900
Let me guess: ''Hunter, not
someone you`d follow into battle.

1379
01:27:38,344 --> 01:27:41,006
A team player. No killer instinct.

1380
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:43,081
Doesn`t have those tools.''

1381
01:27:43,249 --> 01:27:45,240
What is that all a code for?

1382
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:47,511
What, you on Meredith`s side?

1383
01:27:49,689 --> 01:27:52,681
l studied engineering for eight years.

1384
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:56,522
l was the only woman in the
department. You know what l did?

1385
01:27:56,863 --> 01:27:59,696
l worked. You think
l`m on Meredith`s side?

1386
01:28:04,437 --> 01:28:06,200
What do you want to do?

1387
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:08,196
What?

1388
01:28:08,775 --> 01:28:12,939
Their offer ends midnight. lt`s what
Garvin said. You get your job back.

1389
01:28:13,112 --> 01:28:16,946
She`s your boss.
Everyone goes back to work.

1390
01:28:18,718 --> 01:28:20,049
Did you find ''a friend''?

1391
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,120
Did we get the address?

1392
01:28:22,288 --> 01:28:26,452
Dr. Arthur Friend, a chemistry professor
from the University of Washington...

1393
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:29,459
...who`s been in Nepal
the last three weeks.

1394
01:28:29,629 --> 01:28:31,961
You got messages from
a locked office.

1395
01:28:32,799 --> 01:28:35,063
l`m glad we got that one solved.

1396
01:28:35,568 --> 01:28:37,729
Shit, l have to call Lewyn.

1397
01:28:38,404 --> 01:28:41,305
The drives we`re having
problems with came in.

1398
01:28:41,474 --> 01:28:42,805
Only you.

1399
01:28:43,643 --> 01:28:48,137
Anyone else would be sabotaging the
company, not solving their problems.

1400
01:28:48,314 --> 01:28:49,804
lt`s Adele and Mark.

1401
01:28:49,983 --> 01:28:53,475
We`re not home, leave a message
and we`ll call you back.

1402
01:28:56,489 --> 01:28:57,319
What?

1403
01:28:58,258 --> 01:29:03,093
Mark`s wife`s voice is on the machine,
but on Monday it was a man`s voice.

1404
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:07,493
Then the next day Mark said
he never got the message.

1405
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:15,838
l dialed the wrong number that night.

1406
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:17,936
So?

1407
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,112
That`s why the battery was dead.

1408
01:29:23,283 --> 01:29:25,183
What are you talking about?

1409
01:29:30,957 --> 01:29:34,358
That`s why Garvin wants to deal.
He`s got my phone records.

1410
01:29:34,627 --> 01:29:37,960
l`ve got a 10 minute phone bill
while l`m in Meredith`s office.

1411
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:41,862
She took the phone away.
l called the wrong number...

1412
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:45,368
...but l never hung up the phone.
The phone line is open.

1413
01:29:47,373 --> 01:29:50,137
Somebody`s got this whole
thing on an answering machine.

1414
01:29:59,052 --> 01:30:01,316
lt`s Levin, not Lewyn.

1415
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:04,316
What`s going on?

1416
01:30:04,557 --> 01:30:08,493
l`ve been getting phone calls.
Some creep has my Visa...

1417
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:12,392
...then, at the office,
everything`s turned upside down.

1418
01:30:12,565 --> 01:30:14,157
Have they got the tape?

1419
01:30:14,334 --> 01:30:17,565
What l`m saying is, it`s
good l brought it home.

1420
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:21,173
- My girlfriend and l listened to it.
- Where`s the tape?

1421
01:30:23,743 --> 01:30:25,074
lt`s all here?

1422
01:30:26,245 --> 01:30:30,011
l`ve been trying to get
a hold of you all week!

1423
01:30:30,183 --> 01:30:31,741
You know what this means?

1424
01:30:32,085 --> 01:30:34,747
Do you have any idea
what this means?

1425
01:30:35,355 --> 01:30:36,845
Thanks, pal.

1426
01:30:49,102 --> 01:30:51,593
No deal. No, no deal, Catherine.

1427
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:55,104
We`re going to bury them.
Everything is on tape.

1428
01:30:55,441 --> 01:30:57,102
Yes, everything.

1429
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:30,837
Put it in.

1430
01:31:35,348 --> 01:31:37,009
God, look at us.

1431
01:31:37,517 --> 01:31:39,280
Go inside me.

1432
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:42,346
l can`t do this.

1433
01:31:42,522 --> 01:31:44,217
- Do it.
- l won`t.

1434
01:31:44,357 --> 01:31:46,450
Now! Come on, now!

1435
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,617
You can`t just stop! You can`t!

1436
01:31:50,029 --> 01:31:51,360
No! Goddamn it!

1437
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,471
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

1438
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:10,315
This never happened.

1439
01:32:11,384 --> 01:32:13,375
You never used to be this way.

1440
01:32:15,755 --> 01:32:19,316
ln any judicial proceeding,
this tape would be inadmissible.

1441
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:23,553
l`m worried l`m going to drive to
work and hear it on Howard Stern.

1442
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:24,889
ls she threatening?

1443
01:32:25,064 --> 01:32:27,828
l don`t know how many copies
of this tape there are.

1444
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,332
l didn`t put it out there.

1445
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:35,171
This tape just shows consensual
sex between adults...

1446
01:32:35,908 --> 01:32:38,570
...however it may have
appeared the next day.

1447
01:32:38,778 --> 01:32:41,770
Mr. Sanders` regret is not
my client`s harassment.

1448
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:44,775
Ms. Johnson,
is that your position today?

1449
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:46,273
Yes, it is.

1450
01:32:47,286 --> 01:32:48,412
Ms. Alvarez?

1451
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:52,586
Just so l`m clear on
what today`s story is...

1452
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:55,920
...would you define for
me ''consensual sex.''

1453
01:32:56,095 --> 01:32:59,189
Sex where both parties
are willing participants.

1454
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:02,797
How many times did we hear
Mr. Sanders say ''no''?

1455
01:33:03,436 --> 01:33:06,872
l don`t know, l was busy listening
to my panties being torn off.

1456
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:08,298
31.

1457
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:09,931
31 times.

1458
01:33:10,109 --> 01:33:11,804
Doesn`t ''no'' mean ''no''?

1459
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:16,879
Sometimes ''no'' means that person
wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.

1460
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:21,452
The way we`re supposed to have sex
nowadays we`d need UN supervision.

1461
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:23,384
''No'' means ''no.''

1462
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,949
lsn`t that what we tell women?

1463
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:28,316
Do men deserve less?

1464
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:32,959
When he really wanted to stop
he had no problems doing it.

1465
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:34,463
And you got angry.

1466
01:33:34,634 --> 01:33:36,625
Of course l did. Anyone would.

1467
01:33:36,836 --> 01:33:39,327
We tell women they
can stop at any point.

1468
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:42,066
Haven`t you ever said
''no'' and meant ''yes''?

1469
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:44,573
Until the moment of penetration--

1470
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:47,645
He was willing. That tape
doesn`t change anything.

1471
01:33:47,847 --> 01:33:52,750
You controlled the meeting. You
set the time, you ordered the wine.

1472
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:56,912
You demanded service and got
angry when he didn`t provide it.

1473
01:33:57,089 --> 01:34:01,423
So you decided to get rid of
him with this trumped-up charge.

1474
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:05,496
The only thing you have proven
is that a woman in power...

1475
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:08,429
...can be every bit
as abusive as a man.

1476
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:12,264
You want to put me on trial?
Let`s be honest about why.

1477
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,872
l am sexually aggressive. l like it.

1478
01:34:15,007 --> 01:34:17,168
Tom knew it and you can`t handle it.

1479
01:34:17,376 --> 01:34:20,106
lt`s the same thing since
the beginning of time.

1480
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:23,373
Veil it, hide it, lock it
up and throw away the key.

1481
01:34:23,516 --> 01:34:26,280
We expect a woman to do a man`s
job, make a man`s money...

1482
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:30,388
...then lie down for a man to fuck
her like it was 100 years ago!

1483
01:34:30,523 --> 01:34:32,184
Well, no, thank you.

1484
01:34:39,031 --> 01:34:43,968
You won`t believe this. l think
the Howard Stern thing got to them.

1485
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:46,467
- What did Phil say?
- You get your job back.

1486
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,131
You get $100,000 in pain and suffering,
and l get fees and expenses.

1487
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:51,540
Meredith?

1488
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:54,305
She stays through the merger,
then they say...

1489
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,541
...she has to leave for some
whatever emergency. She`s out.

1490
01:34:58,718 --> 01:35:01,482
This is total and
complete vindication.

1491
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:03,979
lt`s over!

1492
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:15,062
l almost feel sorry for him.
He has no idea, does he?

1493
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:28,340
l`d like to read this over again before
we sign. Not that l don`t trust you.

1494
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,449
Just as long as it`s done
by midnight tonight.

1495
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:34,075
Garvin wants this off his screen.

1496
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,253
We want you to make a
presentation on Arcamax...

1497
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:42,950
...at the merger announcement
tomorrow.

1498
01:35:43,129 --> 01:35:45,188
Nothing technical, 4 minutes.

1499
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:46,353
Fine.

1500
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:47,521
Great.

1501
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:51,769
Now l`ve got to go break it to her.
lt won`t be easy.

1502
01:35:51,971 --> 01:35:54,599
l thought you enjoyed
that kind of thing.

1503
01:35:54,774 --> 01:35:58,175
You go after one of our people,
we`ll put the wagons in a circle.

1504
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:02,337
Once you made your case,
the company behaved appropriately.

1505
01:36:02,515 --> 01:36:03,504
Right?

1506
01:36:03,683 --> 01:36:06,243
- You don`t want to know what l think.
- lt`s terrible.

1507
01:36:06,419 --> 01:36:09,183
Way a thing like this can...

1508
01:36:09,355 --> 01:36:10,913
...tear a company apart.

1509
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:14,423
l told Bob we really need
to take a look at it.

1510
01:36:16,028 --> 01:36:17,017
Friends?

1511
01:36:19,865 --> 01:36:20,763
What?

1512
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,263
l hope you still think
of me as a friend.

1513
01:36:26,105 --> 01:36:27,436
Good night, Phil.

1514
01:36:31,043 --> 01:36:33,273
Sign it now and l`ll read it later.

1515
01:36:34,046 --> 01:36:35,377
Where will you be?

1516
01:36:35,548 --> 01:36:38,039
Here, working on the presentation.

1517
01:36:38,217 --> 01:36:41,709
lf not, l`ll have somebody
run this by your house later.

1518
01:36:49,295 --> 01:36:51,058
Let me ask you something.

1519
01:36:51,797 --> 01:36:53,287
Why`d she do this?

1520
01:36:53,733 --> 01:36:57,635
You`ve seen her in action.
She`s cool, smart and in control.

1521
01:36:57,803 --> 01:37:01,068
- How`d she lose control like this?
- l don`t know.

1522
01:37:01,307 --> 01:37:03,400
You`re attractive. Maybe.

1523
01:37:03,576 --> 01:37:07,478
- But not irresistible.
- l`m serious. She`s here one day.

1524
01:37:07,646 --> 01:37:10,740
There`s a merger going on.
Conley people are touchy.

1525
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:12,474
She thought you`d go along.

1526
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:14,642
- There`s more to it than that.
- Come on.

1527
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:17,653
You think too much.
You need to go home...

1528
01:37:17,823 --> 01:37:20,257
...open a nice bottle of champagne...

1529
01:37:20,426 --> 01:37:23,589
...make up with your
wife and get some sleep.

1530
01:37:23,763 --> 01:37:25,162
lt`s over.

1531
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,062
Thank you.

1532
01:37:29,201 --> 01:37:31,567
Absolutely. You`re welcome.

1533
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:33,298
Good night.

1534
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:34,564
Good night.

1535
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,231
Hi, Stephanie.

1536
01:38:05,404 --> 01:38:09,238
Must be difficult, nobody
giving you information.

1537
01:38:09,408 --> 01:38:10,841
lt`s been a crazy week.

1538
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:15,403
l had a friend. She was one of
the first women to move high up.

1539
01:38:15,748 --> 01:38:19,343
You know what it`s like,
every day putting out fires.

1540
01:38:19,618 --> 01:38:22,246
lt turned out the job
wasn`t what she thought.

1541
01:38:22,421 --> 01:38:25,254
She was looking the wrong
way when they fired her.

1542
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:27,422
lnteresting.

1543
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:30,685
Truth usually is, once you get to it.

1544
01:38:48,647 --> 01:38:49,944
lt`s you.

1545
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:51,271
Where is everyone?

1546
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:55,216
Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago.
Said they were working too hard.

1547
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:56,877
Sent everyone home.

1548
01:39:57,516 --> 01:40:00,007
- What if Sanders doesn`t bring it up?
- He will.

1549
01:40:00,219 --> 01:40:03,211
l talked to him about his
presentation on Arcamax.

1550
01:40:03,355 --> 01:40:04,845
He has no idea.

1551
01:40:05,024 --> 01:40:06,719
When he brings up the line....

1552
01:40:06,859 --> 01:40:09,623
You must pounce because we
don`t have the harassment.

1553
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:12,787
lt must be that Sanders
is incompetent.

1554
01:40:14,033 --> 01:40:16,627
lt`ll be in public. With reporters.

1555
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:18,732
Bob`s counting on you.

1556
01:40:19,038 --> 01:40:21,370
Let`s clean out the database.

1557
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:22,871
And any backup.

1558
01:40:28,881 --> 01:40:31,543
Catherine,
can you hold on one minute?

1559
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,751
Has my contract gone out already?

1560
01:40:40,893 --> 01:40:42,258
Shit.

1561
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:45,319
What does it say about firing me?

1562
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:48,557
They can fire me for cause,
can`t they? For incompetence?

1563
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:53,562
The problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design.

1564
01:40:53,772 --> 01:40:57,401
lt`s with the production line
and that`s my responsibility.

1565
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,572
This whole thing tomorrow...

1566
01:40:59,912 --> 01:41:01,777
...they`re setting me up.

1567
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:14,742
Housekeeping, please.

1568
01:42:16,355 --> 01:42:18,255
This is Mr. Conley.

1569
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:21,086
Could someone come
and turn down my bed?

1570
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:25,256
My room number? lt`s on
the phone here somewhere....

1571
01:42:26,665 --> 01:42:27,859
That`s right.

1572
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,763
Thank you very much.

1573
01:42:36,508 --> 01:42:40,774
- When does your dad arrive?
- Midnight. They stopped in Houston.

1574
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,779
l`d love for him to get a
chance to see the Corridor.

1575
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:45,375
You know...

1576
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:50,278
l stayed up late last night, fooling
around with it up in my room.

1577
01:42:50,689 --> 01:42:52,179
lt`s really incredible.

1578
01:42:58,697 --> 01:43:00,392
l`m sorry, sir.

1579
01:43:00,532 --> 01:43:02,022
Here, thank you.

1580
01:43:02,201 --> 01:43:03,634
- You`re welcome.
- Good night.

1581
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:05,394
Have a nice evening.

1582
01:44:22,981 --> 01:44:27,111
You`re in the Corridor, our prototype
for a virtual reality database.

1583
01:44:27,286 --> 01:44:29,277
Enjoy the demonstration.

1584
01:44:29,488 --> 01:44:34,391
lnformation accessed during this demo
is for entertainment value only...

1585
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,723
...and should not be duplicated
to another database.

1586
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:41,297
lf you have any questions,
ask the angel.

1587
01:45:32,851 --> 01:45:35,342
Malaysian Operations.

1588
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:17,826
Searching Malaysian revisions file.

1589
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:20,897
Why don`t we go up to my suite?

1590
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,992
Give my colleagues a chance
to try out the Corridor.

1591
01:46:25,837 --> 01:46:27,327
Good idea.

1592
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,934
''Reduction of air handling
capacity from number 7 air handlers...

1593
01:46:58,136 --> 01:47:01,128
...to a more appropriate
and cost-effective number 5.''

1594
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:06,034
You can`t put number 5 handlers in
there. You`ll have dirt in everything.

1595
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:11,205
My God, she`s in the system.

1596
01:47:29,801 --> 01:47:31,666
Angel, l need help.

1597
01:47:33,905 --> 01:47:35,167
Help is here.

1598
01:47:35,807 --> 01:47:38,571
Can l stop files from being deleted?

1599
01:47:38,744 --> 01:47:40,803
l`m sorry. You`re not Level 5.

1600
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,413
You`re supposed to protect the files.

1601
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:51,488
Sysop controls are
restricted to Level 5.

1602
01:48:11,943 --> 01:48:14,434
Show me all communications
with Malaysia.

1603
01:48:14,713 --> 01:48:16,442
Telephone or video?

1604
01:48:16,782 --> 01:48:18,010
Video.

1605
01:48:30,028 --> 01:48:33,964
Show me the last transmission
involving Meredith.

1606
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:44,298
Sooner or later, Tom will figure
out the changes at the plant.

1607
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,534
He`s not stupid.

1608
01:48:45,744 --> 01:48:48,372
Tom will be out of the picture
by Tuesday.

1609
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,816
l don`t like to gamble.
l love Tahoe, but l think the risk--

1610
01:48:52,984 --> 01:48:56,545
Think. Who`ll believe him?
He`s married, with a family.

1611
01:48:56,755 --> 01:48:59,815
He`ll have no choice but to
take the settlement and leave.

1612
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:03,893
Then we say Sanders made the changes
at the plant? He`ll deny it.

1613
01:49:04,062 --> 01:49:06,758
He won`t know.
He`ll be gone by then.

1614
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:32,183
These things are so darn complicated.

1615
01:49:35,794 --> 01:49:37,284
l think it`s upside down.

1616
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:50,538
There we go.

1617
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:03,543
Who`s first?

1618
01:50:04,122 --> 01:50:06,215
Must have left the system on.

1619
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:10,623
Give it a try. You`ll love it.

1620
01:50:10,829 --> 01:50:12,729
l`d love to try it.

1621
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,333
l am totally screwed.

1622
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:27,143
l`ll make my presentation...

1623
01:50:27,345 --> 01:50:29,905
...Meredith will ask me questions.

1624
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:32,242
She`ll make me
look totally incompetent.

1625
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:35,250
Are you sure there`s not
another system somewhere?

1626
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,082
The system
has been completely deleted.

1627
01:50:38,256 --> 01:50:39,985
So l`m a sitting duck.

1628
01:50:40,492 --> 01:50:44,155
l`ll be walking around like
a ghost with a resume.

1629
01:51:08,687 --> 01:51:10,018
lt`s Mohammed Jafar.

1630
01:51:10,188 --> 01:51:11,519
How are you?

1631
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:15,285
l don`t mean to bug you,
but we`re departing Monday--

1632
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,794
lt`s my fault. Susan got the
Disneyland tickets for you.

1633
01:51:20,031 --> 01:51:21,123
The E-tickets?

1634
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:25,395
You`re comped for all the rides and
at the hotel they`ll upgrade you.

1635
01:51:25,537 --> 01:51:28,131
Magnificent. l can`t
wait to tell my wife.

1636
01:51:28,306 --> 01:51:31,969
She said you were full of shit.
You know how women are.

1637
01:51:32,143 --> 01:51:34,043
Yes, l sure do.

1638
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:36,310
l miss your face.

1639
01:51:36,548 --> 01:51:40,541
Talk to Arthur. He sees it
enough on the DVL. l`m always--

1640
01:51:45,924 --> 01:51:47,323
Tom, are you there?

1641
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:51,929
Mohammed, on this end,
we back up our files on DAT.

1642
01:51:52,063 --> 01:51:54,327
Do you do the same over there?

1643
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:56,566
l don`t know what we have.

1644
01:51:57,335 --> 01:51:59,826
l`d have to check it out. Why?

1645
01:52:00,005 --> 01:52:03,839
l got a real problem here.
l`m up against the wall and...

1646
01:52:04,576 --> 01:52:07,511
...l need you to do some
things for me, Mohammed.

1647
01:52:08,747 --> 01:52:11,011
l hope we have what you need, Tom.

1648
01:52:40,478 --> 01:52:41,604
Daddy?

1649
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,971
l never believed what
they said about you.

1650
01:52:50,488 --> 01:52:51,978
Thank you, honey.

1651
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:54,991
Come here, big guy.

1652
01:53:03,802 --> 01:53:05,133
Thank you.

1653
01:53:21,653 --> 01:53:23,018
Those from Malaysia?

1654
01:53:23,521 --> 01:53:26,581
l can`t believe it`s still coming out.
lt started at 7.

1655
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,042
Testing.

1656
01:54:08,366 --> 01:54:10,300
Put these in one of the files.

1657
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,656
Yeah, there`s a real talent to fishing.

1658
01:54:40,098 --> 01:54:42,589
First you must choose the right bait...

1659
01:54:42,734 --> 01:54:45,225
...then you must know
when to reel it in.

1660
01:54:46,104 --> 01:54:48,504
About the other day, l didn`t mean...

1661
01:54:48,673 --> 01:54:49,833
Yes, you did.

1662
01:54:50,608 --> 01:54:52,838
l apologize, and...

1663
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:54,171
...thank you.

1664
01:54:55,513 --> 01:54:56,844
l accept.

1665
01:55:04,422 --> 01:55:07,118
Which brings us to our
Advanced Products Group.

1666
01:55:07,258 --> 01:55:10,022
Tom Sanders heads our
manufacturing department.

1667
01:55:10,195 --> 01:55:12,026
Tom, can you come up here...

1668
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:16,361
...and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call Arcamax?

1669
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:26,639
Thank you, Meredith.

1670
01:55:29,547 --> 01:55:33,449
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.

1671
01:55:34,052 --> 01:55:37,783
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be
effective, it must be portable...

1672
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,546
...it has to be fast.

1673
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:44,457
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.

1674
01:55:45,063 --> 01:55:48,396
We`ve had our problems,
but we are solving them.

1675
01:55:48,566 --> 01:55:51,228
And were the problems
with the design?

1676
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:55,395
No, there are fabrication problems
involving the production line.

1677
01:55:55,573 --> 01:55:56,972
What sort of problems?

1678
01:55:57,675 --> 01:56:01,907
For example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock...

1679
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,911
...the control chip on.

1680
01:56:04,082 --> 01:56:06,744
The Malaysians have been
doing it by hand...

1681
01:56:06,918 --> 01:56:09,409
...jamming the chips
in with their thumbs.

1682
01:56:09,587 --> 01:56:12,078
And the quality of the air is dirty.

1683
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:16,250
We should use level 7 air
handlers, we`re using level 5.

1684
01:56:16,427 --> 01:56:19,191
And we`re ordering our
components, like...

1685
01:56:19,330 --> 01:56:23,699
...hinge rods and clips, not
from our Singapore supplier...

1686
01:56:23,835 --> 01:56:27,999
...but from someone who`s a lot
cheaper but also less reliable.

1687
01:56:28,206 --> 01:56:32,609
l`m confused. You set up this line.
You didn`t anticipate these problems?

1688
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:37,775
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.

1689
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:41,517
How is that possible? We know
you to be a competent manager.

1690
01:56:43,521 --> 01:56:47,287
You should know.
You ordered the changes.

1691
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:50,523
l don`t know how you got that idea.

1692
01:56:51,029 --> 01:56:53,293
You were in Kuala Lumpur last year.

1693
01:56:55,033 --> 01:56:59,129
To settle a labor dispute.
l`ve never even seen the line.

1694
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:02,967
You haven`t?

1695
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:05,640
No, l don`t know who told you l--

1696
01:57:10,448 --> 01:57:12,882
You`re watching Malaysian Channel 3.

1697
01:57:19,257 --> 01:57:21,987
Perhaps instead of digging
up Malaysian video clips...

1698
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,651
...we should discuss
the problems here...

1699
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:27,821
...the problems in your department
with the line you set up.

1700
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,162
All right.

1701
01:57:35,773 --> 01:57:40,506
The 1st memo in the file being handed
out is signed by Meredith Johnson.

1702
01:57:40,678 --> 01:57:44,671
lt states that manual labor will
be used to install the chips.

1703
01:57:44,849 --> 01:57:47,409
That made the Malay
government happy.

1704
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:51,288
lt also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation--

1705
01:57:51,422 --> 01:57:54,414
The Malay government
insisted we fill those jobs.

1706
01:57:54,592 --> 01:57:58,926
The Malaysian government does
not own shares of DigiCom.

1707
01:57:59,097 --> 01:58:00,928
These people here do.

1708
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:04,528
The second memo...

1709
01:58:04,702 --> 01:58:08,604
...reduces the air handling
capacity in order to cut costs.

1710
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:13,877
And that`s why we`re getting dirt in
the split optics, the drive arms.

1711
01:58:14,112 --> 01:58:19,049
The resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70%.

1712
01:58:19,317 --> 01:58:23,378
- The third memo regarding--
- The drives are your responsibility!

1713
01:58:24,622 --> 01:58:27,147
These problems were created
because of your incompetence.

1714
01:58:27,759 --> 01:58:29,317
That`s what`s wrong!

1715
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,451
Passing the buck!
Back stabbing!

1716
01:58:31,629 --> 01:58:32,618
l`m not done.

1717
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:35,628
This so-called evidence of
yours is fooling no one!

1718
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:39,894
You can protect your turf
and think it means something.

1719
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:43,404
You weren`t told of these decisions
because they`re over your head.

1720
01:58:43,574 --> 01:58:45,906
This merger is about synergy...

1721
01:58:46,077 --> 01:58:49,569
...between hardware and software,
between cash flow and capital needs.

1722
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:52,079
That`s a language
you can`t understand!

1723
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:53,581
l don`t either.

1724
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:57,411
We`re buying this company
because they build things.

1725
01:58:58,156 --> 01:59:00,420
You understand what she means?

1726
01:59:07,999 --> 01:59:11,765
l`m trying to convey the
sentiments of everyone here.

1727
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:13,767
That`s what l meant to do.

1728
01:59:18,676 --> 01:59:21,270
Could you step outside
for a moment?

1729
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:35,289
Can you build the darn thing or not?

1730
01:59:36,194 --> 01:59:37,889
Yes, sir, we can.

1731
01:59:40,698 --> 01:59:44,395
They`re replacing Meredith.
Garvin`s announcing it in 10 minutes.

1732
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:48,636
Ten minutes?

1733
02:00:12,563 --> 02:00:14,724
l`m surprised you didn`t come to gloat.

1734
02:00:14,932 --> 02:00:19,665
Gloating is underrated. l actually
came here to pick up the Arcamax files.

1735
02:00:19,837 --> 02:00:21,930
Some smart people underrated you.

1736
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:23,572
Thank you.

1737
02:00:24,242 --> 02:00:25,834
Not including myself.

1738
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:29,002
l beat you. l beat you fair and square.

1739
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:31,448
Garvin lost his nerve.

1740
02:00:31,582 --> 02:00:34,847
lt was his brilliant idea to
fire you for incompetence.

1741
02:00:35,086 --> 02:00:36,519
Him and Phil.

1742
02:00:36,687 --> 02:00:38,177
Now l`m being fired.

1743
02:00:39,257 --> 02:00:43,751
l`ve never seen you play the victim.
lt`s the only good quality you had.

1744
02:00:44,095 --> 02:00:48,259
l`m playing the game men set up,
and l`m being punished for it.

1745
02:00:48,766 --> 02:00:50,199
lt`s fine.

1746
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:54,528
l`ve had calls from ten
head-hunters with job offers.

1747
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:59,468
Don`t be surprised if l`m back
in ten years to buy this place.

1748
02:01:01,546 --> 02:01:06,108
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith,
that maybe l set you up?

1749
02:01:21,566 --> 02:01:24,228
- This is my son, Spencer.
- How you doing?

1750
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:26,563
- Good.
- You`re at the University of Washington?

1751
02:01:26,737 --> 02:01:28,796
That`s great. Very good.

1752
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:47,580
What a week!

1753
02:01:47,758 --> 02:01:49,419
The Chinese say:

1754
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:53,328
''May you live in interesting times.''

1755
02:01:55,099 --> 02:01:59,433
This merger is the most
interesting merger l`ve had...

1756
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:01,328
...since my 2nd marriage.

1757
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,931
The merger is complete.

1758
02:02:05,543 --> 02:02:07,534
The question now is...

1759
02:02:08,179 --> 02:02:12,343
...who do we find to run
things up here in Seattle?

1760
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:15,041
And what l realized during this...

1761
02:02:15,186 --> 02:02:17,450
...very interesting week...

1762
02:02:17,955 --> 02:02:21,288
...is that l have probably
focused too much on...

1763
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:25,623
...breaking the glass ceiling,
finding a woman to run things here...

1764
02:02:25,796 --> 02:02:29,562
...when l should have been
looking for the best person...

1765
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:31,461
...to run things here.

1766
02:02:32,203 --> 02:02:33,568
Someone whose...

1767
02:02:33,704 --> 02:02:38,300
...long service with this company
has established a record...

1768
02:02:38,643 --> 02:02:40,133
...of creativity...

1769
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:41,972
...sound judgement...

1770
02:02:42,213 --> 02:02:44,579
...and hands-on expertise.

1771
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:47,311
And that person...

1772
02:02:48,219 --> 02:02:49,982
...is Stephanie Kaplan.

1773
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:58,724
Congratulations, Stephanie.

1774
02:03:09,907 --> 02:03:12,842
l tell you something,
she`s the greatest!

1775
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:16,173
Thank you.

1776
02:03:16,681 --> 02:03:20,913
First, l`d like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads:

1777
02:03:21,252 --> 02:03:24,119
...Mary Anne Hunter
and Mark Lewyn here...

1778
02:03:24,255 --> 02:03:27,247
...and Don Cherry, where are you?

1779
02:03:28,125 --> 02:03:29,422
There he is.

1780
02:03:29,627 --> 02:03:32,118
And particularly, Tom Sanders...

1781
02:03:32,263 --> 02:03:35,926
...who epitomizes the
inventiveness of this division...

1782
02:03:36,133 --> 02:03:37,691
...its past and its future.

1783
02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:41,198
l`m counting on you to be
my right-hand.

1784
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:43,871
Thank you.

1785
02:03:50,681 --> 02:03:53,912
We are heading
into a new millennium...

1786
02:03:54,185 --> 02:03:55,243
...a new time.

1787
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:58,079
You a chemistry major, Spencer?

1788
02:03:59,924 --> 02:04:01,084
Yeah, l am.

1789
02:04:03,094 --> 02:04:07,360
l know a chemistry professor there,
Arthur Friend. A. Friend.

1790
02:04:08,032 --> 02:04:10,262
l don`t know if he teaches freshmen.

1791
02:04:10,434 --> 02:04:12,197
l`m his research assistant.

1792
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:16,262
So if Arthur Friend was
in Nepal, for example...

1793
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:20,103
...you`d have the keys to his
office and computer password.

1794
02:04:25,549 --> 02:04:28,780
We all work so well together
and it`s exciting...

1795
02:04:28,953 --> 02:04:30,944
...and it`s wonderful to see.

1796
02:04:32,289 --> 02:04:33,722
Thank you.

1797
02:04:35,292 --> 02:04:37,453
Your mother`s
an extraordinary woman.

1798
02:04:37,728 --> 02:04:39,457
You just figured that out?
