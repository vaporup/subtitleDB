Put it back.

That is my Iucky cricket.

Oh.

352
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,634
Well, he just...
He flew out of my hand, man.

353
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,542
You squished him?

354
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,976
No.

Thanks a Iot, kid!

359
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:50,389
So, Maggie,
what do you do
when you're not here?

360
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,226
So sorry,
don't speak English.

361
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,434
But didn't I hear
you speak English
on the phone yesterday?

362
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,066
No, you must be mistaken,
because I don't speak
any English.

363
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,939
I'm just trying
to get better acquainted.

364

I know what you're trying
to get, table jockey.

with their hands all over me,
with your stupid come-ons.

367
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,349
"Give me a hand
with my balls, Maggie."

368
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,615
Let me guess.

369
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,056
You're not around girls much
or you probably wouldn't
play Ping-Pong, right?

370
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,117
Yeah, well,
I thought that your dad
played Ping-Pong.

371
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,222
Do not compare yourself
to my father.
My father was a great man.

372
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,994
I'm not. It's just a game.

373
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,001
It's not just a game!

00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,766
It is a proud tradition

their Iives to!

375

You treat that tradition
Iike a joke.

I say you have no shot.

You know, why would
a real FBI guy
take on a mission Iike this?

412
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,630
Nobody else would
be caught dead
on Operation Ping-Pong.

413

AII right, they don't expect
us to catch Feng.

What am I missing?

00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,431
Oh, we got the golden paddle.

526
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:20,901
As you can see, the paddle
contains a riddle in Chinese.

(READING IN CHINESE)

528
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,849
"On the Iongest day,
two hands reach
towards heaven.

00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,826
"We enter the clouds."

530
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,859
Of course.

531
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,024
When both hands reach up
on what?

532
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,158
A clock. That's noon.

Longest day.
Wednesday, nine Ietters.

534
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,199
We enter the clouds,
that's got to be an airfield.

535
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,071
Yeah, but which airfield?
There are a dozen
in Orange County alone.

536
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,805

a private hangar there

Yeah. It's 5-7-5.
That's a haiku.

540
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,751
That's impressive.
Yeah.

John Wayne Airport.

543
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,655
Each player can bring
a coach, a doctor,
two carry-ons.

544
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,823
Goose, run them through
the hardware they'II need.

545

I have stripped
everything down for you.

546

This is your homing device,
this is the transmitter.

547
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,099
So you just plant it,
flip the switch
and backup's on its way.

Do not signal
unless you have proof
of what Feng is up to.

We don't want theories.
We want him caught red-handed,

with hard evidence,
so we can put him away
for good.

Yes, sir.

553
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,518
So Iet me guess, fellows.

554

We're gonna stick this
in the heel of our shoe,

a tube of toothpaste,

I think we'II have
to sneak this in
the old-fashioned way.

Good Iuck, secret agent man.
Take care of Uncle, okay?

562
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,229
Uncle can take care
of himself.

been great, but you never
finished your training.

My girl, she really knows
how to handle a man.

Oh, boy!

703
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,438
What the hell is up

I have said some cruel things
about you to my friends
here at the tournament.

I told them that the reason
that you hate me so much

is because I had sex
with your mother.

831

My mother died when I was two.
I hardly knew her.

832

Yeah, I know.
It's a horrible thing to say.

And yet these things
that I say,

1046
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,949
You should've taken my offer.

1047
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:09,684
I would've given you anything.
Anything in the world!

1048
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,749
I want my father back!

1049
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:12,987
Lots of Iuck!

1050
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,079
Come on, get up.

1051
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,611
Come on, fast, fast, fast.
Heads down. Heads down.

1052
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,812

Guys! Guys!

1055
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:48,129
Me, the money
and the Chinese broad
are taking off.

1056
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,360
You see this pen?

1057
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:56,336
This pen contains enough
cyanide to kill everyone
within 100-yard radius.

1058
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,703
Do you think I'd come in here
without a backup plan?

1059
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,800
I'm FBI, pendejo!

1060
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,641
Now, here's
how it's gonna go down.

1061
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,882
Hola. You Iike chorizo?

1062
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,316
Let's get out of here.
He's gonna be really mad.

01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,553
Randy!

1064
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,423
Remember
what I told you, gweilo!

1065
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,558
Feng only finished
one-half of his training.

1066
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,097
Come on.

1067
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,951
I believe it's my serve, Feng.

1068
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,514
Big deal.
I never finished the training.

1069
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,358
What's that mean?
I have no honor or something?

1070
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,454
It means you have
no backhand.

1071
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,416

We are so proud of you!

1078
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,733
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

Seriously, stop it!

You ready, pussycat?

Are you okay?

1083
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,442
Let's go, pussycat,
one more time.

1084
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,536
You got it?

1085
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:52,602
Yeah.

1086
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,548
Oh, no!

1087
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,776
I heard that.

1088

ERNIE:
Okay, no more games.

1089
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,195
Let me help you with that,
Master.

1090
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,266
There you go.

1091
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:16,998
Hey, I wanted to thank you
for everything
that you've done for me.

1092
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:21,475
So I got you
a Iittle something.

1093
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,272
It's really not necessary.

1094
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,316
But Master will accept.

1095
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,150
What is it?
Let me guess.
It's something small.

1096
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,245
No, don't...

1097
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,222
Cufflinks? It's a ring.

1098
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,815
I Iove jewelry.

1099
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,186
I can't guess. What is it?

1100
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,054
It's a new Iucky cricket.

1101
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,455
Oh.

1102
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,597

1103
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,770
I shall carry it

Yeah.

1105
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,848
Don't bother.
He's pretty much dead.

1106
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,176
No, no, no.
I will carry the box.

1107
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,016
It will bring my spare change
great honor.

1108
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,579
Okay, you do that.
You do that.

Hey, gweilo!

1110
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,988

1112
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,434
Good Iuck

Maybe we should
keep this closed.
