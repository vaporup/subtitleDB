1
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,147
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

2
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,405
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt.

3
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,948
Well, thanks, Sara.
I like your CHiPs T-shirt.

4
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,382
- Thanks.
- Fun party, huh?

5
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:00,113
Yeah. Except for Arnie Shankman
being here.

6
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,452
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

7
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:07,321
I feel bad for him with his sister
losing her mind and all.

8
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:11,725
Whatever.

9
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,065
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.

10
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,636
- You want to?
- Sure.

11
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,571
Okay, I'll go first. Truth or dare?

12
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,099
Truth.

13
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,575
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

14
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:26,339
- Well, l--
- Family doesn't count.

15
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,485
- Maybe I'll take dare.
- Okay.

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,651
I dare you to kiss me.

17
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:34,815
Right here?

18
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,791
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

19
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,487
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank,
butt-lick?

20
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,728
- David Buznik.
- I just landed in St. Louis.

21
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:26,432
- I hope you wrote my speech.
- I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

22
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,610
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to St. Louis.

23
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:32,542
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip--

24
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,842
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

25
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,783
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

26
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:40,945
Terrific.

27
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,217
- He hung up on you again, didn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he did.

28
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,055
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the Husky Cat clothing line.

29
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,029
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,226
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so....

31
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:57,566
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

32
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,867
I know. I'll figure something out.

33
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:03,171
I gotta go. Sorry.

34
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,247
I'm gonna miss you.

35
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,079
That guy's looking at us.

36
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,914
You know I don't like it when people
watch me kiss.

37
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:13,214
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,752
Take care.

39
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,953
Okay. Bye.

40
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:21,752
Dave....

41
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,100
- Have a good flight.
- Okay.

42
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,103
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:46,287
I think you're in my seat.

44
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:50,786
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

45
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:54,221
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

46
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:57,366
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

47
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:03,161
Excuse me. This seat's available.

48
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,733
Okay. Thank you.

49
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,502
You're very welcome.

50
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,112
No air.

51
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,676
That's too bad, huh?

52
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,363
You're on my side of the armrest.

53
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:34,696
We're not gonna have problems,
are we?

54
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:36,360
No.

55
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,406
I'm wetting my Jockeys here.

56
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:20,472
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

57
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,481
I mean, you like comedies?

58
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:27,055
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some....

59
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,888
Look at this actress here.

60
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,733
What is your position
on breast implants?

61
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:43,594
This guy.

62
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:46,298
I can just watch the movie with you.

63
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:48,432
Excuse me.

64
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,806
- Could I get a headset?
- Certainly.

65
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:52,205
Thank you.

66
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,686
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

67
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,189
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.

68
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:07,419
Miss?

69
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,661
I'll be right there, sir.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,558
Where's your headset?

71
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:16,103
She's busy right now, but it's coming.

72
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:21,005
For crying out loud. You're missing
important plot points.

73
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,540
Ma'am?

74
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,806
Could you give me a second, sir?

75
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:39,521
Excuse me.

76
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,056
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

77
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,826
- Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
- I wasn't raising my voice.

78
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,059
Just calm down.

79
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,101
I am calm. I just want my headset.

80
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,899
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

81
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,598
If you won't cooperate--

82
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,835
I don't know where a headset
ties into patriotism.

83
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,036
Is there a problem here, sir?

84
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,276
I don't think so.

85
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,419
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

86
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:06,680
A talk about what? There's not a
problem.

87
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:09,484
- The stewardess just keeps--
- Flight attendant.

88
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,056
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when--

89
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,252
Calm down.

90
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,397
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

91
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,193
"You people"?

92
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:18,965
Now wait a minute.

93
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:21,729
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

94
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,737
I will not tolerate any racist
behavior on the plane.

95
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:27,068
This is a difficult time
for our country.

96
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,905
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

97
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,674
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

98
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:34,907
I'm calm!

99
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,891
All rise.

100
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:50,061
- What do you think?
- Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

101
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:56,728
Mr. Buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

102
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:58,632
...I find you guilty.

103
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:04,307
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
Thank God you're okay.

105
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:08,648
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

106
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:13,915
...this court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

107
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,749
Anger management?

108
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,937
Oh, my goodness. Bobby Knight.

109
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:34,106
- You're in this group?
- Oh, yeah. This is my first day.

110
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:37,734
- It's my first day also.
- I hope this class cures me.

111
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,574
Working on the anger problem?

112
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,982
Anger? Isn't this
Sexaholics Anonymous?

113
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,378
No. I think that's down the hall.

114
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:50,719
Well, the hell with this!
I'm going home!

115
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,411
Dr. Rydell?

116
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,014
You don't remember me, do you?

117
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:25,688
- I sat next to you on the plane.
- Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

118
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,953
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

119
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,359
That was a crazy flight.

120
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:34,161
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

121
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,496
Really?

122
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,171
Wow.

123
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,864
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

124
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,034
...and tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

125
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:47,272
I can't just sign your papers.

126
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,644
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that.

127
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:52,513
All right.

128
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,318
How's this?

129
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:56,924
Just hang for one session...

130
00:09:57,092 --> 00:10:00,687
...so I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

131
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:03,855
- Then I'll sign your papers.
- Okay.

132
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,928
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

133
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:08,270
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

134
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,070
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

135
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,505
And I was like, you know,
"Don't go there."

136
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:18,440
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

137
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:22,345
And I said, "Look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

138
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,951
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

139
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,521
...and then I just blacked out.

140
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:29,851
I blacked out.

141
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:33,620
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

142
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:38,529
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

143
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,667
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

144
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:45,564
Not as well as I could've.

145
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:51,008
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

146
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,678
Now, Fury Fighters, let's say hello
to someone...

147
00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:01,016
...who's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

148
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,283
- Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

149
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,448
Hi.

150
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:08,823
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

151
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,590
...and he's feeling much better.

152
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:16,638
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

153
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:18,830
...because I'm only here
for one session.

154
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:23,274
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

155
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,844
- Nice.
- I bet you beat her good.

156
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:30,479
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

157
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,677
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a woman beater.

158
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:35,722
You can't admit it because you're
a piece of garbage.

159
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:40,294
I don't know about all that,
but now I understand why you're here.

160
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:44,361
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbor.

161
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,001
And I took a dump on his porch.

162
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:50,930
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

163
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:52,733
You're superior. He's superior.

164
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:56,901
- Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
- You're not ready. Hear what he said?

165
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,580
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

166
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:02,581
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

167
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:06,551
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

168
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,155
We always do.

169
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,726
- Come on, Dave. Join us.
- Okay.

170
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,660
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

171
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,993
And we're lovers.

172
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:22,137
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy Melo...

173
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:25,364
- ...which was cool, it was in the script.
- Sure.

174
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,032
And then I asked Melo
back to the house with us...

175
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,646
...which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

176
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,537
Variety's good.

177
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:36,342
So anyway, in the middle
of our session...

178
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:39,487
...I look up and I see Gina
kissing Melo on the mouth...

179
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:43,216
...which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

180
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,724
- Stacy bit my toe off.
- Then Melo freaks out...

181
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,428
- ...and calls me a crazy skank.
- Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

182
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:51,793
- So I stapled his lips shut.
- Here we are.

183
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,993
Well, we've all been there.

184
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,240
- I like him.
- Yeah, he's funny.

185
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:01,874
Not as funny as you.

186
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,008
I like that.

187
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,541
- All right, girls.
- Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

188
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,009
Walk it off.

189
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:19,854
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

190
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:23,520
Don't worry, Dr. B, it's just a regular
season game. Not important.

191
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,428
He missed the lay-up!

192
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:28,899
See? Iverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, Sixers lose.

193
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:30,538
Who gives a crap, huh?

194
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,970
I mean, it's just a silly game, anyways.

195
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:40,705
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

196
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:42,640
You gotta dunk that shit!

197
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:44,979
You gotta dunk that shit!

198
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:47,019
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

199
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,154
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

200
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:51,554
Goosfraba.

201
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,592
Goos blah blah.

202
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:56,253
Not "blah blah," Nate.

203
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,964
Goosfraba.

204
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,728
Goosfraba.

205
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,633
That's good. Slower.

206
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:07,536
Goosfraba.

207
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,869
How do you feel?

208
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:10,467
Better.

209
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:14,738
Good job, Nate.

210
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,579
That sound is a derivation
of an old Eskimo word...

211
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:20,119
...that mothers used to calm
their children.

212
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,348
- I see.
- Eskimos seem nice.

213
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,322
- They do.
- I think Eskimos are smug.

214
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:26,927
Hold that thought, Chuck.

215
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,121
So, Dave...

216
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:31,131
...tell us about yourself.

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,289
Who are you?

218
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:35,669
Well, I am an executive assistant...

219
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,169
...at a major pet products company.

220
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:43,308
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

221
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,413
All right.

222
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,612
I'm a pretty good guy.

223
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,677
I like playing tennis on occasion....

224
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:55,117
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

225
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,814
Tell us who you are.

226
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,458
I just....

227
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:04,826
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,126
What did you say?

229
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:09,602
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

230
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,534
No, I just....

231
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:18,777
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

232
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:22,206
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

233
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:25,751
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

234
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,252
I want to know...

235
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,184
- ...who you are.
- What the hell do you want me to say?

236
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,956
I mean, I'm sorry. I just....
I want to answer your question.

237
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:43,229
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

238
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:47,205
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

239
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,311
- Let's move on.
- Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

240
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,640
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

241
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:56,409
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little Spanish fruit topping.

242
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:59,451
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

243
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,256
What are you laughing at, Dave?

244
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,093
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

245
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:13,462
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

246
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:16,801
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

247
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,540
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

248
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:23,768
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

249
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:25,670
Then we'll see who's laughing.

250
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:29,283
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

251
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,715
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

252
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,490
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

253
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,892
- So he's laughing at you.
- I'm not laughing at him.

254
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,368
Goosfraba.

255
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,476
- Goosfraba.
- Okay.

256
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,273
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

257
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,485
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

258
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,918
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

259
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,851
I haven't been to the Actors Studio
in quite some time.

260
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,923
- I'm sure your audition will go well.
- Thanks. I hope so.

261
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,287
- Good night.
- All right.

262
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,723
- Thanks, Buddy.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,090
That was a little bit insane.

264
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:19,528
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

265
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,690
Here you go.

266
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:23,837
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

267
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,264
I agree.

268
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,999
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

269
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:30,839
What do you mean?

270
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:32,570
Let me explain something.

271
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:36,543
There are two kinds of angry people:
explosive and implosive.

272
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:40,752
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

273
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,787
...for not taking their coupons.

274
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:47,721
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

275
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,387
...and finally shoots everyone
in the store.

276
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,158
You're the cashier.

277
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:58,270
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialing 911, I swear.

278
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,565
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...

279
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:03,267
...to help calm you down
when you're losing it.

280
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,534
Chuck.

281
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,543
Not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight,
or the porno girls.

282
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,513
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

283
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:11,308
- Yes.
- Here's my number.

284
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,045
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

285
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:17,118
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to Geraldo Rivera.

286
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,883
- I see.
- My bad. Here.

287
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,459
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

288
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:26,026
Dave and Chuck...

289
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,500
...working together as a team.

290
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,203
- It's a win-win situation.
- Yeah, feels it.

291
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,208
Dave's particulars.

292
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,269
I'll see you soon.

293
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,049
The Yanks are great this season.

294
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,658
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's
win record.

295
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,226
Remember at Brown when we
saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?

296
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,227
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.

297
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:58,558
We could've been too.

298
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,032
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

299
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,298
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet
anyone as good as you.

300
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:08,167
You will. She'll be a very lucky lady.

301
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,937
Thanks for being my best friend.

302
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:14,008
Linda.

303
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:16,343
- Hey, Dave.
- Andrew.

304
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,109
Good to see you guys hugging.

305
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,888
How was the doctor?

306
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:23,056
Psychotic.

307
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,852
Well, did you get any good
promotion news from Mr. Head?

308
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,963
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

309
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:34,296
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

310
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:38,599
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just Brown alumni.

311
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,105
Where'd you go to college again?

312
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,971
Trenton Community College.

313
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:48,377
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

314
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,276
Later, Andrew.

315
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:53,613
--once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

316
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,723
...it'll help you to create a realistic
and a erratic....

317
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,319
Hey, Dave.

318
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:04,225
- Hey. Andrew, what's up?
- Not much.

319
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,999
You always try to simulate live bait.

320
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:11,729
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

321
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,101
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

322
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,673
Be aware of your presentation...

323
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:20,576
...and make sure that,
as you work it along....

324
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:22,075
Oh, yeah.

325
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:26,318
Congratulations.

326
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:29,184
Now that is a big one, folks.

327
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,028
Always a blast being with your friends.

328
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,665
It was a great night.

329
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,824
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

330
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:44,162
Yeah, you like those foot-Iong
hot dogs, don't you?

331
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,107
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal.

332
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:51,944
Saw his...

333
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:54,809
- ...thing.
- You were looking?

334
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,779
Yeah, unfortunately.

335
00:20:57,018 --> 00:21:01,512
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

336
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,414
What are you talking about?

337
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:07,995
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it used to scare you?

338
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:09,152
I never saw it.

339
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:11,156
You never saw it?

340
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:14,925
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?

341
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:17,333
No. No. No. No.

342
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:20,997
It's actually quite petite.

343
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:23,210
I felt bad for him.

344
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:27,045
It looked like it belonged on a baby
and it had a funny color.

345
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:30,877
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

346
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,053
Like, "What the hell's that thing?"

347
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,554
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

348
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:41,526
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 18.

349
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,298
- Which isn't bad.
- You're doing really good.

350
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,797
Thanks.

351
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:53,372
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

352
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,204
- Hello?
- Dave, it's me, Chuck.

353
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:00,943
- Who's Chuck?
- Your anger ally.

354
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,981
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

355
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:04,583
A very bad mood.

356
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:08,280
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more Fudgeicles.

357
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,222
- What's an anger ally?
- Who's that?

358
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,617
She making fun of me?

359
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:15,923
No. That's my girlfriend.

360
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:20,227
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

361
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,633
We're a little busy right now.

362
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:24,896
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

363
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:28,731
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

364
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,787
After I got kicked out of the Army,
I went through a real bad time:

365
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:46,518
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

366
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,695
Finally, my parents said I
had to move out.

367
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:53,763
I'm guessing that's when you decided
to shack up with your aunt.

368
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,066
Don't get cute, wiseass!

369
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:57,795
But, yes.

370
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,499
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

371
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:06,545
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

372
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,715
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

373
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,715
Is this Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?

374
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,979
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

375
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:17,620
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

376
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,693
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

377
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:21,884
Settle.

378
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:26,523
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.

379
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:31,704
Wake up to the sound
of kids screaming.

380
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:33,870
Explosions everywhere.

381
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,075
Never know when your number's up.

382
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:39,007
Vietnam, huh?

383
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:43,115
- Grenada, man.
- Grenada?

384
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,216
Wasn't that like 12 hours long?

385
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:52,014
Did you see that?

386
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:56,293
- See what?
- That guy. He just gave me a look.

387
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,296
He didn't give you a look.

388
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:03,470
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-Semitic remark.

389
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:05,934
Are you Jewish?

390
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:09,873
I could be. But, no. Half Irish,
half Italian, half Mexican.

391
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,604
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

392
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:16,774
Well, the guy on the left is blind,
Chuck.

393
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,780
I hear you.

394
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,209
He's yours.

395
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:22,385
No. That's not what I was saying.

396
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:24,949
- Hey.
- What the hell?

397
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:26,787
Got something against guys
with hair?

398
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:27,950
What's going on?

399
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:35,761
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

400
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:38,064
Stop! Goosfraba!

401
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,228
You piece of shit!

402
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,149
Stop it! Stop it!

403
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:54,588
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

404
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:58,887
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

405
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:02,952
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

406
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:05,257
Flight attendant, Your Honor.

407
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,559
I didn't hit her on purpose,
Your Honor.

408
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,795
I was being attacked by someone...

409
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:13,599
...and while I was
trying to take away his....

410
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,241
His....

411
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:18,105
Trying to take away my cane,
Your Honor.

412
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:22,412
You cracked a waitress in the face...

413
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,279
...while attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

414
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:29,450
Your Honor, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

415
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,991
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

416
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,426
Happy now, ass-wipe?

417
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:44,033
Mr. Buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

418
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:45,933
Maybe you don't know either...

419
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,134
...but I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

420
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,813
- Isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
- No!

421
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:55,471
Okay.

422
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:02,616
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- By all means, Dr. Rydell.

423
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,814
Thank you.

424
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,462
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

425
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:18,299
- You look marvelous, Brenda.
- Thank you.

426
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,168
- And how are the boys?
- Fantastic.

427
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:23,242
James made the basketball team,
Raheem landed the lead...

428
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:24,901
...in Fiddler on the Roof.

429
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,674
Raheem will make
a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.

430
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,218
So do you have a take
on this Buznik guy?

431
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,150
Is this good or bad?

432
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:38,317
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

433
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,153
...but it's good that....

434
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:44,158
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

435
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,057
- You think you can help him?
- I think so, Your Honor.

436
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:53,330
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

437
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,206
Mr. Buznik...

438
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:05,875
...because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

439
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:09,023
...I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management program...

440
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,521
...for 30 days.

441
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:14,952
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his program...

442
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:18,064
...you will spend the next year
in state prison.

443
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:33,837
- Buddy?
- Good evening. Ready to get it on?

444
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:35,642
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

445
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:37,250
Well, well, well.

446
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:38,783
The lair of the rage rhino.

447
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:41,922
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

448
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:44,318
- Where should we put my stuff?
- What stuff?

449
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:47,217
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

450
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,988
My approach dictates
intense observation.

451
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:53,064
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

452
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,962
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

453
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,403
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

454
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:02,802
Sit down, Dave.

455
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:07,146
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

456
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:09,609
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

457
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:12,149
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

458
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,414
...is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

459
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,648
...in your behavior.

460
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:18,950
Now we can do it here
or Rikers Island.

461
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,458
- Anything else, Dr. B?
- No thanks, Dan.

462
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,994
We'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.

463
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:25,187
Wiretaps?

464
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,867
- Is this your CD collection?
- Yes.

465
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,032
Oh, my.

466
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:33,497
What are you doing?

467
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:36,871
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

468
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:38,842
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean....

469
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:41,505
Don't be naive, Dave.

470
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,841
"Close to You."
"We've Only Just Begun."

471
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:47,783
Songs of madness and obsession.

472
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:50,786
Who's going to pay for that?

473
00:28:50,992 --> 00:28:55,952
Retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

474
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:59,162
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.

475
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,361
Good.

476
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:05,199
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

477
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,135
My girlfriend got me that.

478
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,277
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

479
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,883
...and vulgar hand gestures.

480
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:19,815
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances...

481
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:23,718
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine...

482
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,519
...Slippy-Flippies, Jelly Stingers,
Trick Sticks...

483
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:28,491
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.

484
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:31,392
- How about Fiddle Faddles?
- Under my supervision.

485
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,596
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

486
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,227
...please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

487
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:42,068
...depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

488
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:45,734
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

489
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,881
...and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

490
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,949
...at how much fun we can have.

491
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:54,487
Jeez, without Slippy-Flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

492
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:58,853
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

493
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,625
Dave, I got this for you.

494
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,388
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

495
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,397
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

496
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,933
I'm feeling very angry right now...

497
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:14,199
...because I only have one bed
and no couch.

498
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:15,773
Not a problem.

499
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:23,548
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

500
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:27,218
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

501
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:30,888
By the way....

502
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,724
I like to sleep in the nude.

503
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:16,896
You hear that frog?

504
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:18,594
Nope.

505
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:37,446
What do you want?

506
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:40,456
I'm just recording your demeanor
upon awakening.

507
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:44,631
Good to see you got your underwear
back on.

508
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:46,391
6:30?

509
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:48,499
I don't gotta be up till 7.

510
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:50,466
You've got to make my breakfast.

511
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:54,802
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

512
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:58,710
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

513
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,245
...wheat toast, dry, and please...

514
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:03,076
...tell me you've got ketchup.

515
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:05,342
There's a Denny's down the street.

516
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:06,918
Not only do they have ketchup...

517
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,648
...but they got the angriest waitresses
I've seen.

518
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:13,157
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

519
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:14,518
Lame-o.

520
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,809
Your eggs.

521
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:50,357
- Holy shit!
- I said over easy!!

522
00:32:55,736 --> 00:32:57,101
Now, why did I do that?

523
00:32:57,705 --> 00:33:00,697
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

524
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:06,444
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

525
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:09,277
Alpha-Bits.

526
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,816
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

527
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,582
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

528
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:21,425
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

529
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,560
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

530
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:29,566
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'Il,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

531
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:32,262
Well, I have to join you at work.

532
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:33,735
Full contact.

533
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:37,767
That will make me look nuts, Buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

534
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:40,276
...you whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

535
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:44,507
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

536
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,277
It's not a weakness.

537
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,023
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

538
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:54,285
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed.

539
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:57,454
The Talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

540
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,457
...there's something to be seen."

541
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:02,632
Look, Dave.

542
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:17,816
- What exactly was that all about?
- What?

543
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:21,648
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

544
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:25,656
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

545
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,249
Flustered?

546
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,299
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

547
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:37,469
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- I need you to unfluster.

548
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:41,236
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

549
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,775
We will proceed when you
are centered.

550
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:45,309
I'm centered, I'm centered.

551
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:48,312
There's 10,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

552
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:53,545
What is that? Is that good?

553
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:55,546
We're going to sing a song.

554
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,824
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to.... I've gotta go.

555
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:01,153
Here we go.

556
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:05,059
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen Sondheim's...

557
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,860
...West Side Story.

558
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,095
"I Feel Pretty."

559
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,504
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

560
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:17,235
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

561
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:18,906
Wow. Sorry.

562
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,470
Move your ass, dipshit!

563
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,443
Burn in hell!

564
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,893
Yes!

565
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,639
You feel stunning.

566
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,637
And entrancing.

567
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,757
You're late.

568
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:18,398
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie up on the bridge.

569
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:21,558
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

570
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:25,171
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

571
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,567
May I interject?

572
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,399
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

573
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,569
We mustn't absorb and repress.

574
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:36,546
- Who's this?
- I'm his anger management therapist.

575
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:38,982
You're in anger management?

576
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,921
Temporarily, yeah.

577
00:37:43,257 --> 00:37:46,317
Do you remember the flight
to St. Louis...

578
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:49,792
...that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

579
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:52,762
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

580
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,423
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

581
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:56,866
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

582
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,065
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

583
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:06,736
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

584
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,576
You said your apartment caught fire.

585
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,947
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

586
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:17,716
Might I have your first name,
Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.

587
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,122
- It's Frank.
- Fran.

588
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:25,126
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

589
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:27,558
What went on on that flight?

590
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:30,903
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I....

591
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,504
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

592
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:36,165
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

593
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:39,642
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

594
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,508
- I didn't.
- You broke her nose.

595
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:43,741
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

596
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,847
I mean, I accidentally did that.

597
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:50,047
Dave, you have a disease.

598
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:53,990
Would you apologize if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

599
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:58,257
Why do you feel you have to apologize
because you're suffering from T.A.S.?

600
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,322
T.A.S.?

601
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,196
Toxic Anger Syndrome.

602
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:05,036
I don't have T.A.S.

603
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:08,333
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

604
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,033
His name is Frank!

605
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:16,615
No. I'm sorry.

606
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:31,556
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

607
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:35,395
...but there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

608
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:38,504
...who might feel a little
self-conscious...

609
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,765
...about how they look
in certain outfits.

610
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:44,206
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

611
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:47,211
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

612
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:51,374
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...

613
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,884
...and away goes the chin.

614
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:55,783
I'm so handsome.

615
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:02,759
- Hey, Dave. This is your office?
- Andrew.

616
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,524
- What are you doing here?
- I played golf with Frank.

617
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:09,198
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

618
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:12,395
Really? I've been wanting to play golf
with him a long time.

619
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,541
- Is it awesome there?
- It's nice.

620
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:22,576
So, anyway, Dave, how's
anger management going?

621
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,949
Who told you about that?

622
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,713
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

623
00:40:27,888 --> 00:40:31,517
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

624
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,592
No. I mean, I like to consider myself
her best friend...

625
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:39,596
...but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

626
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,895
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

627
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,462
I gotta go. Bye.

628
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:51,976
Well, well, well.

629
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:54,509
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

630
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:56,808
Really? I didn't notice that.

631
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:00,642
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

632
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:04,382
...who looks as though he could satisfy
a blue whale?

633
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,884
Well, it's....
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

634
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,696
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

635
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:13,725
What's up?

636
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:17,796
- This is your young lady?
- That's my Linda.

637
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:20,064
My, oh, my.

638
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:24,577
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

639
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,111
...because of the kitty-cat clothes,
so forth.

640
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,275
What does she do?

641
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:33,651
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

642
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:35,818
I love poetry.

643
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:40,655
Oh, my, my, my. It's....

644
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,823
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

645
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,833
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

646
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:52,835
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

647
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:55,566
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

648
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:56,766
Or a genius.

649
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:02,405
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

650
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,141
...I'll arrange a hearing.

651
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:08,484
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

652
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:17,758
Hi, Nancy.

653
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,831
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

654
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:24,598
Sorry. I just heard you guys
got cleaner seats than us.

655
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,264
Not after I get through with them.

656
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:34,504
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

657
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:38,742
- I've been very patient with you.
- Beware the fury of the patient man.

658
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:41,513
- I'm serious!
- Too serious.

659
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:43,212
Get undressed.

660
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,451
What did you say?

661
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,952
Take off your clothes.

662
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,688
I've got a stress-reduction technique
to show you.

663
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:53,799
- It'll be good for you.
- Take off my clothes?

664
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:56,197
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?

665
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,300
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

666
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:05,639
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

667
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:09,614
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

668
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,059
- What's up, baby?
- Why are we here?

669
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:26,597
I'm not a homophobe.

670
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:29,531
My lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.

671
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:32,194
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

672
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,698
Looking for company, baby?

673
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,706
No. We're not. Thank you.

674
00:43:36,877 --> 00:43:38,538
It's worth 50 bucks...

675
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:43,479
...if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

676
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,379
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.

677
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,216
Oh, boy, here we go.

678
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:54,886
- Hello.
- Hey. Good to see you.

679
00:43:55,963 --> 00:43:58,955
- What's your name, baby?
- Melvin.

680
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,726
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

681
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:05,303
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

682
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:08,805
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.

683
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,306
Great.

684
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:13,708
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

685
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,972
Brooklyn.

686
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:18,542
What part of Germany
do you hail from?

687
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,315
I'm from a little Bavarian village
called Lickin Zee Dickin.

688
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,514
Care to visit?

689
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:29,189
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

690
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:31,763
...in Girls Without Wieners-ville.

691
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,099
I'm more comfortable there.

692
00:44:36,837 --> 00:44:39,431
He's just not used to male intimacy.

693
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,903
Well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.

694
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:44,609
Oops, no, I'm not.

695
00:44:44,778 --> 00:44:45,802
Whoa! There it is.

696
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:49,545
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

697
00:44:51,351 --> 00:44:52,340
Oh, my God.

698
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:55,615
What does this have to do
with anger management?

699
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:59,384
- Oh, are you an angry boy?
- No.

700
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,117
Do you need some discipline?

701
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,522
No, thank you very--

702
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:04,789
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

703
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:08,297
Listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!

704
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:11,596
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

705
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:14,263
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

706
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:17,035
Your services are no longer required.

707
00:45:18,445 --> 00:45:19,707
You know what?

708
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:21,808
You guys are freaks.

709
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:26,109
Give me the tape recorder.

710
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:29,882
Come on.

711
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:35,059
Patient number 135, David Buznik...

712
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:38,994
...has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

713
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:43,694
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my program.

714
00:45:43,904 --> 00:45:46,304
Great. Can I go throw up now?

715
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:54,109
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

716
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:57,011
- Whoa, there it is.
- I feel like dancing.

717
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,413
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John...

718
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:04,421
...if she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

719
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:07,253
But Buddy didn't order you
to have sex.

720
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:09,258
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.

721
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:12,094
- Hello?
- Is Buddy there?

722
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:14,926
No, he's in the shower right now.

723
00:46:15,135 --> 00:46:16,762
This is Becky, his assistant.

724
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:19,098
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

725
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:22,298
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

726
00:46:22,476 --> 00:46:27,675
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
County Hospital for the next two days.

727
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:44,156
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

728
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:46,526
...and brushing my teeth
at the same time.

729
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:49,099
It looks really good.

730
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,228
What's the matter?

731
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:57,202
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, Buddy.

732
00:46:57,811 --> 00:46:59,278
What's wrong with my mother?

733
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:02,347
She's having surgery.

734
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:03,574
I'm sorry.

735
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,413
- Is it serious?
- When is surgery not serious?

736
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:10,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

737
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:13,258
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

738
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:16,418
...see what's going on up there.

739
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:20,054
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

740
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:23,368
Spend some quality time. I'll stay here.

741
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:25,164
It'll be good for you guys.

742
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:26,771
Oh, God.

743
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:35,542
You're all I got, Mom.
Please don't leave me.

744
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:44,019
No more clam chowder.

745
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:47,448
Buddy...

746
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:49,117
...it was a joke.

747
00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:52,323
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

748
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:56,235
- A joke?
- Yeah.

749
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:58,061
Oh, boy.

750
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:01,001
A joke. A jo-- I....

751
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,540
I can't believe that I fell for that one.

752
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:08,442
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

753
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,350
I'm going to get you back for that one.

754
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:19,552
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

755
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:24,590
I thought you said you were joking.

756
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:26,925
No, the serious part was the joke.

757
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:30,466
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

758
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:34,805
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

759
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:38,171
...see what's really going on up there.

760
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:41,940
Why don't you--? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

761
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:47,141
What?

762
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:51,149
- I can't believe he's making me go.
- How come you guys aren't flying?

763
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:55,385
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

764
00:48:55,562 --> 00:48:58,258
Meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass
about that catalog.

765
00:48:58,431 --> 00:49:01,195
I've got to get it done with nut-boy
in Boston.

766
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:03,425
Why can't Head write his own catalog?

767
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:06,037
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

768
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:09,107
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his--

769
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:12,177
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

770
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:15,439
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

771
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:18,778
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any Jelly Stingers.

772
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:20,920
Well, that's going to be tough!

773
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:33,690
Oh, God. There he is.

774
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:35,801
- That's him?
- Yes.

775
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:41,466
What? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

776
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,864
My--

777
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,704
The quiet warmth

778
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:49,611
Smoldering beneath the rituals
Of hope for familiarity

779
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:52,579
A coursing underground river

780
00:49:52,752 --> 00:49:56,119
Pregnant with the chance currents
Of knowledge and love

781
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:59,622
- What?
- That's my poem! I wrote that.

782
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:01,055
I know.

783
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:03,559
That is your poem. I love that poem.

784
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,324
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

785
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:08,592
...on the floor of David's bedroom.

786
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:14,397
- Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
- Who was great on Police Woman.

787
00:50:14,674 --> 00:50:19,077
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

788
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:22,743
I think I better get going.

789
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,049
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

790
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,085
- How about a kiss?
- I'd love a kiss.

791
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:32,019
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

792
00:50:32,192 --> 00:50:34,592
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

793
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:35,853
Got it.

794
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,793
Thank you. And, take care.

795
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:41,091
Have a great trip, you guys.

796
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,529
Oh, we will.

797
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:43,964
Bye.

798
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,234
What?

799
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:54,744
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

800
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,415
Good. Then we can't go.

801
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,141
No, I can get out.

802
00:50:58,418 --> 00:51:01,285
- Get in.
- I don't know how you'll get out.

803
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:05,485
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

804
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:11,990
What's he doing?

805
00:51:20,473 --> 00:51:23,636
Well, you're batting a thousand...

806
00:51:23,843 --> 00:51:25,572
...in craziness.

807
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:30,312
Now we're bumping into cars.

808
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:33,145
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

809
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,287
If I had lost my temper...

810
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:37,787
...would I have had
the presence of mind...

811
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:40,926
...to leave my card
and my insurance information?

812
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:44,689
Whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-
A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-...

813
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:46,388
...While-Swinging-The-Bat Guy.

814
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:56,772
I think you've got room to back up.

815
00:52:09,522 --> 00:52:12,320
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

816
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:13,891
Think you can do better?

817
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,291
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

818
00:52:17,464 --> 00:52:20,490
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

819
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,157
Procrastination, Dave.

820
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:23,768
I'm not procrastinating.

821
00:52:23,937 --> 00:52:26,371
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

822
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:30,134
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.

823
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,144
What's your plan,
ask her at a Yankee game?

824
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:37,246
Actually, yes. How did you know?

825
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,749
I said the corniest thing
I could think of.

826
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,922
If you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

827
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:45,785
Putting up a "Marry me, please"
on the scoreboard...

828
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:49,292
...proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

829
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:54,057
As you seem to have noticed, I'm
a little bit jumpy with public affection.

830
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:57,269
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

831
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:01,367
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

832
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,259
A five-hour trip to find out Mommy
had a jelly bean...

833
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:22,519
...removed from her nose.

834
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:25,095
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

835
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,384
You could have her, you know.

836
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:50,450
I'm sure she'd love to hang out
with a goofy secretary...

837
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:53,183
...whose only talent
is nostril wiggling.

838
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,292
- Girls love that.
- Dave...

839
00:53:56,462 --> 00:54:00,330
...you've got a lot more going for you
than wiggly nostrils.

840
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:03,297
I want you to go over there
and ask that woman out.

841
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,198
No, I got a girlfriend.

842
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:10,542
I'm not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.

843
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,679
Flirting is cheating's ugly cousin,
Buddy.

844
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:15,574
I'm not a cheater.

845
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:19,442
Is it cheating if you're passed around
the cell block like a peace pipe?

846
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,784
Because that is what's on the docket
for you if you don't go and ask her out.

847
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,152
Okay, Dave?

848
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh, God.

849
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,393
That's my boy.

850
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:40,696
Excuse me.

851
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:45,572
I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink. I see that you have a drink...

852
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:49,112
...but I could get you another
when you're through with that one.

853
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:52,317
Bite me.

854
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:56,380
Nice meeting you. Okay.

855
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:03,020
Can you guess why she rejected you?

856
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:07,462
She wanted to be like the 2000 other
girls who said that to me growing up?

857
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:10,194
No. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.

858
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:14,366
Confidence is the key
to winning a young lady's attention.

859
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,209
Now, listen to me very carefully.

860
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,971
- Approach Miss Thing again.
- No.

861
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:21,237
With confidence.

862
00:55:21,414 --> 00:55:23,541
And if she says no this time...

863
00:55:23,716 --> 00:55:27,049
...I will admit that I am a failure
as a therapist...

864
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,381
...and release you from my program.

865
00:55:29,689 --> 00:55:31,919
You'll release me from your program?

866
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,634
Just go over there
and repeat the following...

867
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,534
...verbatim:

868
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:48,306
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

869
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:51,841
...but it's difficult for me
to express myself...

870
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:55,970
...when I'm on the verge of exploding
in my pants.

871
00:56:00,053 --> 00:56:02,283
- Get out of here.
- Trust me, Dave.

872
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:06,023
If you are calm as well as witty,
she will respond.

873
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:09,593
Witty went out the window with
the pants explosion thing, thanks.

874
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:12,029
My offer stands.

875
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:18,470
So if I repeat that crazy shit...

876
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:22,799
...you probably stole from
a porno flick, you sick bastard...

877
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,073
...and get rejected...

878
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:27,302
...you'll release me from the program?

879
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:28,969
Exactly.

880
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:31,207
Here we go.

881
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,145
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.

882
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:06,274
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

883
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,956
...but it's difficult for me...

884
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,591
...to express myself...

885
00:57:31,244 --> 00:57:34,236
...when I am on the verge...

886
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:40,081
...of exploding in my pants.

887
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:46,550
You are too cute.

888
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:48,726
Get the fuck out of here.

889
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:53,455
- I'm Kendra.
- I'm Dave.

890
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:54,927
Let me buy you a drink.

891
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:58,267
Can I get a cosmopolitan?

892
00:58:06,946 --> 00:58:08,641
I couldn't take it anymore...

893
00:58:08,848 --> 00:58:12,147
...so finally I just tell my boss:

894
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:16,412
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you,
I'll squeeze your head."

895
00:58:16,923 --> 00:58:20,757
- I didn't say that, but I should have.
- You are so funny.

896
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,929
Too bad you're leaving town.
We could have fun together.

897
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:27,960
Unfortunately, I am leaving
in the morning.

898
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:30,466
In fact, I think I gotta get back
to my friend.

899
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:39,802
What's the matter?

900
00:58:41,113 --> 00:58:43,308
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What's wrong?

901
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:45,381
My friend took off on me.

902
00:58:45,618 --> 00:58:47,449
I can give you a ride.

903
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,551
I don't even know where the guy lives.

904
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:52,748
We can hang out at my place until you
get in touch with him.

905
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:02,861
I bet there's like 50 Rydells in here.

906
00:59:03,069 --> 00:59:05,435
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.

907
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,365
What? You're not fat.

908
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,304
My clothes hide it, but I'm
getting gooey right here.

909
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:12,009
I don't see any goo.

910
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:14,736
You want to see goo,
I'll show you my ass.

911
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:17,982
Well, I see it,
and I didn't five years ago.

912
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,017
I went out with this guy,
and he wouldn't sleep with me.

913
00:59:21,187 --> 00:59:25,180
And I asked him why, and he said that
when he saw me without my clothes...

914
00:59:26,092 --> 00:59:27,787
...that I look like a porker.

915
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,589
He was probably just nervous
because you're beautiful and....

916
00:59:31,931 --> 00:59:34,957
Anyways, you're not a porker.
You're the un-porker.

917
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:36,999
You're Sizzlean.

918
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,331
- You're so sweet, Dave.
- Well, you're sweet, Kendra.

919
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:47,569
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.

920
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:49,246
Rose.

921
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,583
Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.

922
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:55,948
Rose Rydell! I got it!

923
01:00:00,593 --> 01:00:01,582
Kendra...

924
01:00:02,695 --> 01:00:05,858
...even though I'd love to see you
take that bra off...

925
01:00:06,098 --> 01:00:10,398
...because it represents a team
I've hated my entire life...

926
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:12,862
...I think you gotta keep it on.

927
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,131
Why?

928
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:17,441
Because I got a girlfriend.

929
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,206
I'm not a child, Dave.

930
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:25,748
If you think I'm a porker, then just
come right out and say it.

931
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,647
No. I don't think you're a porker.

932
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,618
Then why when the idea of sleeping
with me comes up...

933
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,088
...do you all of a sudden
have a "girlfriend"?

934
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:35,819
Because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.

935
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:37,895
Said the liar to the beached whale!

936
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:39,497
You're not a beached whale.

937
01:00:39,665 --> 01:00:42,031
If anything, you could even
gain a few pounds.

938
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,535
So now I'm too skinny for you?

939
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:47,102
No. I didn't mean that.

940
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:50,298
- Is this what you want, Dave?
- No.

941
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:52,101
If I put on a few pounds...

942
01:00:52,278 --> 01:00:56,078
...will you be able to stifle your vomit
long enough to have sex with me?!

943
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:57,780
Holy shit.

944
01:00:58,017 --> 01:01:01,350
Are you such a hot stud
that you'll break me in two?!

945
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,751
You're angry right now. Wanna sing?
Do you know "I Feel Pretty"?

946
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,256
- Get out! Get out!
- Stop!

947
01:01:08,494 --> 01:01:09,620
Get out!

948
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:11,592
Get out!!

949
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:13,496
Porker!

950
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:14,688
Fatty!

951
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:17,525
No!!

952
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,042
How did it go, pal?

953
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:35,311
- Why'd you ditch me?
- What are you talking about?

954
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:37,046
You gave me the signal.

955
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:39,348
I didn't give you the signal to leave.

956
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:43,120
I gave you the signal to say your
gross pickup line actually worked.

957
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,229
Well, of course it did.

958
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:49,067
So did Little Davey need
some anger management?

959
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:51,601
- That chick was killer.
- Serial killer.

960
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:54,239
She tried to chocolate me to death.

961
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:56,466
Anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.

962
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,946
- Speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
- Oh, yeah?

963
01:02:01,213 --> 01:02:04,512
She seemed a little bit
bent out of shape.

964
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:08,050
- About what?
- Your being out with another woman.

965
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,280
- How would she know that?
- I told her.

966
01:02:11,457 --> 01:02:13,789
- What else could I do?
- What else could you do?

967
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:18,453
You could've told her something else.
I was at the bank. I was at the store.

968
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:21,566
I ate bad guacamole
and I couldn't stop shitting!

969
01:02:21,734 --> 01:02:23,565
Any of those would have been fine!

970
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:26,800
Well, I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't lie
for my patients.

971
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:30,499
You want to leave your friend and
run off and chase some hot babe...

972
01:02:30,776 --> 01:02:32,744
...you can't expect me to cover for you.

973
01:02:32,912 --> 01:02:35,574
I did what you told me to do,
you sick, demented man.

974
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:40,708
What are you laughing at?

975
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:43,277
What's so funny?

976
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:49,724
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine,
an actress. Pretty good one too.

977
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:54,389
I arranged for her to be in the bar
and for you to pick her up.

978
01:02:58,237 --> 01:02:59,499
You were messing with me?

979
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:02,402
Yeah. You know, just a joke
between friends...

980
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:05,942
...like the one you pulled on me
about my dying mother.

981
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:08,410
I told you I'd get you back for that.

982
01:03:09,615 --> 01:03:10,604
All right.

983
01:03:14,153 --> 01:03:16,348
So you really didn't talk to Linda.

984
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:20,123
Of course I did.
That's what made it so funny.

985
01:03:23,028 --> 01:03:24,325
Where's your phone?

986
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:28,795
She's not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.

987
01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:31,569
She doesn't know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?

988
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:36,434
Yeah, that's it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.

989
01:03:36,675 --> 01:03:39,166
"The testicle with legs." Great!!

990
01:03:39,345 --> 01:03:42,974
Now wait a minute. Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.

991
01:03:43,149 --> 01:03:46,084
Maybe just hum a little "I Feel Pretty."

992
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,810
No!! How about you hum
the "I'm a Crazy Asshole" song?

993
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:52,719
And take me home, you
psychotic piece of wacko.

994
01:03:53,626 --> 01:03:56,117
I never thought you'd take it like this.

995
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:10,667
So, what, we're not going to talk at all?

996
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:17,441
Would you forgive me if I told you
I called Linda last night...

997
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:21,277
...after our little fracas
and explained that it was my fault?

998
01:04:21,654 --> 01:04:22,643
What did she say?

999
01:04:22,888 --> 01:04:28,155
Well, she's not mad at you anymore,
but she let me have it pretty good.

1000
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,453
You deserved it. I did nothing wrong.

1001
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:32,290
I know. I know.

1002
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:35,122
Friends?

1003
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:40,864
- Take a little nap.
- I am tired.

1004
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,871
Well, you had a rough night.

1005
01:04:56,655 --> 01:04:58,213
Stop with the cupcake!

1006
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:02,661
Rise and shine, Sir Snoozola.

1007
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,463
What's going on? Where are we?

1008
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:08,429
Well, at a great deal of expense
and effort...

1009
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:12,196
...we have managed to locate
your grade school bête noire...

1010
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:13,360
...Arnie Shankman.

1011
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:16,736
We do desire a confrontation with him,
do we not?

1012
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:20,740
What? Do you mean the kid
who bullied me in fifth grade?

1013
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:24,906
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you
to confront your childhood nemesis.

1014
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:28,778
Remember, for 22 more days,
you are mine.

1015
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,386
This is where Arnie Shankman lives?

1016
01:05:36,595 --> 01:05:39,689
You're kidding me. You're going to
make me confront a monk.

1017
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:42,193
Great.

1018
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:50,940
Are you ashamed that you
never stood up to him?

1019
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,941
No. He was just a kid lashing out...

1020
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:55,637
...because his sister got sent
to an insane asylum.

1021
01:05:55,814 --> 01:05:58,374
I'm surprised your research
didn't tell you that.

1022
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:00,884
This doesn't look like him.

1023
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:06,049
Excuse me, Arnie Shankman?

1024
01:06:07,293 --> 01:06:09,955
Sorry about waking you up.

1025
01:06:10,729 --> 01:06:13,129
My name is Pana Kamanana...

1026
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:16,760
...but, yes, I was once known
as Arnie Shankman.

1027
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:18,296
Arnie....

1028
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,961
Pana Kamanana...

1029
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:23,602
...Dave Buznik
from elementary school.

1030
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:27,011
David Buznik.

1031
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:30,282
This is the last place I thought
I'd find you, a monastery.

1032
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:34,044
You could say I've gone through
a rather dramatic transformation.

1033
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:36,449
Could you excuse him for a second,
Peanuts?

1034
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,720
His name's not Peanuts.
It's Pana Manapia.

1035
01:06:40,893 --> 01:06:44,329
You want me to fight a monk?
He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

1036
01:06:44,496 --> 01:06:47,932
For Pete's sake, this is the monk
that twisted your tits!

1037
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,534
Confront him or you're going to prison!

1038
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:53,294
All right. All right. All right.

1039
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:02,074
Anyways, what I wanted to say to you
was...

1040
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:06,612
...when we were kids, you kind of
bullied me around a little bit...

1041
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:11,188
...and I never really did anything
to deserve that kind of treatment.

1042
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:13,891
Of course not. I was a real cretin then.

1043
01:07:14,126 --> 01:07:16,526
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.

1044
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:19,960
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.

1045
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:22,962
You pulled my gym shorts down
in front of Sara Plowman.

1046
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,130
That actually was pretty funny.

1047
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:29,800
Jeez, I don't think that it was.

1048
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:33,239
Now, come, David.
Humor is the spice of life.

1049
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:35,447
The look on your face was priceless.

1050
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:38,506
"Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!"

1051
01:07:39,585 --> 01:07:42,213
So Pena likes the spicy humor.

1052
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:46,414
Maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper
you told me about the great Buddha.

1053
01:07:46,592 --> 01:07:48,150
What did you say about Buddha?

1054
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:51,956
Dave said, "How does a guy
who weighs over 600 pounds...

1055
01:07:52,131 --> 01:07:55,259
...have the balls to teach people
about self-discipline?"

1056
01:07:56,435 --> 01:07:58,266
Let's not make fun of my God, here.

1057
01:07:58,437 --> 01:08:01,998
You know what else Dave finds
particularly piquant?

1058
01:08:02,241 --> 01:08:05,802
Recalling your nut-job sister
struggling with her underpants...

1059
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:07,036
...in a straitjacket.

1060
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:08,543
You think that's funny?

1061
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:10,807
Dave used to con her
into getting naked...

1062
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:13,747
...by saying that her clothes
had ghosts in them.

1063
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:15,147
That never happened.

1064
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,413
Then he'd pull out his winkie
and tell her...

1065
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:20,251
...it was a strawberry ice-cream cone.

1066
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:24,056
Is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1067
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:27,096
Did you expose yourself...

1068
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:28,593
...to my sister?

1069
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:34,903
- And don't shove me again.
- It's shower-room humiliation again.

1070
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:38,565
He's giving you a wet willie and
making you chew on his jockstrap...

1071
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,678
...and fart blossom and all this.

1072
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,817
Answer me, Buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?

1073
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:49,577
Over and over again.

1074
01:08:50,956 --> 01:08:53,925
And she moaned like a wildebeest.

1075
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:56,060
Wildebeest.

1076
01:08:59,298 --> 01:09:01,232
Whoo! Now, that felt good!

1077
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,493
I wasn't expecting that
from a Buddhist.

1078
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:08,295
- I'm a little pissed off right now.
- You all right? You're all right.

1079
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:15,872
David! David! No, David!

1080
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:17,675
Easy, boy!

1081
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,215
Sorry.

1082
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,479
Help me, brother.

1083
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:24,247
- Help me.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

1084
01:09:24,556 --> 01:09:27,218
Okay, we're even. We're even now.

1085
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:30,018
- I went crazy. I'm so sorry.
- I started it.

1086
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:31,719
- I started it.
- It's all right.

1087
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:33,660
And I'm gonna finish it!

1088
01:09:34,933 --> 01:09:36,901
Now we're even, butt-lick!

1089
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:39,260
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

1090
01:09:39,438 --> 01:09:43,169
"What's that, Auntie Em?
It's a twister!"

1091
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:44,966
My nipples!

1092
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,771
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.

1093
01:09:47,946 --> 01:09:50,346
I got Casper in my clothes!

1094
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:54,850
- Pretty good.
- Thanks, baby.

1095
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,009
I'll kill you!

1096
01:09:56,955 --> 01:09:58,889
You want that rake?

1097
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:01,685
You can't get that rake from me!

1098
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,327
Look, everybody!

1099
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:05,463
Pana Banana's got a heinie.

1100
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:07,961
- He's got a heinie!
- I give!

1101
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:09,828
- I give!
- All right. I'm sorry.

1102
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:13,466
- Friends?
- You suck!

1103
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:17,531
Shankman!

1104
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:20,200
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

1105
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:22,505
- I've seen enough.
- Hold it right there.

1106
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:24,911
This party's by invitation only.

1107
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:31,084
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

1108
01:10:37,462 --> 01:10:39,453
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1109
01:10:45,604 --> 01:10:47,697
Hold it back there! Come on, come on.

1110
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:48,931
Start the car!

1111
01:10:49,107 --> 01:10:51,200
Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!

1112
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,469
Now! Now! Now! Now!

1113
01:11:00,452 --> 01:11:01,612
Oh, boy!

1114
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:03,618
We were like Butch and Sundance!

1115
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:07,247
Oh, my God! I thought you
were going to shoot somebody!

1116
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:14,390
You really threw me some curves
back there, kid.

1117
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,296
I never expected it to go that way.

1118
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:20,466
But you kicked some serious
monk ass there, baby.

1119
01:11:20,639 --> 01:11:22,334
You're damn right, baby!

1120
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:26,066
- How did it feel?
- I feel good! I feel incredible!

1121
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:30,407
I feel bad about molesting his sister
all those times, but it's all right!

1122
01:11:31,249 --> 01:11:35,185
- You really molested a crazy girl?
- No. Got you.

1123
01:11:37,522 --> 01:11:40,923
Congratulations, keed,
you've reached level three.

1124
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,828
I would never have done anything
with that girl.

1125
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,528
Don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained
everything to me, and I get it.

1126
01:11:52,704 --> 01:11:57,767
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting
fact about me being a procrastinator...

1127
01:11:57,943 --> 01:12:01,174
...and I was going to wait
for a Yankee game to do this...

1128
01:12:01,346 --> 01:12:02,540
...but....

1129
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:06,774
I don't know. I.... It's something
I wanted to say to you...

1130
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:10,716
...and I'm having a hard time saying it
for some reason. But....

1131
01:12:13,058 --> 01:12:17,119
It's just that monks, they talk shit...

1132
01:12:17,295 --> 01:12:19,092
...but they can't back it up.

1133
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,769
That's what was so hard
to say to me?

1134
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:34,812
You know, when I was on the phone
with Buddy, he gave me some advice.

1135
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,916
That's great.
His advice is a little cuckoo...

1136
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,051
...but somehow it works.

1137
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:44,382
Well, then I guess I'll just do
what he suggested.

1138
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,029
I don't think that we should
see each other for a while.

1139
01:12:51,897 --> 01:12:56,095
Buddy thinks that a trial separation
will ultimately...

1140
01:12:57,135 --> 01:12:59,330
...strengthen our relationship.

1141
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,471
Now, Fury Fighters...

1142
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:10,877
...what keys do we need to possess
before we can--?

1143
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:12,414
Dave. You're late.

1144
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:15,519
- Can I talk to you alone, please?
- Sure you can--

1145
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:27,527
You told Linda we should have
a trial separation?

1146
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:29,030
- Yes.
- Yes?!

1147
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:30,393
Yes!

1148
01:13:30,669 --> 01:13:34,298
Separating from Linda
is a crucial part of our strategy.

1149
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:36,703
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.

1150
01:13:36,975 --> 01:13:40,138
All right. Strictly as a friend.

1151
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:43,375
Linda's been thinking about
leaving you for some time.

1152
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:47,215
She loves you, but she
recognizes you're a neurotic mess.

1153
01:13:47,486 --> 01:13:48,475
You're jealous...

1154
01:13:48,653 --> 01:13:52,851
...self-Ioathing, resentful, insecure
and a premature ejaculator.

1155
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,455
She told you I was
a premature ejaculator?

1156
01:13:55,627 --> 01:13:56,992
That part I was assuming.

1157
01:13:57,629 --> 01:13:59,927
I haven't done that in,
like, eight months.

1158
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:05,559
Anyway, a trial separation will make
you both gain a deeper appreciation...

1159
01:14:05,804 --> 01:14:07,897
...for David Buznik.

1160
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:12,569
After she dates a couple of losers,
she'll be begging you to take her back.

1161
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:21,852
So I've been thinking about it,
Linda...

1162
01:14:22,154 --> 01:14:26,648
...and a trial separation is exactly
what we need.

1163
01:14:26,858 --> 01:14:29,918
And if you want to start seeing...

1164
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:32,858
...other penises-- People...

1165
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,395
...I want you to feel free.

1166
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:39,570
You sound upset. Are you all right?

1167
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:46,742
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.

1168
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,845
And don't hold back, okay?

1169
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,244
Because there's a lot of nice guys
out there and I'm cool with it.

1170
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:55,009
I'll be strong.

1171
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,484
So the guy asked me for change.
I laughed. He cursed.

1172
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,718
I whizzed on him.

1173
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:06,558
- What else could I do, huh?
- You should've tossed a rock at him.

1174
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:10,029
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

1175
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:12,031
Let him be. Set your anger free.

1176
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:16,439
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. B.

1177
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:18,542
- We all have.
- Hey, fellas.

1178
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:21,203
Could you bring it down a little bit?

1179
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:24,212
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

1180
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:27,146
- This is a free country!
- What's going on with you?!

1181
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:29,580
- Are you crazy?!
- Go in! Just go in.

1182
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:33,591
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!

1183
01:15:33,758 --> 01:15:36,818
Goosfraba.

1184
01:15:37,095 --> 01:15:39,620
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

1185
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:42,129
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.

1186
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,962
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

1187
01:15:45,136 --> 01:15:49,596
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

1188
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:53,242
Those are her keys to my apartment.

1189
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,641
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

1190
01:15:55,981 --> 01:15:58,643
- Why?
- I heard her on her cell phone...

1191
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:00,512
...talking to a guy...

1192
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:04,284
- ...making a date.
- I'm so sorry, Dave.

1193
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,122
Andrew.

1194
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:07,552
I'll kill that guy.

1195
01:16:09,127 --> 01:16:12,460
She ain't cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

1196
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:16,123
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

1197
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:17,690
Sorry.

1198
01:16:17,969 --> 01:16:20,733
She's meeting the Andrew at Mort's
on 86th Street now...

1199
01:16:20,906 --> 01:16:22,168
...if you want to go watch.

1200
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:26,507
No. No, I can't do that.

1201
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:33,139
We're here.

1202
01:16:33,752 --> 01:16:36,915
- Both of you showed up?
- You like Stacy better or something?

1203
01:16:37,088 --> 01:16:41,252
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

1204
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:43,587
...so I really only needed
one of you guys.

1205
01:16:43,828 --> 01:16:45,762
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

1206
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:49,091
- So do you know the guy she's with?
- I think I might.

1207
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:50,564
Let me ask you something.

1208
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:54,933
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

1209
01:16:55,106 --> 01:16:59,440
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

1210
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:02,478
This is where Gina and I
always get into a heated debate.

1211
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:04,478
I like them when they're really big.

1212
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:07,345
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

1213
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:15,825
Good evening.

1214
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:18,121
Table for three?

1215
01:17:18,296 --> 01:17:21,163
- May we take your coats?
- No. We're okay.

1216
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,665
The girls are gonna
take their coats off.

1217
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:25,996
Would you like a boobs--? Booth?

1218
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:33,805
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

1219
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:35,947
- Sure. Right this way.
- Thank you.

1220
01:17:39,684 --> 01:17:42,710
Oh, my God. It's Stacy and Gina.

1221
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:44,286
Who?

1222
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:45,980
Nobody.

1223
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:48,421
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

1224
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,250
Yummy. Yummy.

1225
01:17:51,563 --> 01:17:54,088
- Let's get wasted tonight.
- Definitely.

1226
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:57,428
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.

1227
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:01,537
What?

1228
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,236
I can't believe this.

1229
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,741
Excuse me.

1230
01:18:06,911 --> 01:18:11,575
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

1231
01:18:11,783 --> 01:18:14,217
I guess not. Are those your friends?

1232
01:18:14,386 --> 01:18:18,152
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

1233
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:26,152
Gina, can you stop sucking
on Stacy's finger for one second?

1234
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,492
I want to introduce you to somebody.

1235
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:32,400
- Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
- Nice to meet you.

1236
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,332
And I'd like you to meet my date.

1237
01:18:35,907 --> 01:18:38,671
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.

1238
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,940
- Look, Dave, it's Buddy.
- I see.

1239
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:45,048
- You know Stacy and Gina?
- Yes, yes, I do.

1240
01:18:45,216 --> 01:18:47,946
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury Fighters!

1241
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:52,148
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your Rémy, Linda.

1242
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:54,291
This is a bit awkward.

1243
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:56,017
I mean, group members...

1244
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:58,628
...are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

1245
01:18:58,797 --> 01:19:01,732
- Yeah! I agree with that.
- You know that.

1246
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,994
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

1247
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:08,901
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

1248
01:19:09,074 --> 01:19:10,735
Of course. Excuse me--

1249
01:19:12,243 --> 01:19:13,301
What?

1250
01:19:15,313 --> 01:19:17,747
- Two of the usual, Duke.
- Coming right up, Dr. B.

1251
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:20,783
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

1252
01:19:21,753 --> 01:19:22,913
What are you saying?

1253
01:19:23,088 --> 01:19:25,318
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

1254
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,118
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

1255
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:30,658
My job is trying to prevent
Mr. Andrew...

1256
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:33,764
...from unleashing the Whopper
with Cheese.

1257
01:19:34,265 --> 01:19:36,961
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

1258
01:19:37,135 --> 01:19:39,831
...Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

1259
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:43,597
...trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.

1260
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,642
- How would you know?
- You think I only tapped your phone?

1261
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:48,312
What was she saying?

1262
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:52,279
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

1263
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:55,283
Now the situation is contained.

1264
01:19:55,453 --> 01:19:57,444
You and I control the game.

1265
01:19:57,689 --> 01:19:58,678
How?

1266
01:19:58,857 --> 01:20:02,190
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

1267
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,296
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

1268
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:09,464
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

1269
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:13,297
...then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

1270
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,644
- You swear to me this will work?
- The ball's already up in the air.

1271
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:23,812
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

1272
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:27,474
Very strong. Come on.

1273
01:20:27,652 --> 01:20:30,348
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

1274
01:20:32,991 --> 01:20:35,391
That's 25 dollars, pal.

1275
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:37,322
We don't....

1276
01:21:11,429 --> 01:21:13,260
Where were you? It's 1:00.

1277
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:17,628
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

1278
01:21:17,802 --> 01:21:19,929
- Better be good. Give it to me.
- Okay.

1279
01:21:20,104 --> 01:21:23,164
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus--

1280
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:25,901
The bus? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

1281
01:21:26,077 --> 01:21:27,704
I was way too smashed to drive.

1282
01:21:27,879 --> 01:21:33,112
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

1283
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:35,675
Okay. I like that.

1284
01:21:35,853 --> 01:21:38,014
So we get to her house...

1285
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:41,519
...we have some kind of a weird
argument...

1286
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:45,026
...about the number of syllables
in a haiku.

1287
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:46,561
Poetry garbage.

1288
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:50,130
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

1289
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:54,002
Now, you say you kissed?

1290
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:56,867
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

1291
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,531
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1292
01:21:58,776 --> 01:22:01,267
You're having this horrible evening.

1293
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:04,882
- How do you end up kissing, again?
- I wish I knew, keed.

1294
01:22:05,049 --> 01:22:07,643
We were both pretty geezed up.

1295
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:11,719
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

1296
01:22:11,956 --> 01:22:14,288
...and then just a quick
10-second kiss.

1297
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:16,927
I thought that you said five seconds.

1298
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:18,756
First it was a five-second one...

1299
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,297
...and then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

1300
01:22:22,634 --> 01:22:25,432
She's cute.
And then a 10-second Frencher.

1301
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:30,803
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

1302
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:35,343
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

1303
01:22:35,647 --> 01:22:38,377
Dr. B, let it bip.

1304
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:41,143
Well, hello.

1305
01:22:43,054 --> 01:22:45,318
I shouldn't really talk right now.

1306
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,652
Well, I suppose you're right.

1307
01:22:50,061 --> 01:22:51,892
It's got to be done.

1308
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:54,726
Who was that? Linda?

1309
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:02,999
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

1310
01:23:03,174 --> 01:23:05,005
First, the good news.

1311
01:23:05,176 --> 01:23:07,838
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

1312
01:23:08,012 --> 01:23:10,242
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

1313
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,908
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

1314
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:16,519
Pretty hard too.

1315
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:19,914
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

1316
01:23:20,091 --> 01:23:21,922
I didn't intend for this to happen.

1317
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:24,857
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just--

1318
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:26,587
Wait a minute.

1319
01:23:30,702 --> 01:23:32,636
I figured this out.

1320
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,043
You're messing with me.

1321
01:23:41,746 --> 01:23:43,441
I wish I were, Dave.

1322
01:23:43,948 --> 01:23:48,783
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

1323
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:53,890
...because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

1324
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:57,292
Is it all right if I date your ex?

1325
01:24:01,733 --> 01:24:03,291
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

1326
01:24:03,468 --> 01:24:06,130
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

1327
01:24:06,304 --> 01:24:09,705
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

1328
01:24:09,874 --> 01:24:13,833
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks
from today for attempted murder.

1329
01:24:14,011 --> 01:24:17,777
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

1330
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:21,282
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

1331
01:24:21,452 --> 01:24:23,818
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

1332
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:25,717
Court is adjourned.

1333
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:46,471
Coming, Peaches.

1334
01:24:55,086 --> 01:24:56,781
Are you kidding me?

1335
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,586
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog
for my Fat Cat clothing line?

1336
01:25:05,763 --> 01:25:07,230
I said I'd have it by 3.

1337
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:11,063
- Okay.
- Get in gear.

1338
01:25:14,705 --> 01:25:16,138
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1339
01:25:16,307 --> 01:25:18,969
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

1340
01:25:19,143 --> 01:25:22,237
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

1341
01:25:22,513 --> 01:25:23,946
Don't worry about him.

1342
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:27,016
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

1343
01:25:34,459 --> 01:25:35,483
It's good stuff.

1344
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,228
That's a good picture, I think.

1345
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:41,395
What the hell is this?!

1346
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:44,626
You keep telling everybody you
created the Husky Cat line.

1347
01:25:44,869 --> 01:25:47,303
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

1348
01:25:47,472 --> 01:25:49,770
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

1349
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:52,569
If friends come over, I want them
to feel comfortable.

1350
01:25:52,743 --> 01:25:53,801
What office?

1351
01:25:53,978 --> 01:25:58,347
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

1352
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:03,220
- You gave him the job that I wanted?
- He earned it.

1353
01:26:03,387 --> 01:26:05,855
Why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

1354
01:26:06,123 --> 01:26:08,887
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

1355
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,551
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.

1356
01:26:11,729 --> 01:26:13,128
I wouldn't worry about me.

1357
01:26:13,297 --> 01:26:16,494
It's your pal Buddy who's taking her
to the Yankee game tonight.

1358
01:26:17,268 --> 01:26:18,701
Yankee game.

1359
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:22,132
Did he steal my proposal idea?

1360
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:25,435
Buznik, your behavior
is unacceptable.

1361
01:26:26,644 --> 01:26:28,475
Unacceptable?

1362
01:26:29,146 --> 01:26:34,140
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

1363
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:36,445
When a good position
actually opens up...

1364
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:39,087
...you give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

1365
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:43,193
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

1366
01:26:44,562 --> 01:26:47,224
Now, when I started here...

1367
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:50,400
...I was promised advancement
opportunities.

1368
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:53,729
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

1369
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:58,634
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

1370
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:03,108
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

1371
01:27:03,281 --> 01:27:08,048
...I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

1372
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:11,017
- Okay.
- Great.

1373
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:13,349
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.

1374
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:19,554
By the way, his name is not
Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...

1375
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:22,392
...and he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

1376
01:27:28,339 --> 01:27:32,241
- You starting to get excited?
- Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

1377
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,071
This is going to be some night.

1378
01:27:36,914 --> 01:27:38,643
Come on. Come on.

1379
01:27:48,492 --> 01:27:51,689
- Dr. B, how's it going?
- Very well, thank you.

1380
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:54,356
Always a thrill. Right this way.

1381
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:59,662
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

1382
01:28:00,972 --> 01:28:02,064
Whoa! Watch it, man!

1383
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:02,406
Your attention, please.

1384
01:28:02,406 --> 01:28:03,839
Your attention, please.

1385
01:28:04,008 --> 01:28:05,839
Before tonight's National Anthem...

1386
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:09,070
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert
Merrill...

1387
01:28:09,246 --> 01:28:14,013
...will present a special moment
for two special people.

1388
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:16,242
I love when they do this.

1389
01:28:17,254 --> 01:28:20,951
- Good.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.

1390
01:28:36,007 --> 01:28:37,998
Linda?! Linda!

1391
01:28:56,193 --> 01:28:59,094
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1392
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:01,521
Wait, don't I know you?

1393
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:03,633
- Come on.
- Where's your German accent?

1394
01:29:08,372 --> 01:29:10,237
You have me confused
with somebody--

1395
01:29:10,408 --> 01:29:13,070
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.

1396
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:15,872
- There's no fans allowed on that field.
- Galaxia.

1397
01:29:16,947 --> 01:29:17,936
It's Gary.

1398
01:29:18,115 --> 01:29:21,778
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

1399
01:29:23,287 --> 01:29:26,381
- Hebrew Melvin's in love.
- Very much.

1400
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,051
I can't stop love.

1401
01:29:30,294 --> 01:29:32,057
- Go.
- Thank you.

1402
01:29:33,564 --> 01:29:36,829
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks by the way.

1403
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:41,769
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to Yankee Stadium.

1404
01:29:44,008 --> 01:29:46,340
Oh, my God, it's Dave.

1405
01:29:46,844 --> 01:29:48,641
What the heck are you doing here?

1406
01:29:48,879 --> 01:29:51,313
- I wanna borrow this for a second.
- That's my mike!

1407
01:29:51,482 --> 01:29:52,972
Linda? Where are you?

1408
01:29:53,684 --> 01:29:54,981
Don't move.

1409
01:29:55,419 --> 01:29:57,910
Linda? Are you out there, honey?

1410
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,515
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

1411
01:30:04,762 --> 01:30:05,922
Oh, shit.

1412
01:30:08,499 --> 01:30:10,524
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

1413
01:30:12,737 --> 01:30:14,671
Davey's going crazy!

1414
01:30:14,839 --> 01:30:17,603
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

1415
01:30:17,775 --> 01:30:19,868
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

1416
01:30:20,044 --> 01:30:21,443
How was that supposed to work?

1417
01:30:21,946 --> 01:30:24,346
I guess I never really
thought it through.

1418
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,514
I gotta tell you something personal!

1419
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,279
This kid lost his marbles.

1420
01:30:33,257 --> 01:30:34,747
I'm over here!

1421
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:39,694
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

1422
01:30:42,266 --> 01:30:43,858
Sweet tackle. Wow!

1423
01:30:44,034 --> 01:30:45,968
Dave just got leveled!

1424
01:30:47,037 --> 01:30:50,632
- Nobody messes with my microphone.
- I'm sorry.

1425
01:30:50,908 --> 01:30:52,239
Bob?

1426
01:30:53,377 --> 01:30:55,641
- Everything all right, Buddy?
- Oh, yeah.

1427
01:30:55,813 --> 01:30:57,576
I've never seen you so excited.

1428
01:30:57,748 --> 01:31:00,512
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

1429
01:31:00,684 --> 01:31:02,208
...to the woman he loves.

1430
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:05,219
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

1431
01:31:05,389 --> 01:31:09,223
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

1432
01:31:09,393 --> 01:31:11,554
I won't let you do this to us!

1433
01:31:12,997 --> 01:31:14,862
Don't marry him!

1434
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,666
Don't marry him!

1435
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:19,799
Wait!

1436
01:31:20,638 --> 01:31:23,266
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

1437
01:31:24,175 --> 01:31:25,403
Let the man back in.

1438
01:31:25,576 --> 01:31:28,841
- Who was that guy?
- I think it's Regis Philbin.

1439
01:31:31,382 --> 01:31:34,545
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

1440
01:31:36,353 --> 01:31:39,288
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

1441
01:31:39,456 --> 01:31:41,947
Chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.

1442
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:43,491
Goosfraba.

1443
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:46,229
Goosfraba.

1444
01:31:49,066 --> 01:31:52,900
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

1445
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,761
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

1446
01:31:56,273 --> 01:31:58,605
But he was right about one thing.

1447
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,901
I was an angry guy.

1448
01:32:02,446 --> 01:32:04,607
Mainly angry at myself...

1449
01:32:04,782 --> 01:32:07,842
...for letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

1450
01:32:08,285 --> 01:32:10,776
But I don't want to be that angry guy
anymore.

1451
01:32:10,955 --> 01:32:12,354
I wanna change.

1452
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:14,021
If you give me a chance...

1453
01:32:14,191 --> 01:32:18,025
...I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

1454
01:32:18,195 --> 01:32:19,787
And I believe in us, Linda.

1455
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:24,228
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

1456
01:32:25,102 --> 01:32:26,763
I should be your husband...

1457
01:32:27,338 --> 01:32:29,101
...not that weirdo.

1458
01:32:30,574 --> 01:32:35,409
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

1459
01:32:35,579 --> 01:32:38,412
Kids who have your eyes...

1460
01:32:38,582 --> 01:32:39,981
...and your lips...

1461
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:41,915
...and my...

1462
01:32:42,653 --> 01:32:44,780
...last name.
That's all I wish on them.

1463
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:49,391
Please marry me, Linda.

1464
01:32:55,165 --> 01:32:58,601
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

1465
01:33:02,306 --> 01:33:05,469
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

1466
01:33:11,448 --> 01:33:13,348
You can do it, David!

1467
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:17,514
Give her a five-second Frencher!

1468
01:33:21,425 --> 01:33:23,689
Kiss her, David.

1469
01:33:24,595 --> 01:33:26,290
Kiss her, David.

1470
01:33:28,198 --> 01:33:30,029
Kiss her, David!

1471
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:33,094
Kiss her, David.

1472
01:33:40,678 --> 01:33:42,737
Go Yankees!

1473
01:34:00,097 --> 01:34:02,292
Dave's a dirty boy.

1474
01:34:04,468 --> 01:34:06,060
That wasn't so bad, was it?

1475
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:10,939
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

1476
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:13,474
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

1477
01:34:18,882 --> 01:34:22,079
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

1478
01:34:44,775 --> 01:34:47,335
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

1479
01:34:47,511 --> 01:34:49,035
Don't change the subject.

1480
01:34:49,213 --> 01:34:54,082
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

1481
01:34:54,284 --> 01:34:55,512
Well....

1482
01:34:55,919 --> 01:34:56,908
Yeah.

1483
01:34:57,254 --> 01:34:59,381
I met with Buddy
after reading his book...

1484
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:02,923
...and I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

1485
01:35:03,127 --> 01:35:08,087
...and how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

1486
01:35:09,767 --> 01:35:13,032
He said that he thought he could help,
but it would be tough.

1487
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:15,261
So how much of this thing was a
setup?

1488
01:35:15,506 --> 01:35:19,806
Well, the guy in your seat on the
plane, the flight attendant, the judge...

1489
01:35:19,977 --> 01:35:21,968
...they're all friends of Buddy's.

1490
01:35:22,146 --> 01:35:25,513
What about the air marshal
who tasered me? Was he in on it?

1491
01:35:25,682 --> 01:35:27,513
No, he was just having a bad day.

1492
01:35:27,684 --> 01:35:30,278
Son of a bitch.

1493
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:44,229
Skipper, how you doing?

1494
01:35:46,236 --> 01:35:49,296
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.

1495
01:35:49,573 --> 01:35:52,940
I was just doing my job.
I never doubted you for a minute.

1496
01:35:53,277 --> 01:35:55,643
Except when Galaxia
had ahold of you.

1497
01:35:57,548 --> 01:35:59,880
Did you just call that guy
Buddy Rydell?

1498
01:36:01,285 --> 01:36:04,118
A guy named Buddy Rydell
left this card...

1499
01:36:04,288 --> 01:36:05,915
...on what's left of my Lexus!

1500
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:08,684
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.

1501
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:10,793
Your insurance was canceled!

1502
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,961
Grenada!

1503
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:19,166
Don't point that gun at Buddy.
I'm the one who smashed your car up.

1504
01:36:19,336 --> 01:36:20,462
- Dave?!
- No!

1505
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:22,263
I'm sick of guys like this.

1506
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:24,771
You wanna mess with my friends,
shoot me first.

1507
01:36:24,942 --> 01:36:26,170
- Don't!
- Are you crazy?

1508
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:27,670
Settle down.

1509
01:36:27,845 --> 01:36:30,507
Butt out! Tough guy's
going to learn a lesson.

1510
01:36:31,849 --> 01:36:35,216
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me
not to be afraid of anybody.

1511
01:36:37,688 --> 01:36:39,849
Can I ask you a question, though?

1512
01:36:48,565 --> 01:36:50,192
Got you!

1513
01:36:54,204 --> 01:36:57,196
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!

1514
01:36:57,407 --> 01:36:59,739
And how does that
make you feel, Lou?

1515
01:37:11,889 --> 01:37:13,754
Chuck.

1516
01:37:13,924 --> 01:37:16,392
We were just doing a joke.
That's my friend.

1517
01:37:16,593 --> 01:37:17,992
Are you okay?

1518
01:37:21,865 --> 01:37:24,333
He feels stunning.
