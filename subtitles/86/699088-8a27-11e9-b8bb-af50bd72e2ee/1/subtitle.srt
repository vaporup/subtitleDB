1
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,564
Mildred.

2
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,843
What's on your mind, lady?

3
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:31,555
You know what l think? l think maybe
you had an idea you'd take a swim.

4
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:32,883
Leave me alone.

5
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:36,926
lf you take a swim, l'd have
to take a swim. ls that fair?

6
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:40,360
Because you feel like killing yourself,
l gotta get pneumonia.

7
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:44,832
Never thought about that, did you?
Okay. Think about it.

8
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:46,664
Go on, beat it now.

9
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:50,035
Go on home before we both take a swim.

10
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,408
Mildred. What are you doing
around this pigeon perch? Slumming?

11
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,545
- What?
- You sick or something?

12
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,575
No. l don't think so.

13
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:35,709
lf you're feeling weak, why not come
have a drink on the house? For free.

14
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,252
Come on.

15
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,158
Buying this joint was
the smartest move l ever made.

16
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,993
- Give us a couple drinks, will you, Tony?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,871
l hope you're not sore at me about
this afternoon. Strictly business, see?

18
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:07,075
lt might just as well have been you
selling me out. You can't expect--

19
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,681
What are you looking
at me like that for?

20
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,984
You can talk your way out of anything.
You're good at that.

21
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,992
ln my business you have to be.

22
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:22,197
Only now, l'd rather talk myself into
something. Do you know what l mean?

23
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,164
- Still trying?
- lt's a habit.

24
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:27,737
- l've tried once a week since we were kids.
- Twice a week.

25
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:31,398
Twice.
Anyhow, l'm still drawing blanks.

26
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,306
You never used to drink it
straight like that.

27
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,472
l've learned how these last few months.
l've learned a lot of things.

28
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,916
- Like, for instance?
- Like, for instance, that's rotten liquor.

29
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:46,421
There's better stuff to drink
at the beach house, Wally.

30
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,617
- ls that a dare?
- Could be.

31
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:55,657
All right. l'll take it.

32
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,927
You know l like good stuff.

33
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:01,766
- Maybe this is my lucky day.
- Maybe.

34
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:16,048
- Come in.
- How about your husband?

35
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,055
ls he getting broad-minded
all of a sudden?

36
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:27,992
Monte isn't here. Besides, you can talk
your way out of anything, can't you?

37
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,895
l get by all right.

38
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:32,832
- You keep saying that.
- Do l?

39
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:41,138
- Nervous, Wally?
- No, l'm cold. Temporarily.

40
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,951
- lsn't this more comfortable?
- Yeah, l guess so, but....

41
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,212
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

42
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,482
- You don't seem very happy here.
- l'm happy. Believe me.

43
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,523
lnside, my heart is singing.

44
00:06:55,694 --> 00:07:00,757
- That's pretty corny, Wally.
- Well, l'm a corny guy, but smart too.

45
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:06,232
- l wonder about things.
- What things?

46
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,430
For instance, l wonder why
you brought me here tonight.

47
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:14,635
All of a sudden, husband gone,
soft lights, quiet room, opportunity.

48
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:19,477
- Why?
- Maybe l find you irresistible, Wally.

49
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,085
You make me shiver, Mildred.
You always have.

50
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,813
You make love so nicely.
You always have.

51
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:30,654
All my life when l've wanted something,
l've gone after it. l get it too.

52
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,491
lt may take me a little time,
but l get what l want.

53
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:39,297
- Do you? lt must be nice.
- Yeah. lt is.

54
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,032
- l'm sorry.
- Hey, what's the score?

55
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,542
l feel sticky.
l think l'd better change my dress.

56
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:50,806
Yeah, sure, Mildred.
lt's a good idea.

57
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,109
l'll only be a minute.

58
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:59,921
- Leave the door open so we can talk.
- l like to hear you talk.

59
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:05,095
So do l. Something about the sound
of my own voice fascinates me.

60
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:09,029
l'm glad you're not sore about me
taking you over the hurdles.

61
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,570
l didn't mean to cut up your business.
l just got started and couldn't stop.

62
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:19,233
l see an angle, l start cutting myself
a piece of throat. lt's an instinct.

63
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:23,511
With me, being smart's a disease.
Know what l mean?

64
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,148
Hey, Mildred!

65
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,586
Hurry up!
You know l don't like to drink alone.

66
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,995
Say something. This one-sided
conversation is beginning to bore me.

67
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,369
Mildred.

68
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,207
Mildred.

69
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,083
Come on. Don't play any games.

70
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:05,712
l'm a nice guy up to a certain point,
but don't get me sore. Mildred.

71
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,367
What's the matter?

72
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,338
What kind of business is this, anyway?

73
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,601
Hit that house with the light.

74
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,273
Stop, you!

75
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:08,644
Okay, okay.

76
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:15,682
What's the hurry, pal?

77
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,420
- No gun.
- Better take a look in that house.

78
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,321
This guy came through that window
like he was shot out of a cannon.

79
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,088
- Get that from the window?
- l cut myself shaving.

80
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,789
Get going, smart guy.
You need some fixing.

81
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,731
Oh, brother.
l'm so smart, it's a disease.

82
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,962
All right, go ahead.

83
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,543
What were you doing in there, pal?
Picking up souvenirs?

84
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:43,613
No, pal. Nothing petty.
This is a pretty big night for you.

85
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,875
Lots of excitement.
There's a stiff in there.

86
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,484
ls that so?

87
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:52,589
And l suppose you were running
right to the station to report it?

88
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:55,351
He says there's a dead guy
in the house.

89
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:58,984
- You never saw deader.
- Better call headquarters.

90
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:04,301
Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.

91
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,097
Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.

92
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:31,325
Mother, where have you been?
They won't tell me anything.

93
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:34,761
- Who won't tell you? Who's ''they''?
- These men.

94
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,869
Mrs. Beragon? We're from headquarters.

95
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,530
The inspector would like you
to have a little talk with him.

96
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,733
- Why? What's the matter?
- l'm sorry.

97
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,812
We only ask the questions. Besides,
we don't know what the trouble is.

98
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:54,418
- lt's probably just something about the car.
- At this time of night?

99
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:01,258
Whatever it is, l'll take care of it.
Don't think about it. Now, go to bed.

100
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:04,054
- Mother.
- Please, go on.

101
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:10,999
- Can't you tell me what's happened?
- We'd better go.

102
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,804
- What's the matter?
- l didn't want your daughter to hear.

103
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,743
lt's your husband. He's been murdered.

104
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,942
Murdered?

105
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:08,818
- Hi, Joe, what'd you get?
- This is Mrs. Pierce. l mean, Beragon.

106
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,359
Which? Pierce or Beragon?
Make up your mind.

107
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,465
- Mildred Pierce Beragon.
- Okay. Wheel her in.

108
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,899
Right over there, please.

109
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:23,638
Mrs. Beragon just came in.

110
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,368
Sit down. He'll be right with you.

111
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,819
Look. l bruise easy.

112
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,479
- lda, what are you--?
- No talking.

113
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,159
lda Corwin.

114
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:54,771
- Well, what is this, a class reunion?
- Looks like it.

115
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,436
lt'll be tough talking
my way out of this.

116
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,908
- Keep moving.
- All right, all right.

117
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,051
Hi, Ed.

118
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:15,749
- Charley, what's the good word?
- My feet hurt.

119
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:19,519
l'm crying. How about a nice,
juicy item for the morning edition?

120
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:22,257
- Nope. Not today.
- What's she in for?

121
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,561
Parking gum under her seat
in a movie. Satisfied?

122
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:28,330
Okay, Charley. Okay.

123
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:38,309
- l'm sorry. l just couldn't help it.
- No talking.

124
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,685
Take a seat.

125
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,289
You know that guy?

126
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,252
Yes. We were married once.

127
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,702
Paper, lady?

128
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,871
No, thank you.

129
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,561
Okay.

130
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:36,564
He wants you now.
Now you can talk.

131
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,580
lnspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.

132
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:50,687
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

133
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,584
Won't you sit down?

134
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:57,490
Sorry about your husband.
lt must be a shock to you.

135
00:16:58,162 --> 00:16:59,823
Well, l....

136
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:05,063
l'm afraid l don't quite know
how to begin.

137
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,402
You see, the fact of the matter is,
Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.

138
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,837
You don't need me?

139
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,673
l don't know how to apologize for
bringing you down here for nothing.

140
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,305
But, you understand, we had to be sure.
Well, now we are sure.

141
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:23,578
Aren't you going to ask me questions?
l thought you would.

142
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:28,453
l know. Everybody thinks detectives
do nothing but ask questions...

143
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:32,562
...but detectives have souls,
the same as anyone else.

144
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,858
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

145
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,467
Go ahead. lt's all right.

146
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:43,763
Mrs. Beragon, being a detective is like,
well, like making an automobile.

147
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,910
You take all the pieces
and put them together one by one.

148
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:50,946
First thing you know, you got
an automobile. Or a murderer.

149
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,104
And we got him.

150
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,684
You're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.
The case is on ice.

151
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,684
Well, you can go now.

152
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,720
All right, men.

153
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,720
Could you--?

154
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,890
- Would you tell me who---?
- Who did it?

155
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:09,589
Sure. You're entitled to know.

156
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:21,771
No.

157
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,436
No!

158
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,878
Yes, he did it.

159
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:34,354
- Your first husband. Pierce.
- No, Bert, l won't let you do this.

160
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,993
And Wally Fay?
How do you know he didn't do it?

161
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,652
Fay had no motive. This man had.

162
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,764
You see, we start out with nothing.

163
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:45,163
Just a corpse,
if you'll pardon the expression.

164
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,601
We look at the corpse and we say,
''Why? What was the reason?''

165
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:53,107
And when we find the reason,
we find the man that made the corpse.

166
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,871
ln this case, him.

167
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:58,273
Come on.

168
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:07,821
- But he didn't do it. l know he didn't.
- Do you?

169
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:11,091
The murder was committed with this.

170
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:14,595
- Do you know who it belongs to?
- No. l don't know.

171
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:18,201
We do. lt belongs to Pierce.
That's fact number one.

172
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:21,099
Fact number two:
He doesn't deny killing Beragon.

173
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:23,331
He seems to think it was a good idea.

174
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,202
lf there's one thing we know...

175
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:31,008
...it's that an innocent man always
denies the crime, loud and often.

176
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,116
Pierce doesn't.

177
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:37,042
So do you blame us for feeling
fairly confident that he's the man...

178
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,712
...who put four shots
out of six into Beragon?

179
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,654
But he didn't. He couldn't.
He's too gentle and kind.

180
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:45,091
Okay. He's kind and gentle.
He's wonderful.

181
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:49,028
But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,
why did you divorce him?

182
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,331
Because l was wrong.

183
00:19:56,741 --> 00:20:01,041
lt's taken me four years to find
that out, but now l know l was wrong.

184
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:05,171
Let's see. Four years ago he was
in the real-estate business, wasn't he?

185
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:09,945
Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.
For a long time they made good money.

186
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:14,080
They built a lot of houses.
Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.

187
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,987
- The boom was over.
- Yes?

188
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,119
Then one day they split up.
Wally was in and Bert was out.

189
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,527
<i>They weren't partners anymore.</i>

190
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,033
<i>That day when Bert came home,</i>
<i>he was out of a job.</i>

191
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:29,138
- Here's the mail for you, Mr. Pierce.
- Thanks, Jack.

192
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:32,639
- Have you got a change-of-address card?
- Why, yes.

193
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:34,476
Thank you.

194
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:40,313
<i>We lived on Corvalis Street</i>
<i>where all the houses looked alike.</i>

195
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,952
<i>Ours was number 1 1 43.</i>

196
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,984
<i>I was always in the kitchen.</i>

197
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:48,455
<i>I felt as though I'd lived</i>
<i>in a kitchen all my life...</i>

198
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,789
...<i>except for the few hours</i>
<i>it took to get married.</i>

199
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:54,658
- That you, Bert?
- Yeah. Who else?

200
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:59,030
- l thought it might be Mrs. Whitley.
- Well, it isn't.

201
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:02,866
<i>I married Bert when I was 1 7.</i>
<i>I never knew any other kind of life.</i>

202
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,440
<i>Just cooking and washing</i>
<i>and having children.</i>

203
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>Two girls, Veda and Kay.</i>

204
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,587
l pressed your pants. You might want
to see McLary about that sales job.

205
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:22,783
lt'd be nice if you left me alone once.
When the time comes, l'll get a job.

206
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,088
l know you will, Bert.
l was just trying to help.

207
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:33,332
Good afternoon.
Package from E. Langlin.

208
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,704
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

209
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:42,345
- What's that?
- A dress.

210
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,605
For Veda?

211
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:46,045
l thought so.
Where'd you get the money?

212
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,050
Making cakes and pies
for the neighbors. l earned it.

213
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,417
Right, throw it up to me that
l can't support my own family.

214
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,118
l don't say half as much as most women
would say with nothing but bills to pay.

215
00:21:57,294 --> 00:22:02,357
There'd be less bills if you didn't
raise the kids like l was a millionaire.

216
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,468
No wonder they're so fresh
and stuck up. That Veda.

217
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:10,096
l'm so fed up with her high-hatting me,
one of these days l'll slap her face.

218
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:13,175
Bert, if you ever dare
touch Veda, l'll--

219
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,781
All right. All right.

220
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,942
You're trying to buy love from them,
and it won't work.

221
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,180
l make enough to get by,
but no, that isn't good enough.

222
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:28,655
Veda needs a piano, lessons
and fancy dresses...

223
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:32,887
...so she can smirk her way through
a piece a talented 5-year-old could play.

224
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:36,191
Veda has talent.
Just ask any of the neighbors.

225
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,426
She plays the piano like l shoot pool.

226
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:42,800
And Kay, a nice, normal kid who wants
to skip rope and play baseball.

227
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:47,342
But she has ballet lessons. She has to
be a ballerina so you can feel proud.

228
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:48,978
All right. What of it?

229
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,671
What if l do want them
to amount to something?

230
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:54,875
l'd do anything for those kids,
understand? Anything.

231
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:57,850
- You can't do their crying for them.
- l'll do that too.

232
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:01,321
- They'll never cry if l can help it.
- There's something wrong.

233
00:23:01,492 --> 00:23:06,520
l don't know what. l'm not smart
that way. But l know it isn't right to--

234
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,102
- Hello?
- <i>I just wanted to know if</i>--

235
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,796
Yes? Yes, he is.

236
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:18,533
- Who's calling?
- <i>Mrs. Biederhof.</i>

237
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,768
Just a moment.

238
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:24,347
lt's for you. Mrs. Biederhof.

239
00:23:25,749 --> 00:23:28,081
Maggie, l can't talk now.
l told you not to--

240
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:31,779
- <i>I tried to call you at the office.</i>
- l can't talk to you now. Later.

241
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:34,321
So the noble Mr. Pierce
can't talk right now.

242
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:38,655
You're busy saying what's wrong with
our marriage is how l treat the kids.

243
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,093
Maggie means nothing to me.
You know that.

244
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,732
l wish l could believe it.

245
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,597
You'd better apologize, or she won't
play gin rummy with you anymore.

246
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,330
- lt is gin rummy, isn't it?
- Now, don't go too far.

247
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:53,135
- One day, l'll call your bluff.
- You're not calling me. l'm calling you.

248
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,244
You might as well get this straight.

249
00:23:55,412 --> 00:23:59,610
Those kids come first in this house.
Before either one of us.

250
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:03,651
Maybe that's right and maybe
it's wrong. But that's the way it is.

251
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:08,281
l'll do the best l can for them. lf l
can't do it with you, l'll do it alone.

252
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:11,451
You're looking for an excuse
to heave me out on my ear.

253
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:13,061
- l didn't say--
- l'm fed up.

254
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,791
Get along without me. When you
want me, you know where to find me.

255
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,457
Bert.

256
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:22,331
You go to that woman's house,
you're never coming back here.

257
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,736
l go where l want to go.

258
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:27,867
Then pack up, Bert.

259
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,945
All right, l will.

260
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:37,251
- Kids haven't come home yet, huh?
- No, not yet.

261
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:42,654
l don't want you to tell them l said
goodbye or anything like that.

262
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:45,522
- You can just say--
- l know. l'll take care of it.

263
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:48,722
Okay, then l'll leave it to you.

264
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,266
Goodbye, Mildred.

265
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:58,402
Go on, Bert. There's nothing
more to say. Just go on.

266
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,375
One, two, three, hike!

267
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,144
Pass it, pass it!

268
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,311
- Come on!
- Pass it!

269
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:17,989
- Kay, for goodness' sake!
- What's eating you?

270
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,995
- You're coming home with me.
- l ain't done nothing.

271
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:24,862
- You never let anybody have fun.
- Look at your clothes.

272
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:28,436
Honest, Kay, you ought to take
more pride in the way you look.

273
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:31,768
- You act like a peasant.
- Pretzels, what do l care?

274
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:35,708
You'll care someday, Miss Smarty!
Wait till you get interested in boys.

275
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,643
l got over that when l was 8.

276
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:04,766
- All right, l'll try. Hello, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

277
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,001
- Good afternoon, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

278
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:10,146
- Who's the cake for?
- Eddie Whitley. lt's his birthday.

279
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,906
That goon.

280
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:14,710
- How was your lesson?
- l'm learning a new piece.

281
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:16,614
- Are you?
- ''Valse Brilliante.''

282
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:21,190
- That means ''brilliant waltz.''
- Does it really?

283
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,986
l saw Father go out.

284
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:28,461
Did you? Why don't you play your
new piece for me? l'd love to hear it.

285
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:29,826
All right.

286
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,262
When do we eat?

287
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:34,199
Now you stop that
or you'll spoil your dinner.

288
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:37,898
- Look at your clothes.
- l know. l should have been a boy.

289
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:41,567
Come on, bring me those dishes
off the sink, will you, darling?

290
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:49,583
- Father had a suitcase with him.
- Did he? That's a lovely piece, Veda.

291
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:52,187
- Where was he going?
- l don't know.

292
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:55,655
- How long will he be gone?
- That's hard to say.

293
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:57,293
Don't stop playing, darling.

294
00:26:57,461 --> 00:27:01,329
ls he coming back?
Has he gone for good?

295
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,702
Look, you might as well know it now.

296
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:10,101
Your father and l
have decided to separate.

297
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:12,936
You mean, Dad's not
coming home anymore?

298
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,513
- Doesn't he like us?
- lt has nothing to do with you, honey.

299
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:21,378
lt just couldn't be helped. We'll have
to get along by ourselves now.

300
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,350
What did you and Father quarrel about?

301
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:27,554
l can't tell you now.
Someday l will, but not now.

302
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:31,490
lf you mean Mrs. Biederhof,
l must say my sympathy is all with you.

303
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:35,598
- She's distinctly middle class.
- Please, Veda. lt wasn't Mrs. Biederhof.

304
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:39,725
- lt was little things. Mostly about your dress.
- My dress?

305
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:42,371
- lt came?
- Yes, it's upstairs in your room.

306
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,975
- Come on.
- Okay.

307
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:50,046
You ought to do something
about your sit-down.

308
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:52,682
- What's wrong with it?
- Sticks out.

309
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,343
lt's the dress. lt's awful cheap
material. l can tell by the smell.

310
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:59,955
What do you expect,
want it inlaid with gold?

311
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:03,320
lt seems to me if you're buying
anything, it should be the best.

312
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:07,862
- This is definitely not the best.
- Quit. You're breaking my heart.

313
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,794
lt's impossible.

314
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:12,936
Look at it. Ruffles.

315
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,766
l wouldn't be seen dead
in this rag. lt's horrible.

316
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,034
How could she have bought me
such a thing?

317
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:27,814
<i>It didn't take me long that night</i>
<i>to figure out that I was dead broke.</i>

318
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:31,580
<i>And with Bert gone,</i>
<i>it looked as though I'd stay broke.</i>

319
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:35,782
<i>I felt all alone. For the first time</i>
<i>in my life, I was lonely.</i>

320
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:40,828
<i>There was so much to remind me of Bert.</i>
<i>How things used to be with us.</i>

321
00:28:40,998 --> 00:28:43,762
<i>And what great hopes we had.</i>

322
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,685
- Hi, Mildred!
- Hello, Wally.

323
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:05,083
- Bert around?
- Not right now, he isn't.

324
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:09,157
He left things a mess at the office.
l thought he could straighten them out.

325
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:13,228
- Ask him to drop over, will you?
- lf it's important, find him yourself.

326
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:15,695
He isn't living here anymore.

327
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,798
- You mean you've busted up?
- Something like that.

328
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,462
- For good?
- As far as l know.

329
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,676
lf you don't know,
l don't know who does know.

330
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,671
- You here all alone?
- No, l have the children.

331
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:32,474
Bert must be crazy.

332
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:36,312
You know, l never did mind
being around you, Mildred.

333
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,818
You don't hear opportunity knocking,
do you?

334
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:42,254
Me? l'm conscientious.

335
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:46,419
Not too much ice in that drink
you're about to make for me.

336
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:47,995
- You're moving in?
- Maybe.

337
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,333
l won't cry my eyes out
about you and Bert splitting up.

338
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:55,062
l like the idea.
lt makes me feel good.

339
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:57,930
l wish it made me feel good too.

340
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:02,305
- l like Scotch.
- l know what you like.

341
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,946
With soda.

342
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:07,111
l've always been soft in the head
where you're concerned.

343
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:09,275
- You surprise me.
- This is on the level.

344
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:12,752
Bert's gone. Okay. l figure maybe
there's a chance for me now.

345
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:15,391
l wouldn't drop dead
at the idea of marrying you.

346
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,719
Quit kidding, will you?

347
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:19,726
l figured maybe one day
you might have a weak moment.

348
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,694
lf l do, l'll send you
a telegram, collect.

349
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:27,460
Easy on the ice for this, will you?
No soda?

350
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:31,266
- Sorry. Bert never had it around.
- We'll take care of that.

351
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:34,342
- Say when.
- Not for me. l'm not used to it.

352
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,502
We'll take care of that too.

353
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,013
- You're sure of yourself, aren't you?
- You gotta be educated.

354
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,310
You just joined
the world's biggest army.

355
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:45,978
The great American institution
never mentioned on the 4th of July.

356
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:48,716
A grass widow
with two children to support.

357
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:54,890
- Why don't you make an effort to grow up?
- You make an effort to forget Bert.

358
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:57,533
- Maybe l don't want to.
- But you'll be lonesome.

359
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,397
- You can't get along by yourself.
- Well, l can try.

360
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,664
- Come on, get wise.
- Wally, you should be kept on a leash.

361
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,400
- Why can't you be friendly?
- l am being friendly.

362
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:09,238
l mean it. Friendship's much more
lasting than love.

363
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:12,007
Yeah, but it isn't as entertaining.

364
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:15,151
Cut it out. You make me feel
like Little Red Riding Hood.

365
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:16,751
And l'm the Big Bad Wolf?

366
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,287
You got me wrong.
l'm a romantic guy, but l'm no wolf.

367
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:23,290
Then quit howling!
l know you romantic guys.

368
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,258
One crack about the moon
and you're off to the races.

369
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,457
- Especially when it looks like a sure thing.
- Here we go again.

370
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:32,659
Did l do something wrong?

371
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,664
You'd better go, Wally.

372
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,033
- No dice, huh?
- Good night.

373
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,175
Well, no dice, no dice.

374
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:42,037
You can't shoot a guy for trying.

375
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:45,978
l just thought maybe that--
Mildred, l was only kidding.

376
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:48,310
l wouldn't pull any cheap tricks
on you.

377
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:50,112
- You know that.
- Yes, l know.

378
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:51,618
Why--

379
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,183
- l said good night, Wally.
- Okay. Round one goes to Mildred.

380
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,693
- There won't be any round two.
- l'll keep on trying.

381
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:04,857
- l know, once a week.
- Twice a week.

382
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,268
- Veda! You awake?
- Yes, Mother.

383
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:18,004
- You'll wake Kay.
- No. She's tired out.

384
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:21,708
- She cried herself to sleep.
- Was it about her father?

385
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:26,151
Yes.
ls he going to marry Mrs. Biederhof?

386
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:29,785
- l don't know.
- l do.

387
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:33,554
l do know that you should be asleep.

388
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,528
- l've been thinking.
- What about?

389
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,727
- l heard you and Wally talking.
- Well?

390
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:44,237
- You could marry him if you wanted.
- l'm not in love with him.

391
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:47,240
But then maybe we could have
a maid like we used to...

392
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:52,211
...and a limousine.
And maybe a new house.

393
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,077
l don't like this house.

394
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:58,779
Neither do l. But that's no reason
to marry a man l'm not in love with.

395
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,252
Why not?

396
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:06,886
Veda, does a new house mean so much
to you that you would trade me for it?

397
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:09,122
l didn't mean it, Mother.

398
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,757
l don't care what we have,
as long as we're together.

399
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:15,734
lt's just that there's
so many things that l--

400
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:18,466
That we should have and haven't got.

401
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:21,873
l know, darling. l know.

402
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:27,210
l want you to have nice things.
And you will have. Wait and see.

403
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:31,445
l'll get you everything.
Anything you want. l promise.

404
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:33,088
How?

405
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,883
l don't know.

406
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:41,163
- But l will, l promise.
- You darling.

407
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:44,266
- Come on, go to sleep.
- All right.

408
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:47,399
- Happy dreams, sweetie.
- Thank you.

409
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:52,406
- l love you, Veda.
- l love you, Mother. Really, l do.

410
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,343
But let's not be sticky about it.

411
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:01,347
Good night.

412
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:10,454
<i>I had to get a job, any kind.</i>

413
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:14,358
<i>I had no experience in the business world,</i>
<i>but I had to get a job.</i>

414
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:18,262
<i>I walked my legs off. Getting a job</i>
<i>wasn't as easy as I thought.</i>

415
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:22,872
<i>Days seemed like weeks, and everywhere</i>
<i>I went I heard the same thing:</i>

416
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,200
Sorry, we need people with experience.

417
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:28,833
<i>I was sick at heart</i>
<i>when I saw the restaurant.</i>

418
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:32,209
<i>I decided to go in for a cup of tea.</i>

419
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,052
Good afternoon.

420
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:44,357
Sit here?

421
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:46,724
Menu.

422
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:52,860
Clear the dirty dishes
off number three. Pick up your feet!

423
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,971
- Roast chicken is nice.
- No, thank you. l'll....

424
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,902
l caught you red-handed.

425
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:00,133
l didn't take your rotten tip.

426
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,041
- What's the trouble?
- She's lifting tips. l've seen her.

427
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:07,775
Go into the kitchen.
You keep out of it.

428
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,409
- How about some service?
- Someone will take care of you right away.

429
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:15,649
- l hope so. l have--
- You mind your own business.

430
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:19,926
Sorry to leave you like that,
but we're so short-handed.

431
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:22,530
- You wanted tea?
- No, l want a job.

432
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:25,759
- What?
- Well, you seem to need help....

433
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:27,664
l want a job.

434
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:32,565
- You ever work in a restaurant before?
- No.

435
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:35,542
Follow me.

436
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:41,745
- You're a nervous gal, aren't you?
- l'm just a little anxious.

437
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:44,853
You want to watch that.
lt's tough on dishes.

438
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:49,750
l don't think you're the type for
the work, but l'll give you a trial.

439
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:54,295
You need white shoes. Ask for nurses'
regulation in any store. $2.95.

440
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:57,661
We furnish the uniform, but it
comes off your check. $3.95.

441
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,961
You get it at cost.
Keep it laundered.

442
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:04,698
lf you don't suit us, we charge you 25
cents. That comes off your check too.

443
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,535
Keep your own tips.

444
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,575
Here, have your tea.

445
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:09,905
Thank you.

446
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,913
- What's your name?
- lda, what's yours?

447
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,074
Mildred Pierce.

448
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,812
Chef's salad. Hold the mayonnaise.

449
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,416
- Two plates, hold the potatoes.
- Two chops, medium and rare.

450
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,582
Two chicken dinners.
One without gravy.

451
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,558
Two chickens. Hold one gravy.
Not ''without,'' say hold.

452
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,756
<i>I learned the restaurant business</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>

453
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,901
<i>In three weeks,</i>
<i>I was a good waitress.</i>

454
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,195
- One chicken. Hold veg.
- Chicken. Hold veg.

455
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,670
Steak, medium. Club san. Roast beef.
Hold one. Combin salad.

456
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:42,141
<i>In six weeks, I felt like I'd</i>
<i>worked in a restaurant all my life.</i>

457
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:45,042
<i>In three months, I was one</i>
<i>of the best waitresses there.</i>

458
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:47,240
<i>I took tips and was glad to get them.</i>

459
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:50,011
<i>And at home I baked pies</i>
<i>for the restaurant.</i>

460
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:55,283
Those'll be done in minutes.
We have a dozen peach, a dozen berry...

461
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:59,519
...a dozen pumpkin, a dozen cherry.
After we finish the apple, we can quit.

462
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:03,097
l don't know how you keep it up.
Honest, l don't.

463
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:07,896
l sleep all morning, but you go to
that restaurant and work and work.

464
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:11,370
Just like you been sleeping all night,
only you ain't.

465
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:15,075
- lt keeps me thin.
- Beg pardon?

466
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:17,641
lt don't do nothing for me.

467
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:21,549
<i>I was doing all right.</i>
<i>I was doing fine.</i>

468
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:25,347
<i>I was able to afford an expensive</i>
<i>singing teacher for Veda</i>...

469
00:37:25,522 --> 00:37:27,581
<i>...and a good dancing school for Kay.</i>

470
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:32,387
<i>One thing worried me. That some day</i>
<i>Veda would find out I was a waitress.</i>

471
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:35,360
- Good afternoon.
- Everything go all right?

472
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:39,059
- l had a busy day today.
- That's good.

473
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:43,203
- Where did you get that uniform?
- Miss Veda.

474
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:46,706
She makes me wear it in case
l have to answer the doorbell.

475
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,639
Miss Veda gave it to you?

476
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:52,339
l told her you wouldn't like it.
l told her right off.

477
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:57,282
But she hollered and went on,
so l put it on just to keep her quiet.

478
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:19,270
- ls that what you learned at ballet?
- Do you like it?

479
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:22,843
- What have you got on your face?
- lt's just some lipstick.

480
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,274
- Lottie!
- Yes?

481
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:27,939
Take Kay upstairs and wash her face
and give her a good scrubbing.

482
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:31,052
My face don't need scrubbing.
l washed it this morning.

483
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:34,918
- Go on, hurry up.
- lt can stand more soap and water.

484
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,899
- Veda.
- Yes, Mother, what is it?

485
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:47,628
- Where did you find the uniform?
- l was looking for a handkerchief.

486
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:49,704
- ln my closet?
- l looked everywhere.

487
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:53,934
Your handkerchiefs are always in your
top drawer. Why were you in my closet?

488
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,137
You're making quite a fuss about
something which doesn't matter.

489
00:38:58,314 --> 00:39:02,808
lf you bought the uniform for Lottie,
and l can't imagine who else it would it be for...

490
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,817
...then why shouldn't she wear it?

491
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:09,084
You've been snooping since l got this
job trying to find out what it is.

492
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,489
And now you know, don't you?

493
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:15,062
Know what? Know what, Mother?

494
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:18,496
You knew that uniform was mine,
didn't you?

495
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:22,069
- Your uniform?
- Yes. l'm waiting tables downtown.

496
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:24,798
My mother. A waitress.

497
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:29,070
l took that job so you and your sister
could eat, sleep and have clothes.

498
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:31,611
Did you have to degrade us?

499
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,011
- Don't talk like that!
- l'm not surprised.

500
00:39:34,183 --> 00:39:38,313
You've never spoken of your people,
where you came from, so perhaps it's natural.

501
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:40,149
Maybe that's why Father--

502
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:54,468
l'm sorry l did that.
l'd have rather cut off my hand.

503
00:39:56,072 --> 00:40:00,406
l'd never have taken the job
if l hadn't wanted to keep us all together.

504
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:04,410
Besides, l wanted to learn
the business the best way possible.

505
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,539
- What kind of business?
- The restaurant business.

506
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:13,382
l'm planning on opening a place of my own.
There's money in a restaurant.

507
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:19,290
- You mean we'll be rich?
- Some people have gotten rich that way.

508
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:22,488
<i>I didn't know what to do next,</i>
<i>but suddenly it hit me.</i>

509
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:24,155
<i>Why not open a restaurant?</i>

510
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:27,565
ln the 7th, give me five
across the board on Materialize.

511
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:28,965
Hello. Grab a seat.

512
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:32,596
What? l know it's a dog,
but l happen to like red horses.

513
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,504
Call me back, will you?

514
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,338
- Well, well, well.
- Hello, Wally.

515
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:39,208
- lt's good to see you.
- lt's nice to see you. Sit down.

516
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:43,716
- l haven't seen enough of you lately.
- This is all business.

517
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:47,686
lf you keep on refusing me,
l'm gonna think you're stubborn.

518
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:49,757
Laugh? No laugh?

519
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:51,325
What's all this?

520
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:54,762
- l'm going to open a restaurant.
- You are?

521
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,923
- And you're going to help me.
- l am? l mean, am l?

522
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,932
Please, Wally.

523
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,335
l guess l am. What's the score?

524
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:06,703
l found the location. An old house
that hasn't been lived in for years.

525
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:09,970
lt's on a busy intersection.
So it's good for drive-in trade.

526
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:13,013
l clocked an average
of 500 cars an hour.

527
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:17,084
Do you realize what that means? And,
there isn't another restaurant in five miles.

528
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:19,221
lt listens good. What's the address?

529
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:23,758
- 35904 Glen Oaks Blvd.
- 35904 Glen Oaks Blvd?

530
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:26,952
- Who owns it?
- l don't know, but there's a ''For Sale'' sign.

531
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,724
- Let's see.
- l need help in getting this place.

532
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,993
You know the angles. l want
that house. Please get it.

533
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:38,698
All right. 35907, 35904.
There we are!

534
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,206
lt's listed at $ 1 0,000.

535
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:43,436
They'll take eight or less.
They want to move the property.

536
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:46,605
- And it's owned by the Beragon Estate.
- Do you know them?

537
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:50,844
No. They're some wealthy Pasadena family
got property here. Beragon Manor.

538
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,318
Beragon Estate. There.

539
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:58,392
- Well, what do you know.
- What is it? Tell me.

540
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:01,553
Beragons have lost two properties
because of back taxes.

541
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:05,633
lt sounds as if they're broke. Using
your gams all day hasn't hurt them.

542
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:10,636
Hello! Hello! Mr. Beragon, please.
Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.

543
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,507
How do you do? This is
Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.

544
00:42:14,677 --> 00:42:17,703
l've been looking forward
to calling you for some time.

545
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,316
lt's regarding your property
on Glen Oaks Boulevard.

546
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:25,716
l've succeeded in interesting a client
in the possibility of a purchase.

547
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:28,890
- Well, how about...?
- This afternoon.

548
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:31,117
Yeah. How about this afternoon?

549
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:33,421
Good. We'll be right down.

550
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:37,862
Fay is the name. No, Fay.
That's right. Goodbye.

551
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:41,595
He's sweating blood already.
Come on, let's go.

552
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:44,433
And, remember,
let me do all the talking.

553
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,268
Wally, you're wonderful!

554
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:48,672
This is all business, remember?

555
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,045
Yep! This is it.

556
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:16,267
Will you wait here, please?

557
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,286
Mr. Beragon, l talked to you
on the phone.

558
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,688
This is Mrs. Pierce, the client.

559
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,885
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

560
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:41,859
Would you like a drink?

561
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:45,364
- l'm trapped. You talked me into it.
- Mrs. Pierce?

562
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:49,162
As l see it, she wants the house
but doesn't want to pay.

563
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:52,739
Well, that's about it. Mrs. Pierce
needs time to get started.

564
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:56,140
But once successful,
she'll buy the property outright.

565
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:58,610
l see. A very unusual proposition.

566
00:43:58,781 --> 00:44:02,308
- How long do you need, Mrs. Pierce?
- l'd say about a year.

567
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:05,420
- You think you can make $ 1 0,000?
- Yes, l have it all--

568
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:08,421
lf the place is successful,
it'll be very successful.

569
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:11,890
lf it isn't, you'll get your
property back in better condition.

570
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:14,325
lt's a gamble,
but you can't lose much.

571
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:18,729
l like to gamble, Mr. Fay.
But the odds are against me.

572
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:22,337
- l'm afraid l'm not interested.
- Please, listen to me.

573
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:24,097
This is a gamble for me too.

574
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:27,800
l'm putting every cent
l have into this place. l haven't much.

575
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:31,208
l can't afford to lose.
l've got all the information.

576
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,974
l know what it will cost
and how much l can make.

577
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,414
l know l can do it. l know l can!

578
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:39,982
Very well. lt's a deal.

579
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:43,148
Great! l'll draw up the papers.
One more thing.

580
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:47,057
- We'll need a pre-dated transfer of ownership.
- You want it immediately?

581
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,824
Yeah. We'll give you a note,
you give us the deed.

582
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:52,627
You take care of the details.

583
00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:56,169
Well, how does it feel to be
the owner of a white elephant?

584
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,069
lt feels wonderful!

585
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,073
How about Uncle Wally?

586
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,647
- Nice guy.
- Very. Good-looking too.

587
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:07,908
- Maybe, but no brains.
- What do you mean?

588
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:11,110
You conning him out of the deed
without putting down a cent.

589
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:14,381
- Sure!
- You leave the angles to Uncle Wally.

590
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:17,219
- There's one other thing to do.
- What's that?

591
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,691
Sorry.
l don't feel romantic this afternoon.

592
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,592
No, nothing like that.
lt's serious. lt's about Bert.

593
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:24,892
- What's on your mind?
- You won't like it.

594
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:28,468
You'll have to get a divorce
if you want to open that restaurant.

595
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:30,265
What's that got to do with it?

596
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:33,033
ln California, they got
a community property law.

597
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:36,178
- Half of what's Bert's is yours.
- What's half of nothing?

598
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:38,939
lt works two ways.
Half of what you own is Bert's.

599
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:43,279
You open that restaurant and Bert's
creditors will be saying, ''Give me.''

600
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,283
- ls a divorce the only answer?
- Why?

601
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,821
- lt takes a year to get a divorce.
- Are you getting cold feet?

602
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:50,618
Why bother if it takes a year?

603
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:54,627
lt takes a year to be final. Once
entered, the creditors can't touch you.

604
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:57,732
- Your worries are over.
- l'll be seeing Bert next week.

605
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,460
He's coming to take
the children for the weekend.

606
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,104
- l'll think about it.
- Nothing to think about!

607
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:06,264
- No divorce, no restaurant!
- l'll think about it, Wally!

608
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:10,810
l'd have to know a little more about
it. Divorce is serious. l'm not--

609
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,311
- Hello, Dad!
- Hello, dear.

610
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,880
We'll be down in a minute.

611
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,746
Veda wants to know where
her new bathing suit is.

612
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,945
- lt's in the top drawer of her dresser.
- Okay!

613
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:23,954
She says it's in the upper drawer
of the dresser.

614
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:28,395
Here.

615
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,392
l wonder if there are many boys
up at Arrowhead.

616
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:35,662
lf there are, they're sure to find you.
Don't worry.

617
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:39,338
l hate this as much as you.
But it's got to be, for the children.

618
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,237
l have to think of their future.

619
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,105
- Of Veda.
- All right, of Veda.

620
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:46,737
- What about Kay?
- Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.

621
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:51,114
Kay's twice the girl Veda is and always
will be. She thinks you're wonderful.

622
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:55,121
- Maybe that's why l try to please Veda.
- You'll always get kicked around.

623
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,920
You ought to know. l've made up
my mind. l want a divorce.

624
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:01,655
l want to know a whole lot
more about this deal.

625
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,163
- What have you got to do with that?
- You're my wife.

626
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,996
You seem to forget about it
when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.

627
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,039
- Well, what about you and Wally Fay?
- You should know better than that.

628
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:16,872
Bert, listen. l've put everything
l've got into this restaurant.

629
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,446
l've worked with painter, carpenters,
electricians.

630
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:22,379
And suddenly,
everything is beginning to take shape.

631
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:25,315
l've worked hard.
l'm going to get that divorce.

632
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:30,824
l know. You want me to poke you in the nose
so you can claim l was guilty of cruelty.

633
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:33,757
No, Mildred. No divorce.

634
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:37,063
l'm going to file papers.
There's little you can do about it.

635
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:41,101
- l don't need your permission.
- No? Well, file away.

636
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,738
l'll fight you all the way.
You and Wally Fay.

637
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:48,343
- And what's more, l'm--
- You don't have to worry about me.

638
00:47:48,511 --> 00:47:51,105
Well, that was quick.
My, how nice you look.

639
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,339
- Thank you.
- Hello, Father.

640
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,778
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, darling.

641
00:47:56,952 --> 00:48:00,479
Have fun. Be careful swimming.
That water's awfully cold!

642
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:02,920
- Bye!
- Bye!

643
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:05,622
On the way,
can we stop and have a hamburger?

644
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:09,128
l guess so.
We'll have to hurry, though.

645
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:30,775
lt's moments like this that make
me happy that nylons are out.

646
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:33,478
Well, if it isn't our silent partner.

647
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:37,023
l've been silent long enough.
l came to check on my investment.

648
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:39,753
- Well, how do you like it?
- Delightful.

649
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:43,365
- You're here to check on your investment?
- Absolutely.

650
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:45,659
Then you'd better look
at your investment.

651
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:49,862
Over there's the counter. Here will be
one table and over here four tables.

652
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,338
We have 1 0 booths, four people
to a booth. That's 40 people.

653
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:55,170
- We can expect to feed--
- lngenious.

654
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:58,074
Today's a holiday.
Why don't you get out of here?

655
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:01,614
l'd love to, but l'm awfully busy.
lsn't the bar beautiful?

656
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:05,550
l've got one at the beach house.
Why don't you come see my ocean?

657
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,588
l've seen one. lf you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

658
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:12,193
Why should people come to eat
and go someplace else to drink?

659
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:15,387
- That's why l put in the bar--
- Logical. But, back to my ocean.

660
00:49:15,564 --> 00:49:18,692
Why don't we go have a swim
and forget about our investment?

661
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,733
l'd love to, but....

662
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:22,996
- l've got too much to do.
- Come on.

663
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,639
Look out. l might say yes.

664
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:27,605
- You know might be highly original?
- No. What?

665
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:31,075
Just say yes. Right away like that.

666
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:32,805
No. No, l shouldn't.

667
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:36,474
You'll find that the only things you
regret are the things you didn't do.

668
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:37,880
l hope you're right.

669
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:42,319
Look. Why don't l pick you up
in, say, 30 minutes.

670
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:44,925
No, l really can't.

671
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:50,559
- How about it?
- All right. You win.

672
00:49:54,737 --> 00:50:00,266
There you are. Just help yourself. lf you
don't find what you want, let me know.

673
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:04,174
- Are you hoarding bathing suits?
- They belong to my sisters.

674
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:06,507
There's nothing like having
a large family.

675
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:10,675
- Yell if you need help with the zipper.
- Thank you, but l won't need any help.

676
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:14,983
- How do you like your drink?
- Harmless.

677
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,225
- l like your ocean.
- l borrowed it from the Navy just for you.

678
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:29,030
- You have a wonderful view.
- l wouldn't say that.

679
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:31,297
l hope the suit fits better
than the robe.

680
00:50:31,473 --> 00:50:32,735
lt does.

681
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:36,778
- Do you live here year round?
- The family mansion is in Pasadena.

682
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:41,076
Complete with iron deer, a ghost
and a greenhouse. l come here in the spring.

683
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,684
- lt must be lovely.
- Yes, but lonely.

684
00:50:43,852 --> 00:50:48,380
ln the spring, a man's fancy turns to
what he's thought about all winter.

685
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:51,890
lt's a good thing California winters
are so short.

686
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:58,695
- No whistle?
- l'd need a police siren.

687
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:01,358
- Well, here we go.
- Go? Go where?

688
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:06,340
- Swimming. lsn't that why we're here?
- l suppose it is. Wait a minute.

689
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:08,499
- Come on.
- Hold it.

690
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,618
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

691
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,492
- You drink too much.
- l do too much of everything. l'm spoiled.

692
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,362
Too many sisters.
They all seem to be my size too.

693
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:35,230
Yes. l like them your size.

694
00:51:35,404 --> 00:51:38,703
- To brotherly love!
- Thank you, Mr. Beragon.

695
00:51:38,874 --> 00:51:42,435
Monte Beragon.
That's a very unusual name. Spanish?

696
00:51:42,611 --> 00:51:44,943
Mostly. Maybe a little
ltalian thrown in.

697
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:47,548
But my mother is
a real dyed-in-the-wool Yankee.

698
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:51,777
That's why l'm such a self-controlled
and dignified young fellow.

699
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:53,751
And just what do you do?

700
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:58,120
l loaf in a decorative
and highly charming manner.

701
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:02,696
- ls that all?
- With me, loafing is a science.

702
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:08,732
- You're very beautiful like that.
- l bet you say that to all your sisters.

703
00:52:08,904 --> 00:52:11,372
- Shall l tell your fortune?
- Can you?

704
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,204
We Beragons come from
a long line of teacup readers.

705
00:52:16,378 --> 00:52:20,815
l'm not very impressionable. l lost
my awe of women at an early age.

706
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:26,649
But ever since you came here, l thought
of what l'd say when we met again.

707
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:29,655
Now l can't say anything.

708
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:33,886
- You take my breath away.
- Do l?

709
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:38,898
l like you, Monte. You make me feel--

710
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:44,199
- l don't know, warm.
- And wanted? Beautiful?

711
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,465
Yes.

712
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:50,010
When l'm close to you, there's a sound
in the air like the beating of wings.

713
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:53,046
- You know what it is?
- No. What?

714
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:56,378
My heart. Beating like a schoolboy's.

715
00:52:57,286 --> 00:53:01,780
ls it? l thought it was mine.

716
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:06,991
The record.

717
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:11,128
Monte, the record.

718
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:22,474
ls he there yet? That's good.

719
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:24,976
l think l have everything we need.

720
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:28,480
Yeah, l called everywhere.
l'll wait another five minutes.

721
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,641
Wait. l think she's coming now.

722
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,616
- Promise?
- l don't know.

723
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:41,558
- Thursday? Friday?
- Make it Wednesday.

724
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:45,462
- Good. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

725
00:53:50,672 --> 00:53:52,765
- Where have you been?
- What are you doing here?

726
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:56,468
l've been looking all over for you.
l've been nearly nuts.

727
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:59,273
- What is it?
- lt's Kay. She's sick.

728
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:02,283
We came down from Arrowhead
80 miles an hour, but--

729
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:06,046
- Well, it's pneumonia.
- No.

730
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:09,222
She isn't here.

731
00:54:10,993 --> 00:54:14,258
She isn't here? Where is she?

732
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:16,294
Mrs. Biederhof's.

733
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:22,270
l was frantic. l didn't know
what to do. l sent for Dr. Gale.

734
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:25,372
lt's all right, Bert, just hurry!

735
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,792
Mommy!

736
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,363
Yes, darling, Mommy's here.

737
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:00,502
More oxygen.

738
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:17,817
l hope it was all right to bring her
here instead of the hospital.

739
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:21,986
- But l thought it would save time.
- You did the right thing.

740
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:26,327
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Biederhof.

741
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:38,172
- Nurse?
- Yes, doctor?

742
00:55:38,347 --> 00:55:40,338
One more cc.

743
00:55:57,366 --> 00:56:00,563
l'm sorry. l couldn't save her.

744
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:40,132
l'm sorry, Mildred.
We did everything in our power.

745
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:48,748
l brought her into the world,
and it seems hard that l was the one to--

746
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:52,177
l'll fix you a nice, hot cup of tea.

747
00:57:03,665 --> 00:57:06,065
l'll never forget her.

748
00:57:06,234 --> 00:57:09,294
Never, as long as l live.

749
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:12,372
She said, ''Mommy!''

750
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:15,371
And that was all.

751
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:18,947
l loved her so much.

752
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,541
Mother.

753
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:28,650
Please, God, don't ever let
anything happen to Veda!

754
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:35,355
<i>After that, only one thing was on my mind.</i>
<i>To open the restaurant and make it successful.</i>

755
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,931
Short stack. Easy on the butter.
Adam and Eve on a raft. Hit me hard.

756
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:47,439
- l'm glad you enjoyed it.
- We'll come again tomorrow.

757
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:49,702
See you tomorrow. Good night.

758
00:57:52,147 --> 00:57:54,274
Too bad you had to stand so long.

759
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:57,441
l'm sorry l've kept you waiting.
This way.

760
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:59,644
l'm so glad you liked it.

761
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:03,917
We've been jammed ever since the doors
opened. Here you are.

762
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:05,684
Arline, take the orders.

763
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,295
- We have great fried chicken.
- l'll have it.

764
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:10,090
l hope you like it.

765
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,368
Pick up something. Never make a trip
with an empty tray like that.

766
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,965
- lt looks like we're in.
- That's what it says here.

767
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:21,735
- lsn't that lovely?
- What would l do without you?

768
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:24,071
Probably have a nervous breakdown.

769
00:58:24,246 --> 00:58:27,477
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello. We got your invitation.

770
00:58:27,649 --> 00:58:31,710
l'm glad you came. Suzanne,
a booth for Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer.

771
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:34,515
- Congratulations, Mother.
- Thank you.

772
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:37,920
- How'd you like to sell?
- No. l know a good thing when l see it.

773
00:58:38,093 --> 00:58:42,120
So do l. lt's some mob.
Those postcards you sent out did the trick.

774
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:46,324
Keep my seat and get me a drink.
l want to talk to your mother.

775
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:50,562
What do you want to talk to me about?
- lt's about Bert. He's coming here tonight.

776
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:54,300
- He is?
- He wants to see you about the divorce.

777
00:58:54,476 --> 00:58:57,240
- What about it?
- He just wants to see you.

778
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:01,109
- Help me. l gotta go to the kitchen.
- All right, sure.

779
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:04,276
- Excuse me. l'm sorry.
- You big peasant.

780
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:08,549
- Look where you're going.
- Excuse me for living. l'm excited.

781
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,381
- What's this?
- We're swamped. Help us.

782
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,860
- Who me? l'm an executive.
- Now you're in charge of the potatoes.

783
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:17,293
- All right.
- Thanks.

784
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,559
- You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

785
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:21,133
Not at all.

786
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:30,234
What do you know?
Beragon just came in.

787
00:59:30,412 --> 00:59:34,007
- Did he? He didn't say he was coming.
- What do you mean?

788
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:37,447
- You been seeing him?
- Don't let the potatoes burn.

789
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,916
l was just asking.

790
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:42,386
Don't ever go in like that.
Put more potatoes on.

791
00:59:42,557 --> 00:59:46,618
- You'll never make money that way.
- Just so the customers are satisfied.

792
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:50,663
This is just like my wedding night.
So exciting.

793
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:56,532
- Will you give Mrs. Pierce these?
- Can l tell her your name or is it secret?

794
00:59:56,705 --> 00:59:59,640
Tell her they're from
an old gypsy fortuneteller.

795
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:03,574
Sit down and read a teacup,
and l'll see if she's busy.

796
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:09,484
- Hey, Mildred! Real, live orchids.
- For me?

797
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,211
Orchids? What is this?
Who they from?

798
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:15,288
From an old gypsy fortuneteller
with beautiful eyes.

799
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,691
- Beg pardon?
- Put them in the icebox, Wally.

800
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,623
Here, muscles.

801
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,938
Put it on this table, please?

802
01:00:35,777 --> 01:00:38,337
l'm sorry,
l didn't realize this table was taken.

803
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:42,745
lt's quite all right. We're so crowded
tonight. Do sit down, Mr. Beragon.

804
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:45,546
Thank you. May l have a dry martini?

805
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,053
- So you know me?
- Everyone knows the Monte Beragon.

806
01:00:49,224 --> 01:00:52,022
You play polo, go yachting,
are an excellent hunter.

807
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:55,357
And are seen with the most
attractive debutantes.

808
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:57,590
- l read the society section.
- l gather.

809
01:00:57,766 --> 01:01:01,600
- l should introduce myself.
- Don't tell me. Your hand, please.

810
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:07,572
- Can you tell from my hand?
- l come from a long line of fortunetellers.

811
01:01:07,742 --> 01:01:09,266
Yes.

812
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:12,809
- What does it say?
- That you are very much like your mother.

813
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:17,418
And it says that
her name is Bierce. No. Pierce.

814
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,680
- How wonderful.
- And it says your name is Veda.

815
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:26,418
- Where does it say ''Veda''?
- That line right there. Unmistakable.

816
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:29,723
- Well, if it isn't Gypsy Beragon.
- The very same.

817
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:34,198
- lt looks like a good investment, huh?
- Anything would be an improvement.

818
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:37,600
Smile when you say that,
a third of this joint belongs to me.

819
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:40,400
- Congratulations.
- l've got another proposition.

820
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:42,839
- That orange grove you got--
- Save it.

821
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:45,377
- Well, here's to success.
- Yes.

822
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:46,536
Thank you.

823
01:01:46,715 --> 01:01:49,650
- Four.
- Two special. One Grade A. One black.

824
01:01:49,818 --> 01:01:52,616
Hot stuff coming through.

825
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:02,596
That's a wonderful piece.

826
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:07,565
- All you need is a pair of bobby socks.
- Maybe Veda will lend me a pair.

827
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:16,870
Well, the last customer
just folded his tent.

828
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:20,708
- Good. We've only got one chicken left.
- Put my initials on that.

829
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:24,079
l don't know whether
l'm on my feet or my ankles.

830
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:29,053
- You must be dead.
- Well, if l am, just bury me with this.

831
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,288
l wish l felt the way they do.

832
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:38,990
- You've got a nice voice. Did you know that?
- Thank you.

833
01:02:39,534 --> 01:02:42,059
Hi. Congratulations. You're a success.

834
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:45,900
- We've been getting acquainted.
- He's promised to take me the races.

835
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:47,974
- lf your mother comes too.
- l'd love to.

836
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,168
- Wally, do me a favor.
- Anything.

837
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:51,903
- Take Veda home.
- What?

838
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,413
- Anyone would think l was a child.
- lt's past your bedtime.

839
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:59,713
lt's not past my bedtime.
Besides, l want to take you home.

840
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:02,721
l've got to close up.
l'll go home with lda.

841
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:06,827
Sure is a big night for me.
l came out for an evening of fun.

842
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:10,931
What do l get? Dishpan hands
and a date with a Girl Scout.

843
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:13,033
- Good night.
- Good night.

844
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:16,068
Good night, Mr. Beragon.
Thank you.

845
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:19,400
- l trust that we may meet again very soon.
- l hope so.

846
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:25,012
Thank you, Mrs. Pierce. l trust that l might
see you in the not-too-distant future.

847
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,545
- Come on.
- l'm coming.

848
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,206
Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.

849
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:32,080
For heaven's sake.

850
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:36,252
Leave something on me.
l might catch cold.

851
01:03:36,424 --> 01:03:40,918
l was just thinking.
Not about you. Come on.

852
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:43,527
- That's a cute youngster of yours.
- lsn't she?

853
01:03:43,698 --> 01:03:46,064
l thought you had two.

854
01:03:46,835 --> 01:03:50,293
- Kay died.
- l'm sorry. You should have let me know.

855
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:55,239
- Let's not talk about it.
- You're going to make a go of this place.

856
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,877
Well, l hope so.

857
01:03:57,045 --> 01:04:00,537
- Don't you ever do anything but work?
- Somebody's got to.

858
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:04,549
Not all the time. There's a time
for work and a time for--

859
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,281
Seventeen. Six minus seven.
Monte, don't. Not here.

860
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:14,258
Why not? l've been waiting
all evening. A lifetime.

861
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:32,408
- l didn't mean to bust in like this.
- That's all right.

862
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,516
This is my husband.
Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.

863
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:39,881
- l've heard a lot of things about you.
- Nice things, l hope.

864
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:43,455
- l'd like to speak to Mildred.
- Yes, of course.

865
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:47,288
- What is it, Bert?
- This'll only take a minute.

866
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:51,463
lt's funny. lt's harder
to say than l thought.

867
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:54,659
lt's about the divorce.
You can have it.

868
01:04:54,836 --> 01:04:58,328
When l walked out, l told you
to see if you could get along without me.

869
01:04:58,506 --> 01:05:00,030
l didn't think you could.

870
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:05,407
When you asked me for a divorce, l still
didn't think you could make a go of it alone.

871
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:09,448
Now l know better. You're doing
all right. You're doing fine.

872
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:14,115
- l never thought it would end like this.
- Who knows how anything is going to end?

873
01:05:14,556 --> 01:05:17,684
- l'm sorry.
- Yes, l'm sorry too.

874
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:21,795
Well, that's what l came
to say, and now that l've said it...

875
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:25,694
...l want you to know l wish you
all the luck in the world.

876
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:28,028
Thank you, Bert. Thank you.

877
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,203
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

878
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,464
This calls for a drink.

879
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,007
ln the Beragon family,
there is an old Spanish proverb:

880
01:05:36,177 --> 01:05:40,045
One man's poison
is another man's meat.

881
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:41,204
Bert!

882
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:58,329
l was in love with him,
and l knew it for the first time that night...

883
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,436
...but now he's dead, and l'm not sorry.
He wasn't worth it.

884
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:06,370
That may be. Whoever killed him
evidently agreed with you.

885
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:10,602
You haven't given us one reason why
your first husband wasn't the murderer.

886
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:13,576
ln fact, you've given us
a very good reason why he was.

887
01:06:13,748 --> 01:06:17,809
Look at it our way. One: Beragon
was killed with Pierce's gun.

888
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:21,888
Two: Pierce cannot account for
his movements at the time of the murder.

889
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:28,484
Three: He had a motive. You've just
given it to us, Mrs. Beragon. Jealousy.

890
01:06:28,663 --> 01:06:31,131
This just came in.
Thought you'd want it.

891
01:06:31,299 --> 01:06:34,393
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

892
01:06:37,105 --> 01:06:41,474
- ls he sure?
- Charley don't like to make mistakes.

893
01:06:41,643 --> 01:06:43,611
Just a minute.

894
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:48,044
Mrs. Beragon, we have some
information here which puzzles us a little.

895
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:52,179
For instance, your business manager....

896
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:55,584
- Right away.
- Okay.

897
01:06:55,757 --> 01:07:00,558
lda Corwin. She tell us that you
called her at approximately 1 1 :45 p.m...

898
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:02,958
...and asked her where Mr. Beragon was.

899
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:07,693
- You seemed quite upset at the time.
- lt was just a business matter.

900
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:11,327
- Then there was nothing wrong?
- No.

901
01:07:11,506 --> 01:07:15,169
Occasionally we run across
a witness who refuses to tell us...

902
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:20,713
...what we want to know, except under
pressure. Like Wally Fay, for example.

903
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:25,216
Why did you take him to the beach house?
Did you know Beragon was there, dead?

904
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:28,412
- No, l didn't.
- Then you were at the beach house.

905
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,321
Why didn't you tell us that before?
Why did you run from the house?

906
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:35,394
Wasn't it because you
knew Beragon was there, dead?

907
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:40,432
And if you did know, why were you
trying to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?

908
01:07:41,035 --> 01:07:44,095
l think you'd better
tell us the truth now.

909
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:48,365
l did it.

910
01:07:48,543 --> 01:07:49,669
l killed him.

911
01:07:50,011 --> 01:07:55,506
But why? Your restaurant was a success.
You were in love with Beragon.

912
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,117
What happened to all that?

913
01:07:59,654 --> 01:08:04,353
The restaurant was a greater success
than l knew. Profits were enormous.

914
01:08:04,525 --> 01:08:08,017
ln a few months l opened another place,
and then l started a chain.

915
01:08:08,196 --> 01:08:10,630
<i>In three years I built five restaurants.</i>

916
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,359
<i>Everywhere you went,</i>
<i>I had a restaurant. They made money.</i>

917
01:08:14,535 --> 01:08:19,700
<i>Everything I touched turned into money,</i>
<i>and I needed it. I needed it for Veda.</i>

918
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,581
<i>She was becoming a young lady</i>
<i>with expensive tastes.</i>

919
01:08:27,915 --> 01:08:30,713
<i>Veda was growing up.</i>

920
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:52,203
That Ted Forrester is nice-looking.
Veda likes him.

921
01:08:52,373 --> 01:08:54,603
Who wouldn't?
He has a million dollars.

922
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:58,735
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. l've just run out of jokes.

923
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:02,246
- What is it? Tell me.
- l've had a little bad luck lately.

924
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:06,080
l won't be able to afford
many more evenings like this.

925
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:10,190
- Do you need money?
- No, no. lt isn't anything like that.

926
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:14,818
- l think you do.
- Mildred, please don't do that.

927
01:09:14,996 --> 01:09:18,727
You've been awfully good to us, Monte.
Take it, please.

928
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:24,236
lf you say so. But l'll pay it back.
l want it understood that it's only a loan.

929
01:09:24,405 --> 01:09:28,273
Anything you say,
just as long as we're friends.

930
01:09:31,779 --> 01:09:36,512
<i>That's how it began. At first it</i>
<i>bothered Monte to take money from me.</i>

931
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:39,653
<i>Then it became a habit with him.</i>

932
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:43,417
There's a total here
of $ 1 480.29 in six months.

933
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:45,559
- What's the big idea?
- We owe him.

934
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:48,389
The restaurant's paid for.
You don't owe him a cent.

935
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:51,396
l manage this business,
and l've done all right.

936
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:54,592
Keeping Beragon in shirts
is not my idea of business.

937
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:55,758
- No?
- No!

938
01:09:55,937 --> 01:09:58,701
Look, l made this business for you
with my own hands.

939
01:09:58,873 --> 01:10:01,171
l got the banks to give you credit.

940
01:10:01,342 --> 01:10:05,142
l conned everybody, and for what?
So you could have a lap dog named Beragon?

941
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:09,545
When you walked out on Bert,
l was glad to see you get some sense.

942
01:10:09,717 --> 01:10:12,914
- Beragon's worse.
- That's none of your business.

943
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:19,458
lt is. l helped you so l'd be around when your
mind changed about me. Maybe l was wrong.

944
01:10:19,627 --> 01:10:23,586
- Maybe you were.
- Beragon is no good. He'll bleed you dry.

945
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:26,927
Suppose l'm in love with him.

946
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:33,466
Okay.

947
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:37,104
- At least now l know where l stand.
- Right. Now you know.

948
01:10:43,484 --> 01:10:45,577
- l hate all women.
- My, my.

949
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:48,381
Thank goodness you're not one.

950
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:52,359
Laughing boy seems burned
at the edges. What's eating him?

951
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:54,620
- A small, green-eyed monster.
- Jealous?

952
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:59,028
Doesn't sound like Wally. No profit in it,
and that boy loves a dollar.

953
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:03,364
- l told him l was in love with Beragon.
- Are you?

954
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:06,697
l thought l was once, but not now.

955
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:08,134
Good.

956
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:11,574
- What's that?
- A $ 1 800 birthday present for Veda.

957
01:11:11,746 --> 01:11:17,013
- The car. lt's here. Where is it?
- lt's that shiny thing a block long.

958
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:23,789
- Do you think she'll like it?
- lf she doesn't, have her head examined.

959
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:27,416
Here, you have to sign this in blood.

960
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:31,429
- lt isn't any of my business--
- lf it's about Monte, l agree.

961
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,897
lt's Veda.
She's been borrowing money.

962
01:11:34,068 --> 01:11:36,935
- From whom?
- Anybody. Waitresses mostly.

963
01:11:37,104 --> 01:11:39,265
Hasn't she paid them back?

964
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,877
They're afraid to say anything
or turn her down. You know how it is.

965
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:46,443
l'll see that they're paid back.

966
01:11:46,714 --> 01:11:49,581
l'm sorry l had to tell you.
l don't blame her much.

967
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,876
Monte was with her--

968
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:54,351
Did you bring the Laguna Beach
and Los Feliz statements?

969
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:57,047
Yeah. They're over here.

970
01:11:58,092 --> 01:11:59,719
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello.

971
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:02,021
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.

972
01:12:02,196 --> 01:12:04,687
l hope we aren't interrupting
a big conference.

973
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:08,199
- Just a teeny one.
- l wish l could get interested in work.

974
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:12,135
You were probably frightened
by a callus at an early age. l'll take that.

975
01:12:12,306 --> 01:12:15,605
- Thank you.
- One missing.

976
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:18,370
You're sitting on
the Laguna Beach statement!

977
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:21,982
That's what l like about you.
You're so delightfully provincial.

978
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:26,483
l like you too. Don't look now,
but you're standing under a brick wall.

979
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:30,988
- l don't get it.
- You will, when it falls on you.

980
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:38,360
- When did you start smoking?
- Just the other day.

981
01:12:38,532 --> 01:12:42,628
Monte gave me this for my birthday.
l couldn't hurt him by not using it.

982
01:12:42,803 --> 01:12:47,399
l mean, that would have been dreadfully
<i>recherche, n'est-ce pas</i>?

983
01:12:48,342 --> 01:12:50,810
Yes, l suppose so.

984
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:53,947
Here's something for your birthday too.
l hope you like it.

985
01:12:54,115 --> 01:12:58,950
- Mother! A car? Where is it?
- Look out the window.

986
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:06,050
- Mother, it's beautiful.
- l'm so glad you like it.

987
01:13:06,227 --> 01:13:08,491
How about me?
After all, l picked it out.

988
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:11,992
Monte, it's the nicest present
l ever got.

989
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:15,897
- You're sweet. Let's go for a drive.
- Nothing l'd like better.

990
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:18,937
- Do you mind? l'd like to talk to you.
- Not at all.

991
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,233
- Run along and dent your fenders.
- All right.

992
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:23,707
- See you later at the club.
- Be careful.

993
01:13:23,878 --> 01:13:25,402
l will.

994
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,315
Bye.

995
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:57,033
- What's the matter?
- l want you to do me a favor.

996
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,679
- Sure. What?
- Stay away from Veda.

997
01:13:59,847 --> 01:14:02,372
What's the matter with me?
Have l sprouted two heads?

998
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:05,519
l just don't want you
to take her out so much, that's all.

999
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:08,484
lt isn't funny.
She's only 1 7 and spoiled rotten.

1000
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,454
- What has that got to do with me?
- l've worked hard...

1001
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,786
...to give Veda the things l never had.

1002
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:19,024
l've done without a lot of things
because l wanted her to have everything.

1003
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,724
Now l'm losing her.

1004
01:14:20,901 --> 01:14:22,926
She's drifting away from me.

1005
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:25,470
She hardly speaks to me
except to ask for money...

1006
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:28,005
...or poke fun at me
because l work for a living.

1007
01:14:28,175 --> 01:14:31,201
- All kids are thoughtless.
- Perhaps. l still don't like it.

1008
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:33,404
l blame it on the way she's living.
And on you.

1009
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:37,108
l don't think you understand Veda
very well. She's not like you.

1010
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:40,447
You'll never make a waitress
out of her.

1011
01:14:40,621 --> 01:14:44,614
You look down on me because
l work for a living, don't you?

1012
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:48,523
All right, l work. l cook food,
sell it and make a profit...

1013
01:14:48,696 --> 01:14:51,358
...which you're not too proud to share.

1014
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:53,466
Yes, l take money from you...

1015
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:57,866
...but not enough to make me like
kitchens or cooks. They smell of grease.

1016
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:01,600
You don't shrink away from a $50 bill
because it smells of grease.

1017
01:15:01,776 --> 01:15:04,438
- Take it easy.
- There's no point in going on like this.

1018
01:15:04,612 --> 01:15:06,807
You're interfering with my life
and business.

1019
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:10,144
Worst of all, you're interfering
with my plans for Veda.

1020
01:15:10,317 --> 01:15:14,447
l always knew that someday
we'd come to this particular moment.

1021
01:15:14,622 --> 01:15:17,523
You want Veda and your business
and a nice, quiet life.

1022
01:15:17,691 --> 01:15:19,921
And the price of all that is me.

1023
01:15:20,094 --> 01:15:24,588
You can go back to making your pies
now, Mildred. We're through.

1024
01:15:24,832 --> 01:15:28,063
Wait a minute, Monte.
l forgot something.

1025
01:15:34,675 --> 01:15:38,611
You've been very good to us.
l know you've had expenses taking Veda out.

1026
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:41,805
l don't know how much
we owe you, but....

1027
01:15:42,349 --> 01:15:45,250
lf that isn't enough,
you can let me know.

1028
01:15:45,953 --> 01:15:49,582
Thank you. l've always wondered
how it felt to take a tip.

1029
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:51,190
Well, now you know.

1030
01:15:52,059 --> 01:15:55,495
You can mark
our account ''paid in full.''

1031
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:10,777
- l'd like some of that.
- You gotta work for it.

1032
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:14,039
Keep your motor running.
Bring me three glasses, will you?

1033
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:17,350
- This is beginning to look serious.
- lt is.

1034
01:16:17,518 --> 01:16:21,352
- Yes, we finally made up our minds.
- This calls for a celebration.

1035
01:16:21,522 --> 01:16:24,423
- Congratulations.
- You've been swell to us.

1036
01:16:24,592 --> 01:16:26,924
l get a kick out of doing
things for people.

1037
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:29,062
- Don't l, Veda?
- Absolutely.

1038
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:32,961
Looks like we never serve
champagne in this joint. Or place.

1039
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:37,594
Try this on for size. lt's our very best,
reserved for special customers.

1040
01:16:37,771 --> 01:16:40,569
California, '42.

1041
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:44,209
Well, here's to....

1042
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:46,243
Here's to true love.

1043
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,105
To true love.

1044
01:16:54,989 --> 01:17:00,017
The receipts at Arcadia have dropped
roughly 7<i>o</i>% during the last month.

1045
01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:01,786
- Say, Mildred.
- Nearly 8<i>o</i>%.

1046
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:04,931
There's a Mrs. Forrester
waiting to see you.

1047
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:07,659
- What about?
- Veda.

1048
01:17:07,835 --> 01:17:09,894
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

1049
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,234
- Do you always interrupt?
- Only because l want to be alone with you.

1050
01:17:14,408 --> 01:17:18,276
Come here and let me bite you,
you darling boy.

1051
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:22,277
- Mrs. Pierce?
- Yes.

1052
01:17:22,449 --> 01:17:25,680
- l'm Mrs. Forrester. Ted's mother.
- How do you do?

1053
01:17:25,853 --> 01:17:28,515
Sit down, it would be
more comfortable.

1054
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:32,181
l've been looking forward
to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.

1055
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:35,328
l'm sure we're going
to work out our problem splendidly.

1056
01:17:35,496 --> 01:17:38,021
- Problem?
- Veda hasn't told you?

1057
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,429
Told me what?

1058
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:44,002
Your daughter has somehow
got the idea that--

1059
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:47,368
l understand it.
Any girl wants to get married.

1060
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:51,367
Ted had no such thing in mind.
l want that made clear.

1061
01:17:51,545 --> 01:17:54,571
- Do you mean they're engaged, Veda and Ted?
- Yes.

1062
01:17:54,748 --> 01:17:56,841
l'm quite sure you'll agree with me...

1063
01:17:57,017 --> 01:18:01,647
...that any discussion of marriage
between them would be most undesirable.

1064
01:18:01,822 --> 01:18:05,553
Why should Veda want to marry
your son if he doesn't want to marry her?

1065
01:18:05,726 --> 01:18:08,422
l'm not a mind reader,
but let me tell you...

1066
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:12,396
...if this girl employs any more tricks
trying to blackmail my son--

1067
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:15,433
- Trying to what?
- Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.

1068
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:19,095
l shall prevent this marriage
in any way that l can.

1069
01:18:19,273 --> 01:18:21,503
l don't think you need worry.

1070
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:26,942
Having you in my family is a pretty
dismal prospect. Good afternoon.

1071
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:38,717
Veda, l want to talk to you.
Hello, Wally.

1072
01:18:38,892 --> 01:18:43,329
- What about?
- Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.

1073
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:47,462
- Wally, this is private.
- That's all right. Wally knows about it.

1074
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,830
He knows you and Ted
want to get married?

1075
01:18:50,337 --> 01:18:52,805
Want to get married?

1076
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:56,670
We are married.
We were married on my birthday.

1077
01:18:56,844 --> 01:19:00,644
- l'm sorry, but it's done.
- Veda was trying to spare you.

1078
01:19:00,814 --> 01:19:04,079
She wanted to make things easier
for you so she asked me to help.

1079
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:07,982
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l wanted to so many times.

1080
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:13,525
But you seemed so far away.
l couldn't somehow. l was afraid.

1081
01:19:14,428 --> 01:19:18,660
- Afraid of your own mother?
- Mother, l've been so miserable.

1082
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:22,632
l made a mistake,
and l didn't know how to tell you.

1083
01:19:24,538 --> 01:19:29,134
Darling, don't you love Ted?

1084
01:19:31,478 --> 01:19:33,742
No, Mother.

1085
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:38,116
l'm sorry about that, Veda.

1086
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:41,015
But maybe we don't belong
in a family like that.

1087
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:45,215
That's right. Veda doesn't love this boy.
All right, so she made a mistake.

1088
01:19:45,392 --> 01:19:50,887
The thing to do is to settle the case out
of court. That's the clean way to handle it.

1089
01:19:51,065 --> 01:19:52,396
All right.

1090
01:19:52,566 --> 01:19:56,468
''l, hereby, of my own free will,
renounce all right and title...

1091
01:19:56,637 --> 01:20:01,097
...that l, or my heirs and assignees,
may have to any moneys or estate...

1092
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:06,372
...real or otherwise, which will accrue
or evolve to Theodore Forrester...

1093
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:10,112
...in exchange for considerations
of value received.''

1094
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:14,585
- Are you agreeable to this?
- Why can't we stay married?

1095
01:20:14,755 --> 01:20:17,622
- You will be good enough to keep quiet.
- Yes, Mother.

1096
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,725
We can assume the waiver
is acceptable.

1097
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:23,090
- Will you sign this, please?
- Yeah, sure. Glad to.

1098
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:28,223
My client feels, and l am in complete
accord with her, that she has been irrep....

1099
01:20:28,402 --> 01:20:30,495
lrreparably?

1100
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:32,931
Unduly damaged.

1101
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:35,940
Therefore, there's one more formality
we should discuss.

1102
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:38,305
- What's that?
- The financial settlement.

1103
01:20:38,612 --> 01:20:41,513
You see, my client would like $ 1 0,000.

1104
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:47,086
l think l'm safe in observing that
almost anyone would like $ 1 0,000, but....

1105
01:20:47,254 --> 01:20:48,346
But...?

1106
01:20:48,522 --> 01:20:52,014
We see no necessity
for a financial settlement of any kind.

1107
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:53,659
- You don't, huh?
- No.

1108
01:20:53,827 --> 01:20:56,489
- You will.
- l doubt it.

1109
01:20:56,663 --> 01:21:01,100
l don't understand all this.
There's no need for a financial settlement.

1110
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:04,533
- The only thing we're interested in--
- Please, Mother.

1111
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:08,163
l need the money.
l have to think of the future.

1112
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:11,106
- That's right.
- l'm going to have a baby.

1113
01:21:11,278 --> 01:21:13,246
- What?
- What?

1114
01:21:13,814 --> 01:21:15,509
Veda.

1115
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:19,752
You see, $ 1 0,000
is not entirely unreasonable.

1116
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,050
- This is moral blackmail, sir.
- That's no way to talk about a baby.

1117
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,557
- l won't pay it.
- Yes, you will. Ask your lawyer.

1118
01:21:27,728 --> 01:21:29,195
Yes?

1119
01:21:30,197 --> 01:21:31,186
Yes.

1120
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:36,029
l guess that's about all. You can make
out the check to Mrs. Forr-- To....

1121
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,964
Miss Veda Pierce.

1122
01:21:39,973 --> 01:21:42,965
Well, that's that.

1123
01:21:44,945 --> 01:21:49,678
l'm sorry this had to happen.
Sorry for the boy. He seemed very nice.

1124
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:52,683
Ted's all right, really.

1125
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:57,552
Did you see the look on his face when
we told him he was going to be a father?

1126
01:21:57,724 --> 01:22:01,216
- l wish you wouldn't joke about it.
- You're a scream.

1127
01:22:01,395 --> 01:22:06,298
- Next you'll be knitting little garments.
- l don't see anything ridiculous about that.

1128
01:22:06,467 --> 01:22:10,164
lf l were you, l'd save
myself the trouble.

1129
01:22:15,976 --> 01:22:19,742
- You're not going to have a baby?
- At this stage, it's a matter of opinion.

1130
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:24,373
ln my opinion, l'm going to have
a baby. l can always be mistaken.

1131
01:22:24,551 --> 01:22:28,783
- How could you do such a thing?
- l got the money, didn't l?

1132
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:30,082
l see.

1133
01:22:30,257 --> 01:22:33,886
l'll have to give Wally part of it
to keep him quiet, but there's enough.

1134
01:22:34,061 --> 01:22:36,757
Money. That's what
you live for, isn't it?

1135
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,660
You'd do anything for money.
Even blackmail.

1136
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,097
- Grow up.
- l've never denied you anything.

1137
01:22:42,269 --> 01:22:46,433
Anything money could buy, l've given you.
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1138
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:48,700
Things are going to be different.

1139
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:52,141
l'll say they are.
Why do you think l went to all this trouble?

1140
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:56,078
- Why do you think l want money so badly?
- All right, why?

1141
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,980
- Are you sure you want to know?
- Yes.

1142
01:22:59,152 --> 01:23:03,111
Then l'll tell you. With this money,
l can get away from you.

1143
01:23:03,824 --> 01:23:04,813
Veda.

1144
01:23:04,992 --> 01:23:09,554
From you and your chickens, pies and
kitchens. Everything that smells of grease.

1145
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:13,632
l can get away from this shack
and its cheap furniture. And this town....

1146
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,963
lts women that wear uniforms.
lts men that wear overalls.

1147
01:23:17,137 --> 01:23:20,698
l'm seeing you for the first time
in my life. You're cheap and horrible.

1148
01:23:20,874 --> 01:23:26,278
You think just because you made money,
you can turn yourself into a lady.

1149
01:23:26,446 --> 01:23:30,314
But you can't. You'll never be
anything but a common frump...

1150
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:34,079
...whose father lived over a store
and whose mother took in washing.

1151
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:37,246
With this money l can get away
from every rotten thing...

1152
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:39,790
...that makes me think
of this place or you!

1153
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:42,819
Veda!

1154
01:23:45,132 --> 01:23:49,068
- Give me that check! l said give it to me!
- Not on your life!

1155
01:23:58,278 --> 01:24:00,542
Get out, Veda.

1156
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:05,276
Get your things out of this house
before l throw them into the street.

1157
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:07,215
Get out before l kill you.

1158
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:26,372
<i>I went away for a while.</i>
<i>I traveled, but not far enough.</i>

1159
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,236
<i>Something kept pulling me back.</i>

1160
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:33,675
<i>Finally, I gave in. I went home.</i>

1161
01:24:38,185 --> 01:24:42,588
Why, Miss Pierce, this is a day
for rejoicing. lt certainly is.

1162
01:24:42,756 --> 01:24:45,020
- How are you?
- You look wonderful.

1163
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:47,319
Thank you.
You been away so long.

1164
01:24:47,494 --> 01:24:50,088
- l've been to Mexico.
- ls that a fact?

1165
01:24:50,263 --> 01:24:53,926
l don't know what we would have
done if you'd stayed away longer.

1166
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:57,662
- Thank you. lt's nice to see you too.
- Likewise, l'm sure.

1167
01:24:58,171 --> 01:25:00,071
- Welcome home.
- Thank you. Hi, lda.

1168
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,834
- Well, long time no see.
- How are you?

1169
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,238
- How was Mexico?
- Crowded.

1170
01:25:04,411 --> 01:25:05,503
- How's business?
- Crowded.

1171
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,046
- You want your desk back?
- No, thanks. On you, it looks good.

1172
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:13,483
You know, l like Mexico.
lt's so Mexican. Thanks.

1173
01:25:13,654 --> 01:25:15,087
Here.

1174
01:25:16,857 --> 01:25:18,484
You're in great shape.

1175
01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:21,926
There's nothing
like a nice, long rest, is there?

1176
01:25:22,095 --> 01:25:24,825
- Got a drink handy?
- Yeah. l guess so.

1177
01:25:24,998 --> 01:25:28,525
Gene, crack open the safe
and get out some of that good bourbon.

1178
01:25:28,702 --> 01:25:32,035
- You never used to drink during the day.
- l never used to drink at all.

1179
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,299
- lt's a habit l picked up from men.
- Men.

1180
01:25:35,475 --> 01:25:38,740
l never yet met one who didn't
have the instincts of a heel.

1181
01:25:38,912 --> 01:25:41,710
Sometimes l wish l could
get along without them.

1182
01:25:41,882 --> 01:25:46,945
- You've never been married, have you?
- Men around me get allergic to wedding rings.

1183
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,112
You know, big-sister type.
''Good old lda...

1184
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:53,123
...you can talk it over
with her, man-to-man!''

1185
01:25:53,293 --> 01:25:55,887
l'm getting tired of men talking
to me ''man-to-man.''

1186
01:25:56,063 --> 01:25:59,396
- l'll have a drink myself.
- l'll take mine straight.

1187
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:02,592
Well, if you can take it, l can.

1188
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:09,272
- Seen anyone l know lately?
- You mean Veda.

1189
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:12,469
l wondered how long it would take you
to get to that.

1190
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,945
Yes, l mean Veda. Have you seen her?
ls she all right?

1191
01:26:16,116 --> 01:26:20,450
- Why don't you forget about her?
- l can't. l've tried, but l can't.

1192
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:23,214
Well, try, try again. That's my motto.

1193
01:26:23,657 --> 01:26:28,185
You don't know what it's like being
a mother, lda. Veda's a part of me.

1194
01:26:28,361 --> 01:26:31,626
Maybe she didn't turn out as well
as l hoped she would...

1195
01:26:31,798 --> 01:26:34,733
...but she's still my daughter,
and l can't forget that.

1196
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:40,533
l went away to try. l was so mixed-up,
l didn't know where l was or what l wanted.

1197
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:45,073
But now l know.
Now l'm sure of one thing at least.

1198
01:26:45,245 --> 01:26:47,338
l want my daughter back.

1199
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:51,143
Personally, Veda's convinced me
that alligators have the right idea.

1200
01:26:51,318 --> 01:26:54,116
They eat their young.

1201
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:59,320
l'm slightly drunk.

1202
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:01,188
- Hello?
- <i>Is Mildred there?</i>

1203
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,158
- Yes. Who is it?
- <i>This is Bert.</i>

1204
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:09,291
Hold on. lt's Bert. He's been calling
every day on the hour for a month.

1205
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:12,295
- Hello.
- <i>How are you? Just get in?</i>

1206
01:27:12,472 --> 01:27:14,804
l'm fine. l got back this morning.

1207
01:27:14,975 --> 01:27:15,964
- <i>How about dinner?</i>
- What?

1208
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:17,974
- <i>Dinner tomorrow?</i>
- Tomorrow night?

1209
01:27:18,145 --> 01:27:19,134
<i>Don't you want to?</i>

1210
01:27:19,312 --> 01:27:22,475
Of course, but what
about Mrs. Biederhof?

1211
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:24,549
- <i>She's married.</i>
- She is?

1212
01:27:24,718 --> 01:27:26,709
<i>Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.</i>

1213
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:30,323
Okay, you pick me up
at the house at 7:30. Goodbye.

1214
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,651
Somebody married Mrs. Biederhof.

1215
01:27:32,826 --> 01:27:37,456
Well, that's a novelty. Remind me
to bake a cake. How's Bert?

1216
01:27:37,631 --> 01:27:40,395
- He's fine. He's working now.
- No kidding.

1217
01:27:40,567 --> 01:27:45,561
- He has a job with Condor Aircraft.
- Manpower shortage must be pretty bad.

1218
01:27:45,739 --> 01:27:48,708
To the men we have loved.

1219
01:27:49,009 --> 01:27:50,806
The stinkers.

1220
01:27:58,185 --> 01:28:01,951
l never did like this place.
Does Wally still own it?

1221
01:28:02,122 --> 01:28:04,647
- Two rum Collins, please.
- Yes, sir.

1222
01:28:04,825 --> 01:28:10,024
- l don't know why you insisted on coming here.
- l thought it was a good idea. Now l'm not sure.

1223
01:28:44,731 --> 01:28:49,225
l am sorry l did it like this,
but l didn't know how to tell you.

1224
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:11,880
Mildred.

1225
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:19,255
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Mildred.

1226
01:29:19,432 --> 01:29:22,026
- Here to see me?
- l'm going to take Veda home.

1227
01:29:22,202 --> 01:29:26,332
- Veda know about that?
- No. l want you to help me, Wally.

1228
01:29:26,506 --> 01:29:29,634
Not me. She's your daughter.
l've never been a father.

1229
01:29:29,809 --> 01:29:34,508
Veda's been here for about a month,
and l know the best way to handle her.

1230
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:39,141
lf you want her to do anything for you,
just hit her on the head first.

1231
01:29:42,188 --> 01:29:45,521
l'm telling you. What could he say?
He was floored.

1232
01:29:45,692 --> 01:29:48,991
''Are you kidding?'' he says.
''No,'' l says.

1233
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:53,826
- The powder room's down the hall.
- lt's all right. She's my mother.

1234
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,369
- l didn't know you had a mother.
- Everybody has a mother.

1235
01:29:58,538 --> 01:30:00,699
Yeah. l guess you're right.

1236
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:04,366
- This is Miriam. She sings.
- That's what they tell me anyhow.

1237
01:30:04,544 --> 01:30:07,035
- l'm glad to know you.
- lt's mutual, l'm sure.

1238
01:30:07,213 --> 01:30:12,150
l guess this calls for a celebration.
Maybe l'd better send out for a beer.

1239
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,583
- None for me.
- What can l do for you?

1240
01:30:14,754 --> 01:30:17,018
- l want to talk to you.
- Go ahead.

1241
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,555
Well--

1242
01:30:18,725 --> 01:30:22,786
- Go see if Wally wants you.
- He won't.

1243
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:26,064
Pardon me, l'm sure.

1244
01:30:26,232 --> 01:30:28,894
Won't you sit down, Mother?

1245
01:30:30,837 --> 01:30:32,168
Well?

1246
01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:35,672
l want you to come home, Veda.
This isn't your kind of life.

1247
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:40,142
- No? What is my kind of life, Mother?
- Well, l don't know.

1248
01:30:40,313 --> 01:30:44,147
Whatever makes you happy, l guess.
That's all l've ever wanted for you.

1249
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:47,844
- Do you think l was happy in Glendale?
- Are you happy here?

1250
01:30:48,021 --> 01:30:52,048
When l first came here, l used to cry
occasionally. l've gotten over that.

1251
01:30:52,225 --> 01:30:55,251
- You're very fortunate.
- l know l've made you unhappy--

1252
01:30:55,428 --> 01:30:59,125
lt isn't easy for me to beg like this,
but won't you please come home?

1253
01:30:59,299 --> 01:31:04,134
No. You must think l'm on a string.
''Go away, Veda.'' ''Come back, Veda.''

1254
01:31:04,304 --> 01:31:07,273
lt isn't that easy. l'm free now.

1255
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:12,605
No one tells me what to do. l do
what l think best, and l like it that way.

1256
01:31:13,013 --> 01:31:18,451
l've had the house redecorated. All new
furniture. Even a new piano. You'd like it.

1257
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:20,779
You still don't understand, do you?

1258
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:24,412
You think new curtains
are enough to make me happy.

1259
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:26,252
l want more than that.

1260
01:31:26,426 --> 01:31:30,419
l want the kind of life Monte taught me,
and you won't give it to me.

1261
01:31:30,597 --> 01:31:34,556
l'm sorry for the trouble l've caused.
lf l went home, it would start again.

1262
01:31:34,734 --> 01:31:37,328
You know that. You know how l am.

1263
01:31:38,104 --> 01:31:41,835
The way you want to live
isn't good enough for me.

1264
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:45,034
lf l could give you the life
Monte taught you...

1265
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:47,475
...would you be willing
to come home then?

1266
01:31:47,647 --> 01:31:50,673
But you couldn't, could you, Mother?

1267
01:31:52,252 --> 01:31:56,518
You can powder your nose just so long.
Then people look at you funny.

1268
01:31:56,689 --> 01:31:58,589
- Your number's coming up.
- All right.

1269
01:31:58,758 --> 01:32:01,693
Sorry, Mother. l'm on next.
l have to change.

1270
01:32:04,397 --> 01:32:06,092
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

1271
01:32:06,266 --> 01:32:12,102
- When will l see you again, Veda?
- Just drop around. l'll be here. Bye.

1272
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:13,670
Goodbye.

1273
01:32:21,981 --> 01:32:25,041
So much for the upstairs.
lt's a little gloomy, isn't it?

1274
01:32:25,218 --> 01:32:29,279
Not quite so bad down here,
with the exception of the entrance hall.

1275
01:32:29,456 --> 01:32:33,893
As you can see, the pride of the
Beragons isn't rolling in wealth.

1276
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,324
- You're not exhausted?
- Not at all.

1277
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:41,126
- You can't be serious about buying it.
- You're not a very good salesman.

1278
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:44,270
No, l suppose l'm not.
ln here used to be a sitting room.

1279
01:32:44,437 --> 01:32:47,873
Still is. l do all my sitting here.
Becoming quite an expert at it.

1280
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:51,067
- Do you live here alone?
- There are complete living quarters.

1281
01:32:51,244 --> 01:32:54,008
Somebody has to be on the premises
to show the place.

1282
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,738
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes.

1283
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:58,475
- Can l fix you a drink?
- Please.

1284
01:32:58,885 --> 01:33:02,013
l have the heel of a bottle,
no ice or seltzer.

1285
01:33:02,188 --> 01:33:06,955
- Sorry l can't be more hospitable.
- That's all right. l prefer it straight.

1286
01:33:07,127 --> 01:33:10,722
- l beg your pardon?
- l said, l prefer it straight.

1287
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:14,022
- Say when.
- When.

1288
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:18,092
- What happened to your orange grove?
- Sold for taxes.

1289
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:21,672
- The beach house too?
- No, not the beach house.

1290
01:33:21,841 --> 01:33:25,208
An uncle with a little money
wouldn't let me sell it.

1291
01:33:25,378 --> 01:33:27,608
He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.

1292
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,078
Sounds like a nice uncle.

1293
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:34,343
Now, Mildred, what do you want?

1294
01:33:34,654 --> 01:33:36,815
- Well, l don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

1295
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:40,015
You don't really want to buy
this antiquated tomb.

1296
01:33:40,193 --> 01:33:41,990
You'd be out of your mind.

1297
01:33:42,362 --> 01:33:47,231
l don't know. lt isn't such a bad
house. Remodeling would do wonders.

1298
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,234
Take off some of that gingerbread
and redecorate the inside and--

1299
01:33:52,839 --> 01:33:55,774
My businesslike air
isn't fooling you much, is it?

1300
01:33:55,942 --> 01:34:01,312
No, l remember too well. l remember
how it was with us once, and so do you.

1301
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:03,711
lt isn't something either of us
can forget.

1302
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:06,511
- You haven't forgotten?
- Not for an hour.

1303
01:34:06,686 --> 01:34:10,850
- Even this doesn't help.
- Then you can do me a great kindness.

1304
01:34:11,024 --> 01:34:14,790
- lf l can.
- Ask me to marry you.

1305
01:34:16,763 --> 01:34:18,230
Why?

1306
01:34:19,032 --> 01:34:22,695
l must say, your attitude isn't
exactly enthusiastic.

1307
01:34:22,869 --> 01:34:25,736
You went to considerable trouble
to get rid of me once...

1308
01:34:25,905 --> 01:34:31,172
...so naturally, l'm startled by your proposal
of marriage. This is a little sudden.

1309
01:34:31,444 --> 01:34:34,208
l have my own reason
for wanting to marry you.

1310
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,678
- A reason named Veda.
- Why should it be?

1311
01:34:36,849 --> 01:34:40,808
Because your reason for doing anything
is usually Veda.

1312
01:34:40,987 --> 01:34:45,356
Well, whether it is or isn't,
what's your answer?

1313
01:34:45,525 --> 01:34:48,983
l can't afford you.
You have money, and l haven't.

1314
01:34:49,162 --> 01:34:52,996
All l have is pride and a name,
and l can't sell either.

1315
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,600
- l see.
- l'm not enjoying this.

1316
01:34:55,768 --> 01:34:59,067
Things are very different now
from the way they were.

1317
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:03,437
- l know. l haven't forgotten.
- Neither have l.

1318
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:06,170
l want you to love me again
the way you did then.

1319
01:35:06,346 --> 01:35:08,507
l need that more than anything else.

1320
01:35:08,681 --> 01:35:12,674
l told you then you were
the only woman in the world for me.

1321
01:35:12,852 --> 01:35:15,616
- l loved you then, and l love you now.
- Then why--?

1322
01:35:15,788 --> 01:35:20,191
l can't marry you. l won't go on
taking tips from you as l used to.

1323
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:23,521
Of course, if l owned a share
in your business--

1324
01:35:24,564 --> 01:35:28,762
l see. l think l understand now.

1325
01:35:30,069 --> 01:35:32,333
How much of a share
would your pride require?

1326
01:35:32,505 --> 01:35:35,338
Don't put it that way.
lt hurts me to do this.

1327
01:35:35,508 --> 01:35:38,102
- l'm doing it--
- How much of a share?

1328
01:35:39,112 --> 01:35:40,477
One-third.

1329
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:44,473
All right.

1330
01:35:45,251 --> 01:35:46,513
Sold.

1331
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:49,287
One Beragon.

1332
01:36:05,905 --> 01:36:08,032
- Hello, Lottie.
- Why, Mr. Pierce.

1333
01:36:08,207 --> 01:36:10,767
ls Mrs. Pierce--?
Mrs. Beragon, is she in?

1334
01:36:10,943 --> 01:36:15,039
She's in there.
l mean, this way, please.

1335
01:36:15,214 --> 01:36:18,342
- Thank you.
- lt's nice to see you again.

1336
01:36:18,518 --> 01:36:23,319
- lt's nice to see you, Lottie.
- lt's been such a long time. Follow me.

1337
01:36:23,489 --> 01:36:28,552
No, no, no. l'm supposed to announce
everybody. You stay there. Pardon, please.

1338
01:36:28,728 --> 01:36:30,195
Please pardon.

1339
01:36:33,733 --> 01:36:36,258
Mr. Albert Pierce!

1340
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:41,937
- Lottie, not so loud.
- No?

1341
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:44,668
Hello, Bert. lt's nice to see you.

1342
01:36:44,844 --> 01:36:48,336
Thanks. l thought l'd drop in.
l hope you don't mind.

1343
01:36:48,514 --> 01:36:51,074
Of course not. Come in, sit down.

1344
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,683
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

1345
01:36:52,852 --> 01:36:56,344
- My hours are too long these days.
- Let's sit over here.

1346
01:36:56,522 --> 01:36:59,958
- This is quite a nifty place.
- We just finished redecorating.

1347
01:37:00,126 --> 01:37:03,027
- You didn't come to the wedding.
- l read about it.

1348
01:37:03,196 --> 01:37:06,597
lt was informal.
Just Monte's family and friends.

1349
01:37:06,933 --> 01:37:12,701
l probably have a lot of nerve to ask
this, but do you really love this guy?

1350
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:16,467
- l married him, didn't l?
- That doesn't answer my question.

1351
01:37:16,642 --> 01:37:19,839
- Monte's okay.
- That still doesn't answer me.

1352
01:37:20,012 --> 01:37:22,242
Are you in love with this guy?

1353
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:25,516
No, Bert.

1354
01:37:26,686 --> 01:37:31,749
l'm not exactly in love with him.
But Monte and l understand each other.

1355
01:37:31,924 --> 01:37:36,554
l thought if l moved from that
other house and fixed this place up...

1356
01:37:36,729 --> 01:37:39,323
- ...l thought, maybe--
- Veda would come back.

1357
01:37:39,999 --> 01:37:42,058
l thought that was why.

1358
01:37:42,468 --> 01:37:46,131
l know you think l'm a fool, Bert.
But l can't help it.

1359
01:37:46,305 --> 01:37:51,402
l'd do anything to get her back. l couldn't
leave her where she was, could l?

1360
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:53,545
No, l guess not.

1361
01:37:53,813 --> 01:37:56,509
Anyhow, that's all l wanted to know.

1362
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:59,476
l guess we'll always fight about her.

1363
01:38:00,753 --> 01:38:03,551
Mildred,
l brought you a wedding present.

1364
01:38:03,856 --> 01:38:05,289
A wedding present?

1365
01:38:05,892 --> 01:38:08,019
Take a look out that window.

1366
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:28,706
- Bert! Did you ask her to come?
- No. She called me up.

1367
01:38:28,881 --> 01:38:32,612
She pretended it was something
else. But l got the truth out of her.

1368
01:38:32,785 --> 01:38:35,083
She wanted to come home, Mildred.

1369
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:37,886
Tell her to come in.

1370
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:05,611
Veda.

1371
01:39:17,964 --> 01:39:20,728
l wanted to come home weeks ago.

1372
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:23,767
When it was Christmas,
l couldn't stay away.

1373
01:39:23,936 --> 01:39:28,396
- l'm so glad, darling.
- l'll change, Mother. l promise.

1374
01:39:28,574 --> 01:39:34,274
- l'll never say mean things to you again.
- l said mean things too.

1375
01:39:36,582 --> 01:39:39,574
- Mother, this is a beautiful place.
- Bert.

1376
01:39:39,752 --> 01:39:42,243
l forgot to thank your father.

1377
01:39:44,423 --> 01:39:47,881
- Bert, l'm very grateful.
- That's all right, Mildred.

1378
01:39:48,394 --> 01:39:51,830
l don't believe it.
l simply don't believe it.

1379
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:56,292
The prodigal returneth.
We'll have the fatted calf for dinner.

1380
01:39:56,469 --> 01:40:00,599
- Hello, Monte!
- Hey. Tears of joy at seeing me again?

1381
01:40:00,773 --> 01:40:03,333
- Of course.
- You look lovely, prodigal.

1382
01:40:03,509 --> 01:40:06,103
lt's about time you came to see us.

1383
01:40:06,712 --> 01:40:09,943
Veda's come home.
She's going to stay with us.

1384
01:40:10,116 --> 01:40:12,812
- lf Monte doesn't mind.
- l think it's wonderful.

1385
01:40:12,985 --> 01:40:14,976
Just don't call me ''Father.''

1386
01:40:16,389 --> 01:40:18,857
- Blow, darling, come on.
- Make a wish.

1387
01:40:19,025 --> 01:40:22,188
- Make a wish first.
- You can do better than that.

1388
01:40:22,361 --> 01:40:25,228
Three is all you get.
Three is all you get.

1389
01:40:26,966 --> 01:40:28,797
Happy birthday, Veda.

1390
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:38,103
Be careful how you pour
that champagne. That's from 1 927.

1391
01:40:38,277 --> 01:40:42,077
- ls that better than '28?
- lt's the newest we could get.

1392
01:40:42,248 --> 01:40:46,412
lsn't this a beautiful night?
l just love parties, don't you?

1393
01:40:46,586 --> 01:40:49,783
- l beg your pardon?
- Thank you kindly.

1394
01:40:53,526 --> 01:40:59,988
Yes? Hello. This is the Beragon
residence. Who shall l say is calling?

1395
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:03,465
Yes, yes, Miss Mildred. l'll call her.

1396
01:41:04,637 --> 01:41:07,231
Business is business, Mr. Jones.

1397
01:41:07,406 --> 01:41:10,864
- Just take a look at this receipt.
- Hello, lda. This is Mildred.

1398
01:41:11,043 --> 01:41:14,012
- How's the party?
- Fine. Veda just cut the cake.

1399
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:18,207
- Get your clients to agree to more time.
- Out of the question.

1400
01:41:18,384 --> 01:41:20,375
l'll be delayed a little.

1401
01:41:20,553 --> 01:41:24,148
What's going on? Are you in trouble?
You sound so funny.

1402
01:41:24,323 --> 01:41:28,453
No, l'll tell you about it later.
Keep the party going, will you?

1403
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:31,494
Okay, Mildred.
Get here as soon as you can.

1404
01:41:31,664 --> 01:41:34,531
- Was that Mother?
- Yes. She's at the office.

1405
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:38,295
l'm worried. l think
she's in some sort of business trouble.

1406
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:40,769
lt happens in the best of families.

1407
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:43,773
You've got canary feathers
all over your face.

1408
01:41:43,943 --> 01:41:48,141
Business and money is all she
thinks about. How about that drink?

1409
01:41:48,314 --> 01:41:51,112
- Beauty calls. Excuse us.
- lt's a pleasure.

1410
01:41:51,283 --> 01:41:53,547
My clients demand an accounting.

1411
01:41:53,719 --> 01:41:57,883
You must satisfy your creditors
or show cause why Mildred's lnc...

1412
01:41:58,057 --> 01:42:00,116
...should not be taken away from you.

1413
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:04,991
lf you resist, your creditors force you
into bankruptcy. lt's as simple as that.

1414
01:42:05,164 --> 01:42:06,654
Can they do it?

1415
01:42:07,133 --> 01:42:11,365
- l'm sorry, Mrs. Beragon.
- Yes, so am l.

1416
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:16,674
l haven't a cent of ready cash in any
of the restaurants. So that's that.

1417
01:42:16,842 --> 01:42:20,539
l hoped you'd scrape up enough dough
to get yourself out of this.

1418
01:42:20,713 --> 01:42:23,511
- You can still manage the business.
- That's very nice.

1419
01:42:23,683 --> 01:42:26,516
Stealing the business from me
and then letting me run it.

1420
01:42:26,686 --> 01:42:29,314
l'm not enjoying this.
l haven't any choice.

1421
01:42:29,488 --> 01:42:33,083
You've bled this business to live
the way you have since Veda came home.

1422
01:42:33,259 --> 01:42:34,556
- l know.
- Okay.

1423
01:42:34,727 --> 01:42:37,662
You let a few bills go by.
Pretty soon you're in trouble.

1424
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:40,663
The creditors want your hide.
l can't stop them.

1425
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:44,894
- Another month like this, and we're all out.
- As it is, only l am, right?

1426
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:48,768
lt looks that way. You'd be all right
if Monte hadn't forced it.

1427
01:42:48,941 --> 01:42:51,136
Monte? What's he got to do with this?

1428
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:56,714
This was his idea. He wants to sell his share.
l gotta go along or l'm out. Didn't you know?

1429
01:42:57,983 --> 01:42:59,245
No.

1430
01:43:00,553 --> 01:43:04,250
- You married him. l didn't.
- Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

1431
01:43:07,693 --> 01:43:12,027
l'm sorry this happened. lf
l do say it, as perhaps l shouldn't....

1432
01:43:12,198 --> 01:43:18,660
l think Mr. Beragon acted badly.
Very badly indeed. Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

1433
01:43:18,838 --> 01:43:20,601
Good night, Jones.

1434
01:43:38,257 --> 01:43:40,817
Hello, lda.
l want to speak with Monte.

1435
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,754
He isn't here. He drove off 20 minutes
ago, just after the party broke up.

1436
01:43:47,066 --> 01:43:48,499
l see.

1437
01:43:50,035 --> 01:43:51,866
<i>Mildred! Mildred!</i>

1438
01:44:17,696 --> 01:44:21,598
l went to the house.
Monte was alone. And l killed him.

1439
01:44:21,767 --> 01:44:25,567
You're lying. We know you weren't
alone in the house with him.

1440
01:44:25,738 --> 01:44:29,640
We have proof of that.
And various other things.

1441
01:44:30,376 --> 01:44:32,571
Okay, now. Yes.

1442
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:37,575
We've had a slant on you from
the beginning. You were the key.

1443
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:41,982
We had to put the pressure on you.
The key turned. The door opened.

1444
01:44:42,154 --> 01:44:44,645
And there was the murderer.

1445
01:44:46,525 --> 01:44:51,929
We picked her up at the airport, off
a plane for Arizona. She didn't like it much.

1446
01:44:52,097 --> 01:44:54,793
- l don't understand.
- You will. We know all about it.

1447
01:44:54,967 --> 01:44:58,095
Your mother told us everything.
Why did you kill him?

1448
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,898
You promised not to tell.
You said you'd help me.

1449
01:45:01,073 --> 01:45:04,873
- Don't say anything more!
- Too late. That's all we needed.

1450
01:45:05,044 --> 01:45:10,346
You left at 1 1 :1 5 with Beragon.
Your mother left her office at 1 1 :45.

1451
01:45:10,516 --> 01:45:13,713
You were at the beach house
when she got there after midnight.

1452
01:45:13,886 --> 01:45:16,150
lsn't that right, Mrs. Beragon?

1453
01:45:20,926 --> 01:45:22,257
Yes.

1454
01:45:23,662 --> 01:45:26,756
l didn't know Veda was there
when l came in.

1455
01:45:27,933 --> 01:45:30,424
<i>I expected Monte to be alone.</i>

1456
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:06,435
We weren't expecting you, Mildred,
obviously.

1457
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:09,300
lt's just as well you know.

1458
01:46:10,376 --> 01:46:12,469
l'm glad you know.

1459
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:15,770
How long has this been going on?

1460
01:46:15,948 --> 01:46:21,716
Since l came home and even before.
He never loved you. lt's always been me.

1461
01:46:21,887 --> 01:46:26,620
l've got what l wanted. Monte's going
to divorce you and marry me.

1462
01:46:26,992 --> 01:46:28,755
No, Veda!

1463
01:46:29,528 --> 01:46:32,088
There's nothing you can do about it.

1464
01:46:39,305 --> 01:46:40,704
Mildred!

1465
01:46:42,141 --> 01:46:45,406
Use your head.
This won't solve anything.

1466
01:46:56,722 --> 01:46:59,953
Just where did you get the idea
l'm going to marry you?

1467
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:02,116
- Don't joke like that.
- l'm not joking.

1468
01:47:02,294 --> 01:47:04,956
lf you think l'm going to marry you,
you're mistaken.

1469
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:10,391
You told me over and over again
that you loved me.

1470
01:47:10,569 --> 01:47:13,060
- Did l? Then l must have been drinking.
- Listen.

1471
01:47:13,238 --> 01:47:16,332
You don't think l could love
a rotten tramp like you, do you?

1472
01:47:42,234 --> 01:47:43,496
Mildred!

1473
01:47:48,474 --> 01:47:50,169
Veda. What's happened?

1474
01:47:50,909 --> 01:47:54,709
lt's Monte. He's dead.

1475
01:47:59,518 --> 01:48:03,454
He said horrible things.
He didn't want me around anymore.

1476
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:09,117
He told me to get out. Then he laughed
at me. He wouldn't stop laughing.

1477
01:48:09,294 --> 01:48:13,890
l told him l'd kill him.
He said l didn't have guts enough.

1478
01:48:14,066 --> 01:48:17,593
l didn't mean to do it.
l didn't mean to, l tell you.

1479
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:21,604
But the gun kept going off
over and over again.

1480
01:48:21,774 --> 01:48:27,735
Then he was lying there.
Looking at me, just looking at me.

1481
01:48:27,913 --> 01:48:32,009
You've got to help me.
Give me money to get away. And time.

1482
01:48:32,184 --> 01:48:35,278
l've got to get away
before they find him.

1483
01:48:36,355 --> 01:48:39,256
l can't get you out of this, Veda.

1484
01:48:40,659 --> 01:48:44,186
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

1485
01:48:46,465 --> 01:48:48,763
- <i>Number, please.</i>
- Give me the police.

1486
01:48:48,934 --> 01:48:53,337
No. No, Mother. Think what
will happen if they find me.

1487
01:48:53,505 --> 01:48:56,668
- Think what will happen.
- l don't care anymore.

1488
01:48:56,842 --> 01:49:00,437
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
Give me another chance.

1489
01:49:00,612 --> 01:49:03,206
lt's your fault as much as mine.

1490
01:49:04,216 --> 01:49:07,583
- <i>Santa Monica Police. O'Grady speaking.</i>
- Help me, Mother.

1491
01:49:07,753 --> 01:49:09,243
- Just this once!
- <i>Hello?</i>

1492
01:49:09,421 --> 01:49:12,390
- l'll change. l promise l will.
- <i>Hello?</i>

1493
01:49:12,558 --> 01:49:16,358
Give me another chance.
lt's your fault l'm the way l am!

1494
01:49:16,528 --> 01:49:19,463
- <i>Santa Monica Police Department.</i>
- Help me.

1495
01:49:19,631 --> 01:49:20,893
<i>Hello?</i>

1496
01:49:29,942 --> 01:49:35,574
l thought maybe, in a way, it was
my fault. So l tried to help her.

1497
01:49:35,747 --> 01:49:40,081
- l wanted to take the blame for it.
- Not this time, Mrs. Beragon.

1498
01:49:40,252 --> 01:49:43,619
This time your daughter pays
for her own mistake.

1499
01:49:43,789 --> 01:49:45,279
Okay, book her.

1500
01:49:49,294 --> 01:49:53,196
Darling, l'm sorry.
l did the best l could.

1501
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:57,158
Don't worry about me, Mother.
l'll get by.

1502
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:01,230
See that those others are released.

1503
01:50:04,676 --> 01:50:06,268
We need some fresh air.

1504
01:50:09,715 --> 01:50:11,945
lt looks like a nice morning.

1505
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:15,687
You can go now.
We'll call you when we want you.

1506
01:50:15,854 --> 01:50:20,814
You know, Mrs. Beragon, there are
times when l regret being a policeman.

1507
01:50:46,485 --> 01:50:47,474
