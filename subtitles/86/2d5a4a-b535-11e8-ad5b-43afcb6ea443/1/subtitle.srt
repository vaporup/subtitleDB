00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,749
<i>and centrifugal force at 3Gs.</i>

10
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,999
<i>Watch, as they
ride their motorcycles</i>

11
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,041

00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,749

<i>Here we go, folks.</i>

00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,583
<i>Come on, give them a hand.</i>

00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,916
<i>There they are.
Come on, get 'em goin'.</i>

18
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,583
<i>They're working hard for you.</i>

19
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,333
<i>We know him as Handsome Luke.</i>

20
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,333
<i>There they go, warming 'em up.</i>

21
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,957
<i>Let's hear it. Come on, give them a hand.
Handsome Luke!</i>

22
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,582
Okay. I gotta go.

23
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,749
Hey.

24
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,083
Do you remember my name?

25
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,540
Romina.
I like to call you Ro.

26
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,083
What are you doing now?
You got plans?

27
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,083
I gotta go home.

28
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,249
Want me to give you a ride?

29
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,916
Thanks.

30
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,083
You don't wanna
talk or anything?

31
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,374
You know, I leave town
tomorrow after we pack up.

32
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,916
I'm not gonna be
around for another year.

33
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,540
Another year?

34
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:40,291
Yeah, you wanna get
a beer or something?

35
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,582
I got someone, so no.

36
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,249
Just wanted to see you again.

37
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,999
Thanks.

38
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:30,208
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

39
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,749
<i>introducing the one, the only,</i>

40
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,374

41

<i>and the Heartthrobs.</i>

42
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,166
Hey.

43
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,166
Is Romina here?

44
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:00,290
No. Hold on.

45
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,791
She's working.

46
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:10,165
Okay. Do you remember me?

47
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:13,999
Yes, I remember you.

48
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,041
Who's that guy?

49
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:25,666
He's yours.

50
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
You wanna hold him?

51
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,415
There you go.

52
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,082
His name's Jason.

53
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,999
Hey. There you go.

54
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,332
Thanks.

55
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,874
Good? Great.

56
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,666
Hey.
What are you doing here?

57
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:42,040
Anything you wanna tell me?

58
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,374
Anything you think I might
wanna know before I leave here

59
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,207
forever and I never come back?

60
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,832
Let's go outside. Come on.

61
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:11,332
You weren't gonna tell me?

62
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:14,374
It was just a fling, right?

63
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,332
That means you
don't gotta tell me?

64
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,540
Just as, like,
a common courtesy or...

65
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:31,499
There might even be
a law, you know,

66
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:33,707
you gotta fucking
tell somebody.

67
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,998
I haven't heard
from you in over a year.

68
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:40,707
You just took off.
Never called me.

69
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:49,374
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.

70
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,248
You do whatever you need to do.

71
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:57,082
What are you gonna do?

72
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:01,499
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

73
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,374
I'm going to school.

74
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,415
I take care of Jason.
I work here.

75
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,082
And I have a man.

76
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,998
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.

77
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,374
You're busy.

78
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,749
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm real busy.

79
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,207
Well...

80
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,415
I don't wanna keep you.

81
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:32,915
Okay.

82
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:34,540
All right.

83
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:57,624
<i>When does this pay
period end, Jack? On Friday?</i>

84
00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,248
Why?

85
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:00,831
Because I gotta get paid.

86
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,998
Just pay me for
half the week, all right?

87
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,332
I don't give advances out.

88
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,749
I'm not asking
for an advance, Jack.

89
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,248
I'm quitting.

90
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:13,165
You can't quit.
I just did.

91
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,540
Hey.
Hey.

92
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:36,831
Wow. You look
like a princess.

93
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:41,582
What are you still doing here?

94
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:45,082
I stuck around.

95
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,406
This is really not a good time.

96
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:47,831
No?
No.

97
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,998
I was just gonna
take him to the park

98
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:53,165
or maybe see if I could just sit
on the porch, just say hi to him.

99
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,831
We're on our way to church.

100
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:56,374
Going to church?

101
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,207
Um...

102
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:00,915
This is Kofi.

103
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,582
- We need to go.
- Yeah.

104
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,915
You should call. You can't
just show up, you know?

105
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,873
- You ready?
- Yeah.

106
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,165
Okay.

107
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,748
- Hey.
- Hi.

108
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,831
You live here?

109
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:19,873
Yup. This is my house.

110
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:22,915
How long you in town?

111
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,332
I'm gonna stick around.

112
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,374
What are you looking at?

113
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,748
Really, you gonna
do this shit today?

114
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:40,706
Do what?

115
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,415
<i>Is it your will that
Jason should be baptized</i>

116
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,915
<i>in the faith of the Church,</i>

117
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
<i>- which we all have professed with you?
- Yes.</i>

118
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:03,831
By God's gift, through
water and the Holy Spirit,

119
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:07,248
we are reborn into
everlasting life.

120
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:11,165
In His goodness, may He continue
to pour out His blessings

121
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:13,207
upon these sons
and daughters of His.

122
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:17,706
May He make them faithful
members of His holy people.

123
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:25,248
Jason, I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

124
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:28,706
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

125
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:33,831
This child of yours has
been enlightened by Christ.

126
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,873
He is to walk always
as a child of the light.

127
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:40,831
God, the father of our Lord, Jesus
Christ, has freed you from sin.

128
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,415
We now anoint you
with the Chrism of Salvation

129
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,831
as Christ was anointed
priest, prophet and king.

130
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:49,748
So may you always live
as a member of His body,

131
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:52,581
sharing everlasting life.
Amen.

132
00:14:56,706 --> 00:15:00,665
In the name of this child and the
spirit of our common friendship,

133
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:04,415
let us pray together in the
words our Lord has given us.

134
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:09,332
Our Father who art
in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

135
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,332
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

136
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,831
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

137
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,415
Give us this day
our daily bread

138
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:19,748
and forgive us our trespasses

139
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,998
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

140
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:27,998
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

141
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,665
The Almighty God,
the Father, the Son

142
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:35,706
and the Holy Spirit
bless you. Amen.

143
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:38,998
Now, as we receive
our new member

144
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:43,998
into our parish, let us all
welcome him with great joy.

145
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:25,915
Ride that thing really good!
Really good!

146
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,082
You ride good, man.

147
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:44,873
Would you like a ride into town?
Save you some gas, man.

148
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,915
Just passing through?

149
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,748
I'm just settling in.

150
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,581
Where you staying?
Some fucking motel.

151
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,748
Yeah. They are
no good around here.

152
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:06,998
Whole town's gone to shit, man.

153
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:09,082
So you got a job?

154
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:10,998
No.

155
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,998
You know your way
around an engine?

156
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:15,498
Yeah.

157
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:20,247
'Cause I got a shop,
repair shop, on Washout Road.

158
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:21,956
You should come
check it out, man.

159
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,498
I could always
use a good worker.

160
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,414
All right.

161
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:28,790
It ain't much.

162
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,247
It's what it is,
you know, but it's mine.

163
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,748
No one can kick me out of it.

164
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,831
So,
that's the workshop in there.

165
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,040
This is Tula.

166
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,414
I don't get a whole lot
of work here, you know?

167
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:49,748
But if you want, you can look for
other jobs or whatever, you know.

168
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,498
If it's not enough for you.

169
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:54,998
I do everything.

170
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,082
Everything there is to do
to a car, I know how to do.

171
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,082
Anything you don't know,
I can teach you, you know?

172
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:05,748
And I got a trailer down here.
Stay there if you want.

173
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,456
Yeah, see? She's shy.

174
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,706
She can't see so good anymore.

175
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,414
Where is it?
Where's the ball?

176
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,247
There's the trailer.

177
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,956
She get it? No, she ain't
gonna get it, man.

178
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,748
You live out here all alone?
Yeah, I live alone.

179
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:33,040
Sometimes people come
stay for a while, you know.

180
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:37,164
That's it. It's not
much, but, you know,

181
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:40,247
it's got whatever
you need in there.

182
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,873
It must get lonely.

183
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,464
<i>Look, Rob,
I don't wanna be ungrateful.</i>

184
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,373
<i>I really appreciate what
you're doing for me and shit,</i>

185
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:21,331
<i>but I gotta make
more fucking money.</i>

186
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,831
<i>Hey, man, if I could
pay you more, I would.</i>

187
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:27,831
<i>You know, you're good at what you do, man.
Really good.</i>

188
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,806
<i>I could fix up
that ol' Mack truck</i>

189
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,665
that's sitting there like a goddamn...
Well, that's good.

190
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:33,986
You can go ahead and fix it up,

191
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,081
but I don't have
the money to pay you.

192
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,081
You know, there are other things
that could be done, you know.

193
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,997
Like what?

194
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,498
Well, you could rob a bank.

195
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,748
You're full of shit.
I'm not full of shit.

196
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,748
I've done it four times myself.

197
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,122
I stopped 12 years ago because
it was getting too hot.

198
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:02,081
As long as you don't do it
too many times, you're fine.

199
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:06,331
You got a kid, you wanna
provide for that kid?

200
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:10,081
You wanna maybe edge out
your competition?

201
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,289
You gotta do that
using your skill set,

202
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,706
and your skill set...

203
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,081
Very unique.

204
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,623
What do you say?

205
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,539
Go fuck yourself.
Okay.

206
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:32,081
Well, good luck supporting
your family on minimum wage.

207
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,706
<i>He's my son
and I should be around him.</i>

208
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,997
<i>I wasn't around my dad, look at
the fucking way I turned out.</i>

209
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,498
Look, I wanna take care of you.

210
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:51,331
I wanna take care of my son.
That's my job.

211
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:54,831
Let me do my job. How are
you gonna take care of us?

212
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,498
Don't say it like that.

213
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:01,790
But how are you gonna take care of me?
Don't...

214
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:10,955
Don't talk down to me.

215
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,498
It's a question. I'm not
talking down to you.

216
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,623
It's just a question.
I will find a way to do it.

217
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:23,247
You want a house,
I'll get you a house.

218
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:27,331
You wanna get the fuck out of
here, we'll get out of here.

219
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:31,665
I got that trailer. I'll get
a truck, we'll hit the road.

220
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,997
You pick a place
you like, we'll stop.

221
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,914
You don't wanna be there?
"Fuck you," we're outta there.

222
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,373
What about my mom?
She can come.

223
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,706
And what about Kofi?
He can stay.

224
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:50,414
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.

225
00:22:57,914 --> 00:23:00,706
That sounds like a nice dream.
Ro...

226
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,955
You can, uh, use this.
If you wanna.

227
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,039
But keep in mind, man,
I did four banks with a note.

228
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,830
In other words,
you don't need the gun.

229
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:49,498
I never liked guns, man.
They're vulgar, you know.

230
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,206
But you may wanna take it. I don't know.
Whatever you wanna do.

231
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,789
How do we do it?

232
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:57,414
Okay. First thing is, we're gonna
go in there nice and early.

233
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,164
<i>Just when the doors open, okay?</i>

234
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:00,965
<i>You're gonna take
a look at all the tellers.</i>

235
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:04,414
<i>Go for the oldest
woman you can, right?</i>

236
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,747
<i>Failing that,
go to the most meek.</i>

237
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,955
You get her to put the money
out on the table. Why?

238
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:13,122
So, that way, you can see
if there's a dye pack.

239
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,830
You put it in your pocket. You
don't hand anything over to them.

240
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,498
You don't show them the gun.

241
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,997
<i>And you go.</i>

242
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,539
<i>Get on your bike. I'll be
about four blocks away.</i>

243
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:27,373
<i>Ride it into the truck. Bam, we're
home, we're done, we're rich.</i>

244
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,830
<i>What happens if you get stopped</i>

245
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:35,914
<i>sitting by the side of the
road with an open cube truck?</i>

246
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,289
What are you gonna say?

247
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:39,498
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?
I'm an officer.

248
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,498
"Excuse me, sir, what are you
doing with an open cube truck?"

249
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,539
"What are you doing? Why are
you sitting here like this?"

250
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:47,206
Oh, I'm broken down. I'm waiting
for the, you know, repairs.

251
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,664
Thank you for asking, Officer.

252
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:52,164
That's a nice touch.
Right?

253
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,885
What are you gonna do
if you get jock itch

254
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,705
and, you know, you're riding 90
miles an hour down the street?

255
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,705
You're gonna
keep riding, right?

256
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,206
Yeah? I mean,
we do what we do.

257
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,664
But when we do it together...

258
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:06,622
Shazam.

259
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,997
I'm just sayin'.

260
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:11,952
Not since Hall and Oates
has there been such a team.

261
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,164
Which one are you?
Oh, I know.

262
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,289
So I gotta be the dark,
curly-haired guy?

263
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,331
You gotta be the good-looking one?
I guess that's about right.

264
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:23,705
<i>This is gonna be good, man.
You're gonna like doing this.</i>

265
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,997
<i>It's the biggest
rush of your life.</i>

266
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:49,664
Oh!

267
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,206
All right!
Everybody who wants to live,

268
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,039
put your hands
in the fucking air!

269
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,331
Get over here!

270
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:00,206
Get over here now!

271
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:04,039
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!

272
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:06,664
All right.
What's your name?

273
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:09,331
Max.
Max is my little fucking dog.

274
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,997
Everybody get your fucking
money and he's gonna go fetch.

275
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,839
Get it out and put it
on the table right now!

276
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:16,206
Get it out! Pray!

277
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:19,914
Pray! Let me hear
you fucking pray!

278
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:24,497
Got that money out, boy?
Go fucking fetch. Fast!

279
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,830
Get it out.
Put it in that bag.

280
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,372
They're not turning!

281
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:05,413
How much d'you get?

282
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:14,205
On, baby.

283
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:18,081
Oh! Beautiful
fucking baby boy!

284
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:23,081
Are you okay, man?
You good?

285
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,747
You did it, man!
You did it!

286
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,622
Yes!

287
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:35,747
God damn it, we fucking did it!

288
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,497
We fucking did it!

289
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:57,497
Yeah!

290
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:00,705
Yeah!

291
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,789
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

292
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,955
<i>What's he like to eat?</i>

293
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:42,580
He, like, really likes apples.

294
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:44,955
But I have to kind of
chew it up for him.

295
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:47,622
You chew up his apples?
Yeah.

296
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,163
It sounds gross, but it's
not when I'm doing it.

297
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,789
Has he ever had ice cream?

298
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,246
Not yet.

299
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,789
You're fucking kidding me.

300
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:11,413
He's still a baby.

301
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:12,996
Bullshit.

302
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,038
What kind of house
are you running?

303
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:17,080
No ice cream?

304
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,497
Why can't he have that?

305
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:24,830
It's not like he can't have
it, he just hasn't had it.

306
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,705
Can I give it to him?

307
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,830
You wanna give him ice cream?
Yeah.

308
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:33,246
I wanna do something with him
that's his first time.

309
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:37,081
I wanna look in his face
when he tries ice cream.

310
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,199
Every time he has ice cream
for the rest of his life,

311
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:41,580
he's gonna see my fucking face.

312
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:50,580
Yeah.

313
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,789
Okay, come on. Come on.
No, he's funny.

314
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:01,622
Come on.

315
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:18,913
Wanna hear it on?

316
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,747
Oh!

317
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,455
I'm sorry.

318
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,996
Here. It's okay.

319
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,497
He cries a lot.
I'm sorry.

320
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,830
Oh, so you want
the bike in it, too?

321
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:42,372
Yeah, just all... You know, so that...
Just capture the mood.

322
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,830
It's a nice bike.

323
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:47,205
The bike's part of the family.

324
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,121
You want another one?

325
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,913
You sure I should take
it when she's crying?

326
00:32:58,246 --> 00:32:59,664
Okay.

327
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:03,789
That's a good trick.

328
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Shh!

329
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:13,788
Five, six, seven... Put that
fucking money on the counter.

330
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,788
Give me the real stuff. Don't
give me the fucking fake stuff.

331
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:18,829
- I know what it is.
- Ten, 11, 12.

332
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:23,205
Let me see you...
Come here. Come here.

333
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:43,538
<i>- Hola, Mami.
- Hola.</i>

334
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,664
What is this?

335
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,996
What is...

336
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,996
What is this?
It's presents.

337
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:10,455
Oh, my God. What is that?
It's a crib.

338
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:13,580
Easy, easy, easy.

339
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:17,538
Hey, boss, you gotta stay...
You're gonna fall off this bed.

340
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,413
There you go.

341
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:39,246
Your mom's home.

342
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,080
<i>Hi, Mami.
Think she's gonna be mad?</i>

343
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:56,121
Hey.
Hey.

344
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:58,080
What are you doing?

345
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,954
I got him a crib and some toys.

346
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:05,871
You know,
this is really nice and all,

347
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:07,788
but you gotta
get this outta here.

348
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:11,205
- You can't just show up like this.
- Why?

349
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,788
'Cause this is
Kofi's fucking house.

350
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:15,372
What?
Just get it out, please.

351
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,038
He can't be sleeping in a bed.

352
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,829
He's gonna roll out and bust his head open.
He needs a crib.

353
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,580
What's going on?

354
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,996
You okay with this?

355
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:31,704
I'm talking to you. You okay with this?
Kofi, it's his father.

356
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:34,829
In our house? You okay
with him in our house?

357
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,871
What are you doing here, man? Shh-shh.
You're making him cry.

358
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:40,829
Don't shush me.
You in my house, man.

359
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,455
You need to pack all this shit
up and get out the house, man.

360
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,871
I don't know who you think you
are, just coming up in our life

361
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,996
and changing shit around,
but this ain't gonna work.

362
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,205
You gotta lower your voice, man.
Excuse me?

363
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,413
Lower your voice. Romina, can
you step outside, please?

364
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,996
Pack all this shit up
and take it out, man.

365
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:01,413
You're making the baby cry.
You're making the baby cry.

366
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,784
Pick this shit up and get
it out the house now, man.

367
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,038
I'm not fucking with you.

368
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,788
Pick up all this shit, man.
Fuck you, man.

369
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,372
<i>Mami, el niño! El niño!</i>

370
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,537
Kofi. Kofi. Baby!

371
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,163
<i>- Mami!
- Kofi!</i>

372
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:30,746
Oh, God, baby!

373
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,246
Baby.

374
00:36:36,246 --> 00:36:38,038
Kofi, baby.

375
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,413
Baby.
Get off him.

376
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:44,829
You're crazy!
You're fucking crazy!

377
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:48,871
Get out! Get out! Get out!

378
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:54,746
Please, please, please,
no, no, no.

379
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:56,579
Okay. Call an ambulance.

380
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,413
Oh, my God. Okay.

381
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,496
It's okay.

382
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,038
It's okay.

383
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,996
It's okay.

384
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:31,621
It's over.

385
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,412
It's over.

386
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:43,246
It's okay.

387
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,412
It's okay.

388
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,829
It's over.

389
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:57,579
Right here.

390
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,579
<i>Is your name Luke Glanton?</i>

391
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,080
<i>Yes.</i>

392
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,913
<i>Mr. Glanton,
a complaint has been filed.</i>

393
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:12,913
<i>It alleges assault
in the second degree,</i>

394
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:15,496
<i>which is a felony
in the state of New York.</i>

395
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:17,163
<i>When such a complaint is filed,</i>

396
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:20,329
<i>you have the right to an
adjournment to obtain a lawyer.</i>

397
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:22,068
Counselor, do you wish to waive

398
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,038
any further reading
of the arraignment?

399
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,788
We would, Your Honor,
and on behalf of my client,

400
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:27,829
I'd enter a Not Guilty plea.

401
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,205
Given the history that I
am aware of, of this defendant,

402
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:33,621
and, as well, the allegations,

403
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:36,412
I'm going to set bail
in the amount of $2,500.

404
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:39,913
Bail may be posted either in
cash or by bail bondsman.

405
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:42,621
In the meantime, I will issue the
temporary order of protection

406
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:46,329
requiring this defendant to
refrain from violent, offensive,

407
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:48,329
<i>assaultive or harassing conduct</i>

408
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,205
<i>and to remain away
from the complainant</i>

409
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,913
<i>until further ordered...</i>

410
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:03,788
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.

411
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,329
I wanna do two in one day.

412
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:15,412
I wanna do
the Trustco on Brandywine.

413
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:18,704
And when all those fucking
pigs are coming after me,

414
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:21,829
I wanna split out the back,
I wanna go down to Rotterdam

415
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:23,996
and I wanna do
that First National.

416
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:29,204
You know something, Luke?

417
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:31,496
If you ride like lightning,

418
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:34,954
you're gonna
crash like thunder.

419
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:38,038
And I'm not gonna let you
bring us both down.

420
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:40,287
Fuck that. Don't be
such a fucking pussy.

421
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,080
No, man. It's over.

422
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,996
Can't do it. Won't do it.

423
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,913
You made your fucking choice.
Fuck you.

424
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:55,080
Hey, you know what?
If you go out tonight...

425
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,746
Take the truck.
You'll be less visible.

426
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,746
Last favor I'll do you.

427
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:04,579
I'm done.

428
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:07,412
You're fucking done?
Yeah.

429
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,162
You're done?

430
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:11,621
It's over.

431
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,746
Ro.

432
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,913
Just take this.
Just take it.

433
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:30,496
Ro, I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking maniac.

434
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:33,079
Ro, just take it. Ro.

435
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,162
Can I get in the car, please?

436
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,788
Just take this.

437
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:46,746
<i>You don't love me,
you don't like me.</i>

438
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,412
<i>I fucking get it.
I'm a piece of shit.</i>

439
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:52,454
Okay? I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.

440
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:56,621
I got this for him. Just give it to him.
Tell him it's from me.

441
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,746
<i>You're never
gonna see him again.</i>

442
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,037
Please give that to him.

443
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:34,788
Hey.

444
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,329
Hey, it's okay.
It's all right.

445
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:38,912
Open your mouth.

446
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:41,120
Wider.

447
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,162
You owe me a new bike.

448
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:55,287
Right?

449
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:57,120
Yeah.

450
00:43:57,204 --> 00:44:00,454
Where's that bail money?
Give it to me.

451
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:06,746
I'm sorry.

452
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:27,579
Fuck.

453
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:29,745
Fuckin' Christ.

454
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,579
Shit!

455
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:38,329
Fucking idiot.

456
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,245
Jesus fucking Christ.

457
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,579
Everybody get down
on the fucking floor!

458
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:51,454
You, get up!
Get the fuck up!

459
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:54,181
Fill up that fucking bag
full of money.

460
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:57,912
Don't look at me!
Put your... No faces!

461
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,663
You! Get up!
Get up. Get up!

462
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,745
Get the fuck up!
Get that fucking money!

463
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,245
Put that fucking money in there!
Fuck! Okay, here it comes.

464
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:10,953
What are you doing!
Throw it over!

465
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,745

466
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:15,537

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

468
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:20,454
Where's that guy back there,
your fucking guy?

469
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,245
Hey, guy! Get up!

470
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,412
Throw that over, and you
better not fuck this up.

471
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,662
Jesus Christ.

472
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,621
This is fucking shit.

473
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,245
Get the fuck down!

474
00:45:51,745 --> 00:45:53,454
Shit. Shit.

475
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,496
Fuck you. Fuck you.

Appears to have
a flat on rear tire.

482
00:46:49,912 --> 00:46:52,329
He's headed on to Moyerson,
he's heading towards State.

483
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:53,912
Cut him off at State.

484
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,912
Down the block at barricade

485
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:05,745

Suspect is going down
State Street!

487
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,454
He got around

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,745
Okay. Okay.
Get the fuck over here.

501
00:48:15,828 --> 00:48:17,662
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just get upstairs.

502
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:19,162
Get upstairs!

503
00:48:19,912 --> 00:48:21,620
Go! Go! Go!

504
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,995
I'm at 702 Plymouth.

505
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,828
I need a backup unit for the
southeast corner of the house.

Get down! Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

512
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:47,745
- Is anybody else inside?
- Yes! He's upstairs!

513
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,745
- Police!
- Ro?

514
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:01,453
Ro, don't hang up.

515
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,578
I'm in trouble.

516
00:50:11,787 --> 00:50:14,578
I'm...
I'm in some lady's house.

517
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,912
Ro, would you do
a favor for me, please?

518
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,120
Just one thing. I'll never
ask for anything again.

519
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:33,787
Police!

520
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:44,995
Look, don't tell him
about me, okay?

521
00:50:46,578 --> 00:50:48,912
Police!
Put your gun down!

522
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:53,912
Ro, just don't
tell him about me.

523
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,787
Ro.

524
00:50:57,912 --> 00:51:00,119
Okay? Police! Lay
down on your stomach

525
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:01,328
with your hands spread apart!
Ro?

526
00:51:01,411 --> 00:51:03,453
Face away from the door!
Ro, please.

527
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:05,161
Police! Drop your...

528
00:51:06,912 --> 00:51:09,453
Oh, fuck.

529
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:30,244
104, I'm at 702 Plymouth.
Shots fired. Perp's down.

530
00:51:30,328 --> 00:51:33,078
I've been shot. Send a box
and a bus to 702 Plymouth.

531
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:41,495
Let's see your fucking hands!

532
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:42,662
Get those fucking hands up now!

533
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,453
Get your fucking hands up, now!

534
00:51:44,578 --> 00:51:45,995
Get the fucking
hands up right now!

535
00:51:46,078 --> 00:51:47,161
Clyde, you all right?

536
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:49,578
- I got him. I got him.
- Okay? Do not move!

537
00:51:49,662 --> 00:51:50,995
Get me another cop back here!

538
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:08,078
Baby?

539
00:52:11,286 --> 00:52:12,745
Hey.
Hey.

540
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:22,411
Hi.

541
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,912
Hi.

542
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,828
Uh-oh.
What's my dad doing here?

543
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:31,578
We're all here.

544
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:35,745
Do you remember
what happened? Any of it?

545
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:40,912
Hey, honey, don't... Don't... It's all right.
It's all right.

546
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:43,787
Don't do that. Leave it.

547
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,536
Hey, hey, hey, honey, just...
Not... AL: Avery.

548
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,912
Hey, honey. Avery!

549
00:52:47,994 --> 00:52:51,244
Avery, you got a bad injury.

550
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:53,328
You gotta take it easy.

551
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:55,203
It's okay, honey.
Just gotta relax, okay?

552
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:56,328
ALI All right?

553
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:57,828
We're all here.
Okay, okay, yeah.

554
00:52:57,912 --> 00:53:00,495
You understand?
Yeah.

555
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:04,411
I'm sorry.

556
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:08,286
I'm sorry. JENNIFER: It's okay.
Hey, baby.

557
00:53:08,994 --> 00:53:11,119
We're all here.
It's okay. It's okay.

558
00:53:14,578 --> 00:53:15,994
It's okay. It's okay.
You just gotta rest...

559
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:18,119
You're gonna be in here
a couple of days. All right?

560
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:20,244
That's it.
A couple of days.

561
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,119
Good morning, Mr. Cross.

562
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,722
You feeling up to
a couple of visitors?

563
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,828
There's a couple men
who wanna speak to you.

564
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,328
Avery.

565
00:53:31,828 --> 00:53:33,620
Hey.
How's our hero?

566
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:35,223
Chief. How you feeling?
You all right?

567
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:36,703
I'm good, yeah, yeah. They
taking good care of you?

568
00:53:36,787 --> 00:53:37,828
Yes, sir. Thank you.

569
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:39,328
Sausage and pepper.
Thanks for coming out.

570
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:40,828
From Sabatiello's.
Oh, how are you?

571
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,949
Bill Killcullen, DA. Avery Cross.
Nice to meet you.

572
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:44,578
Nice to meet you. Oh, of course.
I know who you are.

573
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:46,536
I know your father, you know.
Long time now.

574
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,952
I apologize. No, not at all.
He's a great guy.

575
00:53:49,078 --> 00:53:50,578
I wouldn't have expected
anything less from his son,

576
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,745
but this was above and beyond.

577
00:53:52,828 --> 00:53:54,578
I just did what
anybody would do, right?

578
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:56,411
That's right. And better.

579
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:57,536
I don't know about that...

580
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,536
The whole force is pulling for you, man.
Don't you forget that.

581
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,244
They're all outside.
Banners, everything.

582
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:04,578
What happened to that guy? That guy's gone.
He's dead. It's over.

583
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:07,911
That's the way it happens.
Right?

584
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,662
Yeah, but did he
leave anybody behind?

585
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:12,370
That's not... It's not for you
to worry about right now.

586
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:14,536
We got people who are
gonna talk to you about that.

587
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,411
There's people
talking to his family.

588
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:19,703
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.

589
00:54:20,328 --> 00:54:21,703
All right?
Yeah.

590
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:23,536
Bill wants to ask you a few questions.
Is that all right?

591
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,453
It's just your first
impressions, that kind of thing.

592
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:27,036
- Just what...
- Formality, you know?

593
00:54:27,078 --> 00:54:28,517
Yeah, it's pretty simple.
Yeah. Sure.

594
00:54:28,578 --> 00:54:30,495
All right, I'll leave you two
to get to know each other.

595
00:54:30,578 --> 00:54:31,911
Oh. All right.

596
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:36,286
So what happened when you
were just outside the door?

597
00:54:36,745 --> 00:54:39,453
Um, I said,
"Police, drop your weapon."

598
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:43,578
Um, "Face down on the ground
with your hands spread."

599
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:46,203
And, uh, nothing.

600
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,994
Nothing, right.
Nothing.

601
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:49,411
Did you announce
yourself again, or not?

602
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:53,495
No. No, that's all we need to do
is make ourselves known, right?

603
00:54:54,536 --> 00:54:57,328
Yeah, but it's sometimes
not easy to tell

604
00:54:57,411 --> 00:55:00,203
whether they've heard you
making yourself known.

605
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:03,370
You know what I mean?

606
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:05,370
Anyway, you were yelling.
Is that right?

607
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:07,662
I was making myself known
as we were trained, correct.

608
00:55:07,744 --> 00:55:09,244
Okay. All right.

609
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,078
Okay. Then what?

610
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,578
At that point, I knew that I had to
make entry, and I kicked the door down.

611
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:20,161
Was then. Was the door locked?
Correct.

612
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:21,536
And you knew that because...

613
00:55:22,328 --> 00:55:23,453
What do you mean?

614
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:25,174
You just assumed that
the door was locked?

615
00:55:25,244 --> 00:55:27,328
How did I know it was locked?
Yeah.

616
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:30,286
Is that a trick question?

617
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,453
No. No. I'm just wondering
why you didn't turn the thing.

618
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:34,370
That's how I knew
it was locked.

619
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,495
Did you tell me that?

620
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,078
No.
Okay.

621
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:41,827
All right, so you kick it in.
Right.

622
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:44,453
Why are you...
Why'd you come down here?

623
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:45,934
I'm sorry, why did
I come down here?

624
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,286
Yeah.
Why wasn't somebody else...

625
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,244
A slow day at the office or...

626
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,411
No.

627
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,994
What happened after that? What
would you like me to tell you?

628
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:02,078
I just need you to
tell me what happened.

629
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:03,244
You do?

630
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:05,827
I don't want you to
misremember so, tomorrow,

631
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:08,203
you're trying to match
what you half-thought today.

632
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:12,661
I only want you to tell me what
you saw and what you remember.

633
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,328
I shot the perpetrator,
he fell out the window.

634
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:19,036
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?

635
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:23,786
Did you shoot him first,
or did he shoot first?

636
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,328
Don't fuck with me.

637
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:31,244
Do the right thing, tell
me what the fuck happened.

638
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,036
It was pretty quick.

639
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:37,744
Who shot first?

640
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,994
His hand comes up, you fire?

641
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:45,495
His hand comes up,
he fires, you fire?

642
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:47,453
Right.
Like that?

643
00:56:49,036 --> 00:56:50,744
Yeah.
Like pop-pop.

644
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,661
That sounds like he shot first.

645
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,577
Yeah.

646
00:56:56,952 --> 00:56:59,911
<i>Well, it's just a
triumphant day for Officer Avery Cross.</i>

647
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:04,161
<i>He left Ellis Hospital well enough
to go home and happy to be alive,</i>

648
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:07,869
<i>with supporters from his Schenectady
PD family cheering him on.</i>

649
00:57:07,952 --> 00:57:10,370
<i>His father, State Supreme
Court Judge AI Cross,</i>

650
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:13,119
<i>says he's very happy
his son is alive today.</i>

651
00:57:13,203 --> 00:57:15,203
<i>There's the life of a cop,</i>

652
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,786
<i>the life my son chose.</i>

653
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:21,523
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Cross hadn't
even been on the force for a full year</i>

654
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:24,994
<i>before he ran head-on
into the alleged Moto Bandit.</i>

655
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:27,577
<i>Pursuing Luke Glanton through
the streets of Schenectady</i>

656
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:31,286
<i>after a bank robbery, Glanton
ran into a home, then he came</i>

657
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,494
<i>face-to-face with Officer Cross.
You okay?</i>

658
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:36,203
<i>Glanton fired at Cross,
hitting him in the knee.</i>

659
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,911
<i>Cross fired back, killing Glanton
and saving the hostages.</i>

660
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:43,619
<i>Glanton was a drifter and, at
times, a motorcycle stunt rider,</i>

661
00:57:43,702 --> 00:57:46,119
<i>and police say he had
a very violent past.</i>

662
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:48,494
<i>The guy had
a long track record, you know?</i>

663
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:50,078
<i>He was a professional criminal.</i>

664
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:51,599
<i>He moved here last spring,</i>

665
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:53,244
<i>and he hadn't even been here
for a full month</i>

666
00:57:53,328 --> 00:57:55,911
<i>before he started
robbing banks here.</i>

667
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:58,702
<i>He leaves behind an infant son.</i>

668
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,994
<i>Coming up, Dallas and Denver...</i>

669
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:06,452
Was it scary, honey?

670
00:58:07,411 --> 00:58:09,203
Happened so fast.

671
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,119
I don't think there was
time to be scared.

672
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:14,952
Scary for me.

673
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:20,744
I just don't understand why
you're doing this. Nobody does.

674
00:58:22,827 --> 00:58:25,286
Doing what?
What am I doing?

675
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:31,078
I was speaking
with your father and we...

676
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:36,702
We both agree...
Of course he does.

677
00:58:36,786 --> 00:58:38,494
I'm sorry.
I just thought that...

678
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:40,452
I'm a cop, Jen. I'm a cop.
That's it. There's no...

679
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:42,494
I just thought maybe after this,
maybe you would've had enough.

680
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:43,702
Hey, there's no more
to discuss.

681
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,911
That's all. I just thought
maybe you would've had enough.

682
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,494
That's it. Okay?

683
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,702
Baby, you can't expect me not to think that.
You guys just don't get it.

684
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:55,328
You guys just don't get it.

685
00:58:57,911 --> 00:59:00,269
I'm sorry. We're just worried.
We're just worried about you.

686
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,786
Stop saying that.
That's all.

687
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:05,078
Stop fucking saying that.

688
00:59:14,911 --> 00:59:18,286
<i>Have you been replaying
the incident in your mind?</i>

689
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:20,952
Not really.
Mmm-hmm.

690
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:24,744
No, I'm trying to put it
out of my mind, I think.

691
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:27,577
Does that work?

692
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:29,078
Yeah.

693
00:59:31,244 --> 00:59:34,619
You think you're ready
to go back to duty?

694
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:36,286
Yes.

695
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,994
Would you want
yourself as a partner?

696
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:41,619
Absolutely.

697
00:59:43,535 --> 00:59:46,203
What have you been thinking
about since the shooting?

698
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:47,452
Not much, um...

699
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:56,452
Everything's been so crazy,
you know, with the rehabilitation

700
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,827
and work
and everything at home.

701
01:00:01,535 --> 01:00:04,161
Mmm-hmm. Everything at home?
What's happening at home?

702
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:09,911
Well, I'm there
now, which is much different.

703
01:00:09,994 --> 01:00:12,036
Who's at home with you?
Um...

704
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:16,078
Well, uh, my mother-in-law,
uh, my wife and my boy.

705
01:00:16,702 --> 01:00:18,285
So there's, um...

706
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:21,994
You know, it's been hard on my wife.
It's a shock.

707
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,327
And then, um,
it doesn't help that

708
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,078
there's a...
You know, a baby around.

709
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:29,327
But it's okay.
I mean, it's okay.

710
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,661
What do you mean, "it doesn't
help that there's a baby around?"

711
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:38,577
Well, I just mean, with everything that's...
That's going on...

712
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:44,327
Just trying to... To get
all this in order, uh...

713
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,410
Before I can take care of that.

714
01:00:46,494 --> 01:00:47,952
It's been...

715
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:56,161
I've just been so busy
that it's been hard to, uh...

716
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,952
I have a...
I have a hard time

717
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,369
looking at my son.

718
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:16,661
Mmm-hmm.

719
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:19,285
And that's something new,
since the shooting?

720
01:01:19,452 --> 01:01:21,285
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

721
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:25,036
You know,
I saw in the police record

722
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,327
that this perp also
had a 1-year-old son.

723
01:01:29,827 --> 01:01:33,535
His name is Jason. Have you
been thinking about this?

724
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:41,577
This? You mean...

725
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,786
The fact that he had a boy?

726
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,160
Yeah. Do you think you're having
a hard time looking at your son

727
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:53,661
because you're thinking
about this other little boy

728
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:55,494
that won't have his father?

729
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:34,243
You expecting someone?
No. You?

730
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:35,994
Hey!
Hi.

731
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,452
Hi.
How you doing?

732
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:40,452
Hey.
Hey, how's the gimp doing?

733
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:42,243
Hey, come on in, guys.

734
01:02:42,327 --> 01:02:43,661
No, we're just coming in here

735
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:45,118
to check up on you and see
how you're doing.

736
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:47,240
Hi, how are you, Jen? I'm good.
How are you, Scotty?

737
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:48,952
Oh, I'm all right, doing
good, better than this guy.

738
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:50,327
Oh, he's okay.

739
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,827
Come on in. How you doing?
Hey, Pete, how are you?

740
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:54,327
Good.
Good to see you.

741
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,160
Good to see you, too. Did you
ever meet my wife, Jennifer?

742
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:57,619
No. Hi. It's a real
pleasure to meet you.

743
01:02:57,702 --> 01:02:58,993
Hello.
Hey, how are you?

744
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:00,494
Know Doc?
Yeah, we've never met,

745
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,786
but Avery Cross.
How you doing?

746
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:03,285
Good. How you doing, pal?
That's my wife, Jennifer.

747
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:05,369
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you. Hi.

748
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,869
You guys hungry?

749
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:10,035
No, we're... We'll just
leave you to it.

750
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:11,202
No, come on in,
have some dinner.

751
01:03:11,285 --> 01:03:12,911
No, we didn't
come here for dinner.

752
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:16,160
We got plenty of food. Come on in.
Well, I...

753
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,369
There you go.
Oh, yeah.

754
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:21,410
Glad we decided to do this.

755
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:23,619
Oh, good.
I'm glad you guys came.

756
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:25,661
Here you go.
Thanks.

757
01:03:26,243 --> 01:03:27,827
So how's it feel
to have the hero home?

758
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:30,911
Probably can't wait for him to
get back to work, huh?

759
01:03:30,993 --> 01:03:32,577
No, it's great having him home.

760
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:35,702
I just thank God
he's okay, you know?

761
01:03:35,786 --> 01:03:38,494
God bless that. I think
we should toast on that.

762
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:40,869
- To our hero.
- To hero boy.

763
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,702
- Hero boy.
- There you go.

764
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:44,452
Glad you're okay.

765
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:46,619
I've been on
the force for 22 years,

766
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,786
pulled a trigger
maybe three, four times.

767
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:51,993
You're on for six months, you
already got one in the bag.

768
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:54,285
And he was white.

769
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,118
That's an extra 50.

770
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:58,910
Oh, better him than me, right?

771
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:00,369
- Hey, you got that right.
- Absolutely.

772
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:02,535
You guys have any
plans for tonight?

773
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:04,452
Um...

774
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:07,910
No, we're just... This is it.
Yeah?

775
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:10,577
This is the big plan, having
you guys here for dinner.

776
01:04:10,702 --> 01:04:14,160
Aw! Would you mind
if we stole the hero

777
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:16,619
for a little police work
after this?

778
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:19,285
Uh...

779
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,910
Tonight? And we'll have
him back by curfew.

780
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:28,327
I don't know, honey, you
should probably rest tonight.

781
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,702
Maybe tomorrow night.

782
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:33,035
Yeah, we kind of need him tonight.
Is there a problem?

783
01:04:33,118 --> 01:04:35,494
What about your leg, or...

784
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:37,868
Well, we're not gonna be running.
We'll carry him.

785
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:39,993
What are you gonna do?

786
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:41,955
We just wanna introduce
him to a bunch of people

787
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:44,535
who really admire him
for what he did.

788
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,786
They just wanna
congratulate him in person.

789
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:49,410
Good, yeah, that sounds good.

790
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:51,744
Leave in about 20 minutes?

791
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:55,243
Not that we wanna eat and
run, but we are on duty.

792
01:04:55,327 --> 01:04:57,118
No, you should go.
That's a great idea.

793
01:04:57,202 --> 01:04:58,910
I'm sure everybody
would love to meet you.

794
01:04:59,035 --> 01:05:02,243
Yeah, there you have it.
You're a hero.

795
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:05,702
I hear a little
sarcasm in your voice.

796
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:06,993
Me?
Yeah.

797
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:08,327
He is a hero.
Yeah.

798
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,785
He's a hero around here,
that's for sure.

799
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,535
You don't mind if we take him
then, do you? Not at all.

800
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:14,494
I think it's a great idea. Yeah,
all right, there you have it.

801
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,285
You're released.
Release the hounds!

802
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:19,077
Yeah.

803
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,035
Hey, Avery,

804
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:31,327
does she sometimes, like, tuck
her balls up, at least at night?

805
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:37,118
Hey, Pete? Pete?
What?

806
01:05:37,243 --> 01:05:40,160
- Can you pop the trunk?
- Sure it's okay with her?

807
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:47,452
Scott, you know I'm not
on active duty, right?

808
01:05:47,535 --> 01:05:50,577
Yeah, we're aware. It's a little
gift we got going for you.

809
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,077
Let's go!

810
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,077
Police.

811
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,910
Yes?
Hi. Romina Gutierrez, please.

812
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:04,951
That's the woman, right there.
Romina.

813
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:06,452
Yeah.

814
01:06:08,494 --> 01:06:11,577
Hi. Hi, I'm Officer Deluca.
Romina Gutierrez?

815
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:14,327
Yeah. Yeah, we're here
to search your house.

816
01:06:14,743 --> 01:06:16,577
What for?
For evidence.

817
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,660
Evidence for what?
We're looking for the money

818
01:06:18,743 --> 01:06:21,035
that Luke Glanton may or
may not have given to you.

819
01:06:21,118 --> 01:06:23,494
Yeah, well, we don't have
anything that...

820
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:26,535
You can't just walk in here.

821
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:27,951
Yeah, I can.
No, you can't.

822
01:06:28,035 --> 01:06:30,452
Why's that?
'Cause it's my house.

823
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:34,118
Look, you assume
that I have a warrant,

824
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:36,701
and I'll assume that
your mother has papers, okay?

825
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:40,160
This won't take long.

826
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,369
- Come on.
- Kofi.

827
01:06:43,118 --> 01:06:45,118
- We're just gonna start upstairs, okay?
- No, no, no, no.

828
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,618
No, no, my baby's upstairs.

829
01:06:46,701 --> 01:06:48,243
My baby's upstairs sleeping.
Your baby's...

830
01:06:48,327 --> 01:06:49,646
Yeah, my baby's
upstairs sleeping,

831
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,618
so, no, we're not
gonna start up there.

832
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,118
No, no, no, don't go up there.

833
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:55,993
Romina, hey, relax, relax, relax.
He can't go up there.

834
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,452
Yeah, he can. You can
go up there if you want.

835
01:06:58,535 --> 01:06:59,993
But if we find evidence
while you're up there,

836
01:07:00,077 --> 01:07:01,785
you're under arrest.
For what?

837
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:05,202
We've done this a lot of times, okay?
It'll be quiet.

838
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:08,077
Go on, Scotty. Be quiet.

839
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,993
How about a cup of coffee?

840
01:07:13,077 --> 01:07:14,785
Yes, yes, yes.
That'd be great.

841
01:07:16,285 --> 01:07:18,535
Is it all right if I go
into your living room here?

842
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,285
Yeah, go ahead.
Thanks.

843
01:07:26,993 --> 01:07:28,494
I'm sorry for your loss.

844
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,285
Romina, let's go. Come on.

845
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:57,285
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

846
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:59,285
Hey, this is crazy.

847
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,202
Wait outside. I don't want...
No, we gotta go.

848
01:08:02,285 --> 01:08:03,868
This is fucked-up.

849
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:05,829
Why the fuck are we here?
Let go of my arm, man.

850
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:08,327
What the fuck are we doing here?
Let go of my arm.

851
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,035
Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
Shut up.

852
01:08:16,576 --> 01:08:19,077
- How long did you know Luke?
- A couple years.

853
01:08:19,576 --> 01:08:22,618
Did you know he was robbing banks?
No.

854
01:08:22,743 --> 01:08:24,826
You didn't know that at all? No.

855
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:28,743
Let me just ask you one more time,
because this is what we do.

856
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:32,743
You have no knowledge
to this money? No.

857
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:34,202
Officer, I swear to God.

858
01:08:34,285 --> 01:08:36,035
It's not here?
No.

859
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:37,243
It's not outside?

860
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:40,160
If I was gonna hide something,

861
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:42,910
I would hide it
closest to my heart.

862
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:50,576
Scott.

863
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,369
Pick him up.

864
01:08:59,243 --> 01:09:00,493
Pick up the baby.

865
01:09:00,576 --> 01:09:01,826
I don't think
we should do this.

866
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,618
I don't wanna wake him.
I don't wanna pick him up.

867
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:04,785
Pick him up.

868
01:09:44,576 --> 01:09:45,993
I'm good.

869
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:50,202
Put him back and let's go.

870
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:23,951
What's up?
Yeah, they're clean.

871
01:10:26,284 --> 01:10:29,409
All right-y.
We'll get out of your hair.

872
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:33,493
What do you
got there, Scotty? Come on.

873
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:35,077
Help him out, will you?

874
01:10:35,202 --> 01:10:37,519
Scotty, stop. Stop. You gotta
give me a chance to count it.

875
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,910
You gonna count like that, we're gonna
be here till 5:00 in the morning.

876
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:41,073
How are you gonna count it?

877
01:10:41,077 --> 01:10:43,202
Got a money counter in your asshole?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,826
Fourteen grand.
$14,000.

879
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,035
Well, it's not gonna be
an even split

880
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:51,035
because the lion's share's
going to our hero.

881
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:53,785
Consider it
unofficial hazard pay.

882
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,618
From us to you.

883
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,451
Enjoy it.

884
01:11:01,534 --> 01:11:04,202
'Cause you're not gonna
get it from the department.

885
01:11:04,284 --> 01:11:07,368
Don't spend it
all in one place.

886
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:10,160
Fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.

887
01:11:10,242 --> 01:11:11,660
Not bad, huh?

888
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:13,868
Not bad for a night's work.

889
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:41,826
<i>We're gathered here to
celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud.</i>

890
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,660
<i>We can all rest
a little easier at night</i>

891
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:46,201
<i>now that he's on
the path to recovery.</i>

892
01:11:46,284 --> 01:11:48,826
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Officer Avery Cross.</i>

893
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,743
Thank you. Thank you, Chief.
Thank you for your support.

894
01:11:59,077 --> 01:12:03,618
<i>When I was in law school, we used
to always talk about justice.</i>

895
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:05,576
<i>We'd have
discussions about justice.</i>

896
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:09,910
<i>That's just what they were...</i>

897
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,077
<i>Discussions.</i>

898
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,743
<i>I joined the police force</i>

899
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:16,242
<i>because I wanted to work alongside
the brave men and women</i>

900
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:20,077
<i>who know that some problems
can't be solved by talking.</i>

901
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,719
<i>Now, no one wants
to be in the situation</i>

902
01:12:21,743 --> 01:12:23,993
<i>I found myself in
a couple weeks ago.</i>

903
01:12:24,576 --> 01:12:27,159
<i>I certainly wish that
it turned out differently.</i>

904
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:32,284
<i>I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes
I even wish that</i>

905
01:12:32,368 --> 01:12:36,201
<i>maybe it wasn't me that was
called upon that house that day.</i>

906
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:38,660
<i>But that's the job.</i>

907
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:42,368
<i>And I can't think of another line
of work that I'd rather be in.</i>

908
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:44,409
<i>Thank you.</i>

909
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:03,785
How's it feel?

910
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:08,117
I'm not sure
it's doing much good.

911
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:10,660
How's the spotlight?

912
01:13:11,368 --> 01:13:13,409
I'm ready for it to end.

913
01:13:14,242 --> 01:13:16,409
Look, don't worry, it will.

914
01:13:17,618 --> 01:13:19,576
You know, the police
always put on a big show

915
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,576
when something
like this happens

916
01:13:21,951 --> 01:13:24,743
'cause the hero card's the
only one they have to play.

917
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:25,992
I'm not really
thinking about that, Dad.

918
01:13:26,076 --> 01:13:28,159
I'm just trying
to get back to work.

919
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:29,681
You know, Avery,
if you planned this,

920
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:31,576
it couldn't have
turned out any better.

921
01:13:32,326 --> 01:13:35,368
But you're not gonna make it work
for you in the police department.

922
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:36,992
I promise you that.

923
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:40,576
I didn't come here to be lectured, Dad.
You tricked me.

924
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,618
You said the pool
would be good for my knee.

925
01:13:43,743 --> 01:13:44,951
Sorry.

926
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:46,826
You know, I'm not
as calculated as you.

927
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:49,368
You know,
my life's not a campaign.

928
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:51,451
It's much simpler.
Yeah.

929
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,743
Well, for somebody
not campaigning,

930
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:55,950
you gave a hell of
a speech yesterday.

931
01:13:56,076 --> 01:13:58,076
You certainly had my vote.

932
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:01,910
Plus, that knee's a goldmine.

933
01:14:04,076 --> 01:14:07,743
No, I mean, a limp goes
a long way in politics.

934
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,242
Look at Roosevelt.

935
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:33,284
Pull out the red carpet!
Get the flowers out!

936
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:36,785
Get all the flowers out!
Here she comes. Come here.

937
01:14:46,117 --> 01:14:47,743
I gotta go see the chief.
I gotta go see the chief.

938
01:14:47,785 --> 01:14:49,618
Why? I don't know. I don't know.

939
01:14:49,743 --> 01:14:51,909
Is it bad news?
Think it'll be bad news?

940
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:57,785
Say hi to the chief for me.

941
01:14:57,909 --> 01:15:00,701
Gonna be goin' back down up there.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

942
01:15:00,785 --> 01:15:04,242
Stay off your knee. Don't
mess your hair up, pretty boy.

943
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:14,159
<i>Got a call today
from DA Killcullen.</i>

944
01:15:15,493 --> 01:15:17,159
Close the door.

945
01:15:20,576 --> 01:15:23,368
The state internal investigation
into the shooting of Luke Glanton

946
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:25,660
has been deemed lawful.

947
01:15:25,743 --> 01:15:27,326
Congratulations, Officer.

948
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:30,618
You can put it behind you,
get back to police work.

949
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,992
The question is, can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon,

950
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:36,493
and if you could,
can you be effective?

951
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:40,451
I don't think that I can.
That's okay.

952
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:43,326
You know what? There's a lot
of jobs to be done around here

953
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:44,784
that, in ways,
and you know that,

954
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:46,159
in ways,
are much more important

955
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,493
than what happens
out on the street.

956
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,242
I'm so glad you said that because,
Chief, I've thought a lot about this

957
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:55,825
and I think that I could be
best utilized as a lieutenant

958
01:15:55,909 --> 01:15:58,326
in charge of
special investigations.

959
01:15:58,409 --> 01:16:00,534
There's a lot of restructuring
within the division

960
01:16:00,618 --> 01:16:01,856
that I've actually
formulated...

961
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:03,784
I can't fucking do that.

962
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:06,909
Well, yeah, of course
you could. I mean...

963
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,368
Cross! Come on.

964
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:11,825
You paid too much for your
education to act so stupid, kid.

965
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:14,201
Well, I think it's the very fact that
I do have an education like this

966
01:16:14,284 --> 01:16:15,784
that perhaps is the reason
why I've thought about

967
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:18,576
how restructuring the unit,
the division,

968
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:19,898
can actually benefit you, me...

969
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,992
Cross, I appreciate
your ambition, I really do.

970
01:16:23,076 --> 01:16:26,159
And I think... You know, I think
you're gonna be a great cop.

971
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:28,159
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.

972
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:31,867
But at this point, right now, you
gotta get back to real life,

973
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:34,493
and in real life, you got two choices.
Which are?

974
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:37,117
You can retire on disability...

975
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:38,867
I don't wanna do that.
All right, good.

976
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:40,076
I don't want you
to do that either.

977
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,493
Or you could be reassigned
at your current rank.

978
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:48,909
<i>That's it. You gotta
work your way up, man.</i>

979
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,326
Hey, man,
heard you were down here.

980
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:57,825
Hey.

981
01:16:57,909 --> 01:16:59,534
What are you doing?

982
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:04,909
What are you doing in plain clothes?
You didn't hear? I made Vice.

983
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:07,159
Get the fuck outta here.

984
01:17:07,242 --> 01:17:09,493
Yeah, man, I'm actually
paired up with Deluca.

985
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:11,992
That's good.
What do you got for me?

986
01:17:12,076 --> 01:17:15,409
Oh, yeah, couple mutts left this
in the back seat of their car.

987
01:17:15,493 --> 01:17:17,409
A leaky substance.
All right.

988
01:17:18,076 --> 01:17:20,617
So when are we gonna get
together, grab a little bite,

989
01:17:20,992 --> 01:17:22,368
you know,
talk about some things?

990
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:24,617
Sounds great.
All right, man. Page me.

991
01:17:24,742 --> 01:17:26,117
Okay.
Thanks.

992
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:30,451
What I'm about
to ask you is very sensitive.

993
01:17:30,534 --> 01:17:33,076
The only reason why I'm asking
is 'cause you're my friend.

994
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:34,519
I don't know what
I can do to help,

995
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:36,576
but, yeah, what do you need?
All right. Right on.

996
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,326
Deluca and I have been working
on this case, all right?

997
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:42,825
And I want you to
keep this to yourself.

998
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,493
It's a little private.

999
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:48,659
And I don't want anybody
to know about it, okay?

1000
01:17:48,742 --> 01:17:50,034
Okay.

1001
01:17:50,117 --> 01:17:52,992
Okay, Deluca and I are working
with this fucking hooker.

1002
01:17:53,076 --> 01:17:55,284
We gotta fucking head
her off with some coke.

1003
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:58,409
So Deluca and I thought
that, you know, if...

1004
01:17:58,867 --> 01:18:00,950
We need some temporary
access to the evidence room.

1005
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:02,154
We need you to get some shit.

1006
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,617
We gotta hit this bitch off.
That's what we need.

1007
01:18:05,242 --> 01:18:08,242
I really tried to look out for
you with that seven grand.

1008
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:10,617
Now I need you to
look out for me.

1009
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:14,284
I'm serious, bro.
This is how it works.

1010
01:20:04,575 --> 01:20:08,159
Hey.
Hey, don't worry, it's okay.

1011
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,034
I didn't mean to startle you.

1012
01:20:13,117 --> 01:20:17,201
It's okay. I just wanna
give you something. All right?

1013
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:20,284
Listen, this is the money that we
recovered from your house, okay?

1014
01:20:20,367 --> 01:20:21,784
I want you to have it.

1015
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:23,742
I don't know what that is.

1016
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,117
You don't have to
ever even see me again,

1017
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,992
just take the money.

1018
01:20:28,076 --> 01:20:31,076
I'm not here as a police officer,
I'm here as a regular guy.

1019
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,825
Listen, listen, listen. Listen to me.
Get the fuck away.

1020
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:36,659
You fucked up my son's life,

1021
01:20:36,742 --> 01:20:38,201
therefore you
fucked up my life!

1022
01:20:38,284 --> 01:20:40,367
Get the fuck away from me.

1023
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:57,575
I should have brought this
to you sooner, and I apologize.

1024
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:01,034
This was recovered
from a house during a search.

1025
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:02,659
No, wait a minute, Cross.

1026
01:21:02,742 --> 01:21:05,742
It's just a small fraction
of what's going on.

1027
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:08,450
Wait a minute, Cross.

1028
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:11,784
Don't say another word.

1029
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,575
What do you mean? No, no, no,
don't say another word.

1030
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:25,159
What do you expect
me to do with this?

1031
01:21:25,241 --> 01:21:26,909
You're joking, right?
This is shit.

1032
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:28,034
Chief.

1033
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:32,325
This ain't my problem, all right?
This is your problem.

1034
01:21:32,408 --> 01:21:34,825
This is our problem of the
fucking police department,

1035
01:21:34,909 --> 01:21:36,492
and I'm bringing it
to your attention

1036
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:38,325
because that's what
I should fucking do!

1037
01:21:38,408 --> 01:21:40,159
Oh, yeah, is that right?
Yeah!

1038
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,992
Is that what you should do?

1039
01:21:42,076 --> 01:21:43,659
Rat out other fucking cops?
Chief...

1040
01:21:43,742 --> 01:21:45,992
This is un-fucking-believable,
all right?

1041
01:21:46,076 --> 01:21:48,076
Get this shit out of here!

1042
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:14,617
Fuck.

1043
01:23:26,784 --> 01:23:28,325
Fuck.

1044
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,241
Hey.

1045
01:23:41,825 --> 01:23:43,408
Where you going?

1046
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:49,492
I was going home.

1047
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:57,241
You know that thing you and
Scotty been talking about?

1048
01:24:01,075 --> 01:24:02,450
Yeah.

1049
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:05,408
Sure.

1050
01:24:05,492 --> 01:24:07,909
Well, you and I
have to talk about it.

1051
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:11,241
Follow me.

1052
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,241
What the fuck?

1053
01:25:19,075 --> 01:25:20,241
Fucking...

1054
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:46,533
Oh, fuck.

1055
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:03,784
Hey!

1056
01:26:32,575 --> 01:26:34,241
Hey, Pop.

1057
01:26:37,408 --> 01:26:38,824
Avery.

1058
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:47,241
There's a way out of this.

1059
01:26:49,741 --> 01:26:51,741
You're not gonna like it.

1060
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:55,575
You wanna hear?

1061
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:03,824
Yeah, I wanna hear it.

1062
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:07,241
Let's start with the precinct.

1063
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:09,450
Anybody there still trust you?

1064
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:11,908
Scott.

1065
01:27:13,075 --> 01:27:14,783
We'll start with Scott.

1066
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,116
Playing shortstop.

1067
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:28,741
Looks good. He's getting bigger.
Jesus Christ.

1068
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:32,866
You really gave
Deluca quite a scare.

1069
01:27:32,949 --> 01:27:35,283
He's ready to dump you,
the whole thing.

1070
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:36,824
Enough with these
fucking tests, all right?

1071
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:39,200
Either ask me to help you or
just leave me the fuck alone.

1072
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:44,437
I need you to go
into the locker,

1073
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:45,908
I need you to take
the McKillen case out.

1074
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:49,075
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it
says "McKillen" across it, okay?

1075
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:51,635
I need you to break off a chunk,
I need you to put it in a bag.

1076
01:27:51,658 --> 01:27:53,658
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna
pick it up tomorrow morning.

1077
01:27:53,741 --> 01:27:55,699
If somebody asks you,
"Hey, why is this lighter?"

1078
01:27:55,783 --> 01:27:56,824
You say,
"Hey, you know what?"

1079
01:27:56,908 --> 01:27:58,658
"I'm a rookie.
I made a mistake."

1080
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:01,241
You're a squeaky-clean fucking
lawyer with a medal of honor.

1081
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:03,616
Nobody's gonna
question you, okay?

1082
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:08,075
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

1083
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:11,283
No problem.

1084
01:28:13,116 --> 01:28:15,241
I knew I could
count on you, man.

1085
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,283
Yeah.

1086
01:28:18,241 --> 01:28:19,991
Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.

1087
01:28:20,075 --> 01:28:21,408
All right.

1088
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,312
<i>I need you

1089

1101
01:28:58,991 --> 01:29:00,908
You shown this to IA?

1102
01:29:01,325 --> 01:29:02,949
'Course not.

1103
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:05,075
Handing it to you
on a silver platter.

1104
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:10,741
Got any idea what this means?

1105
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,408
Are you ready to do it?

1106
01:29:13,908 --> 01:29:16,532
Are you, son?
Are you really ready?

1107
01:29:16,616 --> 01:29:19,283
'Cause they're gonna
fuckin' tear you in half.

1108
01:29:20,075 --> 01:29:23,241
I'm gonna need your assurance you're
gonna follow through with it.

1109
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:26,200
Really?

1110
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:30,574
And I'm gonna want full
immunity when you do.

1111
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:32,593
You can't just walk
in here and tell me

1112
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,241
what the fuck to do.
You understand?

1113
01:29:34,325 --> 01:29:35,991
And when you do,

1114
01:29:36,574 --> 01:29:38,158
I wanna be made
Assistant District Attorney.

1115
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:40,741
I have a law degree
and I passed the bar.

1116
01:29:41,783 --> 01:29:44,449
I don't have a spot for you right now.
Make a spot.

1117
01:29:44,949 --> 01:29:46,033
I won't do that.

1118
01:29:46,116 --> 01:29:48,283
I can't just snap my fingers
and make you Assistant DA.

1119
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:49,491
You can say no.

1120
01:29:49,574 --> 01:29:51,325
You can say no,
I'll walk out this door,

1121
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:52,658
<i>I'll walk over to the Gazette,</i>

1122
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:54,866
I'll tell 'em everything I know,
including this conversation.

1123
01:29:54,949 --> 01:29:56,947
Listen, you're not going anywhere.
Don't... Listen.

1124
01:29:57,408 --> 01:30:00,075
Put it back on the table,
I'll fucking do it.

1125
01:30:02,741 --> 01:30:04,241
All three things?

1126
01:30:04,325 --> 01:30:05,908
All right.

1127
01:30:06,616 --> 01:30:09,325
I'm not gonna promise you how
long you're gonna stay there.

1128
01:30:09,407 --> 01:30:12,075
You're not gonna shake
my fucking hand, pal.

1129
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,699
I'll make you Assistant DA. I'm never
gonna shake your fucking hand.

1130
01:30:19,075 --> 01:30:21,574
You're too smart
for your own good.

1131
01:30:22,866 --> 01:30:24,283
Come down, come here.

1132
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:26,241
Get right in there
for a good shot.

1133
01:30:26,949 --> 01:30:29,491
Detective, how do you respond
to these allegations?

1134
01:30:33,658 --> 01:30:35,491
<i>Drugs, corruption and gangs.</i>

1135
01:30:35,574 --> 01:30:38,824
<i>It's not an investigation by the
Schenectady Police Department,</i>

1136
01:30:38,908 --> 01:30:42,824
<i>it's an investigation into the
Schenectady Police Department.</i>

1137
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:44,741
<i>Earlier today,
DA William Killcullen</i>

1138
01:30:44,824 --> 01:30:46,200
<i>announced that his office,</i>

1139
01:30:46,283 --> 01:30:47,824
<i>along with the FBI,</i>

1140
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:49,449
<i>would be handing
down indictments</i>

1141
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:52,783
<i>that would lead to the arrest of
these Schenectady police officers.</i>

1142
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:55,824
<i>The DA is making allegations
today that the Vice officers</i>

1143
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:59,116
<i>were acting like the gangs that
they were supposed to be busting.</i>

1144
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:02,200
<i>Officers allegedly
stole drugs and money,</i>

1145
01:31:02,283 --> 01:31:05,241
<i>even guns from inside
the evidence room here.</i>

1146
01:31:05,908 --> 01:31:07,991
<i>Officials say that,
with that stolen evidence,</i>

1147
01:31:08,075 --> 01:31:11,491
<i>the cops paid criminals
to help set up their rivals,</i>

1148
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:15,200
<i>which then led to those
headline-grabbing arrests.</i>

1149
01:31:15,283 --> 01:31:17,949
<i>The DA announced its star
witness in the case today,</i>

1150
01:31:18,033 --> 01:31:19,741
<i>hero cop Avery Cross,</i>

1151
01:31:19,824 --> 01:31:22,616
<i>who, less than a year ago,
was shot in the line of duty</i>

1152
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:25,075
<i>while trying to save
two Schenectady residents</i>

1153
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:26,991
<i>from the alleged Moto Bandit.</i>

1154
01:31:27,075 --> 01:31:29,282
<i>In Schenectady, I'm Jessica
Layton, News Channel 13.</i>

1155
01:31:29,407 --> 01:31:30,908
<i>- It's gonna be all right.
- Thanks, Jess.</i>

1156
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:34,116
<i>It's the largest case of fraud
this region has seen...</i>

1157
01:32:24,075 --> 01:32:25,574
<i>You know, when I was a kid,</i>

1158
01:32:25,699 --> 01:32:28,741
<i>I used to look at my dad
dressed in judge's robes</i>

1159
01:32:28,866 --> 01:32:32,366
<i>and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.</i>

1160
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:35,366
<i>And I don't think
I was far off.</i>

1161
01:32:36,574 --> 01:32:38,866
He had that quality
that judges have

1162
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:42,075
where they have
tremendous compassion,

1163
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:45,366
but they're also
ferocious at the same time.

1164
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:47,449
He wasn't afraid
of making enemies.

1165
01:32:47,532 --> 01:32:50,991
I think that's probably
why he had so many friends.

1166
01:32:51,075 --> 01:32:53,366
I had the chance, right before he
fell into the coma, to tell him

1167
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:56,824
that I was dedicating my run
for Attorney General to him.

1168
01:32:56,908 --> 01:32:58,908
And...

1169
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,574
He shook his head, "No,"
and I didn't understand why.

1170
01:33:05,532 --> 01:33:07,991
So I leaned in close, and...
He could whisper.

1171
01:33:08,075 --> 01:33:09,949
And he said to me,

1172
01:33:10,033 --> 01:33:12,449
"I'll take the win, not the
run."

1173
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:17,908
That was my dad, that was AI.

1174
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:25,741
Son, you wanna come with me?
Sure.

1175
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:37,157
Avery?
Yeah.

1176
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,783
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1177
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:40,282
Sure.

1178
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:43,115
Close the door.

1179
01:33:46,741 --> 01:33:48,157
What's wrong?

1180
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:50,824
We have to talk about AJ.

1181
01:33:51,407 --> 01:33:52,824
He wants to come
and live with you.

1182
01:33:52,908 --> 01:33:55,324
He won't stop
asking me about it.

1183
01:33:57,074 --> 01:33:58,491
Really?

1184
01:34:00,074 --> 01:34:04,407
I guess that's
a good idea at some point.

1185
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,658
I think he needs you. I think, if
he doesn't come and live with you,

1186
01:34:07,741 --> 01:34:10,574
he's gonna completely
go off the rails.

1187
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:13,157
It's just right now, you know,

1188
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:16,240
with the campaign and everything,
it's just not an ideal time.

1189
01:34:16,366 --> 01:34:19,032
I mean, what am I gonna do with him?
I don't know what he likes.

1190
01:34:20,699 --> 01:34:22,949
I just don't think it would
be good for him or anybody.

1191
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,199
I mean, come on, you know that.
Okay.

1192
01:34:26,282 --> 01:34:28,407
No, well,
you can tell him that.

1193
01:34:29,157 --> 01:34:30,990
Jennifer... What am I
supposed to tell him?

1194
01:34:31,074 --> 01:34:34,115
I just don't... Why are
you doing this right now?

1195
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:37,240
You can tell him now.

1196
01:34:38,574 --> 01:34:40,949
Tomorrow we're gonna
head to Buffalo in the morning.

1197
01:34:41,032 --> 01:34:42,658
Wednesday is outer boroughs
in New York City,

1198
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:43,908
and then the
AI Smith dinner at night.

1199
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:45,869
Do we have time to get there?
We do, absolutely.

1200
01:34:45,908 --> 01:34:47,866
We'll have our last event
close in Queens,

1201
01:34:47,949 --> 01:34:48,949
we'll hit the Upper West Side

1202
01:34:49,032 --> 01:34:50,199
and then we have to
be at the Waldorf.

1203
01:34:50,282 --> 01:34:52,324
How about Yusef, the driver we had for my dad?
Can we get Yusef?

1204
01:34:52,407 --> 01:34:53,783
Yeah, totally.
What's going on in Queens?

1205
01:34:53,866 --> 01:34:55,532
In Queens,
he's gonna do an event

1206
01:34:55,616 --> 01:34:57,574
on environmental issues.
Yeah.

1207
01:34:57,658 --> 01:35:00,074
Talking about some of the...
Protecting the Sound,

1208
01:35:00,157 --> 01:35:01,990
and some of
the environmental stuff.

1209
01:35:02,074 --> 01:35:04,324
And then Thursday
head to Rochester for lunch.

1210
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,658
You're gonna go to a place

1211
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,616
where you're gonna order something
called the Garbage Plate.

1212
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:09,990
Just want you to be prepared for it.
That's the picture.

1213
01:35:10,074 --> 01:35:11,199
We're gonna do that...
Did you see?

1214
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:12,532
Yeah, no, I've seen it.

1215
01:35:12,616 --> 01:35:14,282
And then Sunday morning,
black churches.

1216
01:35:14,366 --> 01:35:15,783
Oh, perfect.

1217
01:35:23,407 --> 01:35:24,948
<i>Avery Cross?</i>

1218
01:35:25,032 --> 01:35:27,157
<i>Yeah. AJ.</i>

1219
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,115
<i>AJ? Hi, AJ.
Yeah.</i>

1220
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:31,616
So what high school
are you coming from?

1221
01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:33,658
Troy High School. Yeah.
You're coming from Troy? Okay.

1222
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:36,658
So not too far away. What
brings you to Schenectady?

1223
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:38,407
Uh, my dad wanted me here.

1224
01:35:38,491 --> 01:35:39,532
Your dad wanted you here?

1225
01:35:39,616 --> 01:35:42,491
Yeah, for my senior year,
he wanted me to move here.

1226
01:35:42,574 --> 01:35:45,032
What about you? Did you wanna
come here for your senior year?

1227
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:47,282
I don't know. Yeah. I...

1228
01:35:48,407 --> 01:35:50,491
I guess not, not really.

1229
01:35:50,574 --> 01:35:52,074
Do you know anybody here?

1230
01:35:52,157 --> 01:35:53,449
At the high school?
No.

1231
01:35:53,532 --> 01:35:54,699
No. Don't know anybody?

1232
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:23,115
Just...
Just peek over your shoulder.

1233
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,240
Peek over your
fucking shoulder.

1234
01:36:25,324 --> 01:36:28,658
There. Hello. Hello. Hello.

1235
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:34,823
You don't like them girls?

1236
01:36:37,115 --> 01:36:38,699
I don't know,
maybe you're just used to it.

1237
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:42,032
They ain't got girls like that
where I come from. You feel me?

1238
01:36:42,115 --> 01:36:43,616
Where are you from?

1239
01:36:43,699 --> 01:36:45,115
Troy.

1240
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:48,449
Troy?
Yeah, you heard of Troy?

1241
01:36:48,532 --> 01:36:50,823
Yeah, I've heard of Troy.
Where's Troy at?

1242
01:36:50,907 --> 01:36:52,532
It's fucking
right next door, dude.

1243
01:36:52,616 --> 01:36:54,032
Right next door?

1244
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:56,240
I would've guessed
you were from Long Island.

1245
01:36:56,782 --> 01:36:58,324
Where's that?

1246
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:04,032
It's where people
that talk like you come from.

1247
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,199
B, I'm bored as a motherfucker
around here, dude.

1248
01:37:08,282 --> 01:37:09,948
I've been here for, like,
fucking three days,

1249
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:11,782
I'm bored out of
my fucking mind.

1250
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:13,658
Welcome to Schenectady.

1251
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:16,491
What do you dudes
do for fun, nothing?

1252
01:37:16,574 --> 01:37:18,990
This is it? This is
what I got, for a year?

1253
01:37:19,074 --> 01:37:20,199
No, we got some things.

1254
01:37:20,282 --> 01:37:21,740
What?

1255
01:37:22,491 --> 01:37:23,865
Don't say, like, a mall.

1256
01:37:23,948 --> 01:37:27,282
If you say a fucking mall, B,
like, I swear to God...

1257
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:32,616
What do you do?

1258
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:34,282
I get high.

1259
01:37:36,658 --> 01:37:38,532
We do some of that around here.

1260
01:37:38,616 --> 01:37:41,366
I could tell you smoked.
I seen you from back there.

1261
01:37:41,449 --> 01:37:45,240
You one of them loner...
Loner-stoners is what I call 'em, right?

1262
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:46,574
You like to get high and, like,

1263
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:49,407
chill in your room
and draw and shit.

1264
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,115
So what you trying to do with
the rest of this day, then?

1265
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:55,907
You trying to go to math class?

1266
01:37:57,157 --> 01:37:58,782
You wanna go get high?

1267
01:38:03,115 --> 01:38:05,032
Let's go.
All right, let's go.

1268
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:15,532
You know what this remind me of?
The Goonies.

1269
01:38:15,616 --> 01:38:18,574
You know that movie? Where
they're, like, all in a cave?

1270
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:22,282
You want a cigarette,
just ask, don't worry.

1271
01:38:23,324 --> 01:38:24,907
I'll take a cigarette.

1272
01:38:25,407 --> 01:38:28,324
I like smoking cigarettes
when I'm high.

1273
01:38:28,698 --> 01:38:30,657
You like smoking
when you're smoking?

1274
01:38:33,698 --> 01:38:37,115
You smoke menthols, man?
Like a breath of fresh air.

1275
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,990
Like a breath of fresh air.
But you don't care.

1276
01:38:40,074 --> 01:38:44,532
You got the smoke puff
blowing everywhere, I swear.

1277
01:38:44,615 --> 01:38:47,740
Yo, here we go,
I said my spit is my MO.

1278
01:38:47,823 --> 01:38:50,532
My mouth is my gun, I shoot
up your whole squadron

1279
01:38:50,615 --> 01:38:53,449
with one flip of my tongue.
And you done.

1280
01:38:53,532 --> 01:38:55,074
When did you write that?

1281
01:38:55,157 --> 01:38:57,449
No, I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.

1282
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,657
<i>Fucking quiet around here.</i>

1283
01:39:02,032 --> 01:39:03,511
<i>Shit, though, when I was a kid,</i>

1284
01:39:03,532 --> 01:39:05,573
<i>there were always kids
playing here, you know?</i>

1285
01:39:05,657 --> 01:39:07,948
<i>Oh, you came here
when you was a kid?</i>

1286
01:39:08,032 --> 01:39:10,740
<i>Yeah, man, I'd come
here with my parents sometimes.</i>

1287
01:39:11,782 --> 01:39:13,990
<i>Are your parents
still together?</i>

1288
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:15,573
Yeah.

1289
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:19,449
That's cool,
they're still together.

1290
01:39:19,532 --> 01:39:21,240
Yeah, it's all right.

1291
01:39:22,074 --> 01:39:23,948
It's not my real dad, though.

1292
01:39:24,782 --> 01:39:26,823
Where's your real dad at?

1293
01:39:28,366 --> 01:39:32,907
Oh, he died, actually, like in
a car accident or something.

1294
01:39:33,324 --> 01:39:34,782
Shit.

1295
01:39:37,282 --> 01:39:39,449
Yeah, this is kind bud, dude.

1296
01:39:40,573 --> 01:39:43,324
But you know where
I could score some X?

1297
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,823
Yeah.

1298
01:39:51,865 --> 01:39:53,282
For tonight?

1299
01:39:53,366 --> 01:39:55,615
Well, we just did our
downer, we gotta get up.

1300
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:05,573
Remember, come back
by yourself. All right?

1301
01:40:05,657 --> 01:40:07,115
Yeah, man, you got it.

1302
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:14,531
All right.

1303
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:17,032
Let's go.

1304
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:22,448
Let me see it.
What?

1305
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:25,865
Let me see the fucking drugs.
You fucking crazy, man?

1306
01:40:27,074 --> 01:40:29,157
Let me see my fucking drugs.

1307
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:34,282
Fucking nuts, man.

1308
01:40:35,115 --> 01:40:37,865
What the fuck?
I gave you $500.

1309
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,366
Yeah, that's 20 hits.

1310
01:40:39,448 --> 01:40:41,240
Yo, that's inflation
in Scheneck, right?

1311
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:47,990
Oh, yo, what the fuck, son?

1312
01:40:48,074 --> 01:40:51,282
Dead ass, the fucking 5-0.
Don't worry about it, man.

1313
01:40:51,782 --> 01:40:54,199
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Police.

1314
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:56,324
Let me see your hands.
Police! Get on the ground!

1315
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,115
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
All right! Fuck!

1316
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:01,573
Interlace your fingers.

1317
01:41:07,782 --> 01:41:10,907
<i>He was buying
ecstasy from a Schenectady kid.</i>

1318
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:12,324
And who arrested him?

1319
01:41:12,406 --> 01:41:15,115
A couple of beat cops.
McCracken and Potter.

1320
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,865
You know these guys?
Mmm-hmm.

1321
01:41:16,948 --> 01:41:19,199
They'll sit on it
if I ask them to.

1322
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:22,074
Did anybody
else see him come in?

1323
01:41:22,157 --> 01:41:24,324
No. I made sure of that.

1324
01:41:30,573 --> 01:41:32,907
Did you get any
sense that he knew this kid or...

1325
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:34,698
Yeah, friends.

1326
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:37,062
- Just the two of 'em?
- Yeah.

1327
01:41:37,115 --> 01:41:38,531
Okay.

1328
01:41:38,615 --> 01:41:40,323
What's this other kid's name?

1329
01:41:40,406 --> 01:41:43,907
Jason Kancam. Got busted a few
years ago for shoplifting.

1330
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:46,199
- What's his name?
- Jason Kancam.

1331
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,782
An aimless youth.

1332
01:41:56,657 --> 01:41:58,323
Gordon, can we kill
the mic on Room 3?

1333
01:41:58,406 --> 01:41:59,907
Yeah.

1334
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,948
Dad, I fucked up. I know...

1335
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,448
And I know you don't have time to
deal with this stuff right now.

1336
01:42:15,531 --> 01:42:16,948
Not him, okay?

1337
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:20,657
What? I want you to
leave him alone.

1338
01:42:21,907 --> 01:42:23,448
All right?

1339
01:42:24,406 --> 01:42:26,115
Okay?
Why?

1340
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:30,573
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me?

1341
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:33,823
I want you to leave that
fucking kid alone, all right?

1342
01:42:33,907 --> 01:42:36,199
Look at me. Look at me.

1343
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,990
You wanted to come
live with me, right?

1344
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,157
You think this is easy for me,
during this time, huh?

1345
01:42:47,323 --> 01:42:51,239
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it for you.

1346
01:42:52,365 --> 01:42:54,032
You can have anything you want,

1347
01:42:54,115 --> 01:42:56,157
but I don't want you
to touch that kid.

1348
01:42:56,948 --> 01:43:00,074
You leave him alone.
Do you under-fucking-stand me?

1349
01:43:00,157 --> 01:43:02,323
Say yes.
Yes.

1350
01:43:03,657 --> 01:43:06,448
Look at me and say yes.
Yes.

1351
01:43:25,531 --> 01:43:27,365
<i>Can you state
your name for the record?</i>

1352
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:28,907
<i>Jason Kancam.</i>

1353
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,657
<i>Jason, how old are you?
Seventeen.</i>

1354
01:43:32,074 --> 01:43:33,698
Are your parents here today?

1355
01:43:34,657 --> 01:43:35,865
Yes. Yes.

1356
01:43:35,948 --> 01:43:37,406
Can you come up, please?

1357
01:43:43,948 --> 01:43:45,448
You're Jason's parents?
Yes.

1358
01:43:45,531 --> 01:43:47,239
Jason, you've been charged
with criminal possession

1359
01:43:47,323 --> 01:43:49,365
of a controlled substance
in the third degree.

1360
01:43:49,448 --> 01:43:51,365
Counselor, do you waive a
formal reading of the charges?

1361
01:43:51,448 --> 01:43:52,448
Yes, please, Your Honor.

1362
01:43:52,531 --> 01:43:53,531
In regards
to my client's status,

1363
01:43:53,615 --> 01:43:55,323
there has been a discussion
with the District Attorney.

1364
01:43:55,406 --> 01:43:57,740
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case potentially resolved today.

1365
01:43:57,823 --> 01:43:59,990
So I'd ask that the court
put it on for second call.

1366
01:44:00,074 --> 01:44:01,114
Second call.

1367
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:02,448
This is a C felony,

1368
01:44:02,531 --> 01:44:05,573
so Jason could do anywhere
between five and 15 years.

1369
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:08,114
But I'm getting the impression
from the prosecutor

1370
01:44:08,198 --> 01:44:10,990
that they may be willing to
reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

1371
01:44:11,074 --> 01:44:14,698
The offer on his particular
case would be time served,

1372
01:44:14,782 --> 01:44:16,101
which is the day
he spent in jail,

1373
01:44:16,114 --> 01:44:17,823
and a fine,
and that would be it.

1374
01:44:17,948 --> 01:44:20,032
Can he come home with us today?
He can.

1375
01:44:20,114 --> 01:44:22,393
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody's looking out for you.

1376
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,406
Look, I didn't mean to get you
busted the other night, all right?

1377
01:44:58,073 --> 01:44:59,573
I'm sorry.

1378
01:45:00,073 --> 01:45:02,531
Yeah, it was a pretty
shitty fucking night.

1379
01:45:03,657 --> 01:45:05,490
But don't worry about it.

1380
01:45:06,615 --> 01:45:09,073
I was out of there
in five fucking minutes, dude.

1381
01:45:10,698 --> 01:45:14,156
You think I'm gonna sit there and
get fucked up the ass all night?

1382
01:45:17,156 --> 01:45:20,073
And what happened
when you got home? Huh?

1383
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:24,239
Went upstairs.

1384
01:45:25,406 --> 01:45:28,573
Tried to go to sleep, but I was
still trippin' like a mo'fucker.

1385
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:32,531
Why, what happened to you
when you got home?

1386
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,281
I'm cool, man.

1387
01:45:36,365 --> 01:45:38,782
Your moms was all
worried and shit?

1388
01:45:39,365 --> 01:45:40,989
Oh, man, my mom's...

1389
01:45:43,865 --> 01:45:45,281
I'm cool, man.

1390
01:45:45,615 --> 01:45:47,073
Really?

1391
01:45:48,406 --> 01:45:50,490
'Cause I saw that guy today.

1392
01:45:52,531 --> 01:45:53,947
What guy?

1393
01:45:54,531 --> 01:45:55,947
Your dad.

1394
01:45:57,698 --> 01:45:59,615
That's your fucking dad.

1395
01:46:01,073 --> 01:46:02,490
When did he move in?

1396
01:46:07,323 --> 01:46:09,740
What the fuck you
talking about, AJ?

1397
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:13,740
Just wanna know. I figured out...
What the fuck's your problem?

1398
01:46:18,114 --> 01:46:19,657
What the fuck's your problem?

1399
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:22,365
Chill, dude. Chill.
What's your problem, AJ?

1400
01:46:23,573 --> 01:46:25,448
Just fucking around.

1401
01:46:26,906 --> 01:46:28,740
Don't be so serious.

1402
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,573
You got a fucking temper, B.

1403
01:46:34,989 --> 01:46:39,114
You need to watch that shit. It's
gonna get you into fucking trouble.

1404
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:46,657
How was school, Vanessa? It was okay.
I had trouble with math.

1405
01:46:47,782 --> 01:46:49,864
Hey, what's the deal
with my dad?

1406
01:46:55,073 --> 01:46:56,490
What?

1407
01:47:00,615 --> 01:47:03,156
What, did you like really
hate him or something?

1408
01:47:06,073 --> 01:47:07,698
What was his name?

1409
01:47:08,323 --> 01:47:10,156
I'm not doing this.
What was his first name?

1410
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:11,782
I'm not doing this.

1411
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:22,406
How come Mom never
talks to me about my dad?

1412
01:47:23,989 --> 01:47:25,906
I'm your father.

1413
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:29,573
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1414
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:38,531
It's her business to talk about
it, not talk about it, you know?

1415
01:47:40,531 --> 01:47:42,698
Grandma used to tell me some.

1416
01:47:43,114 --> 01:47:45,073
Yeah?
What did she used to say?

1417
01:47:45,739 --> 01:47:47,406
She said, like...

1418
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:51,531
Just that he was,
like, an outlaw.

1419
01:47:52,365 --> 01:47:53,739
You know?

1420
01:47:53,989 --> 01:47:55,947
Sound cool to you?

1421
01:47:57,657 --> 01:47:58,947
I don't know.

1422
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,281
He's not your father.
Not really.

1423
01:48:04,031 --> 01:48:05,864
Just some guy with a baby.

1424
01:48:07,573 --> 01:48:09,198
I'm your father.

1425
01:48:12,406 --> 01:48:15,822
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.

1426
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,822
Can you at least
tell me his name?

1427
01:49:52,323 --> 01:49:53,781
Hello?

1428
01:50:02,656 --> 01:50:04,073
Yeah?

1429
01:50:06,073 --> 01:50:07,864
I'm looking for Robin.

1430
01:50:08,906 --> 01:50:11,406
Yeah, I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?

1431
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:13,073
Um...

1432
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:16,864
I was hoping to talk with
you about Luke Glanton.

1433
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,906
I'm his son.

1434
01:50:24,114 --> 01:50:26,114
You're Luke Glanton's son?

1435
01:50:27,156 --> 01:50:28,739
Yeah.

1436
01:50:32,656 --> 01:50:35,365
Well, come on back, get a beer.

1437
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:39,448
Bet it's down here in this box,

1438
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:43,239
if I remember rightly.

1439
01:50:45,906 --> 01:50:47,572
God.

1440
01:50:58,822 --> 01:51:01,989
That guy's your dad.
That's him there.

1441
01:51:02,073 --> 01:51:05,822
And that's the pig there,
the one that bagged him.

1442
01:51:06,906 --> 01:51:08,822
What happened to him?

1443
01:51:08,906 --> 01:51:10,406
Who, the cop?

1444
01:51:10,489 --> 01:51:13,781
Oh, forget about him, man.
Don't... Don't start there.

1445
01:51:14,572 --> 01:51:18,614
I'll show you good things. I'll
show you good things. Come on.

1446
01:51:21,614 --> 01:51:23,489
You are standing
right where your dad

1447
01:51:23,572 --> 01:51:25,405
used to stand
and we used to talk.

1448
01:51:26,822 --> 01:51:28,947
He was a good guy, your dad.

1449
01:51:30,405 --> 01:51:32,864
Oh, wow.
Yeah, those glasses.

1450
01:51:32,947 --> 01:51:34,346
I haven't seen those
in a long time.

1451
01:51:34,405 --> 01:51:37,156
They're his,
those goofy glasses.

1452
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:38,656
These were his?
Yeah.

1453
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:41,572
You can keep those. He would've
wanted you to have them.

1454
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:43,781
Was he good at anything?

1455
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:47,114
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle
rider I've ever seen in my life.

1456
01:51:47,947 --> 01:51:49,281
The best.
Yeah?

1457
01:51:49,364 --> 01:51:52,822
Best. Never seen
another one like him. Best.

1458
01:51:53,739 --> 01:51:57,073
He was like nothing. Rare.

1459
01:51:58,405 --> 01:52:00,073
Were you guys good friends?

1460
01:52:02,614 --> 01:52:04,405
Yeah, I think we were.

1461
01:52:05,906 --> 01:52:07,697
You still got his bike?

1462
01:52:11,947 --> 01:52:14,281
No, his bike's gone. Yeah.

1463
01:52:16,322 --> 01:52:18,073
Police took it.

1464
01:52:18,864 --> 01:52:20,947
I think they cut it up,
you know.

1465
01:52:22,073 --> 01:52:24,530
They were angry with him.
I know that.

1466
01:52:24,614 --> 01:52:26,073
They were real mad with him.

1467
01:52:27,572 --> 01:52:30,822
I can show you some other things,
too, if you want to see more.

1468
01:52:30,906 --> 01:52:32,322
Yeah?
Yeah.

1469
01:52:37,947 --> 01:52:39,614
Why don't you put
the glasses on?

1470
01:52:40,364 --> 01:52:43,989
For sure, he would've said
they were left there for you.

1471
01:52:44,614 --> 01:52:46,073
No doubt.

1472
01:52:48,739 --> 01:52:51,572
Put 'em on, if you want.
Go on, put 'em on.

1473
01:52:51,656 --> 01:52:53,947
Yeah?
Come on, I'll tell you.

1474
01:52:55,073 --> 01:52:57,405
Yeah. Yeah!

1475
01:52:57,947 --> 01:53:00,364
Yeah?
Yeah. You're calling him back.

1476
01:53:20,947 --> 01:53:23,947
Jason! Jason.

1477
01:53:27,073 --> 01:53:28,739
Let me talk to you.

1478
01:53:29,073 --> 01:53:32,739
Look, man, I wanted to say I'm sorry
about what happened earlier, all right?

1479
01:53:32,822 --> 01:53:34,656
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.

1480
01:53:36,614 --> 01:53:38,989
You lost my money, all right?

1481
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:40,238
Like, that's...
I think that's all

1482
01:53:40,322 --> 01:53:42,322
I need to really
fucking say, all right?

1483
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:44,781
But I'm willing to
fucking squash it, okay?

1484
01:53:44,906 --> 01:53:47,280
If you do the squashing,
I'll be the squasher.

1485
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:50,906
I said I'm sorry, brother.
I meant that shit.

1486
01:53:52,156 --> 01:53:54,489
What you thinking?
Okay.

1487
01:53:54,572 --> 01:53:56,822
You dig?
Okay.

1488
01:53:57,822 --> 01:53:59,447
We good?
All right.

1489
01:54:00,073 --> 01:54:01,739
Dude, dude, yo, listen.

1490
01:54:01,822 --> 01:54:04,697
I'm having a fucking party
at my pop's place tonight.

1491
01:54:04,781 --> 01:54:07,280
Dude, my pop's is fuckin'
off-the-chain, B. Come along.

1492
01:54:07,405 --> 01:54:09,781
I can't do that, man, I'm sorry.
Why?

1493
01:54:09,906 --> 01:54:11,989
Can't make it tonight. You got
family stuff you gotta do?

1494
01:54:12,114 --> 01:54:13,656
No, but I got stuff I gotta do.

1495
01:54:13,739 --> 01:54:15,114
Nah.

1496
01:54:17,572 --> 01:54:18,989
You wanna squash it, right?

1497
01:54:19,906 --> 01:54:22,614
We squashed it, man.
So then come tonight.

1498
01:54:25,447 --> 01:54:26,906
You want me to come
to your party tonight?

1499
01:54:26,947 --> 01:54:28,614
I want you to come to my party.
Is that what you want?

1500
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:30,489
All right, cool, I'll see you tonight.
All right. Hold up.

1501
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:32,530
I'll see you tonight.
Another one. Hold up.

1502
01:54:32,614 --> 01:54:34,073
Do me a favor, B.

1503
01:54:34,155 --> 01:54:36,155
Bring some Oxys, all right?
Then we straight.

1504
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:37,530
No, man.
What you mean, no?

1505
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:38,864
You gotta make it correct.
I'll see you, man.

1506
01:54:38,947 --> 01:54:40,322
Nah, nah. You're not...
I'll see you, okay?

1507
01:54:40,405 --> 01:54:42,656
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We ain't seeing shit.

1508
01:54:42,739 --> 01:54:44,530
You coming tonight? Yes.

1509
01:54:44,614 --> 01:54:47,364
You copping my Oxys?
Yes. You got it?

1510
01:54:47,489 --> 01:54:50,364
All right, sounds good. All right,
sounds like a fucking plan.

1511
01:54:51,739 --> 01:54:54,614
It don't gotta be
$500 worth, you know.

1512
01:54:55,489 --> 01:54:58,405
Yo, J!
Keep your head up, bro.

1513
01:55:33,614 --> 01:55:37,155
Same insurance and
everything else with all that stuff?

1514
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:38,864
- Yes.
- All right.

1515
01:55:38,947 --> 01:55:41,614
All right, I'll get to work
on this for you right away.

1516
01:55:46,489 --> 01:55:47,947
Be right back.

1517
01:56:08,614 --> 01:56:10,155
How'd you make out
with the weather?

1518
01:56:10,238 --> 01:56:12,781
We did all right. A
little water in the basement.

1519
01:56:12,906 --> 01:56:15,572
- Made out pretty good.
- Yeah.

1520
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:19,030
So much water in
my basement from that flood

1521
01:56:19,113 --> 01:56:22,155
that the whole house
is gonna have mold in it.

1522
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:25,530
Okay, looks like I've got
everything I need on that.

1523
01:56:25,614 --> 01:56:27,988
Couple more things
I wanna check in here.

1524
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:30,113
Okay.

1525
01:56:32,946 --> 01:56:34,905
Processed here for you.

1526
01:56:37,946 --> 01:56:40,946
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

1527
01:56:43,405 --> 01:56:45,072
What the fuck are you doing?

1528
01:56:52,072 --> 01:56:53,946
You little motherfucker,
get back here!

1529
01:56:54,072 --> 01:56:55,447
Get fucking...

1530
01:57:29,946 --> 01:57:31,405
You made it.

1531
01:57:40,322 --> 01:57:43,113
Hey, Oxys! Hey!

1532
01:57:47,405 --> 01:57:49,781
All right, I got one fucking question.
One question.

1533
01:57:50,113 --> 01:57:51,322
Ho-ho-ho!

1534
01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:53,322
Who wants some fuckin' Oxys?

1535
01:57:57,946 --> 01:58:01,821
Hello. There we go, there
we go, there we go. Hello.

1536
01:58:05,238 --> 01:58:06,364
Who ain't got 'em?

1537
01:58:06,447 --> 01:58:08,614
Who ain't got 'em,
hold your fucking hands out!

1538
01:58:15,405 --> 01:58:16,821
Take it.

1539
01:58:43,905 --> 01:58:45,322
Everything's slowing down.

1540
01:58:45,489 --> 01:58:46,946
You lost?

1541
01:58:52,738 --> 01:58:54,238
They're looking at you.

1542
01:59:52,738 --> 01:59:54,489
Who... Who is that?

1543
01:59:57,572 --> 01:59:59,072
Is that AJ's dad?

1544
01:59:59,155 --> 02:00:00,572
I think so.

1545
02:00:14,072 --> 02:00:16,072
Is everything all right?

1546
02:00:26,322 --> 02:00:27,780
You okay?

1547
02:00:49,072 --> 02:00:50,988
You got something you need to tell me?
Yo, what are you...

1548
02:00:51,072 --> 02:00:54,113
What do you gotta tell me? Huh?
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1549
02:00:55,072 --> 02:00:56,780
Yo, get the fuck outta here.

1550
02:00:56,905 --> 02:00:58,780
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Get the fuck outta here!

1551
02:00:58,905 --> 02:00:59,946
Think I'm stupid?

1552
02:01:00,072 --> 02:01:02,280
Get the fuck out...
What, you can't fucking hear?

1553
02:01:02,405 --> 02:01:03,863
What's your pop do?

1554
02:01:03,946 --> 02:01:06,696
Fuck's your problem, man?
Fuck off.

1555
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:10,280
Here's the fucking door.
There, you motherfucker!

1556
02:01:10,405 --> 02:01:12,280
Get the fuck out.
Fuck you, man.

1557
02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:14,405
Fuck you and your
old fuckin' pig!

1558
02:01:14,488 --> 02:01:15,946
Get the fuck outta here!

1559
02:01:17,946 --> 02:01:19,405
What's your problem?

1560
02:01:21,571 --> 02:01:23,738
Fuck him up.
Fuck him up.

1561
02:01:24,738 --> 02:01:26,364
Calm down!

1562
02:01:52,613 --> 02:01:55,780
Jason.
Can you hear me, baby?

1563
02:01:58,613 --> 02:02:00,113
Vanessa, get your father.

1564
02:02:04,113 --> 02:02:05,571
Baby.

1565
02:02:10,571 --> 02:02:12,113
You're a liar.

1566
02:02:20,738 --> 02:02:22,113
He woke up?

1567
02:02:24,613 --> 02:02:26,072
He say something?

1568
02:02:29,404 --> 02:02:30,780
Hey, Jason.

1569
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:40,280
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm gonna get the car. Okay?

1570
02:03:33,946 --> 02:03:35,571
What the hell happened to you?

1571
02:03:35,655 --> 02:03:37,197
Yo, I need your help,
all right?

1572
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:40,155
Yeah, man, all right. What
you need my help for, man?

1573
02:03:40,237 --> 02:03:41,821
I need a gun.

1574
02:03:41,905 --> 02:03:43,072
You need a gun?

1575
02:03:43,946 --> 02:03:45,404
Come on, man.

1576
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:44,905
What the fuck? What the
fuck are you doing?

1577
02:04:45,404 --> 02:04:47,404
Wait, wait, what are you...
Get on the floor!

1578
02:04:47,905 --> 02:04:51,072
Get on the fucking floor!
Oh, my God! Fuck!

1579
02:04:57,072 --> 02:05:00,613
All right. All right, I'll
see you tomorrow. All right.

1580
02:05:51,696 --> 02:05:53,404
Are you alone?

1581
02:05:53,488 --> 02:05:54,696
What's going on?

1582
02:05:55,237 --> 02:05:57,404
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

1583
02:06:00,863 --> 02:06:02,154
We're gonna get in your car

1584
02:06:03,905 --> 02:06:05,780
and you're just
gonna keep driving.

1585
02:06:07,696 --> 02:06:10,821
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot
you in the back of your head.

1586
02:06:12,112 --> 02:06:13,529
Go.

1587
02:06:51,821 --> 02:06:53,279
Turn around.

1588
02:06:58,112 --> 02:06:59,571
Turn around.

1589
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:25,571
How did you get into my house?

1590
02:07:31,029 --> 02:07:32,488
AJ let me in.

1591
02:07:35,863 --> 02:07:37,321
Is he okay?

1592
02:07:43,904 --> 02:07:45,363
Is he?

1593
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,613
Give me your wallet.

1594
02:07:56,112 --> 02:07:57,529
Where's your wallet?

1595
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:00,488
It's in my jacket.
Give me your jacket.

1596
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:04,112
You want my wallet?
Here, take my wallet.

1597
02:08:04,488 --> 02:08:07,404
Want my jacket? My jacket.

1598
02:08:11,738 --> 02:08:13,154
Get on your knees.

1599
02:08:14,363 --> 02:08:15,945
What did you do to my son?

1600
02:08:16,029 --> 02:08:18,154
Get on your fucking knees!

1601
02:08:29,655 --> 02:08:32,446
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1602
02:08:33,321 --> 02:08:35,321
Please, just tell me
my son's all right.

1603
02:08:37,613 --> 02:08:39,446
This isn't about
your fucking son.

1604
02:09:11,154 --> 02:09:12,820
I'm sorry, Jason.

1605
02:09:16,279 --> 02:09:17,696
I'm sorry.

1606
02:10:54,862 --> 02:10:57,029
<i>It was
a tight race for over a year</i>

1607
02:10:57,112 --> 02:10:58,820
<i>between Cross and Kellerman,</i>

1608
02:10:58,904 --> 02:11:01,612
<i>and then unprecedented events
over the last month</i>

1609
02:11:01,695 --> 02:11:04,029
<i>made to threaten
Cross' election bid.</i>

1610
02:11:04,112 --> 02:11:06,904
<i>First, allegations of underage
drinking at his house,</i>

1611
02:11:06,987 --> 02:11:10,112
<i>and then a violent robbery from
a yet-unidentified intruder</i>

1612
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:13,570
<i>that left his son hospitalized
with a concussion.</i>

1613
02:11:13,654 --> 02:11:17,112
<i>Remarkably, Cross has managed
to right his campaign,</i>

1614
02:11:17,196 --> 02:11:19,446
<i>and now, as you see,
the District Attorney</i>

1615
02:11:19,528 --> 02:11:22,237
<i>has just won the election
for Attorney General.</i>

1616
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:24,654
<i>We will go live now
as Senator McFarley prepares</i>

1617
02:11:24,737 --> 02:11:26,321
<i>to address
the crowd of supporters.</i>

1618
02:11:28,154 --> 02:11:32,363
<i>I've had the honor of knowing
Avery Cross since he was a boy.</i>

1619
02:11:40,363 --> 02:11:44,862
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it's my
pleasure and my greatest honor</i>

1620
02:11:44,945 --> 02:11:47,279
<i>to introduce
the next Attorney General</i>

1621
02:11:47,363 --> 02:11:50,321
<i>of the state of New York, Avery Cross!
Go. Curtain.</i>

1622
02:11:50,404 --> 02:11:53,570
All right, AJ, you gotta go.
You gotta go out there.

1623
02:11:53,654 --> 02:11:56,154
There's a flag.
Go. Go where the kid is. Go.

1624
02:12:14,904 --> 02:12:16,321
<i>Thank you!</i>

1625
02:12:16,779 --> 02:12:17,987
<i>Thank you.</i>

1626
02:12:20,363 --> 02:12:21,779
<i>Thank you.</i>

1627
02:12:24,112 --> 02:12:25,570
<i>Thank you.</i>

1628
02:12:28,987 --> 02:12:30,445
<i>Thank you.</i>

1629
02:12:32,363 --> 02:12:34,279
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1630
02:12:36,363 --> 02:12:39,695
Avery! Avery! Avery!

1631
02:13:55,987 --> 02:13:57,445
Yeah?

1632
02:13:57,528 --> 02:13:58,987
Mr. Anthony?

1633
02:13:59,071 --> 02:14:00,112
Yeah.

1634
02:14:00,196 --> 02:14:04,695
Hey, I, uh... I called you, said
I was gonna be out here today.

1635
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:08,779
Oh, right, of course.
Yeah. Well, you're early.

1636
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:12,904
Yeah. There's only, like,
one bus headed out here.

1637
02:14:14,196 --> 02:14:15,320
So...

1638
02:14:15,403 --> 02:14:17,236
You're not from
around here, huh?

1639
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:20,196
No. I'm headed out west.

1640
02:14:20,654 --> 02:14:23,154
So you ready?
Wanna go take a look at it?

1641
02:14:23,236 --> 02:14:24,316
Yeah.
I'll just get my coat.

1642
02:14:24,362 --> 02:14:25,820
All right.
All right.

1643
02:14:34,987 --> 02:14:36,445
It runs great.

1644
02:14:37,779 --> 02:14:41,112
It's got a lot of miles on it, but
I kept up with the maintenance.

1645
02:14:43,278 --> 02:14:44,695
How much you want for it?

1646
02:14:46,445 --> 02:14:48,945
Well, I was thinking
I need five.

1647
02:14:50,528 --> 02:14:51,945
All right.

1648
02:15:05,654 --> 02:15:07,654
You ever ridden
one of these before?
