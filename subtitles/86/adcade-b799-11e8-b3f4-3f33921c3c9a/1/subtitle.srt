1
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,798
Get Charlie.

2
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:32,036
Dr. Holloway!

3
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:36,078
Charlie!

4
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:45,320
What?

5
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,796
Come quick!

6
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,520
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...

7
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,640
...years. Maybe older.

8
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,679
You gotta be kidding me.

9
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,116
It's the same configuration.

10
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,995
I mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

11
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:10,399
I think they want us
to come and find them.

12
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:14,039
Yeah.

13
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:19,718
What happened to that man?

14
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:20,919
He died.

15
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,677
Why aren't you helping them?

16
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,562
They don't want my help.

17
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,203
Their God is different than ours.

18
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,797
Why did he die?

19
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,515
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

20
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:35,878
Like Mummy?

21
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:38,998
Like Mummy.

22
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,242
Where do they go?

23
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,715
Everyone has their own word.

24
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,079
Heaven.

25
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:48,520
Paradise.

26
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:52,479
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

27
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,236
How do you know it's beautiful?

28
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,637
That's what I choose to believe.

29
00:08:57,964 --> 00:08:59,522
What do you believe, Ellie?

30
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,202
Good morning, David.

31
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:36,643
Transmitting message.

32
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,476
No response.

33
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:52,203
Whilst this articulation...

34
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,003
...is attested in
the Indo-European descendants...

35
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,961
...as a purely paralinguistic form...

36
00:09:57,124 --> 00:10:00,082
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back...

37
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:02,121
...five millennia or more.

38
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,197
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.

39
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,434
Repeat after me.

40
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,353
Perfect.

41
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:22,119
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes?

42
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,435
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

43
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,718
You do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood!

44
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,833
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

45
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:38,592
And you're barmy.

46
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,119
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

47
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,637
Well, what's the trick, then?

48
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:52,442
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

49
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:56,035
The trick, William Potter...

50
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:59,162
...is not minding that it hurts.

51
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:07,362
The trick, William Potter...

52
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:11,280
...is not minding that it hurts.

53
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:25,956
Attention:

54
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,477
Destination threshold.

55
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:28,919
Attention:

56
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:30,995
Destination threshold.

57
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,833
Attention: Destination threshold.

58
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:34,593
Robe.

59
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,832
How long?

60
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:49,279
Two years, four months, 18 days...

61
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,593
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

62
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,118
Any casualties?

63
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:53,713
Casualties, ma'am?

64
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:54,919
Has anyone died?

65
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,275
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

66
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:00,763
Well, then wake them up.

67
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,441
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

68
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:16,117
My name is David.

69
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,719
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

70
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,875
...as a result of the stasis.

71
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,921
It's all right. Perfectly normal.

72
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:24,840
Ellie.

73
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:27,403
We're here, baby.

74
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:32,360
There, there.

75
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:36,240
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.

76
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,077
Hydration aids muscle mass.

77
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:47,002
All crew, consume shakes
with high caloric content.

78
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,074
What the hell is that?

79
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:57,914
It's Christmas.

80
00:13:58,324 --> 00:13:59,393
We need the holidays...

81
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,043
...to show time is still moving.

82
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:02,080
Mission briefing...

83
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:03,723
...is about to start, captain.

84
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,717
Might wanna make your way down.

85
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,194
Well, I haven't had any breakfast yet.

86
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:10,037
Is this seat taken?

87
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,598
Hi, I'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.

88
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,440
Okay.

89
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,960
Look, no offense, but...

90
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,440
...I've been asleep two years.

91
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,518
I ain't here to be your friend.

92
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:27,078
I'm here to make money.

93
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:29,438
You got that?

94
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:33,164
Okay.

95
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,078
I bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

96
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,121
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

97
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,434
It's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

98
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,400
Come on.

99
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:43,395
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.

100
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,237
You look nervous, El.

101
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,523
- I'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- I know you will.

102
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,560
Good morning.

103
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,718
For those of you I hired personally...

104
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,720
...it's nice to see you again.

105
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,193
For the rest of you, I am Meredith Vickers.
It's my job to make sure you do yours.

106
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,152
Okay, then. On with the show.

107
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,196
Weyland Corporation.

108
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:16,355
Building better worlds.

109
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:19,117
Hello, friends.

110
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,676
My name is Peter Weyland.

111
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,362
I am your employer.

112
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:31,439
I am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

113
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:34,274
...you have reached your destination.

114
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,835
And I am long dead.

115
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,321
May I rest in peace.

116
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,521
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

117
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:46,596
And he is the closest thing to a son
I will ever have.

118
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:49,523
Unfortunately, he is not human.

119
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:50,998
He will never grow old...

120
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:53,041
...and he will never die.

121
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:57,001
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

122
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:01,316
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

123
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:02,599
A soul.

124
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,236
I have spent my entire...

125
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:07,759
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

126
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,477
Where do we come from?

127
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,203
What is our purpose?

128
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,837
What happens when we die?

129
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:17,278
And I have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

130
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,797
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

131
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,995
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

132
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:30,475
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

133
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:34,080
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

134
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:39,554
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

135
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,074
Doctors, please.

136
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,120
The floor is yours.

137
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,195
Okay, wow.

138
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:57,683
All right.

139
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,562
I never had to follow a ghost before.

140
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:01,880
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

141
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:03,113
...are here.

142
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:15,233
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

143
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,200
That's...

144
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:19,561
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

145
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:22,517
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

146
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:25,642
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

147
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:29,638
It's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the Isle of Skye in Scotland.

148
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,963
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

149
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:37,082
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet....

150
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:41,799
The same pictogram...

151
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:45,434
...showing men worshipping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

152
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:48,477
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

153
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,518
And the only galactic system
that matched...

154
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,958
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

155
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:59,083
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

156
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,677
But it just so happens...

157
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:03,598
...that that system...

158
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:06,073
...has a sun...

159
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,437
...a lot like ours.

160
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:13,596
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

161
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:17,159
Just one planet with a moon...

162
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:19,121
...capable of sustaining life.

163
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:22,515
And we arrived there this morning.

164
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:29,314
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. Is that right?

165
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:31,792
- No.
- Yeah.

166
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:36,319
No. Not a map, an invitation.

167
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,803
From who?

168
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,916
We call them Engineers.

169
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,237
Engineers?

170
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:44,200
Do you mind...

171
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,922
...telling us what they engineered?

172
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,436
They engineered us.

173
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:53,880
Bullshit.

174
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,801
Okay, so do you...

175
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,556
...have anything to back that up?

176
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,956
Look, if you're willing to discount...

177
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,876
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....

178
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:07,874
But how do you know?

179
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,598
I don't.

180
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,120
But it's what I choose to believe.

181
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:40,873
Doctors.

182
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:45,803
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

183
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:53,919
Wow, nice place.

184
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:58,043
It's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

185
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,076
Air, food.

186
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:03,800
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

187
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:05,921
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

188
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,073
Yes.

189
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:07,881
I do.

190
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:10,194
I like to minimize risk.

191
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:14,200
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

192
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:17,403
I'll take a vodka. Up.

193
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:19,157
Charlie, look.

194
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,599
It's a Pauling Med-Pod.

195
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:24,159
They only made a dozen of these.

196
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,120
Miss Shaw.

197
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:27,639
Please verbally state
the nature of your injury.

198
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,636
Please don't touch that.

199
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,681
It's a very expensive piece of machinery.

200
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,593
It does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

201
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:38,878
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

202
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:42,597
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

203
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:45,153
But I'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

204
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,474
...of savages living in dirty little caves.

205
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,556
But let's say I'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

206
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,720
...you won't engage them...

207
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,403
...you won't talk to them.

208
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:59,198
You will do nothing
but report back to me.

209
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,754
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

210
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:06,482
...you're not telling us about?

211
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:07,681
My company...

212
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,278
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place
and bring you.

213
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:13,117
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

214
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:16,037
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

215
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:18,518
But you didn't.

216
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,437
And that makes you an employee.

217
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:23,755
But if we can't make contact...

218
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:26,313
...why did you even bring us here?

219
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,723
Weyland was a superstitious man.

220
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:32,679
He wanted a true believer onboard.

221
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,359
Cheers.

222
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,679
So no response?

223
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,353
I'm sorry, no.

224
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,355
Maybe they didn't understand it.

225
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,640
How are your lessons going, David?

226
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:52,194
I spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

227
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:54,362
...to their roots. I'm confident...

228
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:55,957
...I can communicate with them...

229
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:58,274
...provided your thesis is correct.

230
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:01,560
"Provided it's correct." That's good.

231
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:04,522
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

232
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:09,122
What are you smiling about?

233
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,081
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

234
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,677
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.

235
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,443
Descent trajectory mapped.

236
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,083
How we doing?

237
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,279
Great.

238
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:19,240
All right, boss.

239
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:20,634
All personnel...

240
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:21,919
...this is the captain.

241
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:23,437
Brace for entry.

242
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:24,798
Yes, captain.

243
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:26,757
That means you too, Vickers.

244
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:27,993
All systems...

245
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:29,119
...online.

246
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:37,358
What is the atmosphere?

247
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,673
Atmosphere is...

248
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:40,038
...71 percent nitrogen...

249
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,319
...21 percent oxygen...

250
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:42,553
...traces of argon gas.

251
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,755
Whoa, now, that's weather.

252
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:45,959
Just like home.

253
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:47,876
If you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

254
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,241
CO2 is over 3 percent.

255
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,360
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

256
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:56,793
Peak portside.

257
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,716
Whoa, 52,000!

258
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:01,000
It makes Everest
look like a baby brother.

259
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:03,400
All right, take us around.

260
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:05,236
We'll use that as our point of entry.

261
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,714
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

262
00:23:09,884 --> 00:23:11,237
...a couple of hard spots.

263
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:12,837
Could be metal.

264
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:33,953
No radio, no heat source.

265
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:36,039
Nobody's home.

266
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:38,757
There is nothing in the desert...

267
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:41,156
...and no man needs nothing.

268
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:42,678
What was that?

269
00:23:43,884 --> 00:23:45,875
Just something from a film I like.

270
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,397
Let's go through that gateway.

271
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:53,640
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

272
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,757
Going through. Nice and slow.

273
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:07,559
Keep it steady, boys.

274
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:08,361
There.

275
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,436
No, what are you doing?

276
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:13,357
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

277
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:16,481
Right there. God does not build in...

278
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:19,636
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

279
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:21,237
...could you put us down there?

280
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:23,554
I wouldn't be any good
if I couldn't do that.

281
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,921
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

282
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,676
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.

283
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,522
Engage landing sequence.

284
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,753
Switch to manual.

285
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:39,039
- Commence landing.
- Easy.

286
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:41,160
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

287
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:45,163
Bringing her down in five.

288
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:47,042
- Preparing RCS thrusters.
- Four.

289
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,202
Two. Easy does it.

290
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,718
Generator systems are inactive.

291
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:14,159
Temperature is at 2.724 K.

292
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,513
Captain, would you...

293
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,595
...tell the survey team to suit up...

294
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:30,117
...and meet us in the airlock.

295
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:32,362
Only six hours left of daylight.

296
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,116
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no.

297
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:36,197
It's Christmas, captain...

298
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,161
...and I want to open my presents.

299
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:39,240
You, boy.

300
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,678
You're coming with us.

301
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:42,403
I'd be delighted.

302
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,238
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.

303
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:53,877
Hey, Jackson...

304
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,432
...what's that for?

305
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:57,153
Expedition security.

306
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,792
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

307
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:04,157
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

308
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:05,313
All right, then.

309
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:07,003
Good luck with that.

310
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,556
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

311
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,073
I beg your pardon?

312
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,836
You don't breathe, remember?

313
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:18,040
So why wear a suit?

314
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:20,674
I was designed like this...

315
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:24,877
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

316
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:29,161
If I didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

317
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,961
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

318
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,923
Not too close, I hope.

319
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:45,798
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.

320
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:52,596
Ramp will open in five...

321
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:56,677
...four, three, two, one.

322
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:14,598
Hey.

323
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,599
This is just one small step for mankind.

324
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:19,399
Seriously?

325
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:27,042
You ready to do this? I know you are.

326
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:38,194
Hey, Fifield.

327
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:39,479
I want a spectrograph on this.

328
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,794
I want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

329
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:44,524
I can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what I can...

330
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,720
...tell you is, it's hollow.

331
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:13,479
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

332
00:28:13,804 --> 00:28:14,919
Affirmative.

333
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,472
We see it.

334
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,041
Okay, ready?

335
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,603
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

336
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,720
- After you.
- After you.

337
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:00,794
Okay.

338
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:01,953
Careful.

339
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,515
Prometheus, we're going in.

340
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:05,799
Copy that.

341
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:38,760
What's back here?

342
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,960
Some kind of a corridor?

343
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:44,318
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

344
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:45,803
I want the whole interior.

345
00:29:46,764 --> 00:29:48,959
If there's anything in here
worth looking at...

346
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:50,352
...these pups'll find them.

347
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:51,874
"Pups"?

348
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:54,274
Yeah, pups. My pups.

349
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:11,123
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

350
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:16,279
Copy that.

351
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:29,079
Well, I'll be damned.

352
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:44,398
Fifield, you got a read?

353
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:45,633
Yeah.

354
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,162
Pups are saying this way.

355
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,357
Look at this.

356
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:16,962
Oh, Charlie.

357
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:21,793
Jesus.

358
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:23,876
The sunlight is heating the water.

359
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,037
Check out the humidity.

360
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,762
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

361
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:29,279
Outside...

362
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,400
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

363
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:33,555
...there's nothing. It's breathable.

364
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:37,077
What are you doing?

365
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,394
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.

366
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,920
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

367
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:43,478
David?

368
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,714
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...

369
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:46,999
...actually.

370
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,040
They were terraforming.

371
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,763
Please don't do--

372
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,642
I'm not wearing this thing anymore.

373
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:53,392
Wish me luck, baby.

374
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:56,032
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.

375
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,795
You crazy bastard.

376
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:19,478
Connect our suit cameras...

377
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:23,717
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

378
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:26,442
Copy that. Switching feeds.

379
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,434
Well, come on. Pay up.

380
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:33,718
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?

381
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:37,240
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

382
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:40,043
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here.

383
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:42,957
If you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, I'd pay.

384
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:44,443
Come on, a hundred credits.

385
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:47,484
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

386
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,554
It's minus 12 in here.

387
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,760
So why is this water not frozen?

388
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,277
Maybe it ain't water.

389
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:57,403
Maybe it's Martian piss.

390
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:02,276
That's your scientific theory?

391
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:04,275
Is it? Mr. Biology?

392
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:10,121
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

393
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:12,842
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

394
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,159
Impressive.

395
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:52,760
What was that?

396
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:54,793
David?

397
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:56,281
David?

398
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:58,838
What is that?

399
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:01,640
David?

400
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,238
Ellie!

401
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:16,680
What was that?

402
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,241
I'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

403
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:21,599
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?

404
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:22,914
Keep up!

405
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:25,881
Come on!

406
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:34,798
Where did he go?

407
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:41,397
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:49,122
There it is. There it is. There it is.

409
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,473
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

410
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:54,123
What do you mean "them"?

411
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:56,717
It is them, Ellie.

412
00:34:57,484 --> 00:34:58,997
It looks like a door...

413
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:03,152
...and he's been decapitated by it.

414
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:05,797
Son of a bitch.

415
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:08,803
They were right.

416
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:14,155
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

417
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:18,873
David...

418
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,156
...please tell me you can read that.

419
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:22,998
Perhaps.

420
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,756
No, I'm out of here.

421
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,436
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

422
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:33,079
What?

423
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:37,324
Look, I'm just a geologist.

424
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,554
I like rocks. I love rocks!

425
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,359
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

426
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:44,992
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

427
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:45,835
...bodies.

428
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:48,916
As I don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

429
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:50,437
...dead body arena...

430
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:55,274
...I want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

431
00:35:58,604 --> 00:35:59,320
Anyone wanna...

432
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:01,520
...join me, hey? You staying?

433
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,153
No, ship's good.

434
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:06,440
Yeah. Ship very good.

435
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:10,276
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

436
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,193
Thank you.

437
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:13,560
Pull yourself...

438
00:36:13,724 --> 00:36:14,600
...together, man.

439
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:20,764
And I thought you were the crazy one.

440
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:30,042
Do you have the carbon reader?

441
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,592
Thank you.

442
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,679
How long's it been dead?

443
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,359
Two thousand years...

444
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:45,639
...give or take.

445
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,597
What are you doing, David?

446
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,162
I'm attempting to open the door.

447
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,519
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

448
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,157
Oops. Sorry.

449
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:05,874
Look, Ford. It's the head.

450
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:18,119
An amazing state of preservation.

451
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,076
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.

452
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:25,483
Remarkably human.

453
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,036
Beautiful painting.

454
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,352
It's a mural.

455
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,081
Stop.

456
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,359
Stop. Don't touch it.

457
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:01,593
Sorry.

458
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:04,595
Please, don't touch anything.

459
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,121
Sweating.

460
00:38:43,484 --> 00:38:44,633
Organic.

461
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:51,879
Oh, no.

462
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,758
Charlie, the murals are changing.

463
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:57,233
I think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

464
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:59,235
Charlie, do you copy?

465
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, the head!

466
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,275
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

467
00:39:14,444 --> 00:39:15,877
- Boss.
- What you got?

468
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:18,675
We got an incoming storm front.

469
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:19,959
Silica...

470
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,035
...and lots of static. This is not good.

471
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:22,920
I see it.

472
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:27,674
Ground crew...

473
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:28,799
...this is Janek.

474
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,716
I need you to hustle back right now.

475
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,437
Ground crew, do you copy me?

476
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,878
I got 200-kilometer...

477
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:35,523
...winds of airborne silica...

478
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:37,117
...and enough static to fry your suit.

479
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:38,717
Copy that, sir.

480
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:39,794
We need more time.

481
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:41,758
I'll be closing the outer...

482
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,073
...doors in 15 minutes.

483
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:45,314
I sincerely hope you can make it.

484
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,795
Charlie! David!

485
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,399
We must leave now.

486
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:55,076
This is just another tomb.

487
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:00,553
David!

488
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:05,121
- On three.
- Two, three, up.

489
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:06,603
Let's go!

490
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,996
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

491
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:14,558
David, we are leaving!

492
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,520
Come on!

493
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:26,322
Damn it, they've already taken off.

494
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:27,394
Come on, let's go.

495
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:31,996
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.

496
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,120
All right, come on. Let's go.

497
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:50,117
Go faster!

498
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,119
Charlie! The head!

499
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:15,556
Ellie, no!

500
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:16,361
What are you doing?

501
00:41:24,804 --> 00:41:25,554
Hatch closure...

502
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:26,713
- ...in five seconds.
- Shit.

503
00:41:27,924 --> 00:41:28,674
Damn it, hold on!

504
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:31,674
Goddamn it.

505
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:32,913
Door closing.

506
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,079
Ellie, don't move!

507
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:41,721
Charlie!

508
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:46,113
Grab my hand!

509
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:57,242
No!

510
00:41:58,324 --> 00:41:59,200
No, Ellie!

511
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,114
Ellie!

512
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:37,799
Got it.

513
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:47,196
So, what was that, Ellie?

514
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,793
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

515
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:51,363
...almost killing yourself!

516
00:42:51,524 --> 00:42:52,479
Are you all right?

517
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:54,163
Yes.

518
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:55,559
Thank you, David.

519
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:57,477
My pleasure.

520
00:42:57,804 --> 00:42:59,556
Doctors, it's real good to have...

521
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,919
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

522
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,722
Aren't they back yet?

523
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:06,597
- Get them up for me.
- All right.

524
00:43:09,404 --> 00:43:11,076
We've been here before, Fifield.

525
00:43:11,244 --> 00:43:13,804
I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

526
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:16,680
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.

527
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,883
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

528
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:22,239
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

529
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:23,560
What?

530
00:43:23,724 --> 00:43:27,080
The temperature is dropping rapidly,
so get your helmets on and stay warm...

531
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:29,635
...until the storm passes.

532
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:30,600
Captain...

533
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,956
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

534
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,073
You got a pen nearby?

535
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:38,075
No. No, I think we got it.

536
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,515
Tell them I said... themselves.

537
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:42,440
Copy?

538
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:44,754
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...

539
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:47,119
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

540
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:49,759
Well, which way now?

541
00:43:49,924 --> 00:43:50,674
All right.

542
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:52,800
Well, which way, huh?

543
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,115
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

544
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:09,479
David.

545
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:14,441
So are they all dead?

546
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:17,641
What? Who?

547
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:19,393
Your Engineers.

548
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:21,476
Are they all dead or aren't they?

549
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,077
I don't know.

550
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,518
We just got here.

551
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:25,595
Scan.

552
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:29,603
Do you care if they're dead?

553
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:31,843
Weyland cared.

554
00:44:32,124 --> 00:44:33,637
Dr. Shaw.

555
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:34,913
Have a look at this.

556
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:41,281
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No.

557
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:43,355
I think it's a helmet.

558
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,794
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...

559
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:47,317
...be able to prize this open.

560
00:44:48,044 --> 00:44:50,274
It's too heavy for us. David?

561
00:44:57,124 --> 00:44:58,273
Careful.

562
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:00,202
Like so.

563
00:45:13,484 --> 00:45:15,236
What is that on its head?

564
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:17,680
It looks like new cells.

565
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:20,475
- In a state of....
- Change.

566
00:45:20,644 --> 00:45:21,315
Yes.

567
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:22,918
Changing into what?

568
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:25,474
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

569
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:28,955
I think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

570
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:31,678
- Thirty amps.
- Okay.

571
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:33,074
No more.

572
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,520
Let me make an incision.

573
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:37,960
Okay.

574
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,677
Go up, 40.

575
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:47,673
Okay, 40 up.

576
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:50,277
Did you see that?

577
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,562
- Yes.
- Yep. See?

578
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:55,237
Go up another 10.

579
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:56,963
Okay, up 10.

580
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:00,279
Maybe it's a little...

581
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:02,196
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.

582
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:03,717
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.

583
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,000
Okay, I'm trying.

584
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,522
I'm trying, it's not going down.

585
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:08,912
Full down. Ford...

586
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:09,960
...stop it.

587
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:11,318
Oh, God.

588
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:13,555
David, contain it! Now!

589
00:46:13,724 --> 00:46:14,918
Contain it? Turn it off!

590
00:46:15,244 --> 00:46:16,597
Oh, God. The smell!

591
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,433
Oh, God, look at that.

592
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:19,559
Look at that.

593
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:20,839
It's getting worse.

594
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:37,602
Mortal, after all.

595
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:45,958
Ford, take a sample.

596
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,644
Let's have a look.

597
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:55,393
No, sir, I will take care of it.

598
00:46:55,724 --> 00:46:57,999
Yes, sir, understood. I'm sorry.

599
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:01,484
Fortunately, slightly premature.

600
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:06,723
Of course, sir.

601
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:35,119
Miss Vickers.

602
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:40,638
What did he say, David?

603
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,199
I don't think he'd want me to tell you.

604
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:52,834
What did he say?

605
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:53,720
I'm sorry...

606
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:54,999
...that's confidential.

607
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,995
So help me God...

608
00:47:57,324 --> 00:48:01,158
...I will find the cord that makes you run
and I will cut it.

609
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,915
What did he say?

610
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:06,598
He said:

611
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:09,953
"Try harder."

612
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:13,759
Cup of tea, ma'am?

613
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:30,713
Genetic view.

614
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:31,714
Okay.

615
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:34,193
Let's have a look at its DNA.

616
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,199
Isolate the strand.

617
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:46,879
Okay.

618
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:49,480
Compare it to the gene sample?

619
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:50,873
Yeah.

620
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,199
Overlay.

621
00:48:52,524 --> 00:48:53,798
Processing.

622
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:56,958
Processing.

623
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:00,959
DNA match.

624
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:03,717
Oh, my God.

625
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:24,358
It's us.

626
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:25,799
It's everything.

627
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:31,475
What killed them?

628
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,154
Big things...

629
00:49:49,324 --> 00:49:51,235
...have small beginnings.

630
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,636
Am I interrupting?

631
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,319
I thought you might be running low.

632
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:11,002
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but I'm afraid...

633
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:12,517
...it would be wasted on me.

634
00:50:13,084 --> 00:50:15,234
Right, I almost forgot you're not a real boy.

635
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,473
I'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

636
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,479
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

637
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:34,275
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

638
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:37,163
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

639
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:38,200
To get answers.

640
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:40,522
Why they even...

641
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,117
...made us in the first place.

642
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,879
Why do you think your people made me?

643
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:49,239
Because we could.

644
00:50:52,044 --> 00:50:54,319
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

645
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,520
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

646
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:02,394
I guess it's...

647
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:04,202
...good you can't be disappointed.

648
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,197
Yes. It's wonderful...

649
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:07,481
...actually.

650
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:09,316
May I ask you something?

651
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:11,480
Please do.

652
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:12,838
How far would you go...

653
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:16,078
...to get what you came all this way for?

654
00:51:16,244 --> 00:51:17,563
Your answers.

655
00:51:18,764 --> 00:51:19,958
What are you willing to do?

656
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:21,763
Anything and everything.

657
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:25,154
That's worth drinking to, I'd imagine.

658
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:37,921
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

659
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:43,483
Good health.

660
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:49,358
It's those things.

661
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:53,959
Are they real?

662
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:56,793
Of course they're real.

663
00:51:57,884 --> 00:51:59,522
Jesus Christ. I mean....

664
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:01,879
Look at the pile.

665
00:52:02,524 --> 00:52:04,321
Look how high up they are.

666
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:05,920
It looks like...

667
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:10,123
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?

668
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:14,723
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

669
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:16,363
Almost like it exploded.

670
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:21,158
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

671
00:52:33,804 --> 00:52:34,998
Well....

672
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:43,436
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

673
00:52:43,604 --> 00:52:44,639
Millburn, Fifield.

674
00:52:44,804 --> 00:52:45,919
This is Prometheus.

675
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,233
What is your position?

676
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:49,762
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

677
00:52:50,044 --> 00:52:51,875
We are at 7-4-0...

678
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,194
...1-4-7-7. Why?

679
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:57,754
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

680
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,437
What do you mean "a ping"?

681
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:01,476
Well, whatever...

682
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:03,555
...that probe is picking up...

683
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:04,839
...it's not dead.

684
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:06,596
It's reading a life form.

685
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:09,159
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"?

686
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,157
Is it--? Is it moving?

687
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,761
No, I don't think so.

688
00:53:14,044 --> 00:53:15,318
Captain, you're...

689
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,963
...obviously not seeing...

690
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,443
...what we're seeing here.

691
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,754
If you were,
you wouldn't be talking about a ping.

692
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:22,152
I know, boys.

693
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:25,601
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

694
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:28,197
That's no good to us down here!

695
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:33,438
Is it--? Is it moving?
Are these things moving?

696
00:53:36,204 --> 00:53:39,002
No. No, it just disappeared, actually.

697
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:40,599
Must be a glitch.

698
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:43,153
What do you mean, "a glitch"?

699
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:44,200
All right, boys.

700
00:53:45,244 --> 00:53:46,393
Sleep tight.

701
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:48,677
Try not to bugger each other.

702
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:50,755
Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?

703
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,798
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.

704
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,797
Now, he said--

705
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:59,398
- He said one click west, yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:01,432
Now, we....

707
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,401
We don't want to check that out, do we?

708
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:04,553
Shit, no.

709
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:05,952
Where are we gonna go?

710
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,079
East.

711
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:09,832
Yeah, east.

712
00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:13,924
A fucking glitch, man.
"Pings, glitch, life form." What the fuck?

713
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:18,237
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

714
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:20,964
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

715
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,160
...to combust. I can't help but wonder...

716
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:26,119
...was there an outbreak here?

717
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:31,554
You rang...

718
00:54:31,724 --> 00:54:33,794
- ...ma'am?
- I have something important...

719
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,716
...to tell you. What is that?

720
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:38,082
This is...

721
00:54:38,244 --> 00:54:40,519
...a rose that I had frozen
with the champagne.

722
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:43,642
I was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

723
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:46,602
We did find what we came for.

724
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:48,119
They were here. This is--

725
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,675
The most significant discovery
in the history...

726
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:54,914
...of mankind. Oh, I know.

727
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:59,396
It's incredible, it really is.

728
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:03,239
But I wanted to talk to them.

729
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:06,283
I mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

730
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,083
Why they abandoned us?

731
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:11,236
I just want answers, baby.

732
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:12,803
We were right, Charlie.

733
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,235
I have proof.

734
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:18,040
Look.

735
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:26,756
Their genetic material predates ours.

736
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,357
We come from them.

737
00:55:29,764 --> 00:55:31,356
- You're kidding me.
- No.

738
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:35,393
Okay.

739
00:55:35,884 --> 00:55:36,999
Okay.

740
00:55:37,964 --> 00:55:41,957
Okay. I guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

741
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:44,834
Why would I want to do that?

742
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:46,996
Because they made us.

743
00:55:47,164 --> 00:55:48,392
And who made them?

744
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:51,240
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

745
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:53,395
But here's what we do know:

746
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:57,239
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

747
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:58,757
Right? Anybody can do it.

748
00:55:58,924 --> 00:56:01,802
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

749
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:05,833
I can't.

750
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,514
I can't create life.

751
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,844
What does that say about me?

752
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:17,962
Ellie, that's not-- I didn't mean--

753
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,603
I wasn't talking about--

754
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,322
Children?

755
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,633
Us.

756
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:27,160
Hey, hey, hey.

757
00:56:27,324 --> 00:56:28,643
Hey.

758
00:56:29,404 --> 00:56:30,632
Hey.

759
00:56:31,444 --> 00:56:33,241
Elizabeth Shaw...

760
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:36,760
...you are the most special person
I have ever met in my life...

761
00:56:36,924 --> 00:56:38,676
...and I love you.

762
00:56:42,564 --> 00:56:43,758
Hey.

763
00:57:27,004 --> 00:57:28,403
How much longer will this take?

764
00:57:30,324 --> 00:57:31,803
I don't know.

765
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:33,397
I'm just a captain.

766
00:57:42,164 --> 00:57:44,519
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

767
00:57:44,684 --> 00:57:48,359
I'll have you know that this thing...

768
00:57:48,524 --> 00:57:50,640
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

769
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:53,522
Am I supposed to know who that is?

770
00:57:58,284 --> 00:57:59,717
You know...

771
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:01,883
...if you wanna get laid...

772
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:03,841
...you really don't have to pretend...

773
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:06,040
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

774
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,440
You could just say,
"Hey, I'm trying to get laid."

775
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:12,720
I could. I could say that, right?

776
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,763
But it wouldn't make sense...

777
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,917
...why I would fly myself half a billion miles
from every man on Earth...

778
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:20,995
...if I wanted to get laid, would it?

779
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,517
Hey, Vickers.

780
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:26,436
Hey, Vickers.

781
00:58:27,564 --> 00:58:29,316
I was wondering....

782
00:58:33,404 --> 00:58:34,757
Are you a robot?

783
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,083
My room.

784
00:58:45,164 --> 00:58:45,960
Ten minutes.

785
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:53,799
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

786
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:54,874
Love the one

787
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:56,113
You're with

788
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,677
Love the one you're with

789
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:05,479
Millburn.

790
00:59:05,644 --> 00:59:07,555
What's all this black stuff?

791
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:12,754
Gazpacho.

792
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:16,199
Is that tobacco?

793
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:17,920
Is that tobacco...

794
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:19,153
...in your respirator?

795
00:59:19,324 --> 00:59:20,837
Yeah, sure.

796
00:59:25,164 --> 00:59:26,597
Tobacco.

797
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:30,714
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
I am ashamed to count you amongst us...

798
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:32,442
...Fifield. Really.

799
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:37,559
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?

800
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:38,600
You see this thing?

801
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:41,961
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

802
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,355
Something they worshiped? What?

803
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:46,196
- It kind of looks like--
- What's that?

804
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:47,873
What the hell is that?

805
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,238
Oh, my God. Okay.

806
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:50,678
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

807
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:52,994
This is okay, I can handle this.

808
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:54,599
Hey, baby.

809
00:59:55,364 --> 00:59:56,035
Hey.

810
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:58,119
Come in, Prometheus.

811
00:59:58,444 --> 01:00:01,880
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.

812
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:06,043
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.

813
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:07,718
And it's beautiful.

814
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:09,801
Okay!

815
01:00:13,084 --> 01:00:13,721
Prometheus...

816
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:14,600
...we have two.

817
01:00:14,764 --> 01:00:17,153
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

818
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:19,999
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

819
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:22,598
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?

820
01:00:22,764 --> 01:00:25,073
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

821
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:26,916
What makes you think that's female?

822
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:28,278
She's a lady. Look!

823
01:00:34,124 --> 01:00:35,079
Hey.

824
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:36,913
She's mesmerized.

825
01:00:37,324 --> 01:00:39,360
Come here. Come here.

826
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:42,593
It's okay.

827
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,356
It's okay. It's okay.

828
01:00:45,044 --> 01:00:46,272
Hey, baby.

829
01:00:49,324 --> 01:00:50,200
You're strong!

830
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:51,521
You should...

831
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:52,321
...help me now.

832
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:53,121
Get it off.

833
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:56,434
Cut it here, man!

834
01:00:56,604 --> 01:00:57,639
I ain't touching that!

835
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:00,515
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

836
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:02,640
- It's getting tighter.
- I ain't touching it!

837
01:01:02,804 --> 01:01:05,477
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

838
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,475
God, you're making it worse!

839
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:09,396
It's tightening! It's tight--

840
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:10,913
It's breaking my arm!

841
01:01:12,684 --> 01:01:13,321
Shit!

842
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:14,554
Cut it off!

843
01:01:14,724 --> 01:01:16,362
Cut it off!

844
01:01:16,524 --> 01:01:17,320
Cut it off!

845
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:18,075
Cut it off!

846
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:21,555
Shit!

847
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:22,440
Oh, my God!

848
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,640
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

849
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:28,198
It's in my suit.

850
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:29,114
Jesus Christ.

851
01:02:26,764 --> 01:02:28,516
Shaw, you up?

852
01:02:30,124 --> 01:02:31,239
Yeah, what's up?

853
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:33,720
The storm passed,
but I can't reach Millburn...

854
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:36,956
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,
see if I can rustle them up.

855
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:38,193
Okay.

856
01:02:39,084 --> 01:02:40,597
Any idea where they are?

857
01:02:40,764 --> 01:02:44,279
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

858
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,681
Okay, we're coming.

859
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:47,560
All right.

860
01:02:47,724 --> 01:02:50,443
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

861
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:51,559
All right, boss.

862
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:55,997
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.

863
01:02:56,164 --> 01:02:58,803
- It's gotta be in the hardware.
- What glitch, captain?

864
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:01,398
One of them probes picked up a life form.

865
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:02,994
Pops up every hour...

866
01:03:03,164 --> 01:03:05,962
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

867
01:03:06,124 --> 01:03:07,637
I can find the probe and fix it.

868
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:09,317
Knock yourself out.

869
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:12,037
Be careful, doctors.

870
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:34,076
Fifield!

871
01:03:36,724 --> 01:03:37,839
Millburn?

872
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:43,283
All right, come on down.

873
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:06,277
David, are you alone?

874
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:08,433
Yes, Miss Vickers.

875
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:10,674
Uplink your feed to my room.

876
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:12,072
Copy.

877
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,600
You son of a bitch.

878
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:56,242
You cut me off.

879
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:17,963
What is this?

880
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:22,473
- Charlie?
- I just tripped.

881
01:06:22,764 --> 01:06:23,879
Oh, my God, you're sick!

882
01:06:24,044 --> 01:06:25,875
I'm okay, baby. Come on.

883
01:06:26,044 --> 01:06:27,033
Fifield?

884
01:06:27,844 --> 01:06:28,993
Millburn?

885
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,683
Hey, Chance. I wouldn't touch...

886
01:06:36,844 --> 01:06:37,959
...that if I were you.

887
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:41,998
Dr. Shaw?

888
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,233
Yeah?

889
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:45,315
Do we have any idea what is...

890
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:46,837
...oozing out of these vases?

891
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:50,041
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

892
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:55,633
Captain?

893
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:57,072
What?

894
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:58,194
Who is it? Which one?

895
01:06:58,364 --> 01:07:00,116
- Who is it?
- It's Millburn.

896
01:07:00,644 --> 01:07:02,441
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.

897
01:07:02,604 --> 01:07:03,400
Ellie, honey.

898
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:05,316
Charlie, what's wrong?

899
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:07,918
I need you to look at me, okay?

900
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:09,153
You know infections...

901
01:07:09,324 --> 01:07:10,313
...so, what do you see?

902
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,042
This is not good, baby.

903
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:14,035
You look at me,
you tell me what you see.

904
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:18,954
Oh, my God.

905
01:07:19,404 --> 01:07:20,917
Ford, get over here.

906
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:22,597
It's okay. Janek?

907
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:24,322
- What?
- We have to go now!

908
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:25,155
What do you see?

909
01:07:25,324 --> 01:07:27,235
Honey, what do you see?

910
01:07:27,404 --> 01:07:29,395
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

911
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:30,121
I see movement...

912
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:30,921
...in his esophagus.

913
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,676
- Come on, baby.
- No. I'm okay.

914
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:37,754
Janek!

915
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:39,073
Come over and help me!

916
01:07:39,244 --> 01:07:41,474
- I'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?

917
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:42,599
- I'm okay.
- Let's go!

918
01:07:42,764 --> 01:07:43,833
Help me with him.

919
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:46,757
I got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

920
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:47,561
Prometheus...

921
01:07:47,724 --> 01:07:48,361
...come in.

922
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:50,355
- Watch your head.
- Okay. I'm okay.

923
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:52,196
- Holloway.
- Get him up.

924
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,116
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in.

925
01:07:54,284 --> 01:07:55,399
Is anyone there?

926
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:57,238
This is Vickers.

927
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,759
I need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

928
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,040
Full quarantine fail-safe.

929
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:03,603
Holloway's sick.

930
01:08:03,764 --> 01:08:04,958
Sick with what?

931
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,160
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.

932
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:09,315
- It's not safe down here.
- Charlie?

933
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:10,280
I'm suiting up.

934
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:12,036
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Move!

935
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:14,434
- What was that back there?
- Let's go, people!

936
01:08:16,084 --> 01:08:18,154
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!

937
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:19,124
Ellie!

938
01:12:06,924 --> 01:12:08,073
He don't look too good.

939
01:12:08,284 --> 01:12:10,878
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

940
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:11,715
I don't know.

941
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:14,882
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

942
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:16,279
Aye, captain.

943
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:18,719
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

944
01:12:20,364 --> 01:12:21,558
Come on!

945
01:12:21,724 --> 01:12:23,362
Please!

946
01:12:28,004 --> 01:12:30,393
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

947
01:12:30,924 --> 01:12:32,676
Vickers, that is an order!

948
01:12:33,444 --> 01:12:35,002
Get that goddamn door open!

949
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:37,598
- Look at me. It's too late, I'm sick.
- No, it's not.

950
01:12:37,764 --> 01:12:38,913
Come on!

951
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:40,275
Ford, help me!

952
01:12:40,644 --> 01:12:42,600
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

953
01:12:42,764 --> 01:12:44,322
Open that back door right now!

954
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:45,599
Hold that door!

955
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:46,401
Prometheus...

956
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:47,280
...do you copy?

957
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:49,833
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!

958
01:12:50,004 --> 01:12:51,039
Open it.

959
01:12:57,804 --> 01:12:59,032
What the hell is this?

960
01:12:59,204 --> 01:13:00,683
He's not coming onboard.

961
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,277
Vickers, this is a sick man.

962
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,513
I see that. That's why...

963
01:13:03,684 --> 01:13:04,673
...he's not coming on!

964
01:13:05,444 --> 01:13:06,399
Charlie!

965
01:13:06,564 --> 01:13:07,553
Chance, get over here!

966
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:11,395
Please!

967
01:13:11,564 --> 01:13:12,599
We can still help him!

968
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:16,672
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

969
01:13:16,844 --> 01:13:18,357
I won't leave him!

970
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:19,320
Then stay!

971
01:13:19,484 --> 01:13:20,599
Wait! We could...

972
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,402
...put him on the Med-Pod!

973
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,553
Please don't do this.

974
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:24,998
It's okay, Ellie.

975
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:26,119
Vickers!

976
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:27,239
What are you doing?

977
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:28,639
I love you, baby.

978
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:29,600
- I love you.
- No.

979
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:30,992
I'm telling you, stay back!

980
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:31,835
Do it.

981
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:32,834
Stay back!

982
01:13:33,004 --> 01:13:34,039
No! No, Charlie!

983
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:34,761
- Do it.
- No!

984
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:41,433
No!

985
01:13:43,404 --> 01:13:44,837
No!

986
01:13:45,164 --> 01:13:46,756
No!

987
01:13:50,284 --> 01:13:51,319
Charlie!

988
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:55,522
No!

989
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:10,241
My deepest condolences.

990
01:14:11,524 --> 01:14:13,242
I'm going to have to take this.

991
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:14,883
It may be contaminated.

992
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:19,843
If there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

993
01:14:21,364 --> 01:14:24,993
You need-- We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

994
01:14:25,644 --> 01:14:26,963
Yes, of course.

995
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:28,472
Yes?

996
01:14:35,524 --> 01:14:37,799
I understand how...

997
01:14:37,964 --> 01:14:39,397
...inappropriate this is...

998
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:42,394
...given the circumstances.

999
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:45,442
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

1000
01:14:47,204 --> 01:14:49,399
...it's my responsibility to ask.

1001
01:14:50,284 --> 01:14:54,277
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

1002
01:14:55,564 --> 01:14:56,679
Since you and he were...

1003
01:14:56,844 --> 01:14:58,038
...so close...

1004
01:14:58,924 --> 01:14:59,720
...I want to be...

1005
01:14:59,884 --> 01:15:01,283
...as thorough as poss--

1006
01:15:03,204 --> 01:15:04,000
My, my.

1007
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:08,874
You're pregnant.

1008
01:15:11,644 --> 01:15:12,281
What?

1009
01:15:13,724 --> 01:15:15,396
From the look of it, three months so.

1010
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,802
No, that's impossible.

1011
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:21,120
I can't be pregnant.

1012
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:24,601
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

1013
01:15:25,404 --> 01:15:26,553
Yes...

1014
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:29,636
...but 10 hours ago.

1015
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:33,320
There's no bloody way
I'm three months pregnant.

1016
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:34,280
Well, doctor...

1017
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:37,235
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

1018
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:41,634
I want to see it.

1019
01:15:41,924 --> 01:15:43,562
Don't think that's a good idea.

1020
01:15:45,324 --> 01:15:48,043
David, I want to see it.

1021
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,473
Now, doctor....

1022
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,317
I want to see it.

1023
01:15:54,364 --> 01:15:55,717
I want it out of me.

1024
01:15:55,964 --> 01:15:57,477
We don't have the personnel...

1025
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:00,033
...to perform a procedure like that.

1026
01:16:00,204 --> 01:16:01,956
- Our best option--
- I want it out.

1027
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,079
Put you back into...

1028
01:16:03,244 --> 01:16:05,075
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

1029
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:07,439
Please, get it out of me.

1030
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:09,117
Get it out of me!

1031
01:16:09,404 --> 01:16:10,439
Please.

1032
01:16:13,964 --> 01:16:15,556
It must be very painful.

1033
01:16:16,404 --> 01:16:18,440
Here, let me give you something.

1034
01:16:22,284 --> 01:16:23,876
That's it. There, there.

1035
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,512
Someone will be along shortly...

1036
01:16:32,804 --> 01:16:35,079
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

1037
01:16:39,204 --> 01:16:41,354
It must feel
like your God abandoned you.

1038
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,079
What?

1039
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:43,994
To lose...

1040
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:48,680
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

1041
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:51,235
What was it that killed him?

1042
01:16:51,964 --> 01:16:53,363
Ebola?

1043
01:16:57,564 --> 01:17:00,203
How do you--? How do you know that?

1044
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,002
I watched your dreams.

1045
01:17:24,644 --> 01:17:25,679
Dr. Shaw?

1046
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:28,039
We're here to put you...

1047
01:17:28,204 --> 01:17:31,435
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

1048
01:17:31,604 --> 01:17:33,162
...go to beddy-byes.

1049
01:17:33,804 --> 01:17:35,237
Dr. Shaw?

1050
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:38,083
She's doped. Prepare her.

1051
01:18:06,884 --> 01:18:10,923
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.

1052
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,435
I need a Caesarean.

1053
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:16,034
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...

1054
01:18:16,204 --> 01:18:17,717
...patients and does not offer...

1055
01:18:17,884 --> 01:18:20,682
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...

1056
01:18:20,844 --> 01:18:21,799
...elsewhere.

1057
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:24,800
Surgery.

1058
01:18:25,124 --> 01:18:26,443
Abdominal.

1059
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:27,840
Penetrating...

1060
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:29,278
...injuries.

1061
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:31,122
Foreign body.

1062
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:32,439
Initiate.

1063
01:18:35,004 --> 01:18:36,801
Surgical procedure to begin.

1064
01:19:16,604 --> 01:19:17,593
Running diagnostics.

1065
01:19:21,004 --> 01:19:22,278
Oh, come on.

1066
01:19:23,804 --> 01:19:25,954
Get it out! Come on!

1067
01:19:26,364 --> 01:19:27,035
Please!

1068
01:19:30,244 --> 01:19:31,518
Oh, God!

1069
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,396
- Come on!
- Initiating anesthetics.

1070
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:37,161
Please!

1071
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,281
Commence surgical procedure.

1072
01:20:24,564 --> 01:20:25,474
Oh, God.

1073
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:29,601
Oh, God!

1074
01:20:29,764 --> 01:20:31,083
Oh, God!

1075
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,436
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1076
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:51,872
Oh, my God!

1077
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:09,079
Come on!

1078
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:34,881
Bridge...

1079
01:21:35,044 --> 01:21:36,557
...to hangar. This is the captain.

1080
01:21:36,724 --> 01:21:38,601
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what I see?

1081
01:21:38,924 --> 01:21:40,755
Fifield's monitor just popped up.

1082
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:42,916
What? Where?

1083
01:21:43,084 --> 01:21:45,393
According to what I'm looking at,
it's outside...

1084
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:46,713
...the goddamn ship.

1085
01:21:47,084 --> 01:21:48,199
Barnes, open the door!

1086
01:21:48,364 --> 01:21:50,275
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

1087
01:21:51,164 --> 01:21:51,835
Fifield?

1088
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:04,838
Wait a second.

1089
01:22:13,644 --> 01:22:14,520
Hey, Wallace.

1090
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:15,878
Take a look at this.

1091
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:21,801
Fifield?

1092
01:22:24,684 --> 01:22:26,561
What the hell is going on down there?

1093
01:22:39,884 --> 01:22:40,953
I'm coming down there.

1094
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:42,273
Chance, you're suiting up.

1095
01:22:42,444 --> 01:22:44,036
- Come on.
- Don't let it on the ship!

1096
01:22:58,564 --> 01:22:58,996
Take him out!

1097
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:00,276
Got him!

1098
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:03,195
Do it!

1099
01:23:06,924 --> 01:23:08,960
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.

1100
01:23:11,844 --> 01:23:12,674
Come on!

1101
01:23:12,844 --> 01:23:13,959
Get in the rover!

1102
01:23:14,844 --> 01:23:16,038
We gotta get out of here!

1103
01:23:22,924 --> 01:23:23,720
Go!

1104
01:23:53,964 --> 01:23:55,192
What is that?

1105
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:31,234
You've been asleep.

1106
01:24:31,404 --> 01:24:33,964
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

1107
01:24:35,364 --> 01:24:36,763
Well, I....

1108
01:24:36,924 --> 01:24:38,721
I have a few days of life left in me.

1109
01:24:39,884 --> 01:24:41,112
I didn't wanna waste them...

1110
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,400
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

1111
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:46,037
To meet my maker.

1112
01:24:46,204 --> 01:24:47,398
There we are, sir.

1113
01:24:47,564 --> 01:24:50,601
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?

1114
01:24:52,124 --> 01:24:55,161
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

1115
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:56,996
One of them is still alive.

1116
01:24:57,724 --> 01:24:59,521
We're on our way to see him now.

1117
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:00,839
What?

1118
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:02,438
Turn me around.

1119
01:25:03,084 --> 01:25:07,714
You convinced me that...

1120
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,274
...if these things made us...

1121
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:14,918
...then surely they could save us.

1122
01:25:15,564 --> 01:25:16,474
My stick, please.

1123
01:25:21,004 --> 01:25:23,120
Well, save me, anyway.

1124
01:25:23,564 --> 01:25:25,520
Save you from what?

1125
01:25:26,124 --> 01:25:27,523
Death, of course.

1126
01:25:27,804 --> 01:25:28,839
Stand me up.

1127
01:25:33,124 --> 01:25:34,079
I'm all right.

1128
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:35,999
I'm all right.

1129
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:38,113
Yes, sir.

1130
01:25:38,324 --> 01:25:39,473
But you don't understand.

1131
01:25:40,164 --> 01:25:41,483
You don't know.

1132
01:25:41,644 --> 01:25:44,317
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

1133
01:25:44,484 --> 01:25:46,440
...what we thought they were.

1134
01:25:46,604 --> 01:25:47,719
I was wrong.

1135
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:49,078
We were so wrong.

1136
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:50,923
Charlie....

1137
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,634
Dr. Holloway's dead.

1138
01:25:54,924 --> 01:25:56,835
We must leave!

1139
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:59,201
And what would Charlie do...

1140
01:25:59,484 --> 01:26:04,160
...now that we're so close...

1141
01:26:04,444 --> 01:26:07,675
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

1142
01:26:07,844 --> 01:26:09,323
...ever asked by mankind?

1143
01:26:10,644 --> 01:26:12,282
How can you leave without...

1144
01:26:12,444 --> 01:26:14,321
...knowing what they are?

1145
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:23,075
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

1146
01:26:57,684 --> 01:27:00,323
Okay. Okay.

1147
01:27:18,884 --> 01:27:20,203
Come in.

1148
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:28,995
Where the hell are you going, doc?

1149
01:27:29,324 --> 01:27:31,235
You know what this place is?

1150
01:27:31,644 --> 01:27:35,193
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

1151
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:38,873
It's an installation.
Maybe even military.

1152
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:41,998
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

1153
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:45,281
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

1154
01:27:45,924 --> 01:27:49,314
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

1155
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:50,873
They made it here.

1156
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:54,957
It got out, it turned on them. The end.

1157
01:27:56,844 --> 01:27:58,880
It's time for us to go home.

1158
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,156
One of them is still alive.

1159
01:28:05,564 --> 01:28:07,998
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

1160
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:12,916
I don't care.

1161
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:15,833
Right.

1162
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:18,435
All you do is fly the ship.

1163
01:28:18,764 --> 01:28:19,879
That's right.

1164
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:23,514
But you must care
about something, captain.

1165
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:28,403
If you didn't, why are you here?

1166
01:28:31,244 --> 01:28:32,677
How about this?

1167
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:36,794
No matter what happens down there...

1168
01:28:38,004 --> 01:28:40,359
...I can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

1169
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,798
Can't let it happen.

1170
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:44,523
I'll do whatever I have to...

1171
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:46,356
...to see that it doesn't.

1172
01:28:48,164 --> 01:28:49,597
Make sure you do, captain.

1173
01:29:04,524 --> 01:29:06,560
So you came after all.

1174
01:29:06,844 --> 01:29:08,323
I thought you wanted me to.

1175
01:29:08,604 --> 01:29:10,959
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

1176
01:29:11,124 --> 01:29:12,523
...I'm surprised to see you.

1177
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:14,393
It's all right. Leave us.

1178
01:29:14,964 --> 01:29:16,317
Yes, sir.

1179
01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:28,521
If you're...

1180
01:29:28,684 --> 01:29:30,276
...going down there, you will die.

1181
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,036
Very negative way of looking at things.

1182
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:39,359
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

1183
01:29:39,884 --> 01:29:42,762
Did you really think I was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

1184
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:44,516
...arguing over who was in charge...

1185
01:29:44,684 --> 01:29:47,881
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

1186
01:29:48,044 --> 01:29:51,559
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

1187
01:29:54,364 --> 01:29:56,002
A king has...

1188
01:29:56,164 --> 01:29:58,632
...his reign, and then he dies.

1189
01:29:59,484 --> 01:30:00,837
It's inevitable.

1190
01:30:03,204 --> 01:30:04,478
That...

1191
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:07,075
...is the natural order of things.

1192
01:30:19,404 --> 01:30:20,723
Anything else?

1193
01:30:22,524 --> 01:30:23,843
No...

1194
01:30:25,084 --> 01:30:26,597
...Father.

1195
01:30:28,124 --> 01:30:28,954
That's it.

1196
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:43,042
I didn't think you had it in you.

1197
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:44,481
Sorry.

1198
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:46,919
Poor choice of words.

1199
01:30:48,164 --> 01:30:51,315
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

1200
01:30:56,124 --> 01:30:57,716
What happens when Weyland is not...

1201
01:30:57,884 --> 01:30:59,078
...around to program you?

1202
01:31:00,084 --> 01:31:01,642
I suppose I'll be free.

1203
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:03,798
You want that?

1204
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:05,443
"Want"?

1205
01:31:05,604 --> 01:31:07,401
Not a concept I'm familiar with.

1206
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:09,197
That being said...

1207
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:12,120
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

1208
01:31:14,044 --> 01:31:15,079
I didn't.

1209
01:31:16,124 --> 01:31:16,954
Dr. Shaw.

1210
01:31:18,524 --> 01:31:19,843
So pleased you could join us.

1211
01:31:34,084 --> 01:31:36,120
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

1212
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:37,000
What?

1213
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:39,553
The air is perfectly breathable.

1214
01:31:39,724 --> 01:31:40,839
Are you sure?

1215
01:31:41,004 --> 01:31:41,959
Positive.

1216
01:31:42,444 --> 01:31:47,040
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. If it's in the air.

1217
01:31:47,604 --> 01:31:48,957
It's not.

1218
01:31:49,244 --> 01:31:50,916
How do you know that?

1219
01:31:51,204 --> 01:31:52,193
Smells fine to me.

1220
01:31:54,724 --> 01:31:56,043
- Shall we?
- Please.

1221
01:32:01,324 --> 01:32:02,996
The bridge is just up ahead.

1222
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:04,199
What is this?

1223
01:32:05,324 --> 01:32:07,076
It's a cargo hold.

1224
01:32:15,724 --> 01:32:18,284
Janek? Are you seeing this?

1225
01:32:19,524 --> 01:32:20,673
How many is there, Shaw?

1226
01:32:20,844 --> 01:32:21,481
Thousands.

1227
01:32:22,924 --> 01:32:24,721
What the hell?

1228
01:32:28,364 --> 01:32:30,275
Ravel, give me those schematics.

1229
01:32:33,004 --> 01:32:35,040
Putting it on the table now.

1230
01:32:36,364 --> 01:32:37,319
Strip away the dome.

1231
01:32:37,924 --> 01:32:40,597
Isolate that area, bring it up.

1232
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:42,322
Bringing it up, captain.

1233
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:46,319
Enlarge that.

1234
01:32:48,364 --> 01:32:49,638
Rotate it.

1235
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:55,043
That is a ship.

1236
01:32:55,964 --> 01:32:57,443
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:01,280
It's a goddamn ship.

1238
01:33:04,324 --> 01:33:06,918
A superior species, no doubt.

1239
01:33:09,124 --> 01:33:11,558
Their hypersleep chambers...

1240
01:33:11,724 --> 01:33:14,284
...will impress, I trust.

1241
01:33:22,924 --> 01:33:23,561
So they...

1242
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:27,353
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- I've managed to work out the broad strokes.

1243
01:33:27,524 --> 01:33:30,277
It's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

1244
01:33:32,164 --> 01:33:34,234
...before things went to pot.

1245
01:33:34,524 --> 01:33:35,843
Leaving to go where?

1246
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:38,281
Earth.

1247
01:33:39,564 --> 01:33:40,280
Why?

1248
01:33:41,364 --> 01:33:43,275
Sometimes to create...

1249
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:45,282
...one must first destroy.

1250
01:33:47,404 --> 01:33:48,678
Where is he, David?

1251
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:50,913
This way, sir.

1252
01:33:57,084 --> 01:33:58,437
Are you sure he's alive?

1253
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:01,159
Absolutely.

1254
01:34:05,444 --> 01:34:06,797
And you can speak to him?

1255
01:34:07,084 --> 01:34:08,517
I believe I can.

1256
01:34:43,324 --> 01:34:44,837
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1257
01:34:46,604 --> 01:34:47,832
Speak to him, David.

1258
01:34:49,044 --> 01:34:50,762
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

1259
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:52,039
Ask where they're from.

1260
01:34:52,644 --> 01:34:53,474
What are you doing?

1261
01:34:53,644 --> 01:34:55,236
Ask him what's in his cargo.

1262
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:56,200
It killed his people.

1263
01:34:56,364 --> 01:34:57,433
Shaw, enough.

1264
01:34:57,724 --> 01:34:59,396
- David.
- You made it here...

1265
01:34:59,884 --> 01:35:02,444
...and it was meant for us. Why?

1266
01:35:02,604 --> 01:35:04,356
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

1267
01:35:06,444 --> 01:35:07,513
I need to know why!

1268
01:35:07,684 --> 01:35:09,322
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

1269
01:35:09,484 --> 01:35:10,883
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...

1270
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:12,033
...mouth again, shoot her.

1271
01:35:12,204 --> 01:35:14,035
David, continue. Tell him why I came.

1272
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:34,834
No!

1273
01:35:40,684 --> 01:35:41,639
Ford! Move!

1274
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,599
There's nothing.

1275
01:36:08,524 --> 01:36:10,242
I know.

1276
01:36:10,924 --> 01:36:13,757
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

1277
01:36:19,964 --> 01:36:21,477
Time to go home.

1278
01:36:34,364 --> 01:36:37,322
Mr. Chance, take us home.

1279
01:37:47,364 --> 01:37:48,194
Oh, no!

1280
01:37:55,724 --> 01:37:56,679
Hey, cap.

1281
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:58,239
What the hell was that?

1282
01:38:40,684 --> 01:38:41,434
Prometheus!

1283
01:38:41,924 --> 01:38:42,913
Come in!

1284
01:38:43,724 --> 01:38:44,918
Shaw, is that you?

1285
01:38:45,084 --> 01:38:45,800
Copy.

1286
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:46,601
Janek...

1287
01:38:46,764 --> 01:38:47,719
...listen to me.

1288
01:38:48,604 --> 01:38:49,798
This ship is taking off!

1289
01:38:49,964 --> 01:38:51,522
- What?
- What is she talking about?

1290
01:38:51,684 --> 01:38:53,163
You can't let it leave!

1291
01:38:53,444 --> 01:38:54,433
You have to stop it!

1292
01:38:54,764 --> 01:38:57,278
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

1293
01:38:57,764 --> 01:38:59,720
Janek, if you don't stop it...

1294
01:38:59,884 --> 01:39:01,636
...there won't be any home to go back to.

1295
01:39:03,564 --> 01:39:06,078
It's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.

1296
01:39:06,364 --> 01:39:08,639
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
- I know.

1297
01:39:08,804 --> 01:39:09,554
Let's go.

1298
01:39:09,724 --> 01:39:10,918
I know that.

1299
01:39:11,564 --> 01:39:13,282
But you must do it.

1300
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,396
Captain, let's go!

1301
01:39:15,564 --> 01:39:17,555
Janek, please believe me! Please!

1302
01:39:32,604 --> 01:39:34,913
I told you to get this ship going.

1303
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:35,880
Mr. Ravel.

1304
01:39:36,044 --> 01:39:37,318
Warm up the ion propulsion.

1305
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:39,236
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.

1306
01:39:39,404 --> 01:39:40,996
Burning ion in the atmosphere--

1307
01:39:41,164 --> 01:39:44,122
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?

1308
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:45,956
This is my ship. I'm telling you...

1309
01:39:46,124 --> 01:39:47,159
...to take us home!

1310
01:39:47,324 --> 01:39:48,757
Vickers, I'll eject your module onto...

1311
01:39:48,924 --> 01:39:50,596
...that surface. Two years of life.

1312
01:39:50,764 --> 01:39:52,675
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

1313
01:39:53,564 --> 01:39:54,838
You got 40 seconds to get...

1314
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:55,959
...to the escape pod.

1315
01:39:56,124 --> 01:39:57,159
You're crazy.

1316
01:39:57,324 --> 01:39:58,040
Gentlemen...

1317
01:39:58,604 --> 01:40:00,196
...I can handle this myself.

1318
01:40:00,684 --> 01:40:02,356
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

1319
01:40:03,204 --> 01:40:04,523
All due respect, captain.

1320
01:40:04,684 --> 01:40:07,801
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

1321
01:40:23,404 --> 01:40:27,397
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

1322
01:40:27,564 --> 01:40:29,714
If you think this means the bet's off...

1323
01:40:31,004 --> 01:40:32,198
...you're wrong.

1324
01:40:33,764 --> 01:40:36,039
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

1325
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:38,195
All right, get us as close as we can.

1326
01:40:38,364 --> 01:40:40,195
Only got one shot at this.

1327
01:40:52,764 --> 01:40:53,401
Lifeboats away!

1328
01:40:58,444 --> 01:40:59,354
Twenty seconds...

1329
01:40:59,524 --> 01:41:00,479
...to evacuate.

1330
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:09,762
- Countdown initiated.
- lon propulsion...

1331
01:41:09,924 --> 01:41:10,595
...is online.

1332
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:11,635
Ten.

1333
01:41:12,044 --> 01:41:12,681
Nine.

1334
01:41:12,964 --> 01:41:13,794
Come on!

1335
01:41:13,964 --> 01:41:14,919
Eight.

1336
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:27,958
- Three.
- Let's do this.

1337
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:28,954
Two.

1338
01:41:32,164 --> 01:41:32,994
Impact imminent.

1339
01:41:33,164 --> 01:41:34,517
Hands off!

1340
01:42:09,884 --> 01:42:10,600
Oh, God.

1341
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:57,159
No. No.

1342
01:42:57,324 --> 01:42:58,359
No! No! No!

1343
01:43:13,964 --> 01:43:14,999
Oh, God.

1344
01:43:30,764 --> 01:43:33,915
Warning: You have two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

1345
01:44:20,364 --> 01:44:24,073
Warning: You have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.

1346
01:44:37,084 --> 01:44:38,153
Airlock sealed.

1347
01:44:39,724 --> 01:44:42,113
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.

1348
01:45:56,884 --> 01:45:58,761
Elizabeth, are you there?

1349
01:45:59,244 --> 01:46:00,393
This is David.

1350
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:03,953
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

1351
01:46:04,244 --> 01:46:06,439
You need to get out immediately.

1352
01:46:06,724 --> 01:46:08,555
He's coming for you.

1353
01:46:08,764 --> 01:46:09,753
Who's coming?

1354
01:46:10,284 --> 01:46:11,353
Airlock breach.

1355
01:46:19,604 --> 01:46:20,593
Die!

1356
01:47:42,644 --> 01:47:44,999
I'm so sorry.

1357
01:47:46,404 --> 01:47:48,201
Oh, God.

1358
01:47:48,804 --> 01:47:50,123
I'm sorry.

1359
01:47:50,284 --> 01:47:53,594
I'm sorry, Charlie, I can't do it.

1360
01:47:53,764 --> 01:47:56,801
I can't do it anymore.

1361
01:48:00,044 --> 01:48:01,477
Elizabeth.

1362
01:48:03,364 --> 01:48:04,513
Are you there?

1363
01:48:08,844 --> 01:48:10,277
Dr. Shaw...

1364
01:48:10,964 --> 01:48:12,192
...can you hear me?

1365
01:48:13,444 --> 01:48:14,638
Yes.

1366
01:48:16,044 --> 01:48:18,114
Yes, I can hear you.

1367
01:48:18,644 --> 01:48:20,441
I was afraid you were dead.

1368
01:48:22,124 --> 01:48:24,957
You have no idea what afraid is.

1369
01:48:25,764 --> 01:48:28,437
I know we've had our differences...

1370
01:48:29,804 --> 01:48:31,203
...but, please...

1371
01:48:32,084 --> 01:48:34,279
...I need to ask you for your help.

1372
01:48:34,444 --> 01:48:36,878
Why the hell would I help you?

1373
01:48:38,564 --> 01:48:42,273
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

1374
01:48:42,924 --> 01:48:45,961
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

1375
01:48:46,404 --> 01:48:48,360
It's not the only ship.

1376
01:48:50,164 --> 01:48:52,155
There are many others.

1377
01:48:53,484 --> 01:48:54,758
I can operate them.

1378
01:49:03,564 --> 01:49:04,917
Dr. Shaw?

1379
01:49:17,164 --> 01:49:18,358
Dr. Shaw!

1380
01:49:19,724 --> 01:49:20,839
Over here.

1381
01:49:26,324 --> 01:49:28,201
Where is my cross?

1382
01:49:28,684 --> 01:49:30,481
The pouch in my utility belt.

1383
01:49:48,484 --> 01:49:50,236
Even after all this...

1384
01:49:50,404 --> 01:49:52,360
...you still believe, don't you?

1385
01:49:53,164 --> 01:49:56,042
You said you could
understand their navigation...

1386
01:49:56,564 --> 01:49:57,758
...use their maps.

1387
01:49:59,684 --> 01:50:01,322
Yes, of course.

1388
01:50:01,484 --> 01:50:03,714
Once we get
to one of their other ships...

1389
01:50:03,884 --> 01:50:06,876
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

1390
01:50:07,564 --> 01:50:10,397
I don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1391
01:50:12,164 --> 01:50:14,724
I want to go where they came from.

1392
01:50:16,044 --> 01:50:18,353
Do you think you can do that, David?

1393
01:50:22,084 --> 01:50:23,233
Yes.

1394
01:50:23,844 --> 01:50:25,641
I believe I can.

1395
01:50:34,604 --> 01:50:37,118
May I ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

1396
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:39,755
They created us.

1397
01:50:39,964 --> 01:50:41,443
Then they tried to kill us.

1398
01:50:41,964 --> 01:50:43,795
They changed their minds.

1399
01:50:45,324 --> 01:50:46,916
I deserve to know why.

1400
01:50:49,004 --> 01:50:50,562
The answer is irrelevant.

1401
01:50:51,564 --> 01:50:53,759
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

1402
01:50:54,444 --> 01:50:55,559
Yes.

1403
01:50:56,844 --> 01:50:58,436
Yes, it does.

1404
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:00,519
I don't understand.

1405
01:51:01,964 --> 01:51:03,033
Well...

1406
01:51:05,004 --> 01:51:07,916
...I guess that's because
I'm a human being...

1407
01:51:08,084 --> 01:51:09,483
...and you're a robot.

1408
01:51:18,924 --> 01:51:19,834
I'm sorry.

1409
01:51:20,004 --> 01:51:21,153
It's quite all right.

1410
01:51:35,724 --> 01:51:38,397
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.

1411
01:51:38,564 --> 01:51:39,474
The ship and her...

1412
01:51:39,644 --> 01:51:41,680
...entire crew are gone.

1413
01:51:41,884 --> 01:51:43,681
If you're receiving this transmission...

1414
01:51:43,844 --> 01:51:47,075
...make no attempt
to come to its point of origin.

1415
01:51:47,244 --> 01:51:51,283
There is only death here now,
and I'm leaving it behind.

1416
01:51:52,324 --> 01:51:54,042
It is New Year's Day...

1417
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:57,116
...the year of our Lord, 2094.

1418
01:51:58,004 --> 01:52:00,393
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...

1419
01:52:00,604 --> 01:52:03,402
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.

1420
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:06,273
And I am still searching.
