1
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,287
<i>Hey folks, I know the Mets are
down three zip in the best of seven.</i>

2
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:15,848
<i>I know no world series team has ever
come back from 3-0 down to win 4th straight.</i>

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,688
<i>I know they haven't played well,</i>

4
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:19,128
<i>I know the pitching's been bad.</i>

5
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,128
<i>I know no clutch hitting in '86 and '69,</i>

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,088
<i>seem a long, long time ago.</i>

7
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,928
<i>And there's no Ruth there's no Garett,
goodness gracious, no Donn Clendenon.</i>

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,808
<i>But, you are not out of it
until you lose 4 games,</i>

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,249
<i>in a best of 7.</i>

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,506
<i>That is all there is to it.</i>

11
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,728
<i>Back to the phones we go, Bruce is
in Bay Side. Bruce, how are you?</i>

12
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:43,528
<i>How you doin' Chris?</i>

13
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,168
<i>Good to have you aboard, what's up?</i>

14
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:47,840
<i>Listen, I'm writing off this season.</i>

15
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:51,168
<i>As far as I'm concerned, the Mets
are out of it. They're down 3...</i>

16
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:52,507
<i>Writing off?</i>

17
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:58,129
<i>If you look at great teams
of the past, the As in the '88,</i>

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,529
<i>the Indians in '54,
went over 100 games.</i>

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,209
<i>The following years these teams
weren't been anything. They're no good.</i>

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,341
<i>Forget it, they're gonna
be out of this year.</i>

21
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:09,849
<i>Question! Did the Indians in '54 say
after the loss of the third game:</i>

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>"Stop the show at game 4, we've lost".</i>

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,249
<i>They won.</i>

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,049
<i>Did the As do it? The As won in '89.</i>

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,129
<i>It's not easy to win every single year.</i>

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,930
<i>This is a team that has
proven they cannot win.</i>

27
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:27,689
<i>- It's so obvious. Every year...
- They won in '86, did they?</i>

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,707
<i>They won in '86 because the guy...</i>

29
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,428
<i>Go! Go!</i>

30
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,863
<i>How many times
you've been late for school?</i>

31
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:08,485
<i>Your sister gets to school on time.</i>

32
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:12,312
<i>What's the problem with you guys?</i>

33
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:17,010
You wanna be driven
around like the President.

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,410
I'm your goddamn chauffeur!

35
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,210
Dad, it wasn't our fault!

36
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,508
Yeah, whose fault was it, mine?

37
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:23,930
No.

38
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,829
Aunt Wendy told us
to take out the garbage.

39
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,548
And she hogged the bathroom.

40
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,149
All morning!

41
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,651
We couldn't get in there,
wash our teeth or do anything.

42
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:38,731
We had to wait till she got out.
By the time we got out the bus was gone.

43
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,868
So how're we supposed to be on time?

44
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,771
It's the only way we're gonna get there.

45
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,948
Hey, listen to me!
I'm the boss, not aunt Wendy!

46
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,731
When it's your turn to use the bathroom,

47
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,709
you tell aunt Wendy to get
the fuck out of the bathroom!

48
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:53,869
What are you, men or mice?

49
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,527
She's hogging the bathroom.
Call me, I'll throw her the fuck out!

50
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,371
They're gonna lose, 4-0!

51
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,972
No, they're not!
They're gonna win!

52
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,309
Strawberry is going to fucking kill them.

53
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,709
Knock it off!

54
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,390
Strawberry is killing them.

55
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:24,790
Knock it off, will you?

56
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,470
Giving me a goddamn headache.

57
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,790
Bye, dad!

58
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,333
Get some shots.
I want some shots over here.

59
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,831
From this point, in here.

60
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:46,671
Mikey, come here. I think we've
got some prints over here.

61
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,792
How you doin' Mikey?

62
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,471
I got two young girls,

63
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,773
shot in the head, twice each.

64
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,573
Kinda messy.
Over here, Mikey.

65
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:03,454
Get some pictures from the other side.

66
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,312
I don't know if they're still wearing
the rounds in their head or what.

67
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,734
Hey Mikey, get this back door over there.

68
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,912
There's something on the inside.
Thank you.

69
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,033
Anybody seen anybody?

70
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,175
We got this one Chinese guy over here.

71
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,712
Saw a couple of guys running over
these park benches, 1st Park Avenue.

72
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,974
We got a pretty good
description on the two guys.

73
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:37,254
The uniform guy put it on the air.
We'll see what happens.

74
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:40,017
Michael, on the inside of that door.

75
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,575
Let me have some shots on the eye level.

76
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,215
The Mets my ass.
Dodgers will smoke them.

77
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,192
What about tomorrow?

78
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,473
What are you thinking?
You like the Mets?

79
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,873
What do you think of that shit back there?

80
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,375
Terrible.

81
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,215
You guys got money coming,
what are you gonna do?

82
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:58,553
Dodgers all the way.

83
00:05:59,015 --> 00:05:59,935
Save the money.

84
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,095
With Cone the pitcher?

85
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,335
That Cone-head motherfucker
got right for his game.

86
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,735
I wouldn't bury the Mets.

87
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,175
Even money with Cone the pitcher?

88
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,513
That's right.

89
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:10,073
You don't think they're
gonna beat him twice, do you?

90
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,936
They're right.

91
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,810
I'm putting my $300 on Mets even money.

92
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,165
Listen...

93
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,575
take the $500,
put it on the Mets.

94
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:28,194
You say it like it's a fucking
death sentence. It's a smart bet.

95
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,953
I think it is a fucking death sentence.

96
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:33,376
Strawberry...

97
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,296
No, man. He can't win 4 in a row.

98
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,856
Three, that's it, max.

99
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,474
What about Strawberry?

100
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,026
Gimme some for the phone, please.

101
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:35,497
<i>- Mike, how are you?
- What's up man, how you doin'?</i>

102
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,155
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

103
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:39,057
<i>We took in $10,000 in action.</i>

104
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,337
<i>We got 6 on the Mets,
4 on the Dodgers.</i>

105
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,675
Plus I want another $15,000
on my own, on LA.

106
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:49,697
15? But that's what you're up!
Why don't you just go ahead?

107
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,835
Don't give me that bullshit.

108
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,577
The Dodgers are a lock.

109
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,876
Are you sure?

110
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,738
Just put in the bet.
I wanna make some money.

111
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,396
You got it.

112
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,277
Gimme something cooked.

113
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,996
It's good shit. Cut it in half.

114
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,837
Shit's gonna kill you, man.

115
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,757
What the fuck, are you a drug counselor?

116
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,997
Or a drug dealer? You don't do your own
product, what kind of business you makin'?

117
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,038
Get back! Police activity!

118
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,798
Just something back for the road.

119
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,227
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I'll have the money.

120
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:54,983
Easy! Easy!

121
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:58,231
Which one of you guys got the money?

122
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,384
Empty your pockets out, the two of you.

123
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,167
Empty your pockets, let me see them.

124
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,452
If I wasn't black you
wouldn't be doing this shit, man.

125
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:08,143
- He did it.
- I did what? You shut the hell up, man.

126
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,362
What's going on?

127
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:13,442
Lieutenant sir, the owner says
they stole cash from the register.

128
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,282
Shut the fuck up!

129
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:18,202
He was chasing them down
the block when I caught up with them.

130
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,744
Go get me a Bud. A High Boy.

131
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,442
Make sure it's fucking cold.
I'll straighten this out.

132
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,965
- That's bullshit.
- That's he!

133
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,761
- It's him! Arrest him!
- How much did they take?

134
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:29,850
How much did they take?

135
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,195
500 dollars.

136
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,603
Take this guy down to
the precinct and make a report.

137
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:45,083
You've got to come with me, sir.

138
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:48,363
- No, I don't want to go.
- Just relax, okay, just relax.

139
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,363
Gimme the fucking money now.

140
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,164
Get the fuck outta here.

141
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,404
<i>Your daddy will be right back.</i>

142
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,244
The door sticks, just a second.

143
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,604
Just on time.

144
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:19,764
I've some very,
very fine brown shit for you.

145
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,507
Same you loved last time you were here.

146
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:28,045
No, nobody there.

147
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:35,325
Where is your pipe?

148
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,619
You ready?

149
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,686
Let's see, where'd I put the lighter?

150
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:14,006
Here's the lighter.

151
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:17,846
You got a lighter.

152
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,605
I'll light my cigarette.

153
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:24,286
It's lit, oh my God.

154
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,247
Get you a little bit more right here.

155
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,487
A little more.

156
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,526
It's a big pile.

157
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:09,232
<i>So with Brett Butler went on third
and Cow Daniel's on first.</i>

158
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,512
<i>Strawberry stands in
against David Coner.</i>

159
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,073
<i>Coner leading in for the side.</i>

160
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,353
<i>He goes to the stretch,
the pitcher on the way.</i>

161
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:21,585
<i>And it's a long, high blast,
right center field.</i>

162
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:25,313
<i>Over the fence, off
the score board of Shea Stadium.</i>

163
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:28,393
<i>Darryl Strawberry trots around the bases,</i>

164
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,793
<i>and he hits one of those shots
that have trademarked his career.</i>

165
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:35,793
<i>Play the crowd, but baby,
too little, too late.</i>

166
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:39,756
<i>The Mets 11-0 lead is now 11-3.</i>

167
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,953
<i>A three run homer for Strawberry,</i>

168
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:47,154
<i>his third home run of the series
and RBIs 10, 11, and 12.</i>

169
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,313
<i>It's 11-3 Mets.</i>

170
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,885
<i>No matter how far Strawberry hits a ball,</i>

171
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:54,308
<i>he cannot drive in enough runs,</i>

172
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:56,306
<i>to get the Dodgers back in this game.</i>

173
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:59,268
<i>Strawberry with the moon
shot getting congratulations...</i>

174
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,834
<i>in the Dodgers dugout.</i>

175
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:03,175
<i>That brings is Eric Davis to the plate</i>

176
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:05,754
and right now all the Dodgers
wanna try and do,

177
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:09,433
<i>is close the Mets out, gain some
momentum back going into game 5.</i>

178
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,999
<i>If they can make a little noise here,
get some offence going...</i>

179
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,055
I'm going to the table, sit here.
Mom, you okay?

180
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,055
Have a little bit of cake, huh?

181
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,732
Strawberry, you wanna cup of coffee?

182
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,772
Why don't you come in
and have a cup of coffee?

183
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:34,213
<i>You know, let's face it folks.</i>

184
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,794
<i>I know they got a ways to go yet.</i>

185
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,451
<i>I know they have ways to go,
with the Dodgers.</i>

186
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,599
<i>Possible man shot, 153 King Street.</i>

187
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:49,733
<i>First one to get is always
the hardest to get.</i>

188
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,887
<i>Confirmed man shot.</i>

189
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:10,795
Hey Veronica baby, what's going on?

190
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,213
There's a key somewhere under the back seat.

191
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:22,007
- Over here is a black man
with his throat cut.
- They come in here?

192
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,669
- Yeah, probably.
- They search the car?

193
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,461
- I'll check car.
- All right, good.

194
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:32,359
<i>- Hey Sarge, how you doin' boss?
- I got a black male with his throat slit.</i>

195
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:38,128
- Any weapons?
- That needs checking.

196
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:54,734
- What's that?
- Coke.

197
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,094
Put it in evidence.

198
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:11,701
I want you two guys to go contact your
junkie friends over on 125th street.

199
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:15,157
See what you get up. And you
two guys go over to porn shops,

200
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:16,596
<i>see what else we can get from that.</i>

201
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:17,934
What's going on?

202
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:20,717
They raped a nun in Spanish Harlem.

203
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:23,836
Imagine have that happen to you.
I would have killed these motherfuckers.

204
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:26,757
They took the fucking chalice,
the Host was still in there.

205
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:27,916
What did they want with the Host?

206
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:30,396
What the fuck you think? What do
you think, they wanted to eat the Host?

207
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:32,957
<i>They wanted to pawn
that fucking chalice off.</i>

208
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,735
They put up a $50,000 reward.

209
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,055
Leave it to the Catholic Church.

210
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,095
Girls get raped every day,

211
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:42,797
and now we're putting up 50 Gs just
because these chicks wear penguin suits.

212
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,815
What is your fucking problem?

213
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,317
The church is a racket.

214
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:50,357
So what? Are you a catholic?

215
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:51,895
I'm a catholic.

216
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,936
Why don't you have
a little bit of fucking respect?

217
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,520
Hey, fuck that noise.
How about the Mets?

218
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,517
I bet you won a shitload on 'em.

219
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:07,597
More than you did.

220
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:09,016
I wanna get paid.

221
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,775
What about tomorrow?
Where do you guys wanna go?

222
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,077
You wanna make a bundle,
leave it all on the Mets.

223
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:18,296
What, you think they're gonna beat Martinez?

224
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,598
The series has got to last 7 games.

225
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,278
Do you know how much money
is riding for commercial time alone,

226
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,096
for the New York, L.A. team?

227
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,986
When is the last time
the series in New York,

228
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,624
did not last 7 games?

229
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,776
Revenue alone in TV commercials?

230
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,438
Endorsements for the players,

231
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:43,376
The income it's bringing to the city
in transportation, there are no
fucking jobs in New York, are there?

232
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,496
There's no way the series will end tomorrow.

233
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,079
There's too many people want
to milk it for all its worth.

234
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,017
Did I steer you wrong yesterday?

235
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,337
I make a small move.
Leave it on the Mets.

236
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,616
What you wanna do?

237
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,417
I'm in.

238
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,319
Are you a doubter?
I'll tell you what then.

239
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,439
Don't listen to the advice
I told you yesterday.

240
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,697
So you owe me money.

241
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,657
What you wanna do?

242
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,818
Can I help you with something?

243
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:09,236
I'm in charge of the investigation.

244
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:12,433
I'm just checking security.

245
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,458
Security...

246
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,658
You wouldn't want those
guys coming back, would you?

247
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:20,699
For the nun? Or for you?

248
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:36,561
<i>Here at the soil
are the undergarments,</i>

249
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:37,681
and the nun's habit.

250
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:40,139
They are to be taken
by you for evidence.

251
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:44,440
Now, black pubic hair,

252
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:46,241
<i>other than the patient was found,</i>

253
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:47,881
<i>during colon inspection.</i>

254
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:50,099
<i>Here are the samples of that.</i>

255
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:56,379
<i>There was trauma to the vaginal mucosa
with multiple lacerations,</i>

256
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,939
<i>that appear to be made
with a sharp object,</i>

257
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:02,339
<i>in which the hymen
membrane is broken.</i>

258
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:07,300
<i>It was stated that
this object was a crucifix.</i>

259
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,980
<i>Trauma consistent with multiple penetration.</i>

260
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,161
<i>3cm laceration.</i>

261
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:18,899
<i>Let the Mets be uplifting.
Let the Mets have dinner at home.</i>

262
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:27,939
<i>One bullet has been lodged.</i>

263
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:31,962
<i>Just a couple of more to go.
And I tell you something right now:</i>

264
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:34,002
<i>The longer this series goes...</i>

265
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:35,340
<i>the longer this series goes...</i>

266
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:39,482
<i>the Dodgers will get awfully tight.</i>

267
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,580
<i>And if it somehow
gets two games seventh,</i>

268
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,500
Do you girls know you're
driving with a tail light out?

269
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

270
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:05,402
No, we didn't know.
Thank you for telling us.

271
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:07,700
Let me see your license and registration.

272
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,341
Actually, I don't have my license with me.

273
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:20,020
- You don't?
- No.

274
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,861
- You have a driver's license?
- No.

275
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,926
You don't have it with you?

276
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:29,581
Whose car is this?

277
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:34,701
Listen, this is our father's car,
we don't have a license.

278
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,941
Does he know you got it?

279
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,403
Yeah.

280
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,941
He does?

281
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,661
Does he know you got the car?

282
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:50,542
Well, not exactly.

283
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:54,981
You've been bad girls, huh?

284
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,942
Where you're coming from?

285
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,981
New Jersey.

286
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,502
Any drugs in the car?

287
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,284
No.

288
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:08,782
- No drugs?
- No.

289
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:11,182
Where were you tonight?

290
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:14,765
We were at the Cat Club.

291
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:19,780
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we were at the Cat Club.

292
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:23,485
You know I should take you in for driving
without a license and registration?

293
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,062
That's a serious thing.

294
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,702
I'll have to call your father up.

295
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:32,925
How do you feel about that?

296
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:35,302
Don't, don't do that.

297
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:40,503
What were you girls doing at the...
what was? Kit Cat Club?

298
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,622
You get a little stoned there?

299
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:47,205
Come on. I'll do the right thing
if you do the right thing.

300
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:50,662
I know what it's like to get stoned
a little bit, to get high a little bit.

301
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:53,542
You gettin' stoned there?

302
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,245
Have any grass there, coke?

303
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:56,943
We smoked a little grass.

304
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,543
How would your father feel
if he knew that you were here now?

305
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,623
You won't tell him.

306
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:07,063
That depends.
What do you think about that?

307
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:10,645
Couple of very beautiful girls,
you know that?

308
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:13,183
Come on, give us a break.

309
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:20,023
Couldn't you just give us a warning
for not having... for the tail light,

310
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,343
...and let us go home?

311
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:25,744
Well you know something,
two just beautiful girls like you...

312
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:28,864
I could give you a warning.

313
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:31,543
You want a warning?

314
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:34,823
Here's the warning.

315
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:39,144
You do something for me, I'll do something
for you. What do you say about that?

316
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:45,103
You do something for me and your father
won't find out you took his car and
you're driving without a license.

317
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,184
You got a boyfriend?

318
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,998
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.

319
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,486
I'll tell you something right now.
Listen up to me, ok?

320
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:04,624
I'm gonna take you down to
the precinct house and call your father.

321
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,624
You hear me?

322
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,286
You can't do that.

323
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,664
What would you do for me if I don't do that?

324
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:12,647
Whatever you say.

325
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:15,225
- Yeah?
- You can't call our father.

326
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:28,142
You ever sucked a guy's cock?

327
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:30,825
Did you?

328
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,545
Look at me, you.

329
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:36,225
You ever sucked a guy's cock?

330
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,127
I'm talking to you.
You ever sucked a guy's cock?

331
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,847
Are you serious?

332
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,185
Did you?

333
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:48,306
Yeah, so?

334
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:51,705
Don't talk to me that way,
you hear me?

335
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,327
I'm gonna hold your ass right in,
you hear me?

336
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:56,705
Sorry.

337
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:04,505
Just let us go.

338
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:05,968
We're gonna fix it in the morning.

339
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:08,207
I'll let you go.

340
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,728
Turn around. I wanna see your ass.
You mind that?

341
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,023
Just one look at your ass.

342
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,626
What do you say?

343
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:22,865
You, come here.
Look at me. Look at me.

344
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,666
You ever sucked a guy's cock?

345
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,409
You ever sucked a guy's... look at me!

346
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,886
You ever sucked a guy's cock?

347
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,306
Let me see how you do it.

348
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:44,546
Show me your mouth
when you suck a guy's cock.

349
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:48,627
Come on.

350
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,547
Show me your mouth.

351
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:54,107
What's the big fucking deal, you've
sucked a guy's cock before, haven't you?

352
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,026
Come on, show me.

353
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:01,787
Show me how you suck
a guy's cock, you hear me?

354
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,986
Show me how you suck...
just turn around.

355
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,564
Show me how you suck
a guy's cock. I'm fucking serious!

356
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:13,521
The last time I'm gonna ask you.
I'm taking you in, you hear me?

357
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:16,375
Show me how you suck
a guy's cock.

358
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,729
Show me with your mouth.

359
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,788
Come on, spit the gum out.
Gimme the fucking gum.

360
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,558
Show me how you suck
a guy's cock.

361
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:29,267
Come on, show me. Show me.

362
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,587
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth and show me!

363
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:41,530
Show me. Open your mouth.
That's it, show me, like that.

364
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:44,290
Like that.
Come on, you little fuck.

365
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:48,290
Show me! That's it, close your eyes
and lick that fucking dick in your mouth.

366
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,548
Come on, that's it. You suck it.
You suck it up.

367
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,427
Show me that fucking mouth.

368
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,588
You like sucking dick?

369
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:22,359
You like sucking a fucking dick?

370
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:27,441
Open your mouth
and lick the fucking dick.

371
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:35,457
Cocksucker,
open your fucking mouth.

372
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,499
It's ok, he's leaving.

373
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,516
Go gently with her.

374
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:11,355
Sister, I can't imagine
how you feel right now.

375
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:16,876
But it's very important that we learn
as much about what happened as possible,

376
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:21,417
<i>so we can get this information
out over the police radio.</i>

377
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:25,116
<i>What can you tell me
about what happened?</i>

378
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,516
<i>Can you tell me
how many of them were?</i>

379
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:33,293
<i>Can you tell me what color they were?</i>

380
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,939
<i>Were they black? Were they white?
Were they Hispanic?</i>

381
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,996
<i>Can you tell me how old they were?</i>

382
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,116
<i>Was one older than the other?</i>

383
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,397
<i>There were two of them.</i>

384
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,557
<i>Two young men.</i>

385
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,716
What can you tell me
about the older of the two?

386
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,978
<i>Were there any distinguishing marks?</i>

387
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:07,077
<i>Or tattoos? An earring?</i>

388
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,757
<i>Did he have a beard or a moustache?</i>

389
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,037
<i>Can you tell me how they were dressed?</i>

390
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,917
Sister, I know this is difficult, but
I can't emphasize how important it is.

391
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:32,157
<i>the sooner we can
get this information out over the...</i>

392
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,460
<i>Here it is, ball two from Franco,</i>

393
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:39,077
<i>and John Franco is struggling.</i>

394
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,957
<i>Daniel's in a game situation here
and if he can work his way aboard...</i>

395
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:55,603
<i>Strawberry has the chance
to play hero once again.</i>

396
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:11,007
<i>Strawberry on deck.
Strawberry already with 3 hits tonight.</i>

397
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:15,141
<i>And there's a strike.
3 to 1 and count.</i>

398
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:18,420
Alright, move. Take the pitch.

399
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:21,679
Eyes! Eyes! Come on Daniel!

400
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,980
<i>Left of second for one. Relay to first.
It's a double play!</i>

401
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,461
You cocksucker!
You fucking miserable fucking...!

402
00:42:33,462 --> 00:42:34,758
Cocksucker!

403
00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:50,679
He's a fucking shit!

404
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:54,758
You fucking nigger fucking cocksucker!

405
00:43:05,622 --> 00:43:08,600
You fucking piece of shit!

406
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:18,919
<i>The body of Christ.</i>

407
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,451
The body of Christ.

408
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,920
Congratulations... asshole.

409
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,982
Now you owe me 30,000.
Now what are you gonna do?

410
00:43:51,983 --> 00:43:54,525
Double or nothing on the next game.

411
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:58,342
Double or nothing.
Are you out of your mind?

412
00:43:58,343 --> 00:44:01,401
There's no way I'm gonna
let that bastard take my money.

413
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:04,902
Take your money? This guy will
blow up your house along with you,

414
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:07,040
and everybody else in it.

415
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:10,663
There's no way LA's gonna lose
this game, they're playing at home.

416
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:12,881
Strawberry is ready to break out.

417
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:16,063
Fuck Strawberry.

418
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:18,383
You're gonna end up
owing this maniac 60,000.

419
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,880
That's my business.
Just place the bet.

420
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:46,922
Those boys.

421
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:50,681
Those sad, raging boys...

422
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:55,481
They came to me as the needy do.

423
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,962
And like many of the needy,
they were rude.

424
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,481
Like all the needy, they took.

425
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:06,202
And like all the needy, they needed.

426
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:11,761
<i>Father. I knew them.</i>

427
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:14,903
<i>They learn in our school.</i>

428
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:17,104
<i>And they play in our school yard.</i>

429
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:19,322
<i>And they are good boys.</i>

430
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,282
<i>You knew them?</i>

431
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:24,882
<i>Who were they, Sister?</i>

432
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:28,762
<i>Who are the boys?</i>

433
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:32,402
<i>What are the names of these...</i>

434
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:35,642
<i>good boys you knew?</i>

435
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:39,122
I could tell you their names now.

436
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:42,402
And I know you'd be bound
by a sacred vow,

437
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,283
to keep my secret.

438
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:47,483
But I cannot tell you their names.

439
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:51,417
<i>For I too am bound.</i>

440
00:45:52,105 --> 00:45:54,723
<i>Jesus turned water to wine.</i>

441
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:59,643
I ought to have turned bitter
semen to fertile sperm.

442
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,603
Hatred to love.

443
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:07,123
And maybe to have saved their souls.

444
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,203
<i>They did not love me.</i>

445
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:12,203
<i>But I ought to have loved them.</i>

446
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:15,924
<i>For Jesus loved those
who reviled him.</i>

447
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:20,183
<i>And never again shall
I encounter two boys,</i>

448
00:46:20,184 --> 00:46:22,563
<i>whose prayer was more poignant,</i>

449
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:25,403
<i>More legible.</i>

450
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:27,684
<i>More anguished.</i>

451
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:30,348
<i>Sid Fernandez and Darryl Strawberry,
a battle of wits and talent here.</i>

452
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:33,086
<i>In the bottom of the ninth in Los Angeles.</i>

453
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:36,566
<i>Strawberry readies himself.</i>

454
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:39,708
<i>Fernandez checks for the sign.</i>

455
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,846
<i>The pitch on the way, swinging.
Strike one.</i>

456
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:47,068
<i>1 and 1, on Strawberry as
Fernandez came in...</i>

457
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:49,631
<i>with that fast ball
and Darryl could not connect.</i>

458
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:51,692
<i>1 and 1, the count. Two outs.</i>

459
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,006
<i>Bottom of the night for L.A.,
men on second and third.</i>

460
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:01,687
<i>The Dodgers find themselves down by 3 and
in need of one of those Darryl moonshots.</i>

461
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,766
<i>One-one pitch from Fernandez.</i>

462
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:08,767
<i>Swinging foul ball,
off to the third base side.</i>

463
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,069
<i>1 and 2 the count to Strawberry now,</i>

464
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,949
<i>as he once again, walks around,</i>

465
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:18,767
<i>thinks about what he might see
on this next pitch from Sid Fernandez.</i>

466
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,670
<i>New York Mets, trying to do something
that no other team has ever done.</i>

467
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:33,528
<i>Come back from a 3-0
deficit in a best of 7 series.</i>

468
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,888
<i>Strawberry is ready,
so is Fernandez.</i>

469
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,909
<i>On the way...</i>

470
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,727
<i>High and outside, it's now 2-2.</i>

471
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:49,869
<i>So the string runs a little bit longer.</i>

472
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:54,949
<i>The tension builds here in L.A..
As Strawberry and Fernández battle.</i>

473
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,007
<i>Dodgers trying to eliminate the Mets.</i>

474
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:59,276
<i>The Mets trying hard...</i>

475
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:00,310
<i>to send this series</i>

476
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,270
<i>to a seventh and final game.</i>

477
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:05,208
<i>Fernandez wants
to change baseballs now.</i>

478
00:50:06,151 --> 00:50:08,790
<i>He gets another one back
from the home plate umpire.</i>

479
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:12,368
<i>It's now a 2-2 count in a game situation.</i>

480
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:16,350
<i>Once again, no team has
ever come back from 3-0 deficit,</i>

481
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:17,790
<i>to come back and win a series.</i>

482
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,390
<i>That's what the Mets
are trying to accomplish here.</i>

483
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:23,590
<i>Strawberry with that big year
this year for the Dodgers.</i>

484
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:26,910
<i>Trying to continue his
hot hitting in this play-off.</i>

485
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:28,830
<i>So it's lefty against lefty,</i>

486
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:31,688
<i>old teammate against old teammate.</i>

487
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:33,831
<i>Strawberry steps in.</i>

488
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:35,968
<i>Fernandez to the stretch.</i>

489
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:37,768
<i>The pitch!</i>

490
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,831
<i>He goes around?</i>

491
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,729
<i>Yes! Darryl Strawberry!</i>

492
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:47,831
<i>On the check swing goes to the
far, he strikes out.</i>

493
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:52,031
<i>This game is over.
As Strawberry goes down looking.</i>

494
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:55,992
<i>The Dodgers are looking at a Mets team
that has tied this series to three.</i>

495
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:59,951
<i>What drama on a 3-2
pitch third base umpire said,</i>

496
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:02,361
<i>yes sir, he did go around.</i>

497
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:06,751
<i>And the expression in
Darryl Strawberry's face says it all.</i>

498
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:11,350
<i>We're tied 3 games a piece,
and the Mets win 8 to 5.</i>

499
00:51:56,072 --> 00:52:00,071
Hey! You alone, come here.

500
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:41,530
It's like the old days.

501
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,698
Knock yourself out, ok?

502
00:53:41,196 --> 00:53:44,538
Do it man, come on.

503
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,244
How many drinks did you have?

504
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:12,093
Well, you got the money?

505
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:16,053
What money?

506
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:19,089
Stop fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

507
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:23,613
I don't got it. Not tonight.

508
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,874
You can't get blood from a stone.

509
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:29,156
Stop fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

510
00:54:29,157 --> 00:54:32,014
This ain't no fucking
joke anymore, seriously.

511
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:37,278
Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

512
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,291
<i>You're a fucking joke, you know that?</i>

513
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,899
- Sweetheart...
- You make me laugh.

514
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,372
Can we get a vodka on the rocks.

515
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:45,553
<i>He's been waiting since the game ended.</i>

516
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:48,674
<i>You got me waiting
3 hours like a fucking moron.</i>

517
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:52,714
<i>What do you think? That you're
like a big game or something with you?</i>

518
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,457
<i>I'm gonna win.</i>

519
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:00,756
<i>Just make sure the fucking bet's in.</i>

520
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,916
I told you once before that,

521
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:06,836
this guy will come by your house and
blow your house up with your wife and kids.

522
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,436
<i>Good.</i>

523
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:11,276
<i>I'll give him an extra
10 grand for his trouble.</i>

524
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:12,436
<i>Hate that fucking house.</i>

525
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:15,436
Ya? You think that maybe because
you're a cop he won't kill you?

526
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,277
You're this close already to death.

527
00:55:17,278 --> 00:55:20,415
I've been dodging fucking bullets
since I was fourteen.

528
00:55:20,637 --> 00:55:22,574
No one can kill me.

529
00:55:22,758 --> 00:55:24,295
I'm blessed.

530
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,214
I'm a fucking Catholic.

531
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,334
How's the case going?

532
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:36,757
<i>What case?</i>

533
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:40,175
The case with the $50,000 reward?
Remember?

534
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:45,175
We're on it big time.
Lots of leads.

535
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:50,615
You can use that 50 to
get yourself out of this hole.

536
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:53,735
The Dodgers are going to win the series.

537
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,295
It's a fucking lock.

538
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:58,135
Get this, man.

539
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:00,855
I was at the game today.

540
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,135
Face to fucking face with Strawberry.

541
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:06,855
<i>And... and...</i>

542
00:56:07,879 --> 00:56:09,536
<i>And I knew...</i>

543
00:56:09,878 --> 00:56:12,976
<i>that he struck out on purpose.</i>

544
00:56:14,398 --> 00:56:18,176
And that he's saving
it up for the Big One for tomorrow.

545
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,398
Today, for the first time, I understood...

546
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:23,238
<i>That you're sick of the fucking head.</i>

547
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:27,949
...that it never could
have gone any other way.

548
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:32,554
Never could have gone any other way.

549
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:36,838
So you'd just better
put in my fucking bet.

550
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:41,136
$120,000 on the last game.
The big one.

551
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:43,318
<i>Come on! Are you a bookmaker,
or fucking what?</i>

552
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:46,878
You know, I'll tell you the truth. To be
honest with you. I'm fed up with this.

553
00:56:46,879 --> 00:56:50,878
Here, I'm going to give you this
guy's number. You call him yourself.

554
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:52,678
You tell him what
the fuck you want.

555
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,696
Put your own bets from now on.

556
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:00,056
You leaving the sinking ship?

557
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,537
I'll give you something.
That ain't no joke.

558
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,896
You couldn't pay 60.

559
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,159
You lose, you'll be in for 120.

560
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,638
For a fucking guy like you,
they'll kill you for nothing.

561
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,537
Yeah, keep laughing.

562
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,857
<i>I was supposed to meet him
at midnight with the 60.</i>

563
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,857
<i>It's now 1:00.</i>

564
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,897
<i>Better be careful.
I mean it.</i>

565
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:18,818
What's up man. Come on in.

566
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:25,138
How you feeling? Come on in.

567
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:31,418
Go on and help your
sister with the homework.

568
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:36,939
Make yourself at home.
Sit down.

569
00:59:31,203 --> 00:59:33,242
The Dodgers are going to win tomorrow.

570
00:59:33,243 --> 00:59:34,900
Yes, I know.

571
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:53,980
There's 30.000 there, so be careful.

572
01:00:48,605 --> 01:00:50,461
Wanna give you a ride, man?

573
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,302
No.

574
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,302
You sure?

575
01:01:05,764 --> 01:01:07,542
You take care, man.

576
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,346
Large?

577
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:57,706
<i>I want my money.</i>

578
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,747
It's still my money.

579
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,506
If you wanna have a chance
at any part of it shithead,

580
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,306
you will take my bet!

581
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:12,907
For $120.000,

582
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,346
on tomorrow's game.

583
01:05:16,169 --> 01:05:18,369
<i>What about the one you
owe me from yesterday's game?</i>

584
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,587
Fuck yesterday's game!

585
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:25,147
The series is seven games not six!

586
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,347
Put in my bet.

587
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,587
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

588
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,308
There's nothing to think about.
Either you put in my bet,

589
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,628
or you get nothing.

590
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,867
<i>- Really?
- Ya?</i>

591
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,147
Really, I'm no fucking asshole.

592
01:05:45,771 --> 01:05:47,707
I'm a fucking cop!

593
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:51,908
<i>You meet me tomorrow.
In front of the Garden, 33rd and 8th.</i>

594
01:05:52,051 --> 01:05:54,677
<i>You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.</i>

595
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:48,654
<i>Vampires are lucky,
they can feed on others.</i>

596
01:09:48,655 --> 01:09:51,952
<i>We gotta eat away at ourselves.</i>

597
01:09:53,136 --> 01:09:57,455
<i>We gotta eat our legs
to get the energy to walk.</i>

598
01:09:57,456 --> 01:10:00,935
We gotta come, so we can go.

599
01:10:00,936 --> 01:10:03,872
We gotta suck ourselves off.

600
01:10:04,216 --> 01:10:08,953
We gotta eat away at ourselves
till there's nothing left but appetite.

601
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:14,993
We give, and give and...

602
01:10:15,496 --> 01:10:20,633
<i>give crazy. 'Cause a gift that
makes sense ain't worth it.</i>

603
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:25,873
<i>Jesus said seventy times seven.</i>

604
01:10:31,257 --> 01:10:36,646
<i>No one will ever understand
why, why you did it.</i>

605
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:41,452
<i>They'll just forget about you tomorrow,
but you gotta do it.</i>

606
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,935
<i>Hirscheiser leans in for the sign.</i>

607
01:10:43,936 --> 01:10:47,656
<i>His pitched Benia... ball outside.</i>

608
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:52,354
<i>Hirscheiser does not have his good stuff,
he has struggled the entire forth inning.</i>

609
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:54,469
<i>Gooden leads off third.</i>

610
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,656
<i>Vince Coleman on first dancing back
and forth trying to distract Hirscheiser,</i>

611
01:10:58,657 --> 01:11:01,696
<i>he's having enough trouble
concentrating on his pitches at this point.</i>

612
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:04,314
<i>Ease to the stretch.
Here's the 1-0 pitch to Benia.</i>

613
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:06,936
<i>And Benia rips it down third base line.</i>

614
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:10,473
<i>It's rolling toward the corner.
Gooden scores easily.</i>

615
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:14,502
<i>Now the ball is bouncing around the corner
and Coleman is tearing around third.</i>

616
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:15,537
<i>He'll score.</i>

617
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:19,336
<i>Benia rounds second holds up.
Goes back into second with a double.</i>

618
01:11:19,337 --> 01:11:22,576
<i>The Mets lead 5 to nothing.</i>

619
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:26,456
<i>And you gotta wonder, if the Dodgers
could ever recover from these deficit.</i>

620
01:11:26,457 --> 01:11:29,101
<i>That should be it for Hirscheiser.</i>

621
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:36,696
<i>Before he even reaches the mound,
he has motioned to the bull pen.</i>

622
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:38,914
<i>And in relief comes Ramon Martinez.</i>

623
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:38,356
Listen to me, sister.

624
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,716
Listen to me good.

625
01:12:42,019 --> 01:12:46,716
The other cops'll will just put these
guys through the system.

626
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:52,276
They're juveniles.
They'll walk.

627
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:54,957
Get it?

628
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,757
But I'll beat the system.

629
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:02,357
And do justice.

630
01:13:03,219 --> 01:13:05,196
Real justice.

631
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:08,316
For you.

632
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,557
I have already forgiven them.

633
01:13:14,874 --> 01:13:19,387
Come on lady! These guys
put out cigarettes on your tits.

634
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,837
Get with the program.

635
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:35,060
How could you...

636
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:41,357
How could you
forgive these motherf...

637
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,357
These guys. Excuse me.

638
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:51,397
How could you?

639
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,958
Deep down inside, don't you want
them to pay for what they did to you?

640
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,956
Don't you want this crime revenged?

641
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:08,678
I have forgiven them.

642
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,558
But do you have the right?

643
01:14:25,701 --> 01:14:28,359
You're not the only woman in the world.

644
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:31,639
You're not even the only nun.

645
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:36,962
Your forgiveness...

646
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:41,175
will leave blood in its wake.

647
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,248
What if these guys
do this...

648
01:14:44,249 --> 01:14:47,221
to other nuns?

649
01:14:49,582 --> 01:14:51,359
Other virgins?

650
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:57,159
Old women who die from the shock?

651
01:14:58,062 --> 01:15:02,399
Do you have the right to
let these boys go free?

652
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:08,199
Can you bear the burden, sister?

653
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:14,617
Talk to Jesus.

654
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:16,799
Pray.

655
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:25,079
You do believe in God, don't you?

656
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:32,999
<i>That Jesus Christ died for your sins?</i>

657
01:16:55,305 --> 01:17:00,801
<i>What? Got something
that you wanna say to me?</i>

658
01:17:01,105 --> 01:17:03,682
<i>You fuck!</i>

659
01:17:03,904 --> 01:17:07,601
<i>You rat fucker, you!</i>

660
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:32,403
What?

661
01:17:33,145 --> 01:17:36,802
Say something. I know,
you're just standing there.

662
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:58,043
You gotta say something!

663
01:17:58,506 --> 01:18:00,323
<i>Something!</i>

664
01:18:01,225 --> 01:18:04,185
<i>You fuck! You fucking stand there!</i>

665
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:07,723
<i>And you want me
to do every fucking thing!</i>

666
01:18:07,866 --> 01:18:09,643
Where were you?

667
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:12,830
Where the fuck were you?

668
01:18:12,831 --> 01:18:15,189
Where were you?

669
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:21,603
Where the hell were you?

670
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:46,684
I'm sorry.

671
01:18:48,147 --> 01:18:50,644
I'm sorry!

672
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:54,003
I'm sorry!

673
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:58,644
I did so many bad things!

674
01:19:09,107 --> 01:19:11,524
I tried...

675
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:17,226
I tried to do...

676
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:22,404
the right thing, but I'm weak!
I'm too fucking weak!

677
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:27,324
I need you to help me!

678
01:19:28,948 --> 01:19:31,005
Help me!

679
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:39,245
Forgive me.

680
01:19:42,988 --> 01:19:44,805
Forgive me, please.

681
01:19:45,468 --> 01:19:47,605
<i>Forgive me, Father.</i>

682
01:20:19,308 --> 01:20:22,446
<i>Quite a match up here.
Ramon Martinez against Johnson.</i>

683
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:23,447
<i>The power pitcher and the fast ball hitter.</i>

684
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:35,485
I stole it from my husband's shop.

685
01:20:36,829 --> 01:20:40,508
So I could return it
to where it ought to be.

686
01:20:40,509 --> 01:20:42,429
It's a holy thing.

687
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:45,210
A holy thing.

688
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:48,909
- Which way is it?
- The boy's right across the street there.

689
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,548
Julio and Pablo.

690
01:20:51,549 --> 01:20:53,671
It's a holy thing.

691
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:55,176
A holy thing.

692
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:02,819
Baila. Baila si quieres mas.

693
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,910
Freeze! Put your hands in front of you.

694
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:30,240
Keep your hands out in front of you.
Get outta here.

695
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:37,487
You, get out.

696
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:47,728
<i>And the remaining Dodger fans,
have finally something to cheer about.</i>

697
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,430
<i>The Dodgers must have been wondering...</i>

698
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,328
<i>if they could do anything right today.</i>

699
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:02,208
Put them on.

700
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,248
Lock them.

701
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:18,888
- What's your name?
- Julio.

702
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:22,328
- What's your name?
- Pablo.

703
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:45,916
Put your hands where I can see them.

704
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,409
Gimme a light.

705
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:37,729
<i>Now it's going to be Harris,
representing the Dodgers' final hope.</i>

706
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,730
Hold it.

707
01:23:40,793 --> 01:23:42,730
Want some good shit?

708
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:50,290
<i>Harris, like many of these
Dodgers, came out on fire.</i>

709
01:23:59,593 --> 01:24:03,432
<i>Mets are now all standing
on the steps for anticipation.</i>

710
01:24:03,433 --> 01:24:05,370
<i>Pitch thrown his ball one.</i>

711
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:09,224
<i>The count's even, 1-1.</i>

712
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:14,051
Put your hand up there,
where I can see them.

713
01:24:18,313 --> 01:24:19,952
<i>...and they're already celebrating.</i>

714
01:24:19,953 --> 01:24:21,993
<i>Foul ball, coming back and out of play.</i>

715
01:24:21,994 --> 01:24:25,153
<i>Now David Cone need one more strike.</i>

716
01:24:25,154 --> 01:24:28,953
<i>to complete the most amazing
comeback in playoff history.</i>

717
01:24:28,954 --> 01:24:32,353
<i>I'll never forget the '86 championship.</i>

718
01:24:32,354 --> 01:24:34,793
<i>But this one, has to be the best.</i>

719
01:24:34,794 --> 01:24:38,153
<i>Everyone, but everyone,
has counted the Mets out.</i>

720
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:41,353
<i>And now they're one strike
away from winning it all.</i>

721
01:24:41,354 --> 01:24:44,834
<i>This whole thing is really unbelievable.</i>

722
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:46,730
<i>Here we go, 1 and 2 to count.</i>

723
01:24:52,124 --> 01:24:55,089
<i>Strike three called!
The Mets win it...</i>

724
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:59,633
<i>Harris doesn't like it, but it's all over.
The Mets have won the championship.</i>

725
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:02,913
<i>And the Mets are the first team ever
to come back from a 3-0 deficit,</i>

726
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:06,051
<i>to win a playoff
or a world series.</i>

727
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:01,031
<i>You raped a holy thing.</i>

728
01:26:01,116 --> 01:26:04,013
<i>You destroyed that young girl.</i>

729
01:26:04,356 --> 01:26:06,213
<i>And she forgives you.</i>

730
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:10,533
<i>You hear that?
She forgives you.</i>

731
01:26:10,996 --> 01:26:13,533
You're fucking heroes.

732
01:26:15,605 --> 01:26:18,556
You liked holding her down and
shoving your dick into her?

733
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:20,236
While she couldn't do nothing about it?

734
01:26:20,237 --> 01:26:21,355
Did you like that?

735
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:23,116
Watch this, motherfucker.

736
01:26:23,117 --> 01:26:25,068
Watch this, you cocksucker!

737
01:26:25,076 --> 01:26:27,795
Look at that! You can't do
a thing about that, can you?

738
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:30,488
Can you? Look at me. Can you?

739
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:35,515
Move. Move, you cocksucker.

740
01:26:35,516 --> 01:26:38,213
Move, I'd like to blow your
fucking face apart.

741
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:44,253
You fucking scumbags.

742
01:26:47,477 --> 01:26:49,534
And she forgives you.

743
01:26:52,277 --> 01:26:54,694
How could she forgive that?

744
01:26:55,876 --> 01:27:00,214
How could she forgive
you slimy little bastards?

745
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,194
How could she forgive a thing like that.

746
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:27,656
<i>All aboard.</i>

747
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:57,456
You think you're not
getting on this bus...

748
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,816
you're dead wrong, man.

749
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,817
There's no fucking way
you're gonna miss this bus.

750
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,777
You get on this fucking bus!

751
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,886
'Cause your life ain't
worth shit in this town.

752
01:31:48,225 --> 01:31:49,900
<i>Hey! Cop!</i>
