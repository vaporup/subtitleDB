1
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,318
I have a secret

2
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,954
What is it?

3
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,596
I'm just so attractive!

4
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,007
Why can't Koreans acknowledge
other people's merits?

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,376
That's why there are no heroes here.

6
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,243
I've dated a lot, you know.

7
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,718
But it's all a waste of time.

8
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,749
Another man just fell
head-over-heels for me!

9
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,528
They say princesses are Ionely
and they're right.

10
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,368
I just blame it all on my charm.

11
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,574
I'm really not Ionely.

12
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,748
I'm not Ionely at all!

13
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
Please Teach Me English

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,753
My name is Young-Ju Na
and I'm 25 years old.

15
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,555
I'm an entry-level public official.

16
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,396
Didn't I tell you not to call me
at the office?

17
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,839
How many times do I have to...

18
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,503
Those born in '79 may get into a fight,

19
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,515
Stay away from gatherings. A fight?

20
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,210
Excuse me?

21
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,911
May I help you?

22
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,451
Hi. Um. They billed me over a hundred
thousand won for my electricity.

23
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,961
Um. How in the world is that possible?

24
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,226
I'm a single resident.
I don't have a rice cooker.

25
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,267
I don't have a television set.

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,668
Um. I think this must be a mistake.
Can you help me with that?

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:03:00,879
Hey! Miss! Hey! Look at me!

28
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,384
Say something for Christ's sake!

29
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,612
Doesn't anyone here speak English?

30
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,286
Miss! Where are you going?

31
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,520
You know if you've been there.

32
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,122
There's only one thing you can do.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,668
Just smile.

34
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,530
Why are you laughing at me?
Do I look funny to you?

35
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,579
Time over.

36
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,983
Time what?

37
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,679
Over.

38
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,750
We held the 88 Olympics 15 years ago,

39
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:54,794
and made the 2002 World Cup semi-finals.

40
00:03:55,702 --> 00:04:00,730
Now the 45,000 public officials of Seoul

41
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,141
lead the way on the road to the world!

42
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,213
- Not having anyone in our office who
- It can't be me.

43
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,445
Speaks English is embarrassing.

44
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,147
I have never, ever been picked for
anything at school.

45
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,716
Never won even the cheapest lottery ticket.
I'm just plain unlucky.

46
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,160
Lady Luck just despises me.

47
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,696
Let's hear it for Miss Young-Ju Na.

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,002
I'm sure she'll do us proud.

49
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,182
Can we get a new grill here!
Pass the bottle.

50
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:54,855
Making me study English because of just
one foreigner is ridiculous.

51
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,721
What is she saying?

52
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,695
You want more pork?

53
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:06,103
Oh, you want to sing? Sing a pop song!

54
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,639
Pop song! Pop song!

55
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,267
I don't want to
go to a language school.

56
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,253
Everyone's obsessed with English.

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,461
What's wrong with being born in Korea
and just knowing Korean?

58
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,953
What brought you here?
"[Spin the bottle]"

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,554
Did you see him? He's so cool.

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,928
I thought I was going to die.

61
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,733
At the institute.

62
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,269
I'm signing up.

63
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,707
A native speaker's class, of course.
I've been coming here long enough.

64
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,378
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.

65
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,240
Excuse me, lady.

66
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,106
Mister, I haven't got time for games.

67
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,105
Move it.

68
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,269
You are beautiful!

69
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,075
- Thank you
- Bye.

70
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,340
Look here.

71
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:37,050
We never met. And I don't have time.
I've made up my mind to study.

72
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,283
I'll be going.

73
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,225
But look.

74
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,690
My glasses are broken.

75
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,993
So they are.

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,296
You should be careful.

77
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,997
You need to take a level test.

78
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,506
Why?

79
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,185
Come on! Come on!

80
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,814
You can't speak a single word of English, can you?

81
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,124
My reading comprehension's okay.

82
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,824
Could you write it down?

83
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,445
Honey! What was your score on the
college entrance exam?

84
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,822
Oh, baby! Welcome to Korea!

85
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,392
Did you take the TOEFL or TOEIC test?

86
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,493
You great sexy girl!

87
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,862
Are you crazy?

88
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,264
No. I'm Park Moon-Su.

89
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh my God!

90
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,856
I only stopped by, you see.

91
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,193
Can't I come back next time?

92
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,596
Can you speak English?

93
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,075
Hey! You're so cute.

94
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,071
Fancy meeting you here.

95
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,882
Is this all you?

96
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,758
Wow, that's so cool.

97
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,095
Evaluation Impossible

98
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
Not my type.

99
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,967
I'm concentrating on studying.

100
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,606
Looks like I'll be doing a lot of
studying, and nothing else.

101
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,546
The women here make me want to cry.

102
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,939
Is this level A?

103
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:56,419
Sorry about your glasses.

104
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,483
What?

105
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,881
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,415
Hello, everyone.

107
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,683
Nice to meet you.

108
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,085
Catherine Presley. This is my name.
Please call me Cathy.

109
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,725
I think we're going to have a really
good time together over the next few months.

110
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,826
As long as you guys study hard.

111
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,967
You kids do your best and I'll do my best.

112
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,031
Kids?

113
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,975
Isn't my Korean good?

114
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,178
Why? You're shocked?

115
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,792
Please tell me why you
want to learn English.

116
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,627
And after that choose
an English nickname.

117
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,761
Because everyone does it. Right?

118
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,064
English is a necessity.

119
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,335
Actually, this is my nineteenth institute.

120
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,238
More like the twentieth.

121
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,436
I don't see anything special yet.

122
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,274
And my nickname is Betty.

123
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,576
What's with you? Not again.

124
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:35,052
My new boss is a foreigner
so meetings are in English.

125
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,852
Frankly, I don't understand much.

126
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,825
We old-timers know words and grammar,

127
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,460
but can't carry on a conversation.

128
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,561
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee! Can you come
and join us, please?

129
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,110
Would Richard be okay?

130
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,916
Richard. A king's name.

131
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,155
And next...

132
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,827
Would you pick one for me?

133
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,198
It's your nickname. Why should
I think of one for you?

134
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:34,207
Because... you are my beautiful teacher!

135
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:43,712
Okay. Um... Elvis!
Your sideburns remind me of the superstar.

136
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,188
Okay?

137
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,315
Elvis?

138
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,018
Good! Thank you very much!

139
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,460
You're very welcome.

140
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,095
And...

141
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,768
I'll just use my real name.

142
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,472
Everyone must have an English
nickname in this class.

143
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,570
Just pick any name!

144
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:15,018
My parents gave me my name.
I'll just be 'Young-Ju'.

145
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,821
No.

146
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,756
Why are you being difficult?

147
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,626
[You're not some kind of nationalist!]
[Nationalist.]

148
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,687
Choosing your English nickname
is a part of studying.

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,399
Think of an English name!

150
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:36,041
Now, you introduce your partner
to the class in English.

151
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,406
The person next to you
is your partner.

152
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,014
His nickname is Elvis.

153
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,613
And...

154
00:14:53,259 --> 00:15:01,860
he is salesman...
he is salesman...

155
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,629
and

156
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,566
handsome man.

157
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,644
And...

158
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,715
The end.

159
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,646
The end.

160
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,518
And next is the superstar.

161
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,786
What's your name again?

162
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,627
Na Young-Ju.

163
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,792
Na Young-Ju. Doesn't want a nickname.

164
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,479
- How do you say "plain" in English?
- Normal!

165
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,415
- Nor... ru-mal, Nor... ru-mal. Thank you.
- She is Normal.

166
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,355
Not nor... ru-mal... Normal.

167
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,825
She is normal.

168
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,423
She is normal!

169
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,799
She is normal.

170
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,170
She is normal.

171
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,436
Correct.

172
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,871
Very good!

173
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:32,482
A sweep! 3 cards!
[Was it two go? Three go!]

174
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,392
Yes! I'm selling!

175
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,832
Gambling brings out your true nature.

176
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,560
Always.

177
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,393
Really? Then what am I like?

178
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,598
You're nice.

179
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,605
What do you mean?

180
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,134
Nice is good for a woman.

181
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,542
Cut the cards!

182
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,346
Women who stand out have difficult lives.

183
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,276
There's nothing special about me?

184
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,350
This is the ninth game.
How many times did you sit out?

185
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,053
Seven times?

186
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,861
See! Your life is meant to be plain.

187
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:14,963
Plain?

188
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,198
Yeah, plain.

189
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,362
PLAIN!

190
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,105
How could you say that to your daughter?

191
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,441
Bah!

192
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,054
Cathy.

193
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,387
It's Cathy.

194
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,185
Cathy.

195
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,963
Cathy! One question.

196
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,733
What is your question, Elvis?

197
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,863
What is your handphone number?

198
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,410
Not handphone.

199
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,643
My mobile phone number is private.

200
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,913
Okay. My joke.

201
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,252
How do you describe a beautiful
and sexy lady?

202
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,188
Gorgeous.

203
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,657
Gorgeous?

204
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:18,662
Yeah. Everyone,
Repeat. Gorgeous.

205
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,322
Gorgeous.

206
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,032
Gorgeous equal Cathy.

207
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,000
Really!

208
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,346
Hello!

209
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,349
I picked a nickname, but you didn't ask.

210
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,145
It's Candy!

211
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,919
Candy!? That's it for today, everyone.
See you next time.

212
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,022
Bye.
Bye, Cathy.

213
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:03,005
I should have called myself "Normal".

214
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,775
Wait for me!

215
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,746
Size 5. Candy, you have
such cute, little feet.

216
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,039
Thank the gods! I have found
the owner of this shoe!

217
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,816
I'm an entry-level public official.

218
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,036
Aren't you getting in?

219
00:20:51,483 --> 00:21:00,790
This is the man I've
been waiting for!

220
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,827
What number are you taking?

221
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,528
Number 111.

222
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,681
Me, too...

223
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,515
I see...

224
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,594
[I don't like subway trains.]

225
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,070
They say the subway is a
lunch box for cannibals.

226
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,351
Yeah...
es, I'm an idiot.

227
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,087
Hey? It's here. It's here.

228
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,373
I'm sorry.

229
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,378
What a ditz!

230
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:42,183
Stamp my heart with a seal of love!

231
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,940
Sorry to all the studs in Korea.

232
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,744
I'm already taken.

233
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,956
Wow, 2 minutes and 35 seconds!

234
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,856
I tied Dad's record.

235
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,629
We have a saying.

236
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:26,493
You can read a person's life in their feet.

237
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,239
Obviously you are graceful and classy.

238
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:38,442
And will continue to forever...

239
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,781
You are just too much.

240
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,254
Did you know...

241
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:52,126
you have such small, exquisite
feet for someone of your stature.

242
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,057
Really.

243
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,561
Yes, yes. Wrap these up.

244
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,937
Bye-bye, cutie pie!

245
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,469
Please, come again.

246
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,656
Miss Lee. I'll ask something
in English and you answer!

247
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,248
I'm busy.

248
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,194
It's easy. Translate this.

249
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,059
I love you long!

250
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,165
You think I'm stupid?

251
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,463
I've loved you for a long time.

252
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,598
Me too, Miss Lee.

253
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,505
Right?

254
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:43,674
No. The answer is
"I will love you for a long time."

255
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,366
Welcome to our store.

256
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,674
Try on anything you like.

257
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,710
Do you have these in size 5?

258
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,978
These are size 5.

259
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,107
I think these would look good on you.

260
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,945
Aren't they... too plain?

261
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,616
Plain is good, you know.

262
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,092
Take a seat and try them on.

263
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,153
And throw these away.

264
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:38,296
You should just sell the plain ones,
or else not have those on display.

265
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,894
Here you go.

266
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,600
I have a lot of plain ones at home.

267
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,036
Hi, Yunjin. I've been so busy, baby.

268
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,843
So many overseas business trips.

269
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:57,253
I don't even have time to
go to the bathroom.

270
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,051
I'll call you back later.

271
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,788
What is it! Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,696
Wait.

273
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,591
You good-for-nothing bum!

274
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,163
You're eyeballing
a married woman now!

275
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,140
What married woman?

276
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,468
Ms. Lee in the ladies' bags section!

277
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,776
Her second child is already crawling!

278
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,445
Second?

279
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,612
The nerve of that woman,
pretending to be available.

280
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,780
What a witch.

281
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,120
You're a disgrace to me,
just like your lousy father!

282
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,421
What? Mom!

283
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,795
If you ever say I'm like him again,
I'll move out!

284
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,072
Pronunciation is very important

285
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,472
Listen, look,

286
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,271
Repeat.

287
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,211
Russia!

288
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,611
Russia!

289
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,377
Good! Next word.

290
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,180
Italy

291
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,879
Italy

292
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,943
Excellent!

293
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,513
Now, get your bodies into this one.

294
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,889
Brazil

295
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,451
Brazil

296
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,031
Candy, why aren't you doing it?

297
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,530
Try it by yourself!

298
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,637
Brazil

299
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,171
Zoo

300
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,944
Zoo

301
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Shape your lips like a doughnut.

302
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,648
Zoo

303
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,623
Zoo

304
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,625
Zoo

305
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,366
Zoo

306
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,906
Sorry!

307
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,884
Cathy, how long do we have to do this?

308
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,610
What did you say?

309
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:16,688
I'm leaving for the U.S. Any day.
When do we get to speak?

310
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,589
I can study pronunciation with a tape.
I don't need to pay for that.

311
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,996
Don't you agree?

312
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:22,931
Hey, Jolie!

313
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,801
I've been to almost 20 institutes.

314
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,101
But this is the slowest class.

315
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,269
Koreans are always rushing everything.

316
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,579
Do You want to learn how
to speak English well?

317
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,944
Then do as I say!

318
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,411
I came here to learn quickly.

319
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,955
I don't have money to burn, you know?

320
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,792
And she talks condescendingly in Korean.

321
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,787
It's because her Korean's not that good.

322
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,329
My Korean is fine.

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,597
That's it for tonight! See you next time!

324
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,433
Ashtray.
Ashtray.

325
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,171
Unification.
Unification.

326
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,406
Side dish.
Side dish.

327
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,607
This is a tough one.

328
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,681
Adoption.
Adoption?

329
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,416
He doesn't know.

330
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,418
Adoption.

331
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:25,395
Wow! That's amazing.
How do you memorize all that?

332
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,125
I just memorized some vocabulary.

333
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,999
What good is vocabulary when
you can't even open your mouth.

334
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,299
Don't you have to go home
and cook something?

335
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,801
Why don't you go cook!

336
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:43,671
English is all about words. This guy
in my hometown ate two dictionaries.

337
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,012
Now he's at Seoul National University.

338
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,012
That was in the old days.

339
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:55,026
I hear yelling in English is the
hottest thing nowadays.

340
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,824
They say you start talking fluently
after only 30 days!

341
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,025
Where do they teach that?
That's where I need to go.

342
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,965
That's no good. It's too embarrassing.

343
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:08,301
Elvis... I have a question.

344
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,571
What's your cell phone number?

345
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

346
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,551
It's the alcohol, that's what it is...

347
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,291
I think I'm drunk.

348
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,297
Your shoes are too small.

349
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,172
I'm a size 5! You want to see?

350
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,406
Ladies first. Sit down.

351
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,572
No, no.

352
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,678
Sit down, Elvis. Please.

353
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:56,209
Will you just sit down and
stop embarrassing me!

354
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,515
I'm okay.

355
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,683
Okay, okay. You're creasing it.

356
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:01,884
Sit.

357
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,621
Just sit down.

358
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,061
I'm okay.

359
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,999
All right. I'll sit.

360
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:11,966
Where are you going?

361
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,866
Hold on.

362
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,569
I had this custom made.

363
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,989
What?

364
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,396
What style do you like?

365
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,635
I like casual, but I usually wear suits.

366
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:49,639
No, no. What kind of woman?

367
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:50,571
Woman?

368
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,808
I don't care.

369
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:02,319
I might look at her character? Why?

370
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,487
By any chance...
Did someone ask you to ask me?

371
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,460
Tell them that for the next 3 months,
I'm only studying.

372
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,862
I won't have time for anything else,
so she should forget about me.

373
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,299
That's what I'd like to say,
but that would be bad manners.

374
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,701
Is she pretty?

375
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,074
In 3 months, I'll have a lot of time.

376
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,839
I wouldn't say pretty...

377
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,277
But she has a great character.

378
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,639
And she has little feet.

379
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,083
Is her English good?

380
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,455
A little.

381
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:50,523
When I find a woman to love,
I'll confess to her in English.

382
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:56,898
"I love you" in Korean is so corny.

383
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,808
"I love you, darling."

384
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,635
English feels different, doesn't it?

385
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:08,144
But if she doesn't understand English,
that would be embarrassing.

386
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,156
English, I will master you completely!

387
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,034
Come on, English!

388
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,770
Come on Elvis!

389
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,144
I AM NOT NORMAL

390
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,206
What has she been drinking...

391
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,375
I'll call the police
if you don't get down!

392
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,316
I love you!

393
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,552
Honey, call the police! Now!

394
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:49,321
Good night. E-L-V-I-SSSSSSS!!!!!!

395
00:33:55,466 --> 00:34:02,269
I am the king of English!
Catherine! Wait! Coming soon!

396
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,075
Every gorgeous woman.

397
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,044
I'm Park Moon-Su.

398
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:13,414
Korean-American lawyer searching for birth mother
years after being adopted to the U.S.

399
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,378
Mom.

400
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,116
Mom, come on over here!

401
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,817
Come on, come on!

402
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,654
You have to yell to speak English?

403
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,164
You don't want to say anything
when you meet her?

404
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,990
You want to be a fool?

405
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,566
Your posture is important.

406
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,505
Bend your legs!

407
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,266
Straighten your back!

408
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,506
Hold your stomach in!

409
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,546
Right?

410
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,385
I! LO VE! VICTORIA!

411
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,388
I...

412
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,188
Make your voice ring out through Seoul!

413
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,366
Don't be so timid!

414
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,763
Loudly this time.

415
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:09,737
- I!
- I!

416
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,733
LOVE!

417
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,775
- Victoria!
- Bacteria!

418
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,746
We're trying to sleep here!

419
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,440
What the hell!

420
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:25,983
Yesterday... I worked on my English.

421
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,820
On a mountain top.

422
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,659
Elvis, you try.

423
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,028
What did you do yesterday?

424
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,763
Very sorry.

425
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,737
So many absences! You can't
even answer simple questions.

426
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,809
If your English is bad,
you must study hard.

427
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,209
[Foundation-elementary level]
Foundation,,,

428
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,652
Heavy traffic.

429
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,494
Do you have a problem with me?

430
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,932
Apologize quickly.

431
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,165
That's it. From now on you will speak
only English during this class.

432
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,141
Only English!

433
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,771
It will be difficult at first,
but if you try, you will get better.

434
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,250
Speaking Korean is not allowed in this class.
Only English!

435
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,054
I'm sorry.

436
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,990
What a temper.

437
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,488
I know.

438
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,931
Is it over?

439
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,809
Why isn't it coming?

440
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,181
Is there a strike?

441
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:06,351
Elvis, you know...

442
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,122
Only English!

443
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:24,100
If you don't have anything
special to do this weekend

444
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:28,407
Would you like to go to a movie
on Saturday with me?

445
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,470
You understand?

446
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,817
She's asking what the
Saturday movie is.

447
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,080
What was it?

448
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,989
No.

449
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,427
Hello.

450
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,698
Oh, Cathy. I am Elvis.

451
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,332
This phone is Cathy phone! Tonight?

452
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:57,636
No problem! Coming soon. Yes!

453
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,877
Are you meeting Cathy?

454
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,913
You are... meeting her.

455
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,442
You're meeting Cathy.

456
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,841
Hey, taxi!!

457
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,654
Go then.

458
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,623
He really went to see her.

459
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,927
Driver, follow that cab!

460
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,605
Are you mental? This is a bus.

461
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,439
This is who I am!

462
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,276
A public official!

463
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,567
Where exactly do you work?

464
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,167
Step on it! You'll lose him!

465
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:05,568
Don't worry. No one has ever
shaken me off yet.

466
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,701
I'm getting off!

467
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,713
Driver!

468
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,197
Hey, Mike. You've been busy?

469
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,155
Excuse me? Excuse me

470
00:39:53,891 --> 00:40:03,823
Hi? Remember me? I'm the guy who had
the wrong electricity bill! Remember?

471
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,228
Hello?

472
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,833
Hi. Yeah. That got taken care of.
Did you do that?

473
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,471
You don't know what a problem
that was for me.

474
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,845
Do you want a drink?

475
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,819
Can you handle Whisky?

476
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,158
One glass, please.

477
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,354
Ladies and gentleman!

478
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,229
The talent guest you have
all been waiting for!

479
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,175
You can call me Tony.

480
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,744
How can I address you?

481
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,377
Thank you!

482
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,949
No, No, How-can-l-address-you?

483
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,782
My Address?
Address?

484
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,626
Guro-dong.

485
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,522
Guro-dong! That's a beautiful name.

486
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,796
Nice to meet you Guro-dong. Cheers!

487
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,339
Me? Again?

488
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,014
She's had enough. She's drinking
everything he gives her.

489
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,483
Are you OK?

490
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,550
Are you drunk?

491
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,018
Do you need to go home? Um...

492
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,195
If you want, I could drive you home.
I have a really nice car.

493
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,893
Thank you, Jessie!

494
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,232
Elvis, do you dance well?

495
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,595
Okay.

496
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,729
Is there anyone else?

497
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,971
Can you tap dance?

498
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:51,837
Sure!

499
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,374
Come on.

500
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,605
Wait.

501
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,609
Beautiful couple!
Cathy and Elvis will tap dance!

502
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,187
My technology!

503
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,326
What the hell is she doing?

504
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,664
Are you okay?

505
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:10,772
Elvis... Run, quickly... Run... RUN!

506
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,111
Candy.

507
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,674
Can you get up?

508
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:29,588
What?

509
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,130
What do you want?

510
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,438
This is medicine.

511
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,874
And this is soondae.

512
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:48,742
And deokbokki.

513
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,677
And I made Korean pancakes.

514
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,622
Have all of it.

515
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,420
What's all this?

516
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:01,953
Candy!

517
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,435
Am I a bad teacher?

518
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,544
Do you like Elvis that much?

519
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,471
It's carrot!
(Of course!)

520
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,481
I don't care for him.

521
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,048
He's kind of cute, but he's not my type.

522
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:38,164
Cathy, you are my good friend!

523
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,432
Help yourself.

524
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,012
I don't know who that could be.

525
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,518
Tyson, what are you doing here?

526
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,851
What's wrong with your head?

527
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,255
Oh, Don't worry about it.

528
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:08,798
You're far away from home.
I thought you might like this.

529
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,527
Thank you! I love pizza!

530
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,636
Candy's here, too. You want to come in?

531
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,136
I have more deliveries.

532
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,977
Oh That's a shame!

533
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,406
Then see you later.

534
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,507
You know... Cathy.

535
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,524
[Language reflects their personality.]

536
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,355
You should learn to speak polite form.

537
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,057
But it's so hard.

538
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:44,092
If it's hard, just say "yoo" at the end.

539
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,560
You?

540
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,430
You?? I don't understand.

541
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:52,641
Like, this. I love yooooo...

542
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,038
Bye.

543
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,185
I love yooo...

544
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,025
I love yooo...

545
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,404
You want more? You eat a lot!

546
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,398
No wonder your butt's so big.

547
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:30,575
Hi, Cathy.

548
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,744
Good evening everyone!

549
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,613
Good evening, Cathy!

550
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,913
Please, look at the board.

551
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,014
These are your partners from now on.

552
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,950
Good?

553
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,921
But Cathy!

554
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,556
Sit down!

555
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,768
Sit, sit sit.

556
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,896
Why are you following me?

557
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,031
We're partners.

558
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,871
That's not final. Sit down here.

559
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:09,878
At other institutes,
we changed partners every day.

560
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:14,720
This man no good...
no change... no money...

561
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,155
I want to change, too.

562
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,926
Okay...
You can use Korean.

563
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,836
Stop!

564
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:38,139
We need teamwork to improve your English.

565
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:43,346
Meet your partner often
outside of class and practice.

566
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,362
Hi, we are team.

567
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,590
Yes!

568
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,966
You don't want me as a partner?

569
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,208
No. It's a good thing.

570
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,385
We're in class... You shouldn't...

571
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,058
Let's think of only English!

572
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:26,829
Candy, don't ever wear sexy clothes.
Let's study really really hard!

573
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,824
I don't wear sexy clothes.

574
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,892
That's right... Sorry.

575
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:33,934
You're welcome.

576
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,503
Oh, no!

577
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,669
That's all right!

578
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,467
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Sorry. - That's all right.

579
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,177
This is annoying.

580
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:50,047
How come you speak so well!

581
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:57,293
You could be like me. Really.

582
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,106
Where are you from? Brazil?

583
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,711
No! I'm American.

584
00:50:54,451 --> 00:51:00,356
I know you. You are my sister Victoria!

585
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,520
Yes, You're my brother Moon-su?

586
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,690
Yes, I love you!

587
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,254
Oh- Victoria,

588
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,201
Do you love your mother?

589
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,133
You're making a fool of yourself!

590
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,753
Let's use only English at home!

591
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,484
Nonsense! Turn it on,
before I get really nasty!

592
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,732
Mencius' mother moved three times
for her son's education!

593
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:46,832
Maybe her kid was smart!

594
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,229
Or I'll run away from home.

595
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,501
Our daughter is studying so hard!

596
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,903
I've never been so moved.

597
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,241
Honey!

598
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,272
Go on out then.

599
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:06,912
Then I'll just have to stop
giving you my paycheck.

600
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,587
Wait!

601
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,728
Darling...

602
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,338
Okay, okay, okay. Puke?

603
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,738
No, no, no, no.

604
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,742
Okay, okay. Water. Water.

605
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,520
Es, water!

606
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:44,120
Yo, yo, yo. What's up, mommy.

607
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,324
Basketball, get out of here.
Give me the money, please.

608
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,224
- Water.
- What's up, Daddy!

609
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:51,959
Who are you?

610
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,099
Thank you.

611
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,031
Oops! Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,638
Where my stamp?

613
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,278
Oh, my goodness!

614
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,848
Good-bye, child!

615
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,884
Your English is terrible.

616
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,850
Try to speak in full sentences.

617
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,887
That way you can improve your English.

618
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,430
Are you okay?

619
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,667
Yes, no problem!

620
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,432
Oh, now it's time for me to study.

621
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,705
We have piles of notices to send out.
You can't go today!

622
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,307
Young-Ju, you're going to class?

623
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,177
Es, sir!

624
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:53,385
So we're neighbors but haven't seen
each other for a while, right?

625
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,921
That's right. Say something to your neighbor.

626
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,901
Hey. Hi.

627
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,371
- Hi.
- Yeah.

628
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,412
Why don't you say something?

629
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,345
I'm so happy to see her that
I don't know what to say.

630
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,590
Just say anything. Candy, you go first.

631
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,425
My mobile phone number is 011-3...

632
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,896
Candy.

633
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:35,103
Oh, sorry. My e-mail is w-o...

634
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,802
Candy. That's enough.

635
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,930
Tyson and Betty. Your turn.

636
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:47,777
What time is it now?
Did you have lunch?

637
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:57,484
Tyson! You have to speak out your
answers to improve your English.

638
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,328
All right?

639
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,664
Yes. Cathy.

640
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,092
Yeah, go on. You don't need me.

641
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,338
Were you embarrassed back there?

642
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,870
A little.
