1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,707
Sorry very much.

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,742
Candy. It's "Thank you very much."
Not "Sorry very much".

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:13,518
I mean, I'm not that good,
but you're really not improving.

4
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:16,454
You have to admit my pronunciation
got better, right?

5
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:23,028
I listen to CNN every night.
Now I understand almost 90%.

6
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,873
Do you understand any of it?

7
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:45,086
Understand, my ass.
I have to watch my soap opera.

8
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:46,979
She looks like she understands...

9
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,523
the way she's frowning and all.

10
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,225
Mom, I'm home!

11
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,932
Hurry up. Get in here.

12
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:01,900
Who is it? Give me that.

13
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,840
Hello?

14
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:09,505
It's Moon-Young, isn't it?
It sounds like her voice.

15
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:10,676
Be quiet!

16
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:14,240
- Can you speak English?
- Okay!

17
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:19,554
Good! It's only two weeks left.
And... I miss you. I miss you!

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,314
She say's she's "Miss Yoo".

19
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,827
- Anyway, it's nice to hear your voice...
- Can't you say something in English?

20
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,585
I AM speaking in English.
Okay? It's English, too!

21
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:29,996
Hello? Hello?

22
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,858
What do... how do?

23
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,202
What?

24
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,436
What is your Saturday movie?

25
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,103
Can you hold? I'll get someone else.

26
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,510
Hello? I'm Luna Kim.

27
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,576
Victoria wants me to say hello
to her mother.

28
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:52,754
Why couldn't I remember "How do you do?"

29
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:58,985
I'm not going to meet her.

30
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:03,190
How could I look her in the eye?

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,226
What is it now?

32
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:12,102
When your father ran off
with another woman...

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,106
I wasn't sure I could
raise you two by myself.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,075
But the more I think about it,

35
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:30,126
I should have raised you both,
if I had been a good mother.

36
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:31,853
Not again!

37
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:38,159
I'm sick and tired of
learning English, too.

38
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:45,135
Good. We both could have
made a huge mistake.

39
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:51,407
You shouldn't have had her
if you couldn't raise her.

40
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,147
You shouldn't have looked for her
if you were going to give her away.

41
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,644
What is this!

42
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:12,424
I would have thrown you away
if I'd known you'd be like your father!

43
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:34,948
Yeah, keep going.
Take all my money while you're at it.

44
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,006
It's for you.

45
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,345
Hello. This is Young-Ju's cell phone.

46
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:07,945
Candy?

47
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,359
Who on earth is making crank
calls at this hour?

48
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:15,129
What, Elvis?

49
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,363
If you're Elvis, I'm Nam Jin.

50
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:23,529
Listen. "In a green field..."

51
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,870
Hello.

52
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,286
Candy!

53
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:50,723
Are you cold?

54
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,970
No! Not at all.

55
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,203
I called too late, didn't I?

56
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,600
No, it's only one o'clock.

57
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:04,105
I can't believe you came out
just because I asked you to.

58
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,009
Of course!

59
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:11,644
I was dreaming about you.

60
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:16,322
And then you called. Strange, isn't it?

61
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,685
Why was I in your dream?

62
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,920
It's not like I have nowhere to go.

63
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:25,401
We were studying in class as usual.

64
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:27,731
Open.

65
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,523
We're taking over this building.

66
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:55,227
Drop all your weapons.
You're under arrest.

67
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,200
Drop all your weapons.
You're under arrest.

68
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,490
Shut up! We will now conduct a level test.

69
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,424
Failure to answer will result
in the gas chamber. Do you understand?

70
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,005
You!

71
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:41,500
Me?

72
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:43,640
What kind of woman do you like?

73
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,943
I like gorgeous woman!

74
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,183
Passed! Stand up!

75
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,284
- You!
- You talking to me?

76
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,953
Shut up! Just answer me in English!

77
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,357
What is your favorite movie?

78
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,257
What?

79
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:13,074
Listen carefully!
WHAT-IS-YOUR-FAVORITE-MO VIE?

80
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:17,034
M-O-V-I-E, MO VIE!

81
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,215
Oh~! Movie!

82
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,347
Quiet!

83
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,688
Zero-Zero-Seven!

84
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,759
Double-O Seven. You mean James Bond?

85
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:36,126
Yes!

86
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,264
Why?

87
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:53,214
Elvis! Help me! Elvis!

88
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,950
SOS!

89
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:00,955
I'll be back!

90
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,216
Why did you pick that movie
when you couldn't even explain?

91
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,458
Have you ever dreamt about me?

92
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,221
What?!!!

93
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:11,055
You have, haven't you?
You dreamt about me!

94
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,296
Just once.

95
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:16,596
I was so shocked because you were in it.

96
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:20,301
Why?

97
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:26,205
It was a beach in Miami, not Korea.

98
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,521
My Emmi Restaurant
[(Mom's Sushi Bar)]

99
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,295
No way. I don't wear bikinis.

100
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:54,205
Just listen. It's my dream!

101
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:59,571
You looked really gorgeous in my dream.

102
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,082
Unfortunately, you were sleeping.

103
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,921
Then you saw me naked!

104
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,691
You had a swimsuit on.
It was a bikini!

105
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,187
I couldn't help myself.

106
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,726
I have to touch this woman.
I have no choice. Just do it!

107
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,765
Never! Never!

108
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:20,497
That's it.

109
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:23,030
Elvis, never stop.

110
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,468
To be continued.

111
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:36,812
[To take off her clothing]

112
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:48,559
D. None of the above.

113
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,461
A.

114
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,428
Oh, my goodness! You stripped me naked!

115
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,165
I checked the dictionary after I woke up.

116
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,532
The answer was B.

117
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:02,234
Then nothing happened.

118
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,007
You wanted me to strip you?

119
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:10,781
Of course not.
How could you get that wrong?

120
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:19,624
It's fun talking to you
late into the night.

121
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,233
Really?

122
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,738
Why do you like talking to me?

123
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,578
When I look at you...

124
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,277
I don't think of women.

125
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:46,680
So it's really comfortable.
All I think of is studying English.

126
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:04,766
You're leaving?

127
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,158
This isn't your bedroom.

128
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,256
Why are you sleeping out here?
It's embarrassing.

129
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,667
Lower your voice. Everyone's sleeping.

130
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,992
Who's listening?

131
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:38,765
Is this loud? Then say so!

132
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,103
What will I do with you!

133
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,434
Would you stop hitting me?

134
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,107
Did you eat?

135
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,181
No, you were probably chasing some girl.

136
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:59,616
How come you turn silly
at the sight of every skirt?

137
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,726
At least your dad had taste. He had me.

138
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:08,135
I'm sick of that story.

139
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:15,400
There are plenty of good girls after me.

140
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,674
You'd want any of them
to be your daughter-in-law.

141
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:25,319
You see what you want to see.
I doubt there's anyone decent.

142
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,923
There's a public official, you know!

143
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:34,219
A public official? Who is she?

144
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,425
That's enough. Let's go in.

145
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,029
How old is she?

146
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,959
I'm teaching her English.
She's not that bad.

147
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,461
So how old is she!

148
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:48,971
Doesn't think of women.

149
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,215
Doesn't think of women.

150
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,253
See me as a woman.

151
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,460
See me as a woman.

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,490
See me as a woman.

153
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,734
What are you mumbling?

154
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,496
I see it in your eyes. You want me.

155
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:24,901
Your eyes look really big
without your glasses!

156
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,872
I get that a lot.

157
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:34,017
People say they could dive in
because they're like lakes.

158
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,245
Now that I look closely...

159
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,923
You look just like an alien!

160
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,820
Their faces are this small
and have almond-shaped eyes!

161
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,530
Doesn't everyone say that?

162
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,576
Everyone. Look at me! We're going
on a picnic this weekend.

163
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:01,104
My foreign friends are going, too.

164
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,877
We're going to Candy's
grandfather's house.

165
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,422
I hear it's in a beautiful village.

166
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,429
Then we have to stay overnight!

167
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,991
I can't stay out overnight.

168
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,465
Candy

169
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,024
Stop!

170
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,311
My grandfather has a famous pig.

171
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,578
It was on the news. Didn't you see it?

172
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:42,551
Did you see it?

173
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,856
The pig that understands English.

174
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,194
What kind of pig is that?

175
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:58,502
Well, you spread letters on the ground.

176
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:02,604
You say "A!" and it brings the A.
You say "B!" and it brings the B.

177
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:10,606
It even knows some words, too.

178
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,881
No way!

179
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,955
Really!

180
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,262
There are so many of you.

181
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,425
Nice to meet you.

182
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,634
Are these all your friends?

183
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:34,230
There're all shapes and sizes.

184
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:39,509
These are my classmates, and the
foreigners just came along.

185
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,207
This is Cathy, our English teacher.

186
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:46,378
Thank you for teaching our
little granddaughter, Ma'am.

187
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,785
It's nice to meet you!

188
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,791
Why, this woman...

189
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,455
Thank you, too!

190
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:58,357
Grandma, how have you been?

191
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:00,731
It's been ages.

192
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,900
Candy, where's the famous pig?

193
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:04,932
Yeah, that pig?

194
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:16,514
It was here, but we ate it
at the last village party.

195
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:23,620
Oh, my God! Why eat such
a great pig? Why?

196
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,951
You made it up, didn't you?

197
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:28,555
No, I didn't.

198
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:34,197
I thought there really was a pig
that knew English.

199
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:46,010
I need to ask a favor. It's real easy.

200
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,049
Just memorize a few letters.

201
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:55,515
I have to show Moon-Su I wasn't lying.

202
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,859
I suggest you cooperate quietly.

203
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:04,257
Why? No?

204
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:09,100
Do you know I like bacon?
[Pork rib.,, bacon.]

205
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:17,310
A looks like this. Easy, isn't it?

206
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:23,908
And these are B and C.
They're easy to tell apart.

207
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:29,012
Pick one of the three. C!

208
00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:33,426
Oh, you pig!

209
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,594
What are you doing here?

210
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:44,527
You have something in your eye?

211
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,937
No. They're originally like this.

212
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,610
You have to try a different
teaching method. Be gentle.

213
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:01,578
Give me that.

214
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,757
What a sexy sow you are.
Boars must drool over you!

215
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,393
Hey, you want to have some fun
with this handsome guy?

216
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Which one is 'A'?

217
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,203
A. A. Go on.

218
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,704
Don't shake it. She won't come.

219
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:26,645
That's it!

220
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,629
She's running away!

221
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,794
Young-Ju!

222
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,568
There she is! Stop right there!

223
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:57,569
There she is.

224
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,649
Elvis, grab her!

225
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,131
Where are your shoes?

226
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,408
I lost them while I was running.

227
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:33,909
That was clumsy of you.

228
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,981
Why do you squint like that?

229
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:43,687
I kept them open extra-wide before.

230
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,733
It's bleeding!

231
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,930
It's all right.

232
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,062
No. It's not all right.

233
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,498
Get on my back.

234
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:05,878
I'm fine. I'm too embarrassed.

235
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,045
Come on.

236
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:20,755
I'm heavy, aren't I?

237
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,194
Keep your eyes open
comfortably from now on.

238
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:38,640
Okay.

239
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,057
I was heavy, wasn't I?

240
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,261
Yeah.

241
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:18,775
Go Candy!

242
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,329
How did you find them?

243
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:09,163
I used to be a scout. A boy scout.

244
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:12,770
Thank you so much!

245
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,174
Shall I get you a pair of shoes?

246
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:16,734
Oh, no.

247
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:25,549
Do you have red ones?
I've always wanted red ones.

248
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:28,321
I'll get you ten pairs so you can
wear them for life!

249
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:29,414
Really?

250
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:35,788
You cold?

251
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,661
No cold.

252
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,406
Happy!

253
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,584
Good people in this scenic village

254
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:05,921
The fresh air and the peaceful silence

255
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:09,724
It opens up my heart.

256
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,291
Me, too.

257
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:22,406
I wish to live like the wind and clouds!

258
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:25,705
Me too.

259
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,337
That doesn't seem like you.

260
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,009
I was just kidding.

261
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:37,122
I know I don't seem like that.

262
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:44,059
Plain, boring, and not sexy.

263
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,621
Stop that!

264
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:54,097
Ou did at first, but I take back
what I said about you being normal.

265
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,972
You're different, you know.

266
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:03,872
Special?

267
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:09,950
I'm special to you?

268
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:15,958
You could say that.

269
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:30,342
Don't you want to say
something in English?

270
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,976
Not yet.

271
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,209
Then when?

272
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:40,183
After I learn more.

273
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:48,721
Let's go in.

274
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:49,787
Okay.

275
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:57,228
Goodnight, Young-Ju.

276
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,044
I found it in the yard.

277
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:16,954
When did that fall out?

278
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,986
I saw the picture. She's hot.

279
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,194
Yeah.

280
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:27,623
What does she do?

281
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:29,260
She's a lawyer in New York.

282
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,929
Her English is great.

283
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,466
Americans get frustrated talking to her
because her pronunciation is so good.

284
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:41,578
That's why you learn English.

285
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:42,971
Yes.

286
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,916
I want to see her.

287
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,521
Sun Tzu's The Art of War states that...

288
00:25:55,796 --> 00:26:00,130
knowing the enemy brings victory.

289
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:01,999
Let's go for lunch.

290
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,067
Age? A little younger than me.

291
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:08,708
I bet she had her face done.

292
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:16,475
But English... No contest!

293
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:22,683
I've lost the will to fight
now that I know my enemy.

294
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:29,893
Orange juice please.

295
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,090
No, we have only coffee.

296
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,228
Okay, milk coffee please.

297
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,498
No. We have no milk.

298
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,885
You're cutting class today, too?

299
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,719
You got dumped, didn't you?

300
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:58,150
So you're quitting altogether?

301
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:04,293
How are your classes going?

302
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:12,571
I'm not going back. No, I can't.

303
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,639
Why is it a disgrace not
to be able to speak English?

304
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:19,306
I was never uncomfortable
not knowing any English until now.

305
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,011
You use it maybe one week
in all the years you study it.

306
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:25,045
It's crazy!

307
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:35,057
I gave up on English but
I got a perfect score in Korean!

308
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:43,098
If you pressure me, I'll file
a complaint with City Hall!

309
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,002
I didn't say anything.

310
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:04,390
Is something wrong with them?

311
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,156
No, no.

312
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:09,257
Weird.

313
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:24,205
What are you doing here so late?

314
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,447
It's the last week of class...

315
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,543
You have to come tomorrow.

316
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:32,077
No.

317
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:33,781
Why?

318
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,153
I hate English.

319
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:39,021
It's Elvis. Isn't it?

320
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:42,989
What happened between you two anyway?

321
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:44,963
Stop talking about him.

322
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:51,736
I know you are good teacher, good friend,

323
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:56,003
but from now stay out of my life.

324
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,810
It's none of your business.

325
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,846
Candy... I am sorry.

326
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:08,050
What?

327
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:18,430
Young-Ju, you are not the
person I thought you were!

328
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:26,940
And you know... For someone
who says they hate English,

329
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,838
you speak it very well.

330
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:56,926
Today, I'm just going to ask you
some questions about your plans.

331
00:29:57,738 --> 00:30:00,605
Remember to answer in English. Jolie?

332
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,172
Oh, yes.

333
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:06,474
I have a plan...

334
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:08,576
Oh! Candy!

335
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:09,313
Hey!

336
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:10,543
Young-Ju is here.

337
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:14,783
I thought you'd given up.

338
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,322
Hey! Welcome, my partner!

339
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,563
Don't use English when
you can't speak it well.

340
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:32,861
And stop taking an interest in me.

341
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:37,769
So many men want me.

342
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,108
Maybe I should date a negative
speaker. (She means native speaker)

343
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:49,954
- Long time no see!
- I miss you...

344
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:52,292
Everybody, tomorrow is our last class,

345
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,385
so why don't we all go out together and celebrate.

346
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,590
I have one suggestion!

347
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:02,295
I quit the pizza place and now
I work in a Korean restaurant.

348
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,700
I'll buy all of you lunch.

349
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,205
Really!

350
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,507
You're coming tomorrow?

351
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,750
I don't think I can.
That meeting is tomorrow.

352
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,013
Please.

353
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:22,018
I'll try.

354
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,557
Your English is really good now.

355
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:32,630
I was bad.

356
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:36,132
No, it was for the best.

357
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,996
I'll be over him in no time.

358
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,500
Game is over.

359
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,368
Moon-Su!

360
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:07,525
Nice to meet you.
Call me brother Moon-Su.

361
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:11,503
Nice to meet you.
I'm your brother.

362
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,297
Try on the suit you'll be wearing.

363
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,509
I'm picking it up at the
dry cleaner's at noon.

364
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,145
Is this for Moon-Young?

365
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,712
No, it's for someone else.

366
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:29,616
You're at it again.

367
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:31,946
Another girl?

368
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,117
You worry about your problems.

369
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:38,060
Stop worrying about everything else.

370
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,759
Don't talk to me like that.

371
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,732
You're giving them to that
public official, aren't you?

372
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,434
You got it all wrong.

373
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,033
She couldn't be further from my mind.

374
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:59,948
That's the problem with you.
You don't see what you have.

375
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:04,920
If you buy a woman shoes,
she'll run off in them.

376
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:10,121
Where are you going? Moon-Su!

377
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,462
I'll be right back.

378
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:14,131
How is it?

379
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,225
It's really good.

380
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,366
This pork is simply delicious.

381
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,441
But where's Elvis?

382
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:25,339
I think he said he had an appointment.

383
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,046
How do you say "sambap" in English?

384
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:30,176
Do they have "sambap" in America?

385
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,675
Wouldn't they call it "sam-rice"?

386
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,914
It's "sambap" in English, too.

387
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:38,482
I was eating that when
I got picked to learn English.

388
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,640
Candy isn't a size 5!

389
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:06,611
Hong, is there a size 6 of red strip shoes?

390
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,313
Yeah, bring them over.
"Victory Soccer Team Ladies' Shoe Dept"

391
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:13,986
Why? I can't. I'm in a jogging suit.

392
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:18,296
Taxi!

393
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:26,068
His name is Park Moon-Su
and he's not bad looking.

394
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,098
He's in my class,
but he didn't come today.

395
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:30,806
He's not here either?

396
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:31,468
No.

397
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:32,842
Then where is he?

398
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,279
Candy, she's looking for Moon-Su.

399
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:37,612
She would know.

400
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:38,778
Hey.

401
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,777
Are you the public official?

402
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:45,281
You know me?

403
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,250
Could you find my good-for-nothing son?

404
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:51,858
I have to go to Amiga or Omega Hotel with him.

405
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:55,134
Wait till I get my hands on him!

406
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,003
Could you take me there?

407
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,089
The girl from the picture?

408
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,357
Getting engaged already?

409
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:26,562
Let's go!

410
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,236
She doesn't look as good as
in the picture.

411
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:42,743
Mother? I'm Victoria.
Please, have a seat.

412
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:48,347
Mother? You're not even married.
You cow!

413
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:54,149
Okay, I sit. Because Mother want.

414
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:57,995
Oh, you speak English. Good. Translate for me.

415
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,003
Please don't cry.

416
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,066
Past is past. I don't remember anything.

417
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,902
I just came here to say hello...

418
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:11,910
It's good to see you.

419
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,573
Tell her this first.

420
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:24,353
I didn't do it because I hated you.

421
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,756
I deserve to be punished.

422
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:30,522
My mind has never been at ease.

423
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:38,231
Wondering if you're eating well,
if people were good to you.

424
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:41,539
That's too long.

425
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:45,836
Tell her everything. Please!

426
00:36:47,347 --> 00:36:48,336
What did she say?

427
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,711
Hmm... Mother said...

428
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,379
What's "punished"? "furnished"?

429
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:58,754
Please tell her not to cry.

430
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:03,720
You be quiet. She cry because of you!

431
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:08,095
Isn't that too short?

432
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,134
English is like that.

433
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:23,615
Did you say she's pretty?
And thanks for growing up well?

434
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:26,545
That's...

435
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:33,788
She said you are beautiful.

436
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,693
But, the picture is better.

437
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,354
What?

438
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,892
You stay here.

439
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,979
I don't think I introduced
myself... Hi... I'm Victoria.

440
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,220
What's wrong? Is it me?

441
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:10,360
You think I shouldn't have come?

442
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,238
Yes!

443
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,808
Did you say yes?

444
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:25,001
Yes.

445
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,675
Mother hate you. Moon-su hate you.
And everybody hate you.

446
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:32,976
Why?

447
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:39,855
Why?? Because... Because...
You are not Korean!

448
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:49,767
Ok! Tell her I came with good intentions.

449
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,969
And that I hope she's happy.

450
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,475
You might as well go sightseeing
since you're here already...

451
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:33,276
Good day, sir.

452
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,896
I told them not to write this on the back.

453
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:02,938
Or at least have it in English.
Soccer team for ladies!

454
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,737
I can't do anything with this.

455
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:10,282
Hi. Victoria.

456
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,544
I'm Elvis.

457
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:13,279
Nice to meet you.

458
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:22,018
I love you. Victoria.

459
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:28,493
I love you, too.

460
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:38,675
I didn't mean to do that to that girl.

461
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:50,287
I just blurt out things
before I think about them.

462
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,319
I'm not a bad person.

463
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,389
I'm sorry, Moon-Su!

464
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,205
What are you talking about?
She said she was staying here.

465
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:14,344
We have no Bacteria or Bacterium
staying at our hotel.

466
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:18,077
We're meeting her at the coffee shop!

467
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:23,785
Where were you? I already met her.

468
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:25,755
But she's gone.

469
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:27,584
Why?

470
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:31,723
I went out to cry and
she just disappeared.

471
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:36,258
That public official girl was with me.

472
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:38,632
What girl?

473
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,696
That girl you talked about.

474
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:43,469
She's wearing your shoes.

475
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:47,469
We have to find Moon-Young first!

476
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,384
Could you check to see if...

477
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:55,387
Please believe me. We do not lie to our clients.

478
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,983
She was here just 5 minutes ago!

479
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,789
Are you calling me a liar?

480
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm sorry. Mom, stay over there.

481
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:06,758
Go where?

482
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:08,391
Would you just go!

483
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:09,957
Why, you lousy...

484
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,537
Her name is Victoria.
She's a lawyer from the U.S.

485
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:19,339
I was out playing golf, you see.
Please check again.

486
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:39,695
She checked out.

487
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:45,971
What is it? Get up.

488
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:48,374
This isn't our house!

489
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:52,776
You want me to get you a blanket?

490
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,685
You can't go! Don't go!

491
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:04,784
Don't go, don't go. Never! Never! Never!

492
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:06,750
Over my dead body!

493
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:09,491
Over my dead body!

494
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,754
Victoria, get out. You out car!

495
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,203
Victoria! Please forgive me.
I'm a liar! Mother said...

496
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:25,076
Mother... Mother like you... Moon-su want you.

497
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,636
What are you talking about?
Please calm down and let me go.

498
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,577
They are waiting for you.

499
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:37,112
We have to leave now.
There'll be a lot of traffic.

500
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:40,058
Please don't go, Victoria!

501
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:42,321
Please.

502
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,007
Don't just sit anywhere.

503
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:17,623
Victoria, I'm your brother.
Call me brother Moon-Su.

504
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:29,634
You know? Mother everyday
see your picture.

505
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:35,944
Really. She's always looking at it.

506
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:37,847
I've seen her with it all my life.

507
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:41,981
Mother...

508
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,521
My baby!

509
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:55,263
Brother!

510
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,507
A lady asked me to give you these shoes.

511
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:12,378
My shoes.

512
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,280
Where's that girl?

513
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,447
My one-sided love is over.

514
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:48,779
Nothing ever happens in my life.

515
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,323
That's normal.

516
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,922
Because I really AM normal.

517
00:47:20,112 --> 00:47:20,544
Young-Ju!

518
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:22,473
Young-Ju!

519
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:23,538
Candy?

520
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:43,492
Candy?

521
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:45,399
Young-Ju!

522
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:46,900
Young-Ju Na!

523
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,201
Candy?

524
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:54,944
Young-Ju! Candy!

525
00:47:56,182 --> 00:47:56,841
Candy?

526
00:47:57,717 --> 00:47:58,775
It's me, Elvis!

527
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,652
Candy! Young-Ju!

528
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:11,429
Candy, it's me, Moon-Su.

529
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:14,791
Candy!

530
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:20,366
Young-Ju! Candy!

531
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,632
Young-Ju!

532
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:40,388
Candy!

533
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:43,651
I have something to tell you.

534
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:48,828
Victoria isn't my girlfriend.
She's my sister!

535
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,664
So stop hiding from me!

536
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:56,367
Candy!

537
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,066
Who's Candy?

538
00:48:58,244 --> 00:49:03,204
I may be a player, but I wouldn't
date my own sister!

539
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,981
I have principles, you know!

540
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:10,582
You're weird to think that.

541
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:17,786
God, he's so loud.

542
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:24,626
So he's admitting he's a playboy?
Is he retarded or what?

543
00:49:24,704 --> 00:49:27,264
It's because she's his sister.

544
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:29,836
We're getting off here, right?

545
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,336
Yeah.

546
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:35,477
Hold on. Then who's younger,
Victoria or the playboy?

547
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:36,276
You are!

548
00:49:36,615 --> 00:49:37,206
Don't piss me off!

549
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:40,844
He said Victoria thought
her brother was a playboy.

550
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,751
You're sure?

551
00:49:43,422 --> 00:49:44,150
Okay.

552
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:50,086
Victoria is his sister?

553
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:51,455
That's right.

554
00:49:52,665 --> 00:49:53,529
Sure.

555
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:56,757
Young-Ju Na!

556
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,169
Here he is again.

557
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:01,935
Hey, then who's Candy?

558
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:03,098
You're Candy.

559
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:04,142
Come here, you jerk.

560
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:08,804
I'm Park Moon-Su and
I have to see you today!

561
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:12,140
Young-Ju!

562
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:13,949
Candy!

563
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,920
I just need it for a minute.

564
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:17,751
Young-Ju Na!

565
00:50:17,823 --> 00:50:20,121
Why are you always taking my paper?

566
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:22,893
- Victoria is my sister...
- What did I ever do to you?

567
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,726
What is she doing?

568
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,611
Young-Ju?

569
00:50:48,287 --> 00:50:49,276
Young-Ju.

570
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:33,528
I've never really dated anyone.

571
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,792
So, what I mean is...

572
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:45,235
You're so slow! You want to
go out with her, right?

573
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,737
Yes!

574
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:49,705
I do.

575
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,251
I love you!

576
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:00,389
I really love you.

577
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:09,795
No, you don't.

578
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:11,692
There is no way you could.

579
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:18,371
You said when you really loved
someone, you'd propose in English.

580
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:20,602
So it's not me.

581
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,676
Of course not. I'm so plain...

582
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:28,515
Someone like you wouldn't like me.

583
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:35,817
No, "love" sounds better in Korean.

584
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:52,972
Then does "kiss" sound better in English or Korean?

585
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:03,979
Well, there are a lot of people here...
So what I'm saying is...

586
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:42,559
What a cute little baby!

587
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,160
Is it a boy or girl?

588
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,655
Our little princess.

589
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:48,226
She looks just like you.

590
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:50,100
Yeah, you think?

591
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,100
Look at her! She looks just like me!

592
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:54,737
Absolutely!

593
00:53:55,341 --> 00:53:58,538
Enjoy your day. Bye, bye. Have a nice day!

594
00:54:05,184 --> 00:54:06,082
Mommy!

595
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,746
Our baby spoke for the first time.

596
00:54:10,823 --> 00:54:12,415
She'll learn to speak.

597
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,461
She'll learn English too someday
and it will be hard.

598
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:27,962
Then I'll tell him to speak up boldly
for someone will answer him.

599
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:34,978
She wet herself again!

600
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:38,416
Honey, get me a diaper.

601
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,885
I left them in the car.

602
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:44,650
Why did you do that?

603
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:52,085
You expect me to go?

604
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:55,264
No, I'll go.

605
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:21,549
I came to my hometown. I'm very happy.
Because I have a beautiful wife.

606
00:55:22,828 --> 00:55:26,423
But I have a problem.
She keeps speaking Korean, not English.

607
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:34,839
She sells seashells on the seashore.
Korean is so beautiful.

608
00:55:35,474 --> 00:55:36,372
Beautiful!

609
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:48,579
Now, I drive a cab.
I often go Incheon airport, because I can talk to foreigners.

610
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:57,086
Oh, I also have something to confess.
This is my wife...

611
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,025
We didn't mean to hide it.

612
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:03,330
I'm taking our Yoo-Jeong to Canada.

613
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,701
We'll be staying there for about two years.

614
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,909
I'll be a long distance father for a while.

615
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:15,436
If you cheat on me, I'll kill you.

616
00:56:17,216 --> 00:56:19,184
I'm going abroad to study.

617
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,015
America? No. I'm going to China.

618
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,056
I think I could master
Chinese in short time.

619
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:28,355
Call me if you come to Beijing.
See you!

620
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,090
Scene 49, cut 3, take 2

621
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:46,742
Their faces are this small
and have almond-shaped eyes!

622
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:48,939
Doesn't everyone say that?

623
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,852
You'd want any of them to be your daughter-in-law.

624
00:56:57,256 --> 00:56:58,655
There are plenty of...

625
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,867
I'm an... wait...

626
00:57:12,404 --> 00:57:15,532
Sorry. - That's all right.

627
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,868
How come you...

628
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:24,909
I have no choice. Just do it!

629
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,344
Those kind of thoughts came to me!

630
00:57:28,887 --> 00:57:29,785
Cut!

631
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:35,354
God! Scary!

632
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,592
How did you do that? How?

633
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,326
I don't know.
