1
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,760
Monkey King, you bastard

2
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,261
You've promised Buddha

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,680
To help the Longevity Monk
to get scriptures in the west

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,266
But the King Bull and you decided to
eat your master

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,227
Do you know you've made a real big
mistake?

6
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,646
Shut up!

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,815
You've followed me for 3 days

8
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,109
I didn't beat you up because you're
a woman

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,236
Don't think that I'm afraid of you

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,613
Monkey King

11
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,616
be polite to Goddess!

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,368
Shut up

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,456
You scare me again

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,957
If you're not scared of me

15
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,292
you needn't hurt Purple Fairy

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,628
and stole her Pandora's Box

17
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,796
You just wanna escape

18
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,590
Now, I can't escape

19
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,551
I will fight with you

20
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,596
What's up?

21
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,932
Don't be angry

22
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,142
You may violate the rule

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,186
Monkey King, you're so naughty!

24
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,395
I've told you

25
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,814
not to throw things!

26
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,815
Look!

27
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,151
You've thrown away the stick

28
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,569
Pandora's Box is the treasure

29
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,863
You'll pollute the environment

30
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,657
You'll hurt kids

31
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,908
If there are no kids

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,329
it is bad to hurt plants

33
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,039
What's up?

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
Let go!

35
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,750
You want?

36
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,086
Speak up if you want!

37
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,213
Why do you keep silent?

38
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,923
Although your eyes are full of sincerity

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,134
I'm very glad, you still have to speak up

40
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,219
Do you really like?

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,804
Take it

42
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:19,430
Do you really like?

43
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,431
You

44
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,976
Damn!

45
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:26,396
Monkey King...

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,022
See

47
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,691
this guy keeps talking all the time

48
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,317
we don't know what he's talking about

49
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,446
He's just like a fly hanging around

50
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,323
Sorry, not a fly

51
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:43,663
It's a swarm of flies flying near your ears

52
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,375
Flying into your brain

53
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,919
Help!

54
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,217
Help!

55
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:01,055
So I catch that fly. Open its belly

56
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,223
Take out its intestine

57
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,725
Put its intestine around its own neck

58
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,477
Then I pull the intestine tightly

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,313
The tongue comes out

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,398
I use a blade and cut!

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,859
Wow!

62
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,990
All the people keep silent

63
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:25,371
Now you know why I need to kill

64
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,418
Monkey King, you have so many excuses

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,629
You don't want to get scriptures
in the west

66
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,759
Shut up please! Beat!

67
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,023
I've got a super body. You can't hurt me

68
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:56,444
I don't scare of any god

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,291
I'm detroy all devils

70
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,418
Being master
I should take the responsibility

71
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,462
Please let him go!

72
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,673
I have to do so
I need to report to Heaven Emperor

73
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,592
Goddess, please tell Heaven Emperor

74
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:24,722
I can sacrifice my life for him

75
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,317
Namonitabhaya...

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,951
What did he said?

77
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,829
Give him the pork

78
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,955
Stand by!

79
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,290
A woman is coming in!

80
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,793
Asst. Master
do you think soldiers are coming?

81
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,086
This is why you're called Blind Bing

82
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,839
Didn't you see Dumby shaking his ass?

83
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,592
Do you think he has hemorrhoids?

84
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,135
OK, even if he has hemorrhoids

85
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,471
he is a soldier with hemorrhoids

86
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:15,601
So what to be feared about him?

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,459
Who the hell you are?

88
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:45,381
Don't you reckon I'm a woman?

89
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,510
What do you come here for?

90
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,845
The world's gone mad

91
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:52,846
A weary lady

92
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,307
looking for a shelter

93
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,685
I wanna brush off the dust of my past

94
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,355
Do you know what place it is?

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,901
This is not a nice place
You all look gruesome

96
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,279
I don't think it is a decent tavern

97
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,990
Is this a slaughter-house?

98
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,410
Yes, we are. How dare you come in

99
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:18,247
You're in danger already

100
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,416
I'm not sure who's in danger

101
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,585
I think you're in danger

102
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:25,045
You can be robbers

103
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,881
So can I

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,887
Who the hell you are?

105
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,023
Blossom

106
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:47,192
Nothing get into my way and survive

107
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:51,155
Money or your heads

108
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:02,166
Why does Ma'am 30th come to
Mt Wuyue?

109
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,545
This devil is a fierce robber

110
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,383
Is here having big business?

111
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,512
Why do you still

112
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,097
put the money on your head?

113
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,307
Put it back!

114
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,768
She said it is our head or the money
Master

115
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,144
What are you talking about?

116
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,481
Asst. Master!

117
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,816
You coward!
How can you be my assistant?

118
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,486
Master, I'm not Asst. Master!
I'm Blind Bing!

119
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,278
He is Asst. Master

120
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,155
I will make you regret!

121
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,282
I will make you regret!

122
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,451
Go away!

123
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,037
Look at yourself
Mousing around, so shameful

124
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,413
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

125
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,791
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

126
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,335
Master, I'm here!

127
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:47,503
Come out!

128
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,171
Coming

129
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,131
Master, you're hit by Kunlun Sage's
7 Ultimate Fists

130
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,841
Your wounds are spreading

131
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,051
Shut up

132
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,469
you knelt down that time

133
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,137
and I got hit in the nose

134
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,764
Master, here!

135
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,266
The 7 Ultimate Fists really hurt Master

136
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,894
Master, I was scared, so I knelt down

137
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,270
It is heard that people who got hit by the
7 Ultimate Fists

138
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,480
will have disease in his eyes

139
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,482
Then he'll become dumb

140
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,859
After that he can't speak properly

141
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,612
At last, his body explodes and he's dead

142
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,988
Master, there's something wrong with
your eyes!

143
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,031
I am OK!

144
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,533
I only concentrate my eyesight on a
single point

145
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,785
I only change my usual way of vision

146
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,620
Do you want to take my position?

147
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,247
No, Master, I don't dare

148
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,290
You don't dare? I am gonna kill you!

149
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:26,500
Kill you!

150
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,837
Can you cry out for me?

151
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:31,463
Ah...

152
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,258
Ok, let's get our weapons and search

153
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,552
Ma'am 30th

154
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:41,306
No need to scare! I'm here!

155
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,561
I'm the leader of the Axe Gang

156
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:48,564
My nickname is Joker

157
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,275
It is nice to meet famous Ma'am 30th

158
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,860
What are you gonna

159
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,696
do here?

160
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,365
I just wanna stay here for a while

161
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,742
A while? How long is it?

162
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,871
3 full days

163
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,498
Maybe 30 or 50 years

164
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,584
I'll leave when I meet the person

165
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,169
who I want to see

166
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:16,592
I don't think you can wait so long

167
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,218
What are you doing?

168
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,429
I've just had a piss!

169
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,722
You had a piss here?

170
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,640
This is why you have so much water
to bath

171
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,891
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:29,938
I said live to see that person

173
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,988
Master...

174
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,975
I'm not that easy to kill

175
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:11,104
Ask my brothers first

176
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,108
You have no guts...

177
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,570
You betray me!

178
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,073
God!

179
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,286
Kill us all if you can!

180
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,038
Forgive me...

181
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,122
Forgive me, heroine...

182
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,500
Stupid! Do you think she will let you go?

183
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,293
I'm gonna fight

184
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,628
even if I lost my life!

185
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,298
That's fine. Since you're willing to beg me

186
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,884
I won't kill you now

187
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,928
Thanks a lot!

188
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:47,682
You... you're so righteous!

189
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:59,361
You're so good!

190
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:06,243
You all clean your sole and wait for me
outside

191
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,247
Why is there a scar?

192
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:11,998
This is not a scar, it is only dirt

193
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,958
Go clean it

194
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,334
or I'll cut the whole leg off

195
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,544
Master

196
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,087
why she wanna see our sole?

197
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,589
It is lucky that you don't wanna see
our ass

198
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,507
Are you scared?

199
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,092
I'm not! You are scared!

200
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,009
Why?

201
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,261
You have hemorrhoids

202
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,220
She'll say they are not clean enough

203
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,221
and cut them off

204
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,347
Why do you know I have hemorrhoids?

205
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,641
Blind Bing peeped on your shower

206
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,393
Why did you peep on me?

207
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:32,602
I not only peeped on you

208
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:36,857
I've peeped on you all

209
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,317
Why is there so much hair?

210
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,193
Sure

211
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,028
I've got more in other parts

212
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,946
What?

213
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,197
Are you excited now?

214
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,577
Where did you say has more hair?

215
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:49,703
No

216
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,580
in fact I only have hair on my head and
sole

217
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,666
Do you think
they grow on the wrong places?

218
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,127
From now on, I'll check all the people

219
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,212
passing here!

220
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,047
Check what?

221
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,591
Check their sole

222
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:10,015
If you discover a guy having
three birthmarks, tell me

223
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,477
Master! We don't go to rob

224
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,729
but check people's sole

225
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,982
If the others know that
they'll say we're perverts

226
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,359
We can plot against her

227
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,153
Poison her, make her faint

228
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,404
then rape and kill her!

229
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,572
A good plot!

230
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,990
You think so

231
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
You shall administer the plan

232
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,952
I don't think I can do this

233
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,455
I go, no need to kneel down

234
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:36,499
I don't want to! I can't control my legs

235
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,460
Master, your wound is expanding

236
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,712
I still have both hands

237
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,341
I won't give up!

238
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:49,387
Master has fallen into a shit pit!

239
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,140
Master!

240
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,767
Have you found the three birthmarks?

241
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,353
Why does everyone tell me to find
the three birthmarks?

242
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,855
You can save him when you find them

243
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:41,940
What are you talking about?

244
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,316
Where are we?

245
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,777
Who?

246
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,281
Dreaming

247
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,078
Did you kill that bitch?

248
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,252
Spider! Spider...

249
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,003
It's only a spider

250
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:04,838
It's big

251
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,299
How big is it?

252
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:10,969
I've told you to tidy up the place

253
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,346
The spiders are bigger than me

254
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:17,100
What should I do?

255
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,352
It keeps running after me

256
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:23,189
Maybe I'm handsome

257
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,364
What?

258
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:19,537
What's up?

259
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,914
A spider is running after Master?

260
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,040
This way? No...

261
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,583
This way!

262
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,128
Fine, be quick!

263
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,673
How come?

264
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,097
Help!

265
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:42,143
Come here! I'm here!

266
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,228
Be quick!

267
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,648
I'm here!

268
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,484
Help me!

269
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,611
Blind Bing!

270
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,446
Nothing in the front!
Turn back, turn back!

271
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,989
No! it's Master! Master...

272
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,407
Isn't it a cockroach?

273
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:57,533
It's Master

274
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,119
Great! Go!

275
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,580
You sons of bitches, deceive me

276
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:06,417
Master, I'm coming

277
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,132
What am I touching?

278
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:16,969
Master is saved...

279
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,431
Asst. Master is so happy
What is he holding?

280
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:25,687
Master, didn't he carry you out?

281
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,314
I'm fine, let's go home...

282
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,524
Take a bath, go to bed sooner

283
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:32,568
Don't hang around tonight

284
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,778
Let go!

285
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,531
Spider!

286
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:37,907
Blindy

287
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,076
Help

288
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,994
Who?

289
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,831
Burn it!

290
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,294
Have a rest first

291
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,131
Burn it!

292
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,632
Don't let him go... burn it

293
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,008
Burn it!

294
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,343
No need to be frightened

295
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:59,429
Burn him...

296
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,222
He's there...

297
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:06,060
It's over there, go there...

298
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,359
Here is another

299
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:17,321
This one is smaller

300
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:28,124
Freeze!

301
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,388
Where?

302
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,598
It's there!

303
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,225
There!

304
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:10,374
Only two claws are left
Let me break you in half

305
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,212
Go to hell

306
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,803
Don't go!

307
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,765
It's here

308
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:29,101
Beat it!

309
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,987
Give it to me

310
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:45,243
All spread out! Let me burn it!

311
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:48,371
Go to hell!

312
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:51,165
Burning!

313
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:54,126
Very hot!

314
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,920
It's Master's voice

315
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,672
Help!

316
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:59,256
It's Master. Help him!

317
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:00,299
It's Master

318
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,843
Help!

319
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,221
Master, your cock is burning

320
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,847
Be quick

321
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,015
Get the water...

322
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:08,975
Put out the fire

323
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:10,059
Put out the fire

324
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,143
Dying!

325
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,561
Be quick

326
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,939
I'm going to out the fire, too

327
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,692
You can't put out the fire with straw
Stay away!

328
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,695
Master, it's OK!

329
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:22,530
I'll put it out!

330
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,824
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop burning...

331
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,076
Out you go...!

332
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:30,162
Stop burning!

333
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:34,208
I can't take this...

334
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:51,350
The fire is out! Are you OK?

335
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:54,687
You have to step on him and
put the fire out

336
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:57,314
Moron!

337
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,942
Who burned me?

338
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,068
Not me!

339
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,070
I have no idea

340
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:05,364
I know it's you!

341
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,783
I know what you're thinking!

342
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:08,868
You wanna take my place!

343
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:09,952
No... Master...

344
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,370
Master's eyes are Ok

345
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,663
No, I didn't do that

346
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:15,624
Master, you've recovered

347
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,877
I'm cured! Why?

348
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:18,919
I know!

349
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,796
You must hurt yourself in order to

350
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,047
cure the wounds

351
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,799
It's reasonable!

352
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,885
You have to thank Asst. Master

353
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:27,553
If he didn't hit you at the crotch

354
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,096
you won't be healed so fast

355
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,265
Do you have an affair with him?

356
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,933
I love you so much

357
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:36,562
Go to hell! Stop it!

358
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:38,564
I've told you to kill Ma'am 30th

359
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:39,565
Have you done that?

360
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:40,900
Ma'am 30th is a devil!

361
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:42,776
Spider Woman!

362
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm a rational man

363
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,281
I can't accept such ridiculous thing!

364
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:48,240
Kill her!

365
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:50,075
Master, aren't you scared?

366
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:51,827
Of course not! I'm healed

367
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:52,703
I will defeat her!

368
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:54,371
Great! You have guts!

369
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:56,123
You said I had guts?

370
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,583
Yes, but forget I'd say that

371
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,751
Master

372
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,170
You just get into her room and
finish her off

373
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,630
We'll cover you up!

374
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:07,384
Why I go first everytime...

375
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:18,103
You said you would cover me up
so stay closer

376
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,230
Steady

377
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,190
we've got weapons

378
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,943
We'll throw them at her

379
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,903
You'll kill me, too

380
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:27,071
Don't be silly!

381
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:32,701
You won't die, you'll only get hurt!

382
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:36,830
Sons of bitches!

383
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,708
Get! You are not fooling me

384
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,335
Listen to me

385
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:44,296
Stop that

386
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,464
Fainted?

387
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:48,384
Big Cow, Younger Tiger

388
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:53,806
You're all useless. Let me do this

389
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,190
What?

390
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,985
You faked the fainted?

391
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,153
This is a tactic

392
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:11,907
It is very useful

393
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:17,413
Where is the leak?

394
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,999
Asst. Master, you're bleeding

395
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,543
Don't scare!

396
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,753
I can stop the bleeding

397
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,715
by myself

398
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,232
it's not picturesque

399
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:46,817
but it is unique

400
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:49,153
You may love this place, eventually

401
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:52,281
Good night!

402
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:56,869
Master...

403
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,870
She is a devil!

404
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,246
Yes!

405
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:00,998
She is a real devil!

406
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,960
My heart is pounding!

407
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,589
Master, stop it!

408
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:14,386
You're a righteous man, a hero

409
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:16,054
It is my pleasure

410
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:17,598
to be your friend

411
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,475
The money put on your bros' heads

412
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:22,519
is all given to you to buy drinks

413
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:26,023
Thank you very much, Ma'am 30th

414
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,442
Master, she's not really good-looking

415
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,987
But I like her!

416
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:38,076
Only thrust the thigh once
but there're so many holes

417
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:41,830
What do you mean?

418
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,049
Sister, why did you leave?

419
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,634
You ran to this poor village

420
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:54,635
and you're forced to reveal

421
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:57,137
your real image

422
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,180
What are you doing here?

423
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,723
How about you?

424
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:02,559
I just want to have a walk

425
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,603
You're waiting for the Longevity Monk

426
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,772
you wanna eat his flesh

427
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:07,648
You can make Granpa Buddha

428
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,525
speak out this top secret

429
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:10,901
So do I

430
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,069
Nonsense!

431
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,072
Nonsense?
Why did you come to Mt Wuyue?

432
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:16,615
This was called Fingers Mountain
in the past

433
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:19,076
It's the prison for this monkey

434
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:20,911
The top secret says that
he'll become human

435
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:23,914
and he has three birthmarks on his sole

436
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:26,333
you can find the Monk
if you know where Monkey King is

437
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,545
Sister, do you still think
I'm speaking nonsense?

438
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,464
You just want to see that monkey

439
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:35,467
You can do nothing even if you see him

440
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:38,595
The difference is that
he died in Goddess's hands last time

441
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,515
but he died in my hands this time

442
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,100
It will benefit

443
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,768
only one person

444
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,521
You know the reason!

445
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:52,150
Do you wanna fight over him with me?

446
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:57,030
Do you think only you can fake face?

447
00:26:57,072 --> 00:26:59,491
Who?

448
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,711
Devil...!

449
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,388
What did you see?

450
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,222
Nothing

451
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:23,181
No!

452
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:24,599
What are you doing down there?

453
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:28,645
I wanna tie the lace

454
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:37,487
If the secret of the monk leaked

455
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,782
I'll kill you

456
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:42,200
Then, all devils gather at Fingers Mountain

457
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:44,578
beg for the flesh of the Longevity Monk

458
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,414
Tell the King about this

459
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:51,460
he will bestow on us

460
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,382
Even a bull is talking
So many devils here this time

461
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:59,843
Go... go away

462
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,887
If I go now, I'm a coward!

463
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,723
No, report to Master

464
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,308
Master

465
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:08,060
This mountain was called

466
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,227
Fingers Mountain in the past

467
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,521
The Longevity Monk and the
Monkey King will meet here

468
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:13,940
My bull is talking

469
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:14,816
Those two things

470
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:19,446
one has 8 legs, one's head...

471
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:20,781
You two haven't slept?

472
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:25,535
What are you talking about?

473
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:26,703
ah...

474
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,997
Two baby pigs are born

475
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,084
One has 8 legs

476
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,252
One has a very heavy head

477
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:35,921
Master, we're rich now

478
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,631
We needn't to be robbers anymore...

479
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,715
We didn't rear any pigs

480
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:40,092
We didn't rear any pigs?

481
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,385
Or I'm speaking in my dream!

482
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:45,013
Ok, I'm leaving, please take a rest

483
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:45,931
We're leaving

484
00:28:45,972 --> 00:28:47,265
Walk both girls away

485
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,600
No!

486
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:50,977
I will order someone to search for

487
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,313
the guy you wanna see

488
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,774
Thank you master

489
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:58,860
Good night! Go!

490
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,613
Go! Go!

491
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,450
Nothing can be done this time

492
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:07,536
Why does Jing Jing have no reaction

493
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:10,038
to this image?

494
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,667
Nothing I can do

495
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:18,088
Go!

496
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,890
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

497
00:29:30,892 --> 00:29:32,727
I just wanna have fun with you

498
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:34,437
Do you like playing?

499
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:38,191
Come and have fun

500
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,485
Is it funny?

501
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:41,486
Yes!

502
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:45,532
Ok, let's play again

503
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,330
Play again?

504
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,499
I don't wanna play...

505
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,001
You said who's got eight claws?

506
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,003
I can't remember it...

507
00:29:58,044 --> 00:30:00,547
What?

508
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,133
No!

509
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:05,760
My head looks like this?

510
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,804
Yes...! Oh no!

511
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:11,933
She's not changed yet

512
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,563
Not yet?

513
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:19,524
I'll kill him

514
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,401
No

515
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:23,528
Why?

516
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,114
I'm gonna mesmerize him

517
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:30,952
he'll be my undercover agent

518
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:32,537
Hi!

519
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,040
Ghost!

520
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,000
Go to have a look

521
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,377
You said a ghost!

522
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,213
Oh dear!

523
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:45,342
Don't be pretentious around here

524
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:48,053
Or I will cut you into pieces

525
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:49,387
You're so brutal!

526
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:51,056
Look at me!

527
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:54,309
Mesmerizing!

528
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:02,817
Who?

529
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,195
It's a long night, no mood to sleep

530
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,447
I thought I am the only one

531
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:13,203
But Jing Jing, you're sleepless, too?

532
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,457
Yes, why can't you sleep?

533
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:20,210
Just because of Jing Jing!

534
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,920
Me?

535
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:24,589
yes, when I saw you

536
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:27,425
I made up my mind that
I wouldn't be a robber

537
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:30,261
I just wanna show my sincerity

538
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:32,931
I can't face my past

539
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:35,517
Like what you see?

540
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:37,435
You're monkey?

541
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:38,728
Monkey?

542
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,813
Monkey King

543
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:40,939
Monkey King?

544
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,981
You think you're alright with a
human face?

545
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:43,233
Human Face?

546
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:46,277
I have to use Skeleton Fire on you

547
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,322
You gonna burn me again!

548
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,366
Why?

549
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:52,784
Did I make a mistake?

550
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:55,245
Why?

551
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:59,290
Why did you use flame bomb to burn me?

552
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:00,625
Why did you shave off your beard?

553
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,252
You're just another guy

554
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:03,002
without the beard

555
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:04,379
Really?

556
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,005
You can't do anything

557
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:08,508
Do you want to be a scholar instead of
a robber?

558
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,884
I've thought about this

559
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:11,678
Please stop changing image

560
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,930
being a robber is

561
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:15,473
a good job

562
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:16,516
I know

563
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:18,643
I'll try my best!

564
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,980
You look like that thing!

565
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:24,107
So pathetic

566
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:29,237
Jing Jing loves my violent side

567
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,036
Having the personality again

568
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:55,471
Monkey King, come out!

569
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:56,890
Damn monkey

570
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:59,142
You said you would marry me
when I was 18

571
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,393
I have waited for you 3 years

572
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:02,020
You come out!

573
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,063
Our King is not here

574
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:07,025
He said give it Miss Pak
when you come here

575
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,110
and thanked Miss Pak very much

576
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:12,864
He can't enjoy it

577
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:22,707
500 years...

578
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:28,546
We've found the Longevity Monk at last

579
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:34,385
The hair on the sole has shaved off

580
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:40,016
I don't know when it will grow again

581
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:49,525
Shit! They come first!

582
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:52,236
I have to inform

583
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:56,366
these innocent people

584
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,846
You come back to Waterfall Cave again?

585
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:20,181
Waterfall Cave?

586
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:21,265
Who are you?

587
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:23,101
Why do you bring me here?

588
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:27,480
No one brings you here
You come here on your own

589
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:31,776
it is normal to miss your home

590
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,027
Don't tease me!

591
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:36,114
My home is at Mt Wuyue

592
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:37,657
You have made a mistake
can you hear me?

593
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:41,994
Don't annoy me, please!

594
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:46,040
We have to go, Master, or we'll be late

595
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:46,833
Go? What do you wanna do?

596
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:48,251
Robbery!

597
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:49,210
Who dare to do so?

598
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,503
We go to rob!

599
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:54,132
Ok, that's fine!

600
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,262
Go to rob...

601
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,183
What?

602
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,309
Rob the sole

603
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:10,064
I have no legs. What to do?

604
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,318
What are you looking at?

605
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,821
Are you jealous of my handsomely
shaved face?

606
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,197
That's fine

607
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,490
Yes...

608
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:20,825
Jealous! You guys...

609
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,661
Shut up!

610
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,497
Grapes?

611
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,713
Master, the grapes are washed

612
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:34,547
Go out

613
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:35,089
The dinner is ready

614
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:37,842
Go out!

615
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,179
Who?

616
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:46,893
I'm the grapes that you bring here!

617
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,103
You're grapes?

618
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:51,856
No, I'm Grandma Ada?

619
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:53,900
What Grandma Ada?

620
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,151
Stop the non-sense

621
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,944
I'm Grandpa Buddha, an immortal

622
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:59,488
I turned myself into grapes and save you

623
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,992
You stole my grapes and forbid me
mentioning Grandma

624
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,369
Both women are devils

625
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:06,704
If you don't believe me

626
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:09,165
you can use my Magic Mirror!

627
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:10,750
I use your Mom's mirror!

628
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:11,709
Say! Listen to me

629
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:12,752
Have you stolen my grapes?

630
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:13,836
No!

631
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,463
Where are my grapes!

632
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:16,297
I'm your grapes!

633
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,673
Louder!

634
00:36:17,715 --> 00:36:19,258
I'm your grapes

635
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,470
Why aren't you an apple?

636
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,055
Listen to me

637
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,556
You shouldn't think I can't defeat you

638
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:27,350
I don't wanna hurt innocent people

639
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:28,559
Go out!

640
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:32,521
You will be seriously hurt!

641
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,898
Jing Jing!

642
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:34,940
Your beard looks great!

643
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,525
Really?

644
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,277
Why was it so noisy?

645
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,323
Just beating the grapes

646
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:45,576
Who're gonna beat grapes?

647
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:47,870
Meal time

648
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:49,372
Meal time

649
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:50,289
That's great!

650
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,248
Great?

651
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,044
What a pretty moon. Let'...

652
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:57,338
Moon? I can't see it

653
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,299
There is a big moon. Can you see it?

654
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,635
It's not dark yet
how come is there a moon?

655
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:05,680
Tell me...

656
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:10,518
Who? Who the hell...!

657
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,894
Who the hell?

658
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:12,853
I was turned into grapes

659
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:13,771
Where are you?

660
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:15,940
In your trousers

661
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,441
Big grapes!

662
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:20,194
It's yours. I'm at your back!

663
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:21,779
That's great to see you

664
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:22,613
You trust me now!

665
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,657
Yes, I trust you

666
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:26,784
Why do we have devil here?

667
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:30,329
Stupid fool, listen to me

668
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:34,542
These devils are waiting for the
Longevity Monk

669
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:38,087
Longevity Monk?

670
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:42,258
500 years ago
Monkey King was destroyed by Goddess

671
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:44,301
His master Longevity Monk wanted to
save him

672
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:45,386
He exchanged the monkey's life

673
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:48,013
with his own

674
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,141
He hoped this monkey would be good

675
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:51,976
Why does the Longevity Monk

676
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:54,061
need to appear?

677
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:57,523
he wanted to save the whole world

678
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,151
so he went to India and tried to get
scriptures

679
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,778
he hoped they would do good to
the people

680
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,115
All devils were impressed by his spirit

681
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:07,867
heaven Emperor saw that

682
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,077
He gave the monkey a chance to revive

683
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,246
He planned the master and the disciple
to meet here

684
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,374
Then they can finish the journey
to the west

685
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,293
Now, you know why there are so many
devils here

686
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,337
You got it

687
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:22,840
So I am having the same

688
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,341
dream

689
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:27,845
In a pitch-dark area

690
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:30,681
a pair of seductive eyes

691
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:32,516
looking at me

692
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:34,852
make me embarrassed

693
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,145
Your eyes look like the eyes in my dream

694
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:38,355
Sometimes, my face becomes red

695
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:40,482
I have to face the devils tonight!

696
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:43,444
Yes! You are facing devils tonight!

697
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,696
Two Magic Bags here
and some invisible stickers

698
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:48,032
You're invisible if you stick one on
your body

699
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:50,409
Cover him by it when he is not aware

700
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,661
I'll cover you up from the back

701
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:54,663
This is my line!

702
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:55,873
Whom are you talking to?

703
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:57,958
To him

704
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,545
Let me help you!

705
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:03,547
That's great! You're my good bro

706
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,090
Tell all bros to come in

707
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:06,050
give a magic sticker to each of them

708
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,927
I go back to get the Magic Bag

709
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:08,886
Then we can catch all the devils

710
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:10,054
No problem

711
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:13,307
Good brother

712
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:15,017
Your eyes today...

713
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:15,809
Are they seductive?

714
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:18,145
Yes

715
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,444
I will help you

716
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,751
Help yourself!

717
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:42,044
What to do?

718
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,629
It is Master's order

719
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:44,964
You wait a moment

720
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:48,217
Asst. Master

721
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,636
Tell the others, Master is looking for us

722
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,888
Go

723
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,937
Invisible sticker

724
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:02,481
Go...

725
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:07,903
Sister

726
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,029
OK...

727
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:14,952
Let's keep quiet and see what they want

728
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:27,339
Sister, drink!

729
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:43,939
Sister, you drink too

730
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:50,028
What are you doing?

731
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,031
I'm drunk. I wanna sleep

732
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:54,992
don't be afraid. We're invisible

733
00:40:55,033 --> 00:41:01,748
You shouldn't drink so much if you
cannot drink

734
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,766
We're invisible

735
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:21,018
You can see nothing all the time

736
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:23,353
Ok!

737
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:28,317
Master hasn't come yet

738
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:29,485
Yes

739
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:34,531
You say there is roast chicken

740
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:44,166
Master! It's burning

741
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:47,628
Don't be naked

742
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,010
Pay me back! Fool!

743
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:38,387
No need to be like that?

744
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,180
None of your business, pay me back

745
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:41,264
When did I borrow money from you

746
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:42,432
You owe me

747
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:43,558
I owe you?

748
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,476
Don't you remember?

749
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,770
No...

750
00:42:46,812 --> 00:42:48,021
You lost your memory

751
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,565
Sorry

752
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:12,462
You should pay back!

753
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:14,047
/No need to be like that

754
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,340
Pay me back, or I'll ruin your face

755
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:17,217
I have paid you back last month

756
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:20,429
Really? Yes, yes

757
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,848
You're old. You lost your memory

758
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:26,309
Forget it, it's my fault

759
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:29,104
Cut it! Cut it!

760
00:43:29,146 --> 00:43:32,149
That's better than nothing

761
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,567
Fight with him! Bros!

762
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:34,359
Bros, let's go!

763
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:36,820
Yes!

764
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:42,451
Devils, come out!

765
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:45,078
Where is the Magic Bag?

766
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,332
The Magic Bag is here
They wanna frame you

767
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:53,587
Traitor, you betray me

768
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,965
Today, you betray me

769
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,508
I will betray you one day

770
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,926
Really?

771
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:02,387
Yes!

772
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:07,225
I want to destroy all devils

773
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:12,063
I can take off my underwear!

774
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:15,609
Master, there's really something wrong
with Asst. Master

775
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,819
That guy is unwilling to do anything
even if I beg him

776
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:19,946
Now, he admit so quickly
There must be something wrong

777
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:20,655
Pull him out

778
00:44:20,697 --> 00:44:23,116
Yes!

779
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:25,494
Let me go...

780
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:26,661
Let me go

781
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:27,996
Shut up

782
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:30,207
Let me go

783
00:44:30,248 --> 00:44:31,875
Kneel down

784
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:35,504
You son of a bitch
I'm gonna kill you tonight

785
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:37,005
Fine!

786
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:38,590
You can't blame him

787
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:42,677
He's only mesmerized by both devils

788
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:43,678
Let me go

789
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,388
or I'll tell my Master to kill you

790
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,225
Shut up!

791
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:50,519
Wong Choi

792
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,021
The string you're biting is so familiar

793
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:53,980
Stranger

794
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:59,319
It is the string for my Magic Bag

795
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:00,612
Son of a bitch

796
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:04,950
How dare you come here!

797
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:06,535
Come here!

798
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,745
I'll kill you, reincarnated Monkey King

799
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:11,206
Then you won't find the Longevity Monk

800
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:12,540
What?

801
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:15,043
He is the Monkey King?

802
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:16,503
Say you're the Monkey King

803
00:45:16,544 --> 00:45:18,213
or we'll all die

804
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:19,464
He's not the Monkey King

805
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:20,966
He can't even withstand my Skeleton Fire

806
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:22,300
He is not the Monkey King?

807
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:23,468
Shit!

808
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,053
You've exposed a top secret

809
00:45:25,095 --> 00:45:25,804
Really?

810
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,555
This way

811
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:29,266
Are you really a fairy?

812
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:30,892
Give me your hand

813
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:33,353
It is too much of you...

814
00:45:33,395 --> 00:45:35,355
Do you think I can't withstand your
Skeleton Fire?

815
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:37,065
Burn me again

816
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:38,233
Serious?

817
00:45:38,275 --> 00:45:40,860
Great!

818
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:44,322
I'm not scared! See?

819
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:46,783
Yes!

820
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:53,248
You can burn my hand if you like

821
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,293
I'm not afraid of you

822
00:45:56,334 --> 00:46:00,046
Not burn my hand?

823
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,971
Burning

824
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:13,393
The hand is still OK

825
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:15,103
Let go!

826
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:16,855
Now you know I'm great

827
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:17,939
Surrender!

828
00:46:17,981 --> 00:46:20,108
I have got my bros and a fairy

829
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,234
Where are you going?

830
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:23,111
I'll take revenge on you one day

831
00:46:23,153 --> 00:46:24,863
Even a fairy is not righteous

832
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:25,780
No need to ask

833
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:28,116
My bros must be there

834
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:30,368
Yes! Master!

835
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,496
Sons of bitches!

836
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:35,081
Are you that heartless guy?

837
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:37,751
You deceived me last night!

838
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,377
That Monkey King

839
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:41,504
Sister will not be married just
because of you

840
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:43,840
Me?

841
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:46,009
Get the Joker!

842
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,218
Go!

843
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,470
Stop that

844
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:51,514
Master, go

845
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:03,109
Don't kill my bros!

846
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:25,590
Master

847
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:36,392
Blindy, I'm here, no need to scare

848
00:47:36,434 --> 00:47:37,352
Sorry, Blindy!

849
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:38,561
You have made a mistake

850
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:41,147
You won't blame me, will you?

851
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:43,441
For my whole life I know

852
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,902
I'm blind...

853
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:51,449
But I am right to be your follower!

854
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:56,329
Kill you!

855
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:00,375
You go to hell

856
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:01,501
You can't kill him

857
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:02,585
You still help him

858
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:04,254
You want to rely on him to find
the Longevity Monk

859
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:09,425
Take him back to Spider's Web Cave

860
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:11,302
Sister

861
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:14,889
Only one man can be benefit by it

862
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:17,225
You don't know this in fact

863
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:19,435
You won't gian anything even
if you hurt me

864
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:22,313
Look at your palm

865
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,983
Black Widow!

866
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:26,943
You've been poisoned by my weapon

867
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:28,653
You will die in 7 days

868
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:31,364
if you can't get my remedy

869
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:33,157
Sister, I don't dare to do so anymore

870
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,119
Get lost!

871
00:48:37,954 --> 00:48:39,998
You regret at last

872
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,210
No! A fierce thing has come

873
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:47,171
Go out and have a look

874
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:48,298
Where are you going?

875
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:50,633
No!

876
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:54,220
King Bull has come?

877
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:57,265
King Bull?

878
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:06,232
Pretend to be dead here?

879
00:49:06,274 --> 00:49:09,193
Me too...

880
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:12,739
Monster

881
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:23,374
Granpa Buddha

882
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,168
Give the Longevity Monk to me

883
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,294
or you're gonna die

884
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:27,170
We have nothing to talk

885
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:29,213
You are looking for the Monkey King

886
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:31,424
My bro Monkey King?

887
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:33,718
Where is he?

888
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,927
This monster

889
00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:36,304
is the Monkey King's Bro

890
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:37,764
We are saved

891
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:39,682
I'm you Bro

892
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:41,809
the reincamated Monkey King

893
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:42,977
You?

894
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:43,978
Yes...

895
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,146
Yes! It's me

896
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:50,068
I'm gonna kill you adulterer!

897
00:49:51,861 --> 00:49:54,697
Tell me your name, witch!

898
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:55,656
I'm Boney M of Spider Devil

899
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,241
Spider Woman

900
00:49:57,283 --> 00:50:00,369
In the old days when I know your masters

901
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,955
where were you?

902
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:05,291
I have no business with you...

903
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,252
Change...

904
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:12,673
I'm going to kill

905
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:14,509
the ones who black my way

906
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,846
Try my White Bone Whip!

907
00:50:39,492 --> 00:50:41,702
Change!

908
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:45,832
Dragon Heavenly Silk!

909
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,884
Go!

910
00:50:57,176 --> 00:51:01,264
It's only small trick

911
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:45,224
Blindy, you're still alive!

912
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:47,643
We are in trouble

913
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:50,896
I admire you

914
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:54,650
Don't go...

915
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:57,612
Let me see what magic you have got

916
00:51:57,653 --> 00:52:00,865
King Bull Go

917
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:10,124
My Little Buddha in hurt

918
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:16,005
Another hundred years before it is healed

919
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:18,632
Get up

920
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:25,348
What are you doing?

921
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,100
Master wanna see you

922
00:52:28,142 --> 00:52:29,518
What place is this?

923
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,188
Spider Web Cave

924
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:33,522
Spider Web Cave?

925
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:34,648
Yes!

926
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,318
I'm Spider Devil's disciple Spider Woman

927
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,320
This is Spider Web Cave

928
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:41,530
Spider Web Cave?

929
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:42,990
Let's go! Monkey

930
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:44,200
Hey, you have gone mad

931
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:46,369
I'm your Master, monkey!

932
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,370
I'm mad

933
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:48,871
You are lying!

934
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:50,206
You've admitted that

935
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:51,290
you're the Monkey King

936
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:52,208
Go!

937
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:53,084
Get smart just for once

938
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,335
I was forced to pretend

939
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:57,254
you can use the Magic Mirror to
show my true identity

940
00:52:57,296 --> 00:53:00,591
Magic Mirror?

941
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:08,224
Can you see it?

942
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:09,391
Yes

943
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,894
Clear?

944
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:13,229
Deceive me!

945
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,940
This is not the Magic Mirror

946
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:18,400
Pig!

947
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:21,695
Sister, have pity on me

948
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:23,322
Stay calm

949
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:25,908
I guarantee that you can trust

950
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,451
my word this time

951
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:28,410
Master!

952
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:29,328
Master!

953
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,081
Master! The monkey has come

954
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:36,877
Where is the Longevity Monk?

955
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:39,338
Big misunderstanding, everybody

956
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,673
How big?

957
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:41,966
Let me tell you secretly

958
00:53:42,007 --> 00:53:44,260
I was born in the Year of Monkey
but I'm not the Monkey King

959
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:45,136
A waste of time!

960
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:46,011
I have got the Magic Mirror and
everything

961
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:46,971
You can use the mirror on me

962
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:48,013
Fake mirror

963
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:48,931
how dare you use the fake mirror...

964
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:50,933
Now! Stop playing game

965
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,476
If I'm the Monkey King

966
00:53:52,518 --> 00:53:53,894
why am I standing here for you to bite
my hand?

967
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:54,854
I could jump to the sky

968
00:53:54,895 --> 00:53:57,189
Then shit on your heads

969
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:58,357
You haven't changed to be
Monkey King yet

970
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,192
You'll shit at that time

971
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:03,028
What is it, sister?

972
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,780
Broken hearted?

973
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:05,781
No

974
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,117
No?

975
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:12,538
I won't be hurt by this man again

976
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,665
you are lying to me!

977
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:17,376
Sister, I'm not lying to you

978
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:20,004
Then kill him

979
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:21,964
Kill him

980
00:54:22,006 --> 00:54:24,174
Don't you want to find
the Longevity Monk?

981
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:30,222
Yes! But I don't think you will kill him

982
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:34,393
Not accurate...

983
00:54:34,435 --> 00:54:37,563
Give the sword!

984
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:41,191
Give! Understand

985
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:43,652
Kill him!

986
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:45,029
You've sliced a piece of my thigh out

987
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,988
I intended to do that

988
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,323
Give me a bill and I'll pay you back

989
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,616
You're welcome

990
00:54:48,657 --> 00:54:51,744
I kill you!

991
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:56,332
Cheap whore, you still love that monkey

992
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:01,253
Stop that, I'm gonna kill you

993
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:17,061
Are you Ok?

994
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,192
You're still concerned about me

995
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:28,238
I'm gonna love forever onwards

996
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:33,869
They are outside

997
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:35,204
Can this door block them?

998
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:40,709
this door is mad of unbreakable steel

999
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:43,837
Stand aside

1000
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:48,217
Sister, do you remember
how he treated you in the past?

1001
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,219
He deceived you, refused to marry you

1002
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,221
You had a good marriage with
Chilian Immortal

1003
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:53,472
He ruined it

1004
00:55:53,514 --> 00:55:54,556
He can do nothing now

1005
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:55,641
When he returned to his own image

1006
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:56,767
he'll leave you

1007
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:58,060
Have you finished? Son of bitch!

1008
00:55:58,102 --> 00:55:59,895
Damn monkey
how dare you call me a bitch!

1009
00:55:59,937 --> 00:56:01,730
Scold me, son of a bitch

1010
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,899
Don't think it's safe to hide inside

1011
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:05,609
it's full moon tonight

1012
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:10,155
She will become a zombie!

1013
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:15,702
I don't scare, son of a bitch

1014
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:20,666
What?

1015
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:23,419
There are many hills and caves here

1016
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,087
We don't know
where the Spider Web Cave is?

1017
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:26,588
Yes...

1018
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:32,427
More than the bugs in my body. Search!

1019
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,750
What are you doing?

1020
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:06,587
How about inside? Are you fine?

1021
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:08,130
Of course I'm alright

1022
00:57:08,172 --> 00:57:11,425
We are very happy

1023
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,427
Jing Jing is till very pretty

1024
00:57:13,468 --> 00:57:15,220
I'm still very handsome

1025
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,722
We are still very good-looking

1026
00:57:16,763 --> 00:57:20,851
Meal time, Ma'am 30th

1027
00:57:22,561 --> 00:57:24,730
Help...

1028
00:57:24,771 --> 00:57:25,981
Zombie!

1029
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:26,899
Open the door!

1030
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,733
I can't open it!

1031
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:29,318
Kiss her, breath life to her

1032
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:33,196
Maybe it will be stopped

1033
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:35,824
Scare me!

1034
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:37,910
Sister, you can't defeat me

1035
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:39,828
Really?

1036
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,665
I'll break you neck if you move

1037
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:46,710
Give me the key! Lock him up

1038
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:48,503
You wanna go inside

1039
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:51,840
Now you can go

1040
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:54,676
Goodbye!

1041
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:12,152
Please stop taking revenge

1042
00:58:13,195 --> 00:58:15,697
Listen to my suggestions

1043
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:21,703
You can beat me
but please don't hit my face...

1044
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,039
Stop beat my cock, thanks

1045
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:29,086
There is a chicken, Ma'am 30th

1046
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:34,424
I'm telling you

1047
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:43,767
No reactions after a kiss

1048
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:47,396
Don't lock it up

1049
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:50,232
Ok, since you refuse to open the door

1050
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:51,650
I warn you

1051
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:56,571
I'll rape and kill your lover

1052
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:01,076
One

1053
00:59:09,835 --> 00:59:12,129
Two

1054
00:59:14,005 --> 00:59:16,800
I get it

1055
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:22,514
Three

1056
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:28,437
Seductive magic

1057
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:38,572
Go!

1058
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:47,456
What are you doing?

1059
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:49,791
I have just shivered for a while

1060
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,334
Very interesting

1061
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,587
You shivered on my body?

1062
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:55,922
Yes

1063
00:59:56,173 --> 00:59:58,884
Oh god!

1064
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:26,745
It must be better if she's not a devil!

1065
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:35,670
You're poisoned

1066
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:38,089
You'll die if you don't cured

1067
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:39,841
What for even if I'm cured?

1068
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,636
Living long is meaningless
if you are unhappy

1069
01:00:42,677 --> 01:00:47,974
Your last few days will be great
if you're happy

1070
01:00:48,016 --> 01:00:49,559
If I tell you I'm the Monkey King

1071
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:51,269
what do you think?

1072
01:00:51,311 --> 01:00:53,271
I will kill you

1073
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:55,440
I'm not him

1074
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:56,733
This is a magic mirror

1075
01:00:56,775 --> 01:00:57,943
You should use it

1076
01:00:57,984 --> 01:01:00,195
You're not him, really?

1077
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:01,780
I'm not

1078
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:03,823
Don't you scare that I will kill you?

1079
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:07,577
Yes, but I have no option

1080
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,497
Because I don't want you to look at me

1081
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:15,085
while you're thinking of another

1082
01:01:15,126 --> 01:01:17,504
I would like to kill you

1083
01:01:17,545 --> 01:01:20,048
You said living long was meaningless

1084
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,010
if you were unhappy

1085
01:02:13,685 --> 01:02:14,728
Go ahead!

1086
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:17,689
Yes, I'll

1087
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,200
Shit! Who make this knot?

1088
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:32,537
Let me do it!

1089
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:42,797
Sorry, I don't mean it

1090
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,299
You do it strongly

1091
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,967
So I wanna do it with you

1092
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:47,552
Although I'm not a righteous man

1093
01:02:47,594 --> 01:02:50,013
I won't take advantages from the others

1094
01:02:50,054 --> 01:02:52,098
I'm not used to do it at daytime

1095
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,227
Let's wait till night

1096
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:02,775
No matter when

1097
01:03:02,817 --> 01:03:05,612
call me if you need me

1098
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:07,030
From now on

1099
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:10,658
I'll be with you

1100
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:20,877
Can you get him?

1101
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:21,544
No

1102
01:03:21,586 --> 01:03:24,088
Go on

1103
01:03:46,194 --> 01:03:48,321
Damn!

1104
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:50,990
I'm so pretty

1105
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:56,913
But I have a baby with such an ugly man

1106
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:00,708
Ma'am 30th

1107
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,585
Shut up!

1108
01:04:02,627 --> 01:04:06,172
I will kill you if I'm not pregnant

1109
01:04:06,214 --> 01:04:07,090
Thanks

1110
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:09,300
Why are you so happy?

1111
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:10,843
Tell you...

1112
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:11,678
Don't tell the baby

1113
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:15,223
you're his father

1114
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:16,432
What should I be?

1115
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:17,892
His maiden

1116
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,228
I'm a man. I can't be a maiden!

1117
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:21,562
We bring him up

1118
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:24,565
He don't know if a maiden is
a man or woman

1119
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,819
That's right

1120
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:33,783
I've found a guy just like you

1121
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:46,087
It's you?

1122
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:52,010
Do you wanna know
where the Longevity Monk is?

1123
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:53,636
Yes, I do

1124
01:04:53,678 --> 01:04:58,391
Don't strike back if you do

1125
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:01,644
you have to pay for the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

1126
01:05:01,686 --> 01:05:04,689
It worths!

1127
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:07,483
If you give me the medication for
Jing Jing

1128
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:09,819
I will tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

1129
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:12,613
You just do it for that bitch

1130
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:16,159
I like to do so

1131
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:23,249
Maiden

1132
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:28,838
Maiden is kissing you

1133
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:38,431
Ok, let's go by tomorrow

1134
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,229
Because of love

1135
01:05:45,271 --> 01:05:50,485
you can ruin my face if you like

1136
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:57,909
Hurry up, do you wanna save someone?

1137
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,746
Just let me do it!

1138
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:10,505
Joker

1139
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:12,298
Sister can't take this anymore
You go ahead!

1140
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,052
Let me... do that

1141
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:27,813
Not here

1142
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:36,572
Everyone deceives me

1143
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:43,162
We'll reach the Buddha Cave after
climbing this hill

1144
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:45,915
No, Ah!

1145
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,710
Jing Jing!

1146
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:52,755
Jing Jing!

1147
01:06:57,677 --> 01:07:00,221
She thought I left her alone

1148
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:01,389
How long will you search?

1149
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,890
Jing Jing

1150
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:07,103
She's poisoned, must have died and
fell down from the cliff

1151
01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:09,563
It's all because of you

1152
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:10,898
You shouldn't let me sleep for
a whole night

1153
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,983
I should come here as soon as possible

1154
01:07:12,024 --> 01:07:12,858
You should whip the horse strongly

1155
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,068
We can be faster!

1156
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,152
I won't tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

1157
01:07:15,194 --> 01:07:17,613
I don't know anything

1158
01:07:17,655 --> 01:07:22,326
How dare you put the blame on me!

1159
01:07:22,368 --> 01:07:23,286
What?

1160
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:26,247
We discovered that Boney M fainted
under the cliff

1161
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:29,917
Granpa Buddha has died

1162
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:33,629
God is helping me!

1163
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:36,257
Go in!

1164
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:37,591
If you don't tell me

1165
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:41,220
you can't go out

1166
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:46,183
I won't listen to you

1167
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:52,982
The ground is not so hard

1168
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:59,363
Powerful devil, extraordinary energy!

1169
01:07:59,405 --> 01:08:00,614
I will cure your wound but

1170
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:03,409
you must take me to the Cave to get
the incarnated monkey

1171
01:08:03,451 --> 01:08:04,785
We'll find the Longevity Monk sooner
or later

1172
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:07,121
You can also eat the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

1173
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:11,667
or you will die painfully

1174
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:20,801
I have to come out
even if I have to dig a tunnel

1175
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:27,391
I can move freely in time and space with
the power of moon

1176
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:30,519
What is it?

1177
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:50,539
This is the Indian language

1178
01:08:50,581 --> 01:08:54,293
The Pandora's Box

1179
01:08:54,919 --> 01:09:01,425
The treasure left behind by
Spider Web Devil?

1180
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:30,955
Take me into the Cave

1181
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,040
Why does the belly feel painful?

1182
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:35,167
Is it coming?

1183
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:36,627
Where am I?

1184
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:37,670
Why so many traps?

1185
01:09:37,711 --> 01:09:42,508
It becomes wetter and wetter

1186
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:22,506
Welcome, our King!

1187
01:10:32,433 --> 01:10:35,644
Damn! I've met a ghost!

1188
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:38,564
What's going on?

1189
01:10:38,605 --> 01:10:39,857
You love the Longevity Monk

1190
01:10:39,898 --> 01:10:41,775
so I play him to make you happy

1191
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:42,735
What are you doing?

1192
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,778
I'm helping you to give birth!

1193
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,530
The head is coming out!

1194
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:47,698
Really, I've no feeling

1195
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,158
You see?

1196
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,576
This is my knee

1197
01:10:50,617 --> 01:10:52,244
So there is no hair

1198
01:10:52,286 --> 01:10:53,287
Someone's coming

1199
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:57,041
Hide up, be quick

1200
01:11:00,336 --> 01:11:01,587
I'm hurt

1201
01:11:01,628 --> 01:11:03,005
I'm hurt, too

1202
01:11:03,047 --> 01:11:08,635
Please let go of your hand! Alright!

1203
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:18,228
Goddess

1204
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,148
Monkey King
you'd committed serious offences

1205
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:24,610
I hope you know you're wrong

1206
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:26,153
Who's talking?

1207
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:29,698
500 years ago
your master Longevity Monk sacrificed

1208
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,158
his life to save you

1209
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,826
Heaven Emperor planned that

1210
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:35,079
you revive after 500 years

1211
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,122
I hope you'll be like your master

1212
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:38,499
Making sacrifices to save the others

1213
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,876
To clean the sin that you've made before

1214
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:43,253
You should put on the Gold Ring
on your head

1215
01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:44,713
Admit you sin

1216
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:48,008
Then you'll become
the super Monkey King

1217
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,178
You'll take the responsibility to get
scriptures in the west

1218
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,513
Rewrite the history

1219
01:11:52,554 --> 01:11:55,057
All things in human life is then
none of your business

1220
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:57,684
you can't have any desires anymore

1221
01:11:57,726 --> 01:11:59,937
Worship Buddha whole-heartedly

1222
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:02,773
You haven't turned into the Monkey King

1223
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,024
because you haven't met the guy

1224
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:06,151
who gives you the 3 birthmarks

1225
01:12:06,193 --> 01:12:07,653
After you see him

1226
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:11,865
your whole life will be changed

1227
01:12:11,907 --> 01:12:13,909
Talking to me?

1228
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:16,203
I don't think so

1229
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:20,249
I think you have made a mistake

1230
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,583
Crazy!

1231
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:24,461
Painful...

1232
01:12:24,503 --> 01:12:25,838
Let go!

1233
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:29,800
Keep calm please No

1234
01:12:29,883 --> 01:12:31,844
Keep calm

1235
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:34,555
I'm painful

1236
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:38,183
I'm painful, too

1237
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:45,983
Mind the traps here

1238
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,025
Chase

1239
01:12:47,067 --> 01:12:48,777
Go!

1240
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:51,154
Come her and grab me

1241
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:55,993
Ok, do it... Ok! It's coming

1242
01:12:56,535 --> 01:12:58,036
The Longevity Monk was born
go to get him!

1243
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:00,497
Yes!

1244
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:08,213
The baby looks like you

1245
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,174
I think

1246
01:13:11,216 --> 01:13:13,010
being an immortal or not is not important

1247
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:16,013
The flesh of the Longevity Monk
isn't must, too

1248
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:19,433
We have to live together happily

1249
01:13:19,474 --> 01:13:21,018
Bring our son up

1250
01:13:21,059 --> 01:13:23,812
Don't let him be robber

1251
01:13:23,854 --> 01:13:25,439
You want the Longevity Monk most

1252
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:29,401
Just call him Longevity

1253
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:30,652
Who?

1254
01:13:30,694 --> 01:13:32,904
It is too coincident

1255
01:13:32,946 --> 01:13:35,407
What do you want?

1256
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,452
Your baby?

1257
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:42,914
My baby with Joker!

1258
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:46,209
What are you talking about?

1259
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:49,713
Maiden, tell him

1260
01:13:49,755 --> 01:13:52,674
Tell him!

1261
01:13:56,678 --> 01:13:59,097
Yes!

1262
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:04,603
this is her baby with Joker

1263
01:14:06,772 --> 01:14:09,066
Go!

1264
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:11,193
See where you can go

1265
01:14:11,234 --> 01:14:12,778
No need to scare, I'm gonna protect you

1266
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:13,737
Who the hell you are?

1267
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:15,072
You're not qualified to protect me

1268
01:14:15,113 --> 01:14:16,907
Get lost

1269
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:20,535
take my son away

1270
01:14:21,912 --> 01:14:22,871
Come here!

1271
01:14:22,913 --> 01:14:24,289
Give me the Longevity Monk

1272
01:14:24,331 --> 01:14:26,917
I'm not calling you to come

1273
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:27,793
This is my son

1274
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:29,086
not the Longevity Monk

1275
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:31,630
Help!

1276
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:34,549
Help...

1277
01:14:34,716 --> 01:14:40,931
You're concerned about me
I'll die for you

1278
01:14:47,813 --> 01:14:48,688
Take my son away

1279
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,648
Don't go!

1280
01:14:49,689 --> 01:14:51,358
Go

1281
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,402
Ma'am 30th

1282
01:14:57,489 --> 01:15:02,494
It is lucky that we can go out

1283
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:13,296
Jing Jing

1284
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:39,573
Honey

1285
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:43,034
Tortoise Magic

1286
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:44,578
Slash your liver, stomach

1287
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:48,623
and internal organs!

1288
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:51,251
Tie it with a knot

1289
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:55,380
Here comes the spirit

1290
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:58,550
Bitch, don't step on my intestine

1291
01:15:58,592 --> 01:16:01,887
I wanna do so

1292
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:18,862
Honey...!

1293
01:16:18,945 --> 01:16:19,946
My wife is inside

1294
01:16:19,988 --> 01:16:21,239
Please help me!

1295
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:22,490
I'm not free

1296
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:25,243
Thanks!

1297
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:26,745
Come out!

1298
01:16:26,786 --> 01:16:29,080
Go!

1299
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:36,212
Can we go back to the past?

1300
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:43,511
Hurry up! Go!

1301
01:16:43,553 --> 01:16:45,680
I won't! Let's go together

1302
01:16:45,722 --> 01:16:47,682
Listen to me

1303
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:51,227
Bring up my son

1304
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,940
Go!

1305
01:16:57,651 --> 01:17:00,737
Our son! Honey!

1306
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:03,031
you have to leave or I'll die!

1307
01:17:03,073 --> 01:17:05,367
No!

1308
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:15,377
Honey... Honey...

1309
01:17:16,503 --> 01:17:18,380
Honey!

1310
01:17:18,421 --> 01:17:19,756
the moon is rising!

1311
01:17:19,798 --> 01:17:22,300
Honey

1312
01:17:22,926 --> 01:17:24,302
Ok!

1313
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:28,139
What's that? I've forgot that!

1314
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:31,601
Boyi Bolomi...

1315
01:17:36,648 --> 01:17:40,151
Being immortal!

1316
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:44,948
Great! We're going back to the past

1317
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:47,742
Wait for me!

1318
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:51,663
The killer is leaving

1319
01:17:51,704 --> 01:17:55,291
Honey... My wife

1320
01:17:56,543 --> 01:17:59,379
Your wife is coming out, easy!

1321
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:04,134
I've not finished. How do you know?

1322
01:18:04,175 --> 01:18:06,136
She's coming out. Go!

1323
01:18:06,177 --> 01:18:09,681
Honey, honey...

1324
01:18:11,474 --> 01:18:14,686
Boyi Bolomi!

1325
01:18:15,562 --> 01:18:18,940
Being immortal again!

1326
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:23,027
Why did you say again?

1327
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:25,780
Wait...

1328
01:18:29,993 --> 01:18:32,579

01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:42,213
Don't disturb me!

1331
01:18:43,673 --> 01:18:46,050
Why did you tell me not to disturb you?

1332
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:47,260
Shit! You're annoying!

1333
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:49,637
I know I'm annoying

1334
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,514
Why?

1335
01:18:51,556 --> 01:18:52,223
You come out!

1336
01:18:52,265 --> 01:18:54,726
Go, go!

1337
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:57,562
Honey...

1338
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:02,400
Boyi Bolomi

1339
01:19:02,442 --> 01:19:05,361
You're also very annoying

1340
01:19:05,403 --> 01:19:08,114
Wait...

1341
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:16,414
Damn, I'm very tired

1342
01:19:16,956 --> 01:19:19,751
Honey...

1343
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:28,760
Give me

1344
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:36,059
I won't tell you!

1345
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:39,479
That's fine

1346
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,440
Why did you do so?

1347
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:45,276
Honey...

1348
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,740
Boyi Bolomi...

1349
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:59,874
Honey, come out with King Bull
and see Jesus

1350
01:20:04,545 --> 01:20:07,048
Stop!

1351
01:20:12,011 --> 01:20:13,388
Commit suicide

1352
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:16,516
Why commit suicide?

1353
01:20:16,557 --> 01:20:21,062

1354
01:20:27,694 --> 01:20:30,113

01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:33,366
Let you go?

1357
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:35,952
Tell me a reason why I have to let you go

1358
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:39,163
You tell me a reason why you wanna
kill me

1359
01:20:39,205 --> 01:20:41,416
Ok, you leave me alone

1360
01:20:41,457 --> 01:20:42,834

1361
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,168
No, that's not the case Wanna die?

1362
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,586
No, hero!

1363
01:20:45,628 --> 01:20:47,839
I left because I wanna get medication
for you from you sister

1364
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,881
But I was late

1365
01:20:48,923 --> 01:20:50,967
I couldn't find you

1366
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:52,093
You deceive me!

1367
01:20:52,135 --> 01:20:54,846
You don't trust me

1368
01:20:54,887 --> 01:20:57,682

01:20:59,934 --> 01:21:00,935

1371
01:21:03,354 --> 01:21:06,190

1372
01:21:06,232 --> 01:21:12,613
When the rock is put down

1373
01:21:17,827 --> 01:21:20,621

1374
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:27,378

1385
01:23:03,641 --> 01:23:06,227

1386
01:23:06,268 --> 01:23:08,854

1388
01:23:13,484 --> 01:23:16,362
Don't go into the Spider Web Cave!

1389
01:23:16,404 --> 01:23:18,531
Spider Web Cave?

1390
01:23:18,572 --> 01:23:19,991

01:23:20,032 --> 01:23:23,452
Waterfall Cave

1392
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:34,088
Spider Web Cave. It is a good name

1393
01:23:36,882 --> 01:23:40,386
Spider Web Cave

1394
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,180
We'll live here onwards

1395
01:23:43,222 --> 01:23:45,725
Stop!

1396
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:56,026

1397
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:58,028
In this hill, all things belong to me

1398
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,071
Including you

1399

1403
01:24:11,292 --> 01:24:13,627
If someone bully you

1404
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:17,381

1405
01:24:17,423 --> 01:24:20,009
Spider Web Immortal?

01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,053
500 years?

1407
01:24:26,474 --> 01:24:28,642
You haven't turned into Monkey King

1408
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:36,192
because you haven't met the guy having
three birthmarks

1409
01:24:57,421 --> 01:25:00,841
Close the door
