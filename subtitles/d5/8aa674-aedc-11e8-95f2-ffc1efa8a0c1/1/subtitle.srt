1
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,385
It rained for months on end.

2
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,198
The whole of Tokyo was flooded.

3
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,235
The damage
ran to billions of yen,

4
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,400
and the dead and missing
numbered in their millions.

5
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,599
The survivors

6
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,508
all mutated into
strange amphibian monsters,

7
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,777
adapting quickly to the
suddenly changing climate.

8
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,783
We're all going to die!

9
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,481
No, we'll mutate.

10
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,125
We mustn't breed!

11
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,128
Think what the children
would look like.

12
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,630
No, actually,

13
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,498
the horniness is
part of the mutation.

14
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,896
That's why the species
is so successful

15
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:54,701
from an evolutionary
point of view.

16
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,404
<i>- Hello?
- Hiroko, where are you?</i>

17
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,546
No, we're not lost,

18
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,347
just stuck in traffic.

19
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,373
<i>- Where are you?
- Right now...</i>

20
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,621
<i>- We've just passed Shinsencho.
- You're almost here.</i>

21
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,924
<i>- OK, talk to you in a bit.
- OK.</i>

22
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,925
Yeah, see you.

23
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,129
Are we going the right way?

24
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,192
Look at the map.

25
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,804
Sorry.

26
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,706
Sorry.

27
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,477
We're already... there,
I think.

28
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,886
<i>Really?</i>

29
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>Where? What color is your car?</i>

30
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,990
It's silver.

31
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,392
A Honda.

32
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,096
Well,
more like gray, really.

33
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,200
<i>I've got a red umbrella.</i>

34
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,401
A red umbrella?

35
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,804
Spin it round.

36
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,802
<i>I'll try.</i>

37
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,676
<i>I'm spinning it, I'm spinning it.
Can't you see me?</i>

38
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,000
Now jump.

39
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,981
<i>Jump? OK, here I go...</i>

40
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,386
Now on one leg.

41
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,396
- Akemi!
- Hiroko!

42
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,003
- Here, towels.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,477
In Tokyo...

44
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,883
the bigger the
company you work for...

45
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,582
the smaller
the flat you get.

46
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,791
You should work
for a smaller company.

47
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,389
My company's
already pretty small.

48
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,098
- It's a nice place.
- You think so?

49
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,296
You still have Saburo, then?

50
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,007
Little Saburo!

51
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,400
It's raining tonight,
so your car should be OK.

52
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,447
But you can't leave it.

53
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,505
There's a hardware store

54
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:21,885
just over there. Park in front...
It's been closed for a while.

55
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,296
<i>AKEMI SHIMIZU</i>

56
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,994
Now for this week's episode
of 'Where Are They Now?'

57
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,801
Akira, what are you doing now?

58
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,510
Well... I'm a filmmaker.

59
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,082
He's just made a film
that he's showing around.

60
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,377
The film's about...

61
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,281
...is the main thing.
Please go and see it.

62
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,181
This is it.

63
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:06,390
But this is...
a porno theater.

64
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,700
It's a real theater, then!

65
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,101
It'll be dark and quiet.

66
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,104
You shouldn't have cut
my sex scene after all!

67
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,312
Are you making pornos?

68
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,677
No, that was a joke.

69
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,982
I had a part for Hiroko,
but she turned it down.

70
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,489
What a pity. No ambition!

71
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,288
Right!
That's her problem exactly.

72
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,398
Why did you pass up
the chance to be a star?

73
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,792
I don't like the sound
of my own voice.

74
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,493
It sounds like this.

75
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,902
I can't wait to see it.

76
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,701
- Really?
- Yes.

77
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,605
How about now?

78
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,611
- I've got the DVD here.
- She might be tired.

79
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:59,275
No, let's watch it now.
It's not too intellectual, is it?

80
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,981
<i>There are so many lives
in the future.</i>

81
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,296
<i>Assuming we haven't
destroyed ourselves first</i>

82
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,490
<i>we could live on
after the end of the solar system.</i>

83
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:21,300
<i>In the infinity
of new souls created</i>

84
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,607
<i>there's no reason that one
shouldn't be me again.</i>

85
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,089
Sorry.

86
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,595
I have to get up early
in the morning.

87
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,207
- Can you help me with this?
- This?

88
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,006
I liked the bit I saw, though.

89
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,882
You can change in
the bathroom.

90
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,381
Hiroko, can you pull that side?

91
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,426
I hope you'll be all right.
I'm sorry it's so cramped.

92
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,792
It's fine.

93
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,386
'A good soldier must suffer
with pride,' right?

94
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:24,492
'Enduring the unendurable.
Suffering the...'

95
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,696
Stop it, stupid!

96
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,806
Seriously, though. Thanks.

97
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,147
We'll start looking for
an apartment tomorrow.

98
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,980
My boyfriend's staying next
Sunday. He's driving from Nagoya.

99
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,580
His uncle works in advertising.

100
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,989
Shall I ask him
to come and see your film?

101
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,790
You think
he'd come from Nagoya?

102
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,132
Of course not!
That's my side.

103
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,334
His uncle lives in Tokyo.

104
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,393
I'm switching it off.

105
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,505
All that way, for your movie!

106
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,608
Three, two, one...

107
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,607
- Good night!
- Good night.

108
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,646
Don't forget
to move your car tomorrow.

109
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,274
The fines are huge.

110
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,186
I'm glad it's raining.

111
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,485
<i>Don't forget to move your car</i>

112
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,294
Look.

113
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,001
We'll be OK until Friday.

114
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,111
<i>CLOSED UNTIL FRIDAY NOVEMBER 16TH</i>

115
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:19,000
What are you doing?
It'll go up if we don't pay.

116
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,178
We're not kids anymore.

117
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,883
Cover me!
I'm going into the safe!

118
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,586
Copy that!

119
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:33,589
We can't make any more mistakes.
Our budget's tight as it is.

120
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,699
To rent an apartment...
Say the rent is 30,000...

121
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,708
We'd need a deposit
of two months' rent.

122
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,407
In all, we'd need...

123
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,481
We would need
400,000 yen in advance.

124
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,385
It's a good place
for young couples.

125
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,000
Who are you? Let me out!

126
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,011
It's popular with young couples.

127
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,978
Do you like the view?

128
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,777
Nice dead cat.

129
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,687
Something smells like shit!

130
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,983
I can't live in a dump like that.

131
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,393
There wasn't any soap left
in Akemi's place.

132
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,890
Do you think it's a hotel?

133
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,499
I didn't mean that.

134
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,002
My bad.
Let's go and buy some soap now.

135
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,303
What's wrong? Are you mad?

136
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,905
It's nothing.

137
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,775
Come on, what is it?

138
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,279
You said I have no ambition.

139
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,881
What?

140
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,983
Yesterday. You said
I have no ambition at all.

141
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,992
I said that?

142
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,889
It's not true.
I like photography and art.

143
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,903
I've got a boating license,
and I read a lot too.

144
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,604
But they're hobbies.
They're not the same as ambitions.

145
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,110
What's the difference?

146
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,173
You have to be able to define...

147
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,978
who you are in the world
by what you do.

148
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:38,182
What I like to do
defines who I am.

149
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,383
Doesn't that make me
a richer person?

150
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,791
You still have to be better at it
than others.

151
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,895
Something's wrong.

152
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,401
Something's wrong
with these buildings.

153
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,699
They refuse all physical contact
with each other.

154
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:01,001
You're always
say something clever

155
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,715
to avoid really talking.

156
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:08,483
Every night, flat ghosts
slide in and out of these gaps.

157
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,486
And wander about the city...

158
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,328
They wander about the city,

159
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,993
scaring the people shitless.

160
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,592
The authorities
fill in the gaps with concrete,

161
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,896
but the buildings
keep moving apart,

162
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,515
letting the flat creatures
take over.

163
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,207
I could make them
out of paper.

164
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,978
All right, what's the matter?

165
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm listening.

166
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,325
I'm ready
for a dramatic conversation.

167
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,385
with flashbacks
and a big climax...

168
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,792
You've stopped
listening already.

169
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,399
You're the one who's 'dramatic'!

170
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,796
I'm listening.

171
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,709
But we're talking a lot.

172
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,723
That's not true!

173
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,394
Maybe you're right.

174
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,993
I don't think I know
what I'm doing.

175
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,001
What, here?

176
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,903
No, in general.

177
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,617
You take things too seriously.

178
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,483
Where's your sense of humor?

179
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,392
There are
these two poisonous snakes.

180
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,099
One says to the other.

181
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,902
'We're poisonous, aren't we?'

182
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,509
So the other one says

183
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,704
'Of course we are.
Why do you ask?'

184
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,682
And the first snake says

185
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,686
'I've just bitten my tongue!'

186
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,295
<i>PART-TIME JOB AVAILABLE
WRAPPING PURCHASES</i>

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,407
A part-time job.

188
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,305
We could work here.

189
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,412
No, they'll pay peanuts!

190
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,015
It'd take two weeks
to pay off the parking fine!

191
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,177
Wait till you find a real job.

192
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,786
I want to keep busy.

193
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,022
Anyway, I have no ambition.

194
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,789
so it's a perfect job for me.
Come on!

195
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,770
I did it without thinking
and got the job.

196
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,177
Only you, Akira?

197
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,285
But Hiroko's dog was great.

198
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,977
They are stupid.

199
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,486
It wasn't great.

200
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,884
And it was a cat.

201
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,127
You're better off
doing something else.

202
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,829
I won't work there long.

203
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,390
How long do you
plan to stay here?

204
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:47,094
- We haven't really...
- We saw a nice place today.

205
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,299
We have a good chance
of getting it.

206
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,311
Yes, a really good chance!

207
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,175
Where?

208
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
Tokyo...

209
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,336
No boyfriends, no pets.

210
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,599
Is there anyone
who actually checks?

211
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,484
Don't wrap two together.

212
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,588
Hello.

213
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,691
There seem to be some residents
already living here!

214
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,982
<i>FRIDAY NOVEMBER 16TH</i>

215
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,287
<i>CLOSED UNTIL FRIDAY NOVEMBER 16TH</i>

216
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,477
<i>CAR No 55M46-51 TOWED AWAY
TO MUNICIPAL POUND</i>

217
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,687
So I wrap nine boxes
with just one roll of paper.

218
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,527
But she says I should do eleven.

219
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,588
How am I supposed to do that?
Even ten is impossible.

220
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,595
What's the matter?

221
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,999
The car was stolen today.

222
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,298
What?

223
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,200
All our equipment was in it.

224
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,606
What about the screening?

225
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,514
I'm screwed!

226
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,516
No, you're not.

227
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,881
Yesterday, I moved everything
into the apartment.

228
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,489
I didn't like leaving it out there.

229
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,889
Akemi was upset
so I forgot to tell you.

230
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,090
Great thinking!

231
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,697
The smoke machine too?

232
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,599
I just told you.
There's the 15,000-yen fine

233
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,045
plus a 14,000-yen towing fee.

234
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,874
I don't have 29,000 yen. But
I need my things from the car.

235
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:57,480
Can you take me to it
so I can get my stuff?

236
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,683
Not until you pay the money.

237
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,794
We're open until six.

238
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,691
It's still my car!

239
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,890
Not until you pay the money,
it's not.

240
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,293
Let's just say
there's 29,000 yen in the car.

241
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,042
If you just show me where it is

242
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,745
I can get the money and pay you.

243
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,308
What do you say?

244
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,886
What'll happen to it
if I don't pay?

245
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,192
Make? Color?

246
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,793
Year?

247
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,589
Thank you.

248
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,291
I hate him. He's a cavity!

249
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,999
He's got bad teeth?

250
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,196
No, I mean he's a cavity himself.

251
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,307
Last year
he caught pneumonia.

252
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,976
Too bad,
he has a good doctor!

253
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,278
All that stuff?

254
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,684
Here you go!
Put it in here, please.

255
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,293
Where shall I put this?

256
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,586
Look!

257
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,806
<i>There are so many lives

258
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,988
<i>Assuming we haven't
destroyed ourselves first.</i>

259
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,584
<i>we could live on.</i>

260
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,589

261
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,703

00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,501
<i>at the edge of the event horizon.</i>

263
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:43,977
<i>then tossed in
all our nuclear waste...</i>

264
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,504
Great! I've never seen smoke
used like that in a film before.

265
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,203
No, Lucy.

266
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,616
It's the first time smoke's been
used that way 'outside' a film.

267
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,280
Using smoke 'inside' films
is so common.

268
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,083
I want to force
the audience's involvement

269
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,283
by breaking through
the surface of the screen.

270
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,894
The audience shouldn't feel safe.

271
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,891
Pleased to meet you.

272
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,892
It got to me, eh?

273
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,896
You should come
to my office sometime.

274
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,806
We usually do advertising
for medical products.

275
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,708
But we get more
creative sometimes.

276
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,277
Thanks.

277
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,580
I'll think about it. I'm
considering a few options right now.

278
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,391
Nice work! Pretty funny.

279
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,083
Really?

280
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,495
Being funny is the hardest.

281
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,692
I'm going for a beer.

282
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,001
Excuse me.

283
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,300
- I'll pass this on.
- Thank you.

284
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,009
You should be in films.

285
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,203
Come off it! Not me.

286
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,075
- Were you in the film?
- That's not me.

287
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:31,883
I'm more in transportation.
I helped with the editing too.

288
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:37,086
- Are you a filmmaker too?
- No, I'm just the girlfriend.

289
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,196
You must be a good one.

290
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,196
Relationships with artists
are tough.

291
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,392
They can be demanding.

292
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,102
I once went out with a painter.
He was always working

293
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,800
or talking about his work.
I felt invisible.

294
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:56,277
But when he had an opening,
with all those people.

295
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:01,283
I realized his art was more
important than my problems.

296
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,370
You said
they'd be out tonight.

297
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,381
Not so loud.

298
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:37,181
I told them you were coming.
I thought they'd understand.

299
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,589
Apparently not! One extra
person is bad enough, but two...

300
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,888
Don't say that.

301
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,898
They're my friends.
I have to help them.

302
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,197
They're just
taking advantage of you.

303
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,706
You're not helping them.
All you're doing is indulging them.

304
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:01,904
Your 'friend' doesn't think he has
to work because he's an 'artist'.

305
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,379
My uncle won't hire him.

306
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,882
He thinks he's an idiot.

307
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,877
Akira's not an idiot.
He's even got a job.

308
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,785
Hiroko is the problem.

309
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,791
She just hangs around all day

310
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,090
cutting pictures
out of my magazines.

311
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,290
Cold.

312
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,789
What the...

313
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,400
Did you see that?

314
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,810
<i>Dear Akira</i>

315
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:47,582

317
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:59,786

318
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,398
<i>Or maybe by now</i>

319
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,900
<i>you're a big-shot director.</i>

320
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,395
<i>Or perhaps</i>

321
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,204
<i>you're in advertising.</i>

322
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,102
<i>I wonder what
happened to the car.</i>

323
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,876
<i>I hope that someone
is having a good time with it.</i>

324
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,183
<i>I wonder how Akemi's doing.</i>

325
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:28,088
And guys show up,
so scary...

326
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:45,903
<i>I tried to fold this letter
into an elegant yacht,</i>

327
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,774
<i>but I got it totally wrong.</i>

328
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:54,783
<i>You know
how useless I am at origami.</i>

329
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,589
<i>As for me.</i>

330
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:08,194
<i>living between the buildings
with the ghosts.</i>

331
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,297
<i>Just kidding!</i>

332
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,608
<i>My life isn't that extraordinary.</i>

333
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,881
<i>I'm fine.</i>

334
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,485
<i>That's all
I wanted to tell you, really.</i>

335
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,074
<i>And I'm doing</i>

336
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,178
<i>all the things</i>

337
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,186
<i>I ever wanted to do.</i>

338
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,185
<i>In fact</i>

339
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:10,886
<i>I've never in all my life</i>

340
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,395
<i>felt so useful.</i>

341
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,297
That guy!

342
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:05,893
- Who is that guy?
- He's 'The Creature from the Sewer.'

343
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,397
Hey!

344
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,298
Somebody help!

345
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,002
He's the Creature from the Sewer.

346
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,405
He's coming.

347
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,480
Run!

348
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,280
Please call the cop!

349
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,088
Call the police!

350
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,095
Get him, get him!

351
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,493
Tokyo is afraid.

352
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:28,005
Who is this creature who for
the past 2 weeks has been

353
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,979
terrifying citizens all over
Tokyo and then vanishing?

354
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:38,482
The media are calling him
'The Creature from the Sewers.'

355
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,785
A few shocked eyewitnesses

356
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:47,193
have managed to film him
on their cell phones.

357
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,001
Just watch, Mr. Nomoto...

358
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,103
His gait

359
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,400
his insane beard

360
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,906
his milky eye...

361
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,876
<i>I wanted to run away too</i>

362
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:10,783
<i>but I was so scared,
I couldn't move.</i>

363
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:17,190
<i>He came towards me...
and then he... he licked me.</i>

364
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,701
<i>He was disgusting...</i>

365
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,305
<i>Sorry.</i>

366
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,508
<i>His eye was like this</i>

367
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,509
<i>his beard went like this</i>

368
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:41,574
<i>and he walked like this...</i>

369
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,688
<i>I was so afraid...</i>

370
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,387
<i>He was walking like this...</i>

371
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,494
<i>And smoking like that...</i>

372
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,589
The police are still searching
the sewers and underground.

373
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,000
There.

374
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,380
There he is.

375
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,185
Don't move!

376
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,597
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

377
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,600

389
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,993
<i>Under interrogation

390

<i>All he eats is flowers,</i>

<i>symbol of the imperial family.</i>

<i>in footage

407
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,401
- There!
- Here! Here!

408
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,097
- Mr. Voland!
- Please say something!

409
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,705
Mr. Voland!

410

00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,680
Sir.

<i>Mr. Hirokishi would like to know</i>

415
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:57,691
<i>I asked him if he realized
that it's likely he'll be hanged.</i>

416
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,606
And what did he reply?

417
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,173
He said, 'No, I don't want to.'

418
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,586
Did you ask him his name?

419
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:26,293
<i>He said, 'Call me Merde.' Which sounds
very like the French word 'merde'.</i>

<i>Merde?</i>

421
00:59:28,289 --> 00:59:30,082
Shit

422
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:40,209
<i>Following the Merde case,
the Japanese government</i>

423
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:43,574
<i>to toughen
immigration regulations.</i>

424
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,982
<i>Inside Japan,
there have been attacks</i>

425

<i>Mr. Merde,
whose trial will start tomorrow,</i>

427
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,793
<i>will be defended
by the French lawyer Mr. Voland.</i>

428
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,990
<i>one of the only
three people in the world.</i>

429
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,899
<i>who can speak
the same language as Mr. Merde.</i>

430
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:14,909
<i>Mr. Voland has already declared
that he will plead insanity</i>

431
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,275
<i>and irresponsibility
at the time of the offense.</i>

432
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:30,491
Let us move on to the motive
for this heinous act

433
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,892
if such a motive can exist.

434
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,698
Could you tell us

435
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:42,897
why you took the lives
of so many innocent people?

436
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,485
<i>'I don't like innocent people.'</i>

437
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,185
<i>'I don't like people.'</i>

438
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:11,698
So what...
you're going to kill us all?

439
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,098
Wouldn't it have been simpler

440
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:19,607
since you like no one,
for you to kill yourself?

441
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,885
<i>'But I love life, imbecile!'</i>

442
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,691
What?

443
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,486
Silence!

444
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,587
Silence!

445
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:47,602
Maitre, instruct your client
the court will not be insulted!

446
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:52,197
At least modern terrorists
have the decency

447
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,206
to blow themselves up
with their victims.

448
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,183
<i>'And among all people,</i>

449

<i>the Japanese are really
the most disgusting.'</i>

450
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,195
Disgusting?

451
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:18,299
I understand now.

452
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,803
You should know that in Japan,

453
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:24,498
we don't really like
racist foreigners.

454
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,701
Besides,
nobody forced you to come

455
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,972
and live in our country!

456
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,289
<i>'Yes. My god did.'</i>

457
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:04,771
<i>'My god always places me</i>

458
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,416
<i>among the people

459
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,317
<i>'It's the cross I have to bear.'</i>

460
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,692
So I ask you, Mr. Merde.

461
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:25,699
what do you have
against the Japanese?

462
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,282
<i>'They live way too long.'</i>

463
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,083
<i>'And their eyes are shaped
like a woman's sex.'</i>

464
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,192
<i>'It's totally disgusting.'</i>

465
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:05,499
Silence!

466
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:15,684
And Mr. Merde thinks
that 'he' is quite appealing?

467
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:36,897
<i>'I don't know.
But if I knew, I'd answer yes.'</i>

468
01:04:54,023 --> 01:05:00,792
<i>I've never looked at myself.
My god forbids mirrors.'</i>

469
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,698
<i>'But my mother,
who was gorgeous</i>

470
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,599
<i>used to say
I was a pretty little boy.'</i>

471
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,872
Well...

472
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:25,079
then your mother...
sorely deceived you, Mr. Merde!

473
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:50,772
<i>He won't talk to you anymore.
He says, 'It's not interesting.'</i>

474
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,899
<i>'My mother was a saint!'</i>

475
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,199
<i>'You all...</i>

476
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:18,796

01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:23,173
<i>'And I am your son!'</i>

478
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,584
Warders!

479
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,081
Make the defendant sit!

480
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,393
Silence!

481
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:51,701
Defendant, do you understand
that you risk the death penalty?

482
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,170
'No.'I don't want that.
'I'm against it.'

483
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:42,180
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

484
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:48,593
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

485
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:54,897
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

486
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:59,701
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

487
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:06,179
Free Merde! Free Merde!

488
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:13,084
Free Merde! Free Merde!

489
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:19,786
Free Merde! Free Merde!

490
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:28,094
<i>Today, the Pope condemned
Mr. Merde's appalling crimes.</i>

491
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:33,698
<i>In Japan, ultra-nationalists
are violently demonstrating</i>

492
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,777
<i>to demand the death penalty.</i>

493
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:43,278
<i>But in the eyes of many
Mr. Merde has become a star.</i>

494
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,900
<i>The trial's outcome
will be announced tomorrow.</i>

495
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:08,604
<i>CONDEMNED TO DEATH!</i>

496
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:18,483
<i>THREE YEARS LATER</i>

497
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:56,885
<i>He wants you to warn your client
he'll be hanged in an hour.</i>

498
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,392
<i>He said, 'No.'</i>

499
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:16,168
<i>Ask him what he wants
for his last meal.</i>

500
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,884
<i>'Flowers... and cash.'</i>

501
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,197
<i>He's asking for a last cigarette.</i>

502
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,780
<i>Non smoking</i>

503
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,374
What's he doing?

504
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,082
He's praying.

505
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,805
Execute.

506
01:13:58,734 --> 01:13:59,996
Dead.

507
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,975
- It's over.
- Yes.

508
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,880
It's over.

509
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,793
<i>The sky has grown old.</i>

510
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,282
He's gone!

511
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,799
<i>Coming soon:
the adventures of Mr. Merde in NY</i>

<i>MERDE IN USA</i>

<i>Directed by Leos Carax</i>

514
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:46,094
<i>How long will it take
before this circle disappears?</i>

515
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,704
<i>10 seconds, 10 minutes,</i>

516
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,003
<i>10 hours, 10 days,</i>

517
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,169
<i>10 months, 10 years...</i>

518
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,574
<i>I've been living in this house
for 10 years.</i>

519
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,987
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

520
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:24,704
<i>Usually, hikikomoris live
at the expense of their parents.</i>

521
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,707
<i>but I live alone.</i>

522
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,278
<i>Defecating with the door open,
I don't care.</i>

523
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,677
<i>Falling asleep while defecating,</i>

524
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,578
<i>I don't care.</i>

525
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,185
<i>Strangely,
I don't watch television.</i>

526
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,289
<i>When was the last time
I watched it?</i>

527
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:52,097
<i>However,
I feed myself every day.</i>

528
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,898
<i>I don't need a table.</i>

529
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,876
<i>Those who are sensitive
would have noticed,</i>

530
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,977
<i>but my own way of tidying up,
practiced for 10 years</i>

531
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:10,084
<i>has now reached
the level of art.</i>

532
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,984
<i>It's hard to believe,</i>

533
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,291
<i>but I have read all these books.</i>

534
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:31,402
<i>Lately, reading magazines about
climbing, fishing and travelling</i>

535
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,108
<i>suddenly makes me miss home.</i>

536
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:42,182
<i>I never get into the room
that my father used.</i>

537
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,681
<i>The envelope of money
my father sends.</i>

538
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,483
<i>I open it every month.</i>

539
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:53,993
<i>The first year
money came with a letter.</i>

540
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,493
<i>For the next 9 years</i>

541
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,293
<i>only money.</i>

542
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,797
<i>Brand new crisp banknotes.</i>

543
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,098
<i>How exciting.</i>

544
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:12,280
<i>With money and a telephone,
everything is OK</i>

545
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,382
<i>as everything
can be delivered.</i>

546
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:18,179
<i>The bell is ringing. I open the door.</i>

547
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,584
<i>I take. I give.</i>

548
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:21,984
<i>I close the door.</i>

549
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,692
<i>With the delivery men.</i>

550
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,490
<i>I never make eye contact.</i>

551
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,897
<i>On Saturdays, I always order a pizza.</i>

552
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:39,501
So you never look at
people's faces?

553
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:40,699
<i>Right.</i>

554
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,771
<i>I hated having contact
with people.</i>

555
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,483
<i>I hated having contact
with the sunlight too.</i>

556
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,298
<i>I like watching the sunlight.</i>

557
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,269
<i>I can see it...</i>

558
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,379
<i>The movement of the sunlight.</i>

559
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,684
<i>Others may not</i>

560
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:36,989
<i>but I can even see
the hour hand moving.</i>

561
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,103
<i>Everything is moving.</i>

562
01:20:52,414 --> 01:21:00,185
<i>It has been 10 years
since I last moved.</i>

563
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,001
<i>It has been 11 years</i>

564
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:24,073
<i>living in the house.</i>

565
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,983
<i>Strictly speaking.</i>

566
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,582
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

567
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,589
<i>I digest better.</i>

568
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,599
<i>When I fall asleep
on the toilet</i>

569
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,205
<i>I have sweet dreams.</i>

570
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,673
<i>The reading continues.</i>

571
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,477
<i>The smell of my father...</i>

572
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,780
<i>Saturday is pizza day.</i>

573
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,890
<i>With the delivery men,
I don't make any...</i>

574
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,001
<i>The first eye contact in 11 years.</i>

575
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:21,982
Excuse me...

576
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,895
Buttons?

577
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:59,382
C, o, m...

578
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:05,283
Coma.

579
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,488
Did you push it?

580
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,491
- Yes.
- You did?

581
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,406
There's a mistake.

582
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,876
The eighth one from the floor.

583
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,282
On the right.

584
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,802
This place is really perfect.

585
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:23,993
This smell is really awful.

586
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,087
<i>Because of the shock,
for 2 days,</i>

587
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,984
<i>I couldn't do anything.</i>

588
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,690
<i>Even if I don't do anything
to start with.</i>

589
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:12,772
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

590
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:20,881
<i>It's shaking.</i>

591
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,791
Pizza's End?

592
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,786
How dare you answer me?

593
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,585
I'm not joking, cut the crap.

594
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:02,093
A guy like you, I'll cut off
both his hands and feet

595
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,698
to make sashimi.

596
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:20,180
Bring me some water.

597
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,081
It's me.

598
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,290
Don't hang up.

599
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:37,092
The weather is dull
and I wasn't in a good mood.

600
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,197
Sorry.

601
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,996
I said I'm sorry, punk!

602
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,800
You're really getting
on my nerves.

603
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,572
You're not even good
at delivering

604
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,578
and who do you think
you're talking to!

605
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:58,276
I paid your two-weeks salary
you should be grateful.

606
01:30:58,419 --> 01:30:59,784
Are you trying to say
you are hurt?

607
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:05,188
Well, I am hurt as much as you.
Cut the crap, punk!

608
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:09,695
I am much more introvert than
you are! Moron!

609
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:13,791
Excuse me...

610
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:19,299
The girl who is working at
your place...

611
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,171
Is it her day off today?

612
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:27,676
Who?

613
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,078
Pale complexion...

614
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:36,388
Garter belt...

615
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:40,393
Buttons...

616
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,897
She's my wife.

617
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,600
Just kidding.

618
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,472
She also quit yesterday.

619
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:01,973
She stopped delivering?

620
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:04,175
This is really perfect...

621
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:13,691
The little one said...

622
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,389
she'd never come out again.

623
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,494
You must be all crazy.

624
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,801
She had been working for
some time.

625
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,675
Where does she live?

626
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,777
3 Daizawa, I think.

627
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:39,881
Don't bother about the pizza.

628
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,597
<i>When a hikikomori</i>

629

<i>wants to meet a hikikomori</i>

01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,294
<i>there is only one way.</i>

631
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,701
<i>What a blinding light.</i>

632
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:45,274
<i>It's so hot.</i>

633
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:51,579
<i>I hate sweating.</i>

634
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,287
<i>Why did I come out?</i>

635
01:34:55,923 --> 01:35:00,485
<i>Right.</i>

636
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:02,596
<i>I'm going... Where?</i>

637
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,994
<i>To the left.</i>

638
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:09,091
<i>The subway station...</i>

639
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,498
<i>No, the bus is better.</i>

640
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:15,507
<i>3 Daizawa...</i>

641
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:19,070
<i>Right, I don't have any money.</i>

642
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:23,172
<i>Nobody must see me.</i>

643
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:24,579
<i>Where do I have to go?</i>

644
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,689
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

645
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:31,986
<i>Great.</i>

646
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:36,290
<i>This...</i>

647
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:38,591
<i>Passing by Sangenjaya...</i>

648
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:42,191
<i>Come on...</i>

649
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,896
<i>I can ride this...</i>

650
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:52,571
<i>I can be there in 30 minutes.</i>

651
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:56,376
<i>Whatever, Let's go.</i>

652
01:35:56,517 --> 01:36:00,681
<i>Let's walk.</i>

653
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:05,588
<i>Off we go.</i>

654
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:09,396
<i>Good. Full steam ahead.</i>

655
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,575
Excuse me. I would...

656
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:31,787
<i>They all went back in.</i>

657
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:40,900
<i>All of them.</i>

658
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,380
<i>This man...</i>

659
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:59,392
<i>I was like him 5 years ago.</i>

660
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,893
<i>For her, it must
have been 10 years...</i>

661
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:06,490
<i>15 years?</i>

662
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:15,772
<i>This guy is a rookie.</i>

663
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:20,373
<i>As for her...</i>

664
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,605
Come out, please.

665
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,174
Quick, come out.

666
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,282
If you don't come out now

667
01:41:05,926 --> 01:41:07,689
you never will.

668
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,298
Listen to me.

669
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:18,302
Open the door!

670
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:21,602
At least, tell me your name.

671
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,480
It's collapsing!

672
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,090
It's collapsing!

673
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:42,789
Come out!

674
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,696
Everybody, come out!

675
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:51,902
Come out!

676
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:57,171
What is she waiting for?

677
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:30,803
Don't go back.

678
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:37,968
Don't touch me!

679
01:43:40,914 --> 01:43:42,279
Don't go back in.

680
01:44:00,534 --> 01:44:01,796
I pushed it.

681
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,574
It's shaking.
