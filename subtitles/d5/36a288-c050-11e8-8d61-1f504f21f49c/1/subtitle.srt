1
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm coming, I'm so sorry...

2
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,054
I have just gone for pissing,
I'm so sorry!

3
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:28,196
Where the hell has boss gone?
So many cars are queuing up!

4
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,890
How can I finish all these?

5
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,132
Kiddy, I will give you $20 dollars.

6
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,571
Park this car for me, OK?

7
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:42,542
Twenty dollars?

8
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,872
How about I give you two hundred
and you fix the queue for me?

9
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:46,371
Shit! A traffic police is coming!

10
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,383
Damn it! I'd better run!

11
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,947
Sir, I'm sorry, the cars are going
to be driven away!

12
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,782
If you can make it by yourself,
just do it.

13
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,289
One minute.

14
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,266
Sir, aren't you giving us face?
Just one minute, OK?

15
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,869
That's right! Why not
be a little bit nice?

16
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,265
Alright, just one minute.

17
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,128
What are you doing here?

18
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,460
You can't park your car right here.

19
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,468
You are too comy!
Please don't fine me, OK?

20
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:41,831
Sir, go ahead!

21
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:46,600
Boss, where have you been?
I can't manage all these by myself!

22
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:48,571
I went to look for my woman!

23
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,803
Got her or not?

24
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,273
It's shit!

25
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:56,116
We quarreled this morning,
then she went away with our son.

26
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,481
What the hell!

27
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:03,517
It's Ruby, I've found your honey now.

28
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,489
Where the hell has she gone?

29
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,124
Do you want a talk?

30
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,192
Sure...

31
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:14,199
Let daddy use it for a while,
come on.

32
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:20,401
Well, I won't drink again.

33
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,009
I won't go to disco anymore, OK?

34
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,510
But you would fool around
in some place else.

35
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,180
Come on!

36
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,872
Please give me a break!

37
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,110
I knew you two so well!

38
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,880
Your son is already 2 years old,
but you two are still like kids.

39
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,290
You should thank Ruby.

40
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:39,384
If now were her honey lips,
I would have left you.

41
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,628
Thank you.

42
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:44,291
Why not find her a boyfriend?

43
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,095
Good idea! I know two men,

44
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,133
one is called Sun-sa,
one is called Gutsy Chuen.

45
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,236
Which one do you like?

46
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,736
Save that for your God-mother!

47
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,137
It's hard to find a nice guy now.

48
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:53,601
I'm one.

49
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,041
Why don't you marry me too?
Let's go to the registry tomorrow,

50
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,669
so, we will have a sweet family.

51
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,448
Good idea! Ruby is my best friend,

52
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,279
I won't let you court any
other woman, except Ruby.

53
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,019
Come on! Please cut the bull shit!

54
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:11,825
Sai-fai.

55
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,895
Cheung-dee, what's the matter?

56
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:15,696
Who is staying with Prince?

57
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,589
There're 5 people
inside the VIP room.

58
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,700
But I think there is
a gang waiting outside.

59
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:21,268
I can tell from their gesticulations
that they are a gang.

60
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,335
Is that anything wrong?

61
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:23,733
What's the matter? Anything wrong?

62
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,001
I don't know, I'm going to take look.

63
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:27,201
Take care.

64
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:28,874
This place is under my supervision.

65
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,886
Crazy Ball, the Police has got
enough evidence to nail you.

66
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,388
How dare you fool around
instead of hiding up?

67
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:47,861
That's why I'd like
you to pay your debt.

68
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,955
Just three million,
I haven't added interest.

69
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,665
I've given you face, you know?

70
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,500
I have nothing but guts.

71
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,434
I will not pay except on the
gambling table, are you green?

72
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:01,769
I know your old man
is the boss of Hung Tai,

73
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:03,275
but this doesn't mean you can
refuse to pay your debt.

74
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,674
The whole district is under
the supervision of Hung Tai Group.

75
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,477
You're sitting at the turf
of Hung Tai too.

76
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:08,778
I love doing what I want,

77
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,112
so what?

78
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,587
You should pay your bill
before leaving.

79
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,969
Are you crazy? How dare you
pull off a stunt in my place?

80
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:34,933
You would end up going
into fugitive, you know?

81
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,979
Right! So I'm planning to run,
and I want to leave tonight.

82
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:44,843
Call you damn father Mei
to pay me five million.

83
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:47,786
Otherwise, I will cut off
your flesh piece by piece.

84
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:49,249
Take him away.

85
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:05,499
Something's wrong, right?

86
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:10,578
Don't bother your man
from working, let's go.

87
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:26,293
You...

88
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,444
I can't make it.

89
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,553
I can't run!
Run!

90
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,726
Ruby, I'm not leaving,
take care of my son.

91
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,461
Cindy, no! Cindy!

92
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,838
Cindy!

93
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,874
Police! Freeze!

94
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,313
Cops are around. Let's run...

95
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,027
Cindy, how are you?

96
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,731
Mom...

97
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:50,575
My name is Cheung-dee,

98
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,172
I've been a rascal for five years,
always want to be a gang leader.

99
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:58,116
I saved Prince, and thus
made me become a gang leader.

100
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,858
But, what I couldn't imagine is that.

101
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:08,820
being a leading light isn't as
gorgeous as what you see in movies.

102
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:21,738
Yip... Do you have any pain-killer?

103
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,274
Shut up, someone has
come to pay your bail.

104
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,543
Thank you...

105
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,047
Cheung-dee, this way.

106
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:36,748
Madam, this's the file of Cheung-dee.

107
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,059
Sir, do you have...

108
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,291
You had a fight
in a nightclub last night,

109
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,128
Fat Chow is in hospital.

110
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:49,294
I thought I was beaten.

111
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,802
This is Sandy Leung, your lawyer.

112
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,745
Sign the paper and
you can leave now.

113
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,076
You are charged with assault.

114
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,441
You want me to sign
anything you asked?

115
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,710
Do you have any name card?
Show me first.

116
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,686
Sandy Leung.

117
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,419
Barrister? Take it back.

118
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:17,221
My classmate is used to
pay you bail, he is on leave now.

119
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,127
This time, I think you'll
be in deep trouble.

120
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,670
I always have trouble, please...

121
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,395
fix this as soon as possible,
I want a sleep.

122
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:28,404
No, Tai-hung's teacher wants to
see you! At twelve, please.

123
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,134
You go for me, OK?

124
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,913
No, his teacher wants to see
you this time, personally!

125
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,813
This is shit!

126
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,111
Miss...

127
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,154
can you disguise as me
and meet my son's teacher?

128
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:42,723
Would you do me a favour?

129
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,154
Please.

130
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:57,031
Mr. Wai, Wai Tai-hung's
done well in school.

131
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,231
But I notice that he has
violent inclination.

132
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:02,171
Once he disagrees with someone,
He'll fight.

133
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:06,775
Why do you fight?

134
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:09,710
He said you are bad.

135
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,149
Kids will fight
when they are challenged.

136
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:15,722
Especially his classmate
insulted me, you see?

137
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,226
Come on!

138
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,855
Please teach you little students
to behave well.

139
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:24,862
Any lighter?

140
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,557
You can't smoke here.

141
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:28,833
Are you sick?

142
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:31,903
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,007
Damn it! You are Dicky Keung!

144
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:43,308
Prince called for me?
What's the matter?

145
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:48,088
Lion King? That scum!

146
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,622
He is a betrayer!
We'd give him a good lesson.

147
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:51,782
Of course.

148
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:53,427
It's alright, call Gutsy Chuen
to gather enough fellows.

149
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:54,995
I will kill him, I swear.

150
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,062
I remember that.

151
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,633
I will take my son
there as soon as possible.

152
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:00,894
Deal.

153
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:06,697
Where were we?

154
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:12,872
The kids... said you are bad...

155
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,613
In fact,
I think they've wrong concept...

156
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:23,047
What? I don't look like a bad guy.

157
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,619
But I like the teachers here.

158
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,387
I think she'll be understanding
to be educated here.

159
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:35,896
Ruby, what kind of school is it?

160
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,434
Why can't I see any student here?

161
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,505
You son is punished
to stay behind school.

162
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:41,835
Right.

163
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:46,246
Cheung-dee, I think you'd stay
more time with your son.

164
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,579
Tai-hung is quite eccentric.

165
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:52,383
Isn't her?

166
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:54,783
Lady, I have to work.

167
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,286
In these years,
you seem to be gorgeous.

168
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,754
Everynight, you enjoy much.

169
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,258
But you can't make much money.

170
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,261
You son's growing up.

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,991
He needs your company.

172
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,496
As your wife's best friend,
I don't think I can do much.

173
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:13,807
I know, but I'm the boss.

174
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,609
I've to attend
many business parties.

175
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:20,074
And, the VCD factory held by
Prince and me is making big money.

176
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:21,012
Right...

177
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,378
- We have a new production...
- What?

178
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,817
named "Lustful nanny, baby creep",
do you want to watch it?

179
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:28,013
No! Don't show your son
any bad things.

180
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,179
You are so bad.

181
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,122
May I take you to the birthday party?

182
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:53,371
Where is Uncle Mei?

183
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,277
Meeting...

184
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,510
Not sleeping... No sleeping...

185
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:57,744
Thank you.

186
00:14:58,788 --> 00:14:59,880
Drink?

187
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,450
Water...

188
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:06,960
Thank you.

189
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:10,363
You stay here with the kids,
I'm going up for a business talk, OK?

190
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,664
I dislike this place.

191
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:18,298
Why not? There's swimming pool,
and you have snacks.

192
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,738
So many children will play with you.

193
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:24,102
There are rabbits, ducks,
everything's so cute!

194
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,947
I really dislike this place.

195
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,345
I don't care, anyway,
you'll wait for me right here.

196
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,609
Cheung-dee.

197
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,681
Why are you so late?
They are all inside.

198
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,588
I'm sorry, I took the minibus,
that's why I came late.

199
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,025
Say hello to auntie, come on.

200
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:42,355
How are you, auntie?

201
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,021
It's all right, help yourself to
any food you like, OK?

202
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,231
Speak up or not? Speak up...

203
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:52,799
Uncle Mei.

204
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:58,239
Brother Pao-wing, Prince,
Uncle Pui, Uncle Fatty, hi!

205
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:00,046
Go to hell!

206
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,358
To hell with you!

207
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:15,795
Let me do it.

208
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:18,532
You bastard! Speak up or not?

209
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,769
To hell with you!

210
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:24,202
Speak up or not?
I would kill you, I swear!

211
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:28,771
Pao-wing, his mouth is stuffed,
how can he tell you?

212
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,910
Kid, if you want to say,
just nod you head.

213
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:34,979
Otherwise he would kill you!

214
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,245
Nod now?

215
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,284
Where will Lion King go tonight?

216
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,723
If I tell you, He'll kill me too.

217
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,995
If you don't tell us,
you'll die at once.

218
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:49,856
Uncle Fatty has just
told you the truth.

219
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:51,489
Creep like you
deserve to be sent to hell!

220
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,567
How can you work for such betrayer?

221
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:57,401
Brother Cheung-dee, I have a family.

222
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,402
Save you breath and cut the crap.
Let's shoot him to death.

223
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:01,474
Come on, hold him...

224
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,011
No! Don't kill me!

225
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,444
Brother Prince, please let me go!
Don't kill me!

226
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:09,040
Forget it! He is our fellow anyway.

227
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,252
Kid, you know very well that,

228
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,854
Lion King took 200 fellows of mine
to join the Tung Sing Group.

229
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:22,422
We lost face, you know?

230
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,333
If you confess now,
you can be rewarded instead.

231
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,166
I will pay you $300,000, cash.

232
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:32,206
And a ticket to Taiwan.

233
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,839
You can then take your family
there some months later.

234
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,877
And start a new life,
isn't that good idea?

235
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,943
Confess now!
Uncle Mei is so kind to you!

236
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:49,087
He'll collect a debt at the
Poultry Market at 3 p.m.

237
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,550
Good!

238
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,823
My place is dirtied!

239
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,559
- Bury him!
- Yes.

240
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:05,105
Three p.m. at the poultry market?

241
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,105
Who will do it?

242
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,699
How about Cheung-dee?
He is the best.

243
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:13,204
Good idea, Cheung-dee is the
best fighter in our group.

244
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,806
After killing Lion King,
He'll gain fame again.

245
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:26,857
Happy birthday to you...

246
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,860
I know he has lots of fellows.

247
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:33,998
But they pushed me to do it,
I can't refuse it.

248
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,363
Anyways, get me
some men and weapons.

249
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:37,802
Wait for me at the
poultry market, OK?

250
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,132
Make a birthday wish!
Bravo!

251
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:47,040
Let's cut the birthday cake, come on!

252
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:50,016
What's the matter?

253
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,482
Let's go.

254
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:55,346
Good boy, you stay here,
I have to work.

255
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:57,350
OK?

256
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,222
I will ask Ruby to pick you up, OK?

257
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:01,618
Cheung-dee.

258
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,594
- You're going to be rich!
- Really?

259
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,527
Well, when will we get the bonus?

260
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:09,696
Very soon!

261
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,568
Come on, I'm in need of money...

262
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,835
Woo woo woo! You always
pretend to be poor! You bastard!

263
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,146
Be good,

264
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:25,218
when I finish my work,
I will buy you a superman.

265
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,152
Dad, you'd be very careful.

266
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,150
I know!

267
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,147
Who are you?

268
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:03,015
My daddy is Cheung-dee.

269
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,656
My daddy said
your daddy is a dog!

270
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,291
No!

271
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,557
I said, you daddy is a dog!

272
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:13,993
No!

273
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:21,765
My daddy said your daddy
is a dog! A dog which eats shit!

274
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:28,008
You daddy eats shit...

275
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,377
Can you go now? You're a trouble!

276
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,612
I'm almost ready, wait!

277
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,131
That bastard hasn't come yet.

278
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,870
Bastard! Someone is going to die!
Would you hurry up?

279
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,270
Cut the crap!
Let's go.

280
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,206
This is shit!

281
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:12,821
Isn't that Brother Cheung-dee?

282
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,422
Hey, Lion King, why are you here?

283
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,259
I've been informed that

284
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,129
Uncle Mei asked you to kill me.

285
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,461
Are you kidding me?
No, it's not true.

286
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:23,002
- Not true?
- No!

287
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,935
You really have guts to come alone.

288
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:25,903
- No!
- Come to kill me now.

289
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:28,303
My daddy said your daddy
is a dog which eats shit!

290
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,306
How about fight with me?

291
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:30,901
You bastard!

292
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:31,842
Kill me!

293
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:33,241
Bastard!

294
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,588
Kill him!

295
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:44,951
Beat him up...

296
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,624
Stay where you are!

297
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:52,731
Beat him...

298
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,475
How dare you run!

299
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:13,183
Peter, charge up...

300
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,592
Beat him...

301
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:23,697
Why do you fight? Get up...

302
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,866
How dare you fight?
Are you a good fighter?

303
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:37,042
Boss.

304
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:39,745
It's fixed.

305
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:42,244
You will take the prize.

306
00:22:57,366 --> 00:23:00,164
Brother Prince,
they are no match for me.

307
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:03,568
We have got nerves...

308
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:06,172
Chuen followed me...
Come on... take a seat.

309
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,971
Chuen followed me to tail them...

310
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:11,442
We scared the shit out of them!

311
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:12,605
Ruby, come here!

312
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,380
What's the matter, Brother Prince?

313
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:19,986
What's wrong with you to bring
such monsters to me?

314
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:21,587
I just want you to keep me company.

315
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:23,054
I don't mind staying with you now.

316
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:25,921
I worry that you'll lose your temper
for I'm not going to entertain you.

317
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:29,791
It's easy, just do it.

318
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:31,998
No way! I won't sleep with
my clients, you know that!

319
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,292
And, Brother Prince
won't like me too.

320
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:37,428
Why do you work here as a mamasan?
Why not be my woman?

321
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:39,336
You'll be rich and famous, you know?

322
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,505
I'm not as attractive as
the little girls!

323
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,772
They are young and fresh.

324
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:47,778
Really? Let me check.

325
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:49,177
This one ... Look at this!

326
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,716
I think this's better, this's better.

327
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:54,879
Brother Prince,
this is good for screwing!

328
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,882
If you have guts to screw her,
just go ahead.

329
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,856
Of course I have guts! Boss.

330
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:01,054
I have guts to kill,
how come I dare not screw her?

331
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,355
Any problem?

332
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:05,763
Cheung, you are great!
Have my toast!

333
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,198
Take this seat, come on!

334
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:09,128
Thank you, Brother Pao-wing.

335
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:12,736
You know what
Cheung-dee is good at?

336
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:14,068
What?
Go ahead.

337
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,507
He is the best bluffer!

338
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:19,503
My boys witnessed
how he killed Lion King.

339
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,606
They saw you hiding yourself
under the car, you chicken!

340
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:26,580
Brother Pao-wing,
you must be kidding!

341
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,187
Dare you deny that?

342
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,322
Yes, you know what?

343
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:35,226
I slipped down carelessly,
and thus I rolled under the car.

344
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,422
They didn't see the other side
of the car, did they?

345
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:37,792
I rolled out from the other side.

346
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,799
Then fought with those bastards.

347
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:40,924
- Sounds great, huh?
- Yeah!

348
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:43,094
It's Gutsy Chuen
who killed Lion King.

349
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:44,568
Not you!

350
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,440
I couldn't stand any more! Actually
I didn't want to blame you!

351
00:24:51,613 --> 00:24:53,604
Brother Pao-wing, you fellows
were told to standby,

352
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:55,773
why didn't you ask them to help me?

353
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:58,142
If you couldn't make it,
my fellows would help.

354
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:01,581
If you could make it,
I just didn't want to take you pride.

355
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,456
Cheung-dee, what I should say is...

356
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:09,553
you are useless!

357
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,562
You fixed Crazy Ball
fiercely years ago,

358
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,064
I wonder, didn't you
get stoned for that?

359
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:14,791
You are going worse!

360
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:20,164
I'm sorry, I want to piss.

361
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:43,229
Back to you work, I'm fine!

362
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,629
What can I do?

363
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:48,366
Do you think I should go in
and let them take my advantage?

364
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:50,734
Those are beasts!

365
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,077
You have totally changed.

366
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,209
You dress well now.

367
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:03,183
Yeah, there is something
you don't know.

368
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,884
Now, my whole family
is being covered by Prince.

369
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,850
Beggars can't be choosers.

370
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:08,785
You know what people
talk about you?

371
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:09,620
What?

372
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,190
People said you are a dog of Prince.

373
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,259
Who said this?

374
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:14,658
I would beat that creep.

375
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:15,988
Prince said this.

376
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,096
I'm alright, I'll go back soon.

377
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:21,860
Don't you want to
take care of your son?

378
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,064
Have you taken him home?

379
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:26,672
I took him to the doctor.

380
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,099
What's the matter?

381
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:45,689
Why did you fight?

382
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:49,324
Why did you fight with other kids?

383
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:52,329
Answer me.

384
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,296
They said you are a dog.

385
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,330
Why do you care?

386
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,165
I have told you many times.

387
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,977
I told you not to fight
with others, you know?

388
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,544
I've told you many times!

389
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:09,311
Are you a dog?

390
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,414
Dad isn't a dog.

391
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:20,326
I'm a pig, OK?

392
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:35,572
Prince slapped him.

393
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:38,706
Damn it!

394
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,206
What's the matter?

395
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:41,838
He is just a kid!
How could he slap him?

396
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,616
Brother Prince,
why do you come down here?

397
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,153
Where the hell have you been?

398
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:48,652
Well, I just want to
take some fresh air here.

399
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,347
Let's go to the VCD factory now.

400
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,551
We are making big money! A new
film is under production now.

401
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,075
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

402
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,908
The kids fought among
themselves and you son got hurt.

403
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,947
Never mind, children always fight.

404
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:23,022
I told you, we are making
big money in these days.

405
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,121
Take your bonus
in advance, $100,000.

406
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:30,691
Thank you!
I'm really in need of money!

407
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,699
The school fee, and the lawyer,
you know?

408
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,490
And...

409
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:39,397
There is a contract for you,
you are the license holder.

410
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,134
Just for taxing purpose, no big deal.

411
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:49,046
It's written in English,
I don't quite understand it.

412
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:51,079
You are my fellow,
I won't harm you, you know?

413
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,185
Sign where there is a mark.

414
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,658
I'll show you something.
See, how great it is!

415
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:03,456
Once a new film is finished,
right after first show,

416
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:06,226
we will move directly to the
theatre and shoot it, then produce.

417
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:07,460
Brother Prince...

418
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:08,934
please advice your fellows,

419
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:11,833
they always shoot badly.

420
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,132
The vision isn't sharp,

421
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,608
and too many people
walking to toilets.

422
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,699
It harms the quality.

423
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:18,268
You stupid fool!

424
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:19,502
It's useless to shoot sharply.

425
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:21,979
Those bastards pay $25 for the VCD.

426
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:23,209
So what?

427
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:25,182
You are talking about
quality with me?

428
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,719
Are you too stupid?

429
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:28,650
The customers will complain!

430
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:31,121
Just ask those bastards
not to buy from us.

431
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:33,750
Move to the theatre,
then they can ask for quality!

432
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:38,160
They pay limited money
for these VCDs.

433
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,856
It's just like receiving loot.

434
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:44,666
We make the VCDs,
we know how bad the quality is.

435
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:46,703
But we can't help,
they just want to stuff us money.

436
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,000
Should I reject the money? Go!

437
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:49,735
Well, who cares!

438
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:51,875
It's great!
Boss, you are really great!

439
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,173
Rascal.

440
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,311
Where is the new attraction
"Fung-wen"?

441
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,009
That's shit! Damn poor vision!

442
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,781
Do you know grabbing
the film and then copy it?

443
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:03,549
They won't let us do it

444
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:06,283
Are you sick?
You are a triad member.

445
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:07,450
Are we doing decent business?

446
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,927
Go to a theatre in remote area,
if the guys refuse, beat them up.

447
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,157
If they still refuse to let you
copy it, beat them again.

448
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,527
Refuse again? Then beat them up,
until they say yes.

449
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:13,895
I don't think they are superman.

450
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:15,161
Do you see my point?

451
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,703
Any foreign films?

452
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,139
Over the corner.

453
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,839
My son is learning English.

454
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:33,710
What are you doing?

455
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,426
What are you doing here?

456
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,152
That guy is taking cocaine!

457
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:43,696
We will be in deep shit!

458
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:45,228
You bastard!

459
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:52,400
Brother Prince, please let me go.

460
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:54,498
Don't stop me, I want to kill him!

461
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:58,974
No! Run! Run for you life!

462
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,080
Bastard!
It's alright.

463
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:53,128
On March 7, at karaoke,

464
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:56,793
a guy named Chow Tai-man,

465
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,996
nicked-named Fatty Chow,
had a fight with you.

466
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,730
You attacked him with weapons,
is that right?

467
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,333
You badly injured him. Am I right?

468
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:07,003
I don't know,
he has many foes, you know?

469
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,479
I don't know who did it to him!

470
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:10,473
Mr. Wai,
if you answer like this in court,

471
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:13,450
ou'll let the judge think you're
a slippery customer, it's not wise.

472
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:16,222
Who are you? What are you?

473
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,085
He is your solicitor.

474
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,482
Who are you?

475
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm your barrister.

476
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:23,389
What's the difference?

477
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:25,624
Formally speaking,
you can't hire me.

478
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,663
You should hire him first,
and then He'll hire me.

479
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:31,028
I'm a barrister, he is Solicitor.

480
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:33,699
I don't know what the difference is,

481
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,173
I just think that you
want me to pay more!

482
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:38,136
What did you use to hit him?

483
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,576
Damn it, you change the topic.

484
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:41,941
I don't know you're
helping me or attacking me!

485
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:44,884
Miss Leung is trying to let you
practice how to answer in court.

486
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:46,986
We hope you can
answer in a proper way.

487
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,788
I'll tell the judge the answer which
you're going to teach me, OK?

488
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:53,117
I can't teach you how to answer.

489
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:55,861
I can only help you
according to the facts.

490
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,961
Actually, did you hit him?

491
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:00,430
What the hell is it?
Are you threatening me?

492
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,367
Can you leave first?

493
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:13,043
Don't worry, he won't overhear us.

494
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:18,878
OK, can you tell me now,
whether you beat him or not.

495
00:33:19,254 --> 00:33:20,551
I mean with weapon.

496
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:24,154
It's just a fight.

497
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:27,217
I thought he would
call his fellows to help,

498
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:30,487
so I couldn't control myself but...

499
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:34,629
His head hit the ashtray
in my hand accidentally.

500
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:36,731
This is the case.

501
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,834
That means you hit him
by the ashtray.

502
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:42,374
No, I didn't say so,
you can't put it that way.

503
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,171
Mr. Wai.

504
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:49,246
You know you are a poor liar?

505
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:53,443
I... I know how to
tell the judge in court.

506
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:54,713
I'm smart.

507
00:33:56,824 --> 00:34:00,817
You've just acted like a kid
who lied in front of his mom.

508
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:03,894
You're scared after lying, that's it.

509
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:05,755
You haven't looked at me.

510
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:09,362
I think,
you can't lie to anyone in court.

511
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:13,636
Well, just admit your charge,
I'll beg for mercy for you.

512
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:14,867
No way!

513
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:19,576
No way! I promised
my son not to go to jail.

514
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,313
You hurt people!

515
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:22,777
I know, but...

516
00:34:23,318 --> 00:34:25,616
You didn't see that guy!

517
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,312
He was so disgusting!

518
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:32,654
If you saw him,
you would have beaten him too.

519
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,689
You can't smoke right here.

520
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:41,891
Doesn't you boyfriend smoke?

521
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:44,665
He doesn't.

522
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:48,100
I don't want my husband dies
of lung cancer at his early fifty.

523
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:52,269
Well, I listen to you and
should listen to me too.

524
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,281
Try to let me out of this case.

525
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:00,953
I promised my son,
I can't walk into jail.

526
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:03,751
I can't let others tease him
of having a prisoner daddy.

527
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:08,659
You remember, OK?

528
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,924
Don't worry, I don't want you
to go to prison as well.

529
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:14,533
OK, I have to leave now, bye bye.

530
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,740
Sorry! Something has kept me busy,
that's why I'm late.

531
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:22,932
Never mind.

532
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,681
Where are we going to?

533
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:38,390
Where are we going to?

534
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,393
You know Cheung-dee Wai?

535
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,990
He is my client,
I'm helping him now.

536
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,800
It's wise of you not to stick with
such kind of person.

537
00:35:50,038 --> 00:35:52,632
You promised not to care
the job of each other.

538
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,774
I know, just to remind you.

539
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,409
I heard that you've
recruited many fellows.

540
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:06,349
Not many! Just a queue of kids
will greet you as boss, that's it.

541
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:09,683
See that guy David?

542
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:10,587
Which one?

543
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,124
The smart looking guy.

544
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,356
He will be a good pimp!
Handsome boy, huh!

545
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:17,293
Just like me!

546
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,364
Why do you add that much?
It's rather hot.

547
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:23,059
I feel itchy lately! You know?

548
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,771
I heard people
saying this can kill germs.

549
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,838
Let me tell you.

550
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:30,770
this is for external use,
you just soak your dick inside.

551
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,878
- You mean it.
- Sure!

552
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,145
Brother Sun-sa.

553
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,713
Are you going to work?

554
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:40,043
This girl always smiles to me.

555
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:42,121
I think she likes me.
I'll juice her up!

556
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:43,751
You are lucky!

557
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:45,119
Have you screwed any girls lately?

558
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:47,591
Sure I have! Please use your brain!

559
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:51,492
But, I don't know
I should be frank or not.

560
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:52,462
Go ahead.

561
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,292
Ruby is so nice!

562
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:56,199
She has been with
your family for ages.

563
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,404
And she's given up many chances.

564
00:36:58,606 --> 00:36:59,698
Come on!

565
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:03,366
I saw many nice guys
proposing to her.

566
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,170
But she refused them.

567
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,177
You see the point?
She is waiting for you!

568
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,613
Please! Please cut the crap, OK?

569
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,150
If you don't shut your mouth,
I will cut your dick off, I swear.

570
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:12,711
You scum!

571
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:13,683
Boss!

572
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:16,021
I know you!

573
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,282
My name is David.

574
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,550
Greet him boss, that's it.

575
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,557
- Boss.
- Good boy!

576
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:22,662
You may call me Brother Cheung-dee
from now on.

577
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:24,855
Brother Cheung-dee, I'm your fan.

578
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:28,160
I remember I saw you riding along
the Prince Margaret Road.

579
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:29,200
You were a great rider!

580
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,668
Forget it, I don't ride now.

581
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:33,596
Are you kidding me?

582
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:35,436
Will you teach me riding?

583
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,704
You young man,
you'd better learn making money.

584
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:40,005
Making money, can you hear me?

585
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:46,342
Brother Prince...

586
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:47,385
It's right.

587
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,455
What? Are you free?

588
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,253
Cheung-dee, I tell you! Tonight...

589
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,722
I won't let Ruby go!

590
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:56,695
You should stay away from us.

591
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,192
I won't care, OK?

592
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,696
You leave us alone!
OK, I won't care.

593
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:05,733
He drinks that much,
will he make any trouble?

594
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,967
I will take a look,
I'll can you if I need help.

595
00:38:09,076 --> 00:38:09,872
OK

596
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:13,311
Brother Prince.

597
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:17,449
Are you bored? You can
only find more girls there.

598
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:19,418
Why not move to Lan Kwai Fong?
You can find more girls there.

599
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,286
Cheung-dee, I warn you!

600
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:24,823
You should leave us alone tonight.

601
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,186
Just stay here and watch.

602
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,252
I've just seen 2 blondes in
Disco 97, they are really pretty.

603
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:30,386
They are sexpots!

604
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:32,293
I warn you!

605
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,894
I don't care whether
you're Ruby's man or not.

606
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,931
Tonight, no one can save her.

607
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,633
No woman can cheat me, you know?

608
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,609
Brother Prince, just forget
what I said, OK?

609
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,474
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,405
- Sit over there.
- Sure!

611
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:54,844
Brother Prince.

612
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:59,617
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

613
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,920
You know, one of my sisters go sick.

614
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:02,961
- Really?
- I sent her to hospital.

615
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:06,098
Well, I don't mind. But I just
want you to sleep with me tonight.

616
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,202
Come on! I won't sleep with
my clients, you know that!

617
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:11,494
Let's play a guessing game.

618
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,337
I will guess first.

619
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,905
Five.

620
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:17,066
Another five.

621
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:24,082
You are stupid! You're thirty
something, how can you cheat?

622
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,580
You are punished! Get out now!

623
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,853
What?

624
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:38,259
Dare you cheat me?
Who do you think you are?

625
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,933
You work in a club, do you
think you are Miss Hong Kong?

626
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:44,160
You are a mamasan, don't you
think you need not serve me?

627
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,928
I want to screw you right now.

628
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:47,764
- Brother Prince...
- Help!

629
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:49,169
Have you gone too far?

630
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,332
No! Do it next time, OK?

631
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:53,438
Let me go!

632
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:55,411
Am I breaking you heart?

633
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:58,946
Let go of me!

634
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:05,350
Help!

635
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,492
Bastard!
Do you still deny your affair?

636
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,596
Brother Prince.

637
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:17,195
You seem to have
two on your chest, right?

638
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,268
Same tattoo!

639
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,836
What? Eagles of love?

640
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:25,740
Brother Prince, would you
please give me face?

641
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,942
Of course I'm giving you face!

642
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,951
I will share the woman
with you! You first.

643
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,512
Come on!

644
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:36,345
Please let her go, would you?

645
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:39,118
Use your brain! Are you moron?

646
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,322
You turn me on,
and you ask me to let go of her?

647
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,627
Alright, I will spare her,

648
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:47,926
but you should show me,
screw her in front of me.

649
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,469
If you do it well, I will let her go.

650
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,108
Get lost!

651
00:40:57,745 --> 00:41:00,543
Brother Prince, I'm not a moron.

652
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:03,582
But I feel a bit high.

653
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:05,212
Don't scare me.

654
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:09,116
You bastard!

655
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:11,957
Do you know
what you are doing now?

656
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:13,351
You want me to kill
your whole family?

657
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,858
Don't scare me!

658
00:41:15,463 --> 00:41:17,954
Let her go! Let her go!

659
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:19,326
Let go of her!

660
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:22,729
Don't come over!

661
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:24,932
Let's go.

662
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:32,337
Don't cover over.

663
00:41:35,483 --> 00:41:38,077
Brother Prince, I'm sorry.

664
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:42,111
I think I have drunk too much!
I'm sorry.

665
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:46,957
Brother Prince, please don't
blame me! I'm sorry.

666
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:48,920
It's alright! Forget it! It's over.

667
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,131
Cause you are my buddy,
you know?

668
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,325
For this woman? No way!

669
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:54,995
Come on, let's have a drink!

670
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,667
It's alright!

671
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,104
Kill this scum for me!

672
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:05,041
Got you!

673
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,070
To hell will you!
Are you pretending to be cool?

674
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,810
Don't you recognize me?

675
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:42,405
It's okay,
I just fell and hurt myself.

676
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,419
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,583
I think, it's me
who should apologize.

678
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:57,230
It's been five years!
You have helped me so much!

679
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,360
If I didn't give you a hand,

680
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,434
I think,
even I would despise myself.

681
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,999
- But Prince...
- It's alright.

682
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:09,174
I can fix it. Don't worry.

683
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,006
Let me put some medicine
on your wound.

684
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:13,405
Alright.

685
00:43:21,055 --> 00:43:22,249
What's up?

686
00:43:23,224 --> 00:43:24,316
When did you make it?

687
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,057
Last year.

688
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,324
For me?

689
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:37,702
You know and you still ask!

690
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,600
Why didn't you tell me?

691
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,179
You are so bad!

692
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:50,516
Are you crazy?
Why do you bite me?

693
00:43:52,653 --> 00:43:56,555
I've fallen for you
since you knew Cindy.

694
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:59,983
You know,
Cindy fell crazy for you.

695
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,852
How could I tell
how much I love you!

696
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:08,367
After her death,
I burn her incense everyday.

697
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:11,997
I beg her not to blame me.

698
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:17,772
Well, she has nothing to blame.

699
00:44:20,514 --> 00:44:21,606
Yes!

700
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:24,917
I take you as my man.

701
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:32,014
Don't you believe...

702
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:35,084
I always take you as
Tai-hung's mom?

703
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:08,584
I'm sorry. Sorry...

704
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,822
You ordered too many food!

705
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:14,725
- Love it or not?
- I love it.

706
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:17,302
If only Tai-hung loves it,
just do it.

707
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:18,868
I don't like it.

708
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:21,334
What do you want? I order for you!

709
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:23,034
I want dumplings in fine soup.

710
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,199
It's just been ordered.

711
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:37,783
Don't you remember me?

712
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:43,857
How about this?

713
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:48,560
You seem to be very afraid!

714
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:53,639
Aren't you the most capable
fighter in Hung Tai Group?

715
00:45:58,312 --> 00:46:00,405
I can tell from you eyes that

716
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:03,205
you are wondering why I'd
be released from prison.

717
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:06,676
What are you looking at?
Just eat you food.

718
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:14,854
In these five years, I spent all
my money for an appeal.

719
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:20,692
Finally I've discovered that
the judge made a big mistake...

720
00:46:21,135 --> 00:46:22,830
to mislead the jury.

721
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,864
That's why I appealed successfully,
and I'm free now.

722
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:27,470
So what?

723
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,847
I tell you, this is a public place.

724
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:44,218
I've almost forgotten that!
I'm sorry!

725
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:45,583
I'm sorry...

726
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:50,887
I really envy you! You've a cute son.

727
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:52,960
And your girl has nice figure!

728
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:55,600
But I tell you!

729
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:57,326
From now on, I'm always free.

730
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,472
That will make you feel unhappy!

731
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:07,538
- So?
- It's alright.

732
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,313
Let's go.

733
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,481
He just wants to threaten you!
Don't give it a damn!

734
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:22,825
But I really...
He is insane you know?

735
00:47:25,432 --> 00:47:27,423
Put a knife under his neck,
I wonder he won't be insane any more.

736
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:29,100
He just wants to threaten you!

737
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:32,902
But I think...
I'd better talk to Uncle Mei.

738
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,337
Come on! Do you think
he will help you?

739
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,774
Why not?

740
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:39,208
This is difficult to say.

741
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,680
Boss, please come here.

742
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,641
Boss, you know what it is about.

743
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,411
I know it very well,

744
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:49,283
Uncle Mei will never help except
he finds advantage.

745
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:50,822
He will leave you alone if there
isn't any advantage for him.

746
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,116
About Crazy Ball's matter,
you'd fix it yourself.

747
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:57,295
How can I kill him?
I'm helpless.

748
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:00,327
Boss, you slashed him once,
so you can do it the second time.

749
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,825
You can only live once, you know?

750
00:48:03,103 --> 00:48:04,798
What are you considering?

751
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,636
I know, but I...

752
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:10,773
All of us will back you up!

753
00:48:12,546 --> 00:48:16,141
Boss, see you bike! Now if
becomes the attraction of my shop.

754
00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:17,510
I clean it everyday.

755
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:20,283
Do you have any feel?
If yes, take a ride.

756
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:24,990
I have no feeling!
I haven't ridden for ages.

757
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,784
I don't want to lose face.

758
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:29,585
Let's stop here! I'm leaving now.

759
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:32,197
Boss, do you drive?

760
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,390
I will take the minibus.

761
00:48:39,506 --> 00:48:40,905
What's wrong with boss now?

762
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,440
He lames when he walks!

763
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:46,069
He hasn't been our leading
light for ages! Let's go.

764
00:48:47,748 --> 00:48:50,740
Cheung-dee Wai claimed
himself a triad member.

765
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:51,873
He came in and wanted
to blackmail me.

766
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:53,742
I'm decent citizen, you know?

767
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:56,079
I would never be
blackmailed by a triad.

768
00:48:56,256 --> 00:48:57,245
So I counter attacked.

769
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,355
He broke my head
with an ashtray.

770
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,661
Mr. Chow, you emphasize
the word "Blackmail".

771
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:05,797
What does that mean?

772
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:07,957
Well, the triad members always
want to take advantage.

773
00:49:08,168 --> 00:49:10,363
They will set us up
and grab money from us.

774
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:11,834
Say, they will frame us
of doing something bad.

775
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:13,836
Or, they'll force us to admit to
courting their girls, so and so.

776
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:16,141
Anyways, just doing something bad.

777
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:18,172
They will put all the blames on you!

778
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:20,812
You know Wai
is a triad on that night?

779
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:22,776
Everyone knows he is a triad member.

780
00:49:22,983 --> 00:49:24,382
See the eagles on his chest!

781
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,084
And a dragon on his back.

782
00:49:26,286 --> 00:49:27,685
Who will believe that
he is a decent person?

783
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:31,513
It's you who walked straightly
into his VIP room on that night.

784
00:49:31,658 --> 00:49:34,456
You know he is a triad,
why did you move to his room.

785
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:35,826
Didn't you worry that
he would beat you up?

786
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,326
Such fight wouldn't have
happened in the past.

787
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:41,767
That means you went into
his room many times before?

788
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:43,027
I have forgotten.

789
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:44,700
Let me tell you the truth.

790
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:46,436
More than once.

791
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,435
You know Wai very well.

792
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:51,004
He wanted you to pay
the gambling debt, and you refused.

793
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:52,237
So you started to fight.

794
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:54,004
At last, you fought each other.

795
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:55,671
And you were no match for him,
is that right?

796
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,146
Don't frame me!

797
00:49:57,784 --> 00:50:00,480
Witness, just answer
straight to the question.

798
00:50:01,255 --> 00:50:04,156
I don't know him well,
and I didn't owe him money.

799
00:50:04,324 --> 00:50:06,815
I'm so strong, he is no match
for me if we fight.

800
00:50:07,528 --> 00:50:08,722
He attacked me.

801
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:11,160
From the back?

802
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:12,628
Of course.

803
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:15,796
But you hurt your forehead.

804
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:17,225
Yes.

805
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:21,764
That means, he held the ashtray...

806
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:25,401
stood behind you, and aimed at
your forehead, right?

807
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:26,840
It could be possible.

808
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:29,109
How tall are you?

809
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:30,546
Five feet 11 inches.

810
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:34,047
Mr. Cheung-dee Wai
is five feet nine.

811
00:50:34,621 --> 00:50:36,521
So he had to act like
a basketball player,

812
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,592
to jump tall enough and
hit your forehead from behind?

813
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:45,521
I think, such action will only
appear in action films.

814
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:48,762
Nothing further.

815
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:57,170
In March 7, 1998, did you
hit Mr. Chow Tai-man...

816
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:01,246
at Yeah's karaoke with an ashtray?

817
00:51:02,883 --> 00:51:04,180
I did fight with him.

818
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,842
And you claimed yourself
a triad member, is that right?

819
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,918
No.

820
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,716
Well, are you a triad member?

821
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:17,652
Yes.

822
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:19,493
You threatened Chow Tai-man.

823
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,498
You said you'd beat him up
if he didn't pay back, right?

824
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:23,797
No!

825
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:29,665
Although I'm a triad member,
but since five years ago,

826
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,810
I haven't joined
any triad's activities.

827
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:36,543
I promised my son,

828
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:39,179
I won't let his dad
become a prisoner.

829
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:42,911
During a gang fight 5 years ago,

830
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:46,925
I lost my wife accidentally.

831
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,760
In all these years, I...

832
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:52,790
I'm the father and mother
of my son, so...

833
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,432
Why did you hit Chow Tai-man?

834
00:51:56,536 --> 00:51:57,935
I didn't hit him.

835
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:00,865
It's self defense.

836
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:03,673
I asked him to pay me back.

837
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:07,402
He refused, and said...

838
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:12,012
something dirty.

839
00:52:12,252 --> 00:52:13,549
What's that?

840
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,487
I don't think it's proper
to tell right here.

841
00:52:16,623 --> 00:52:17,920
Go ahead.

842
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:24,057
He insulted my mom and my wife.

843
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:26,193
Did you attack him from his back?

844
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:27,958
I said I didn't hit him.

845
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,438
We fought.

846
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,967
He grabbed a bottle
and intended to hit me.

847
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:41,479
I grabbed and ashtray to resist,
but I hit him accidentally.

848
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:44,774
I thought this was
a normal reaction.

849
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:47,285
I won't deny that we fought, but I...

850
00:52:51,558 --> 00:52:53,048
Your honor, I...

851
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,359
I really want to say something.

852
00:52:57,397 --> 00:52:58,386
Go ahead.

853
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:02,331
Yes, I'm a triad member.

854
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,932
I regret to be a triad member,
because...

855
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,134
It makes my son feel shame.

856
00:53:11,545 --> 00:53:15,447
I try so hard to go straight.

857
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:19,414
I hope you to give me a chance.

858
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:23,619
To let me become
a model daddy of my son.

859
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:42,638
Finished?

860
00:53:44,077 --> 00:53:45,169
Adjourn now.

861
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:55,613
You know, you're
great in court! So great!

862
00:53:56,056 --> 00:53:58,354
I think you have potential
to become an actor.

863
00:53:58,725 --> 00:54:00,215
Can't you see the judge?

864
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:03,059
You've fixed it, no problem!

865
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,125
I'm really scared!

866
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:07,198
If I didn't promise my son...

867
00:54:09,102 --> 00:54:10,000
Be gentle please!

868
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:12,261
Why not toast to Sandy?

869
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,629
Thanks.

870
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:16,507
This is my job.

871
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:20,137
Why hasn't your boyfriend
come yet?

872
00:54:21,982 --> 00:54:23,176
Here he is.

873
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:29,714
He is cool.

874
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:33,453
Michael, this is
Cheung-dee Wai, this is Michael.

875
00:54:34,728 --> 00:54:35,626
How are you doing?

876
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:40,923
You boyfriend is really smart!

877
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,693
Where do you make a fortune?

878
00:54:43,437 --> 00:54:44,734
We can't make a fortune.

879
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:48,806
Organised Crime And
Anti-triads Bureau.

880
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:54,741
Are you hungry?
Want to order something?

881
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:57,680
I heard that you're
making a fortune lately.

882
00:54:58,218 --> 00:55:00,914
Don't be silly! I'm not.

883
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:05,214
Your VCD factory
is running good business!

884
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:09,555
We don't produce pirates.

885
00:55:11,298 --> 00:55:13,789
Michael, why don't you
order some food?

886
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,126
OK.

887
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:18,198
What a perfect match!
How long have you been in love?

888
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:19,866
It's been three years.

889
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,740
Beautiful and capable girls
are always men's dream girls.

890
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:25,171
If I were you,
I would have married her.

891
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:29,013
Nowadays,
men don't like getting married.

892
00:55:29,783 --> 00:55:31,478
Are you a cop?

893
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:34,242
Yes.

894
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:37,148
Why do you stare at my dad?

895
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:39,386
Since you father is cute.

896
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:40,585
How cute?

897
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,529
Well, judging form you look now...

898
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:48,199
you would be a good daddy
and a good husband.

899
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:51,593
If I were a woman,
I would have fallen for you.

900
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:56,802
But for something deep,
I don't think anyone will know that.

901
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:08,679
If you want to know it,
go ahead to get it.

902
00:56:10,056 --> 00:56:11,353
I have finished my food,

903
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:15,560
if you want to order something,
better separate the bills.

904
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:29,207
I think it's not wise of me to stay
and ruin you appetite.

905
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:31,166
Never mind, I have to go now.

906
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:32,538
My boss paged me.

907
00:56:33,446 --> 00:56:34,640
You'd better leave first.

908
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:37,039
OK. Excuse me.

909
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:42,246
Nice to meet you, Mr. Wai.

910
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:44,456
I'm sorry,
I don't like to see you actually.

911
00:56:45,025 --> 00:56:47,323
When you see me next time,
maybe it will depress you.

912
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:53,464
You boyfriend is really bad.

913
00:56:54,968 --> 00:56:57,459
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.

914
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:01,763
We're used to be teased by cops.

915
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:04,206
I shouldn't have asked him to come.

916
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:06,072
None of your business.

917
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:09,204
Is that your boyfriend
who sits inside the car?

918
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:10,881
He has tailed us for one night.

919
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:13,508
Should we say hello? I worry my
fellows would beat him up.

920
00:57:13,954 --> 00:57:15,148
Just kidding.

921
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:21,121
Since you boyfriend isn't around,
let's go to eat dessert.

922
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:23,024
Sure!

923
00:57:29,502 --> 00:57:31,197
What do you want?
Red and white? OK?

924
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:32,663
Man, two bowls of red
and white please.

925
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:34,797
No, she wants red and white
and I want black and white.

926
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:37,165
- Come on, take a seat.
- Thanks.

927
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:43,273
What is red and white?
What is black and white?

928
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:47,579
Red mixed with white, and the
other is black mixed with white.

929
00:57:48,288 --> 00:57:49,482
What's that?

930
00:57:51,992 --> 00:57:54,085
This is red and white.

931
00:57:54,995 --> 00:57:58,396
- Red bean soup plus bean pudding.
- Thank you.

932
00:57:58,598 --> 00:58:03,900
This is black and white,
sesame soup plus bean pudding.

933
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:05,937
- It's like you.
- Why?

934
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:08,534
You seem to be black,
but actually you are white.

935
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:11,867
In fact, I think you are nice.

936
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:14,009
Thank you!

937
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:17,279
But, why do you become a black...
I mean a triad member?

938
00:58:17,617 --> 00:58:19,107
This is hard to say.

939
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:21,977
When I was small,

940
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,950
my dad was a triad member.

941
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,548
My mom has left us for ages.

942
00:58:26,826 --> 00:58:28,225
I'm the most
educated son in my family.

943
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:29,818
I finished form two.

944
00:58:30,397 --> 00:58:32,592
But let me tell you,
if I don't become a triad,

945
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,859
I will never achieve anything
to the society, no way!

946
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,302
But you can go straight.

947
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:38,836
Yes, I have!
I'm producing VCDs.

948
00:58:39,205 --> 00:58:41,605
But they are pirates. It's illegal.

949
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:43,936
Everyone does that.

950
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:47,011
One day I went to the cinema,
I saw a person...

951
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:48,603
shooting the screen.

952
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,374
I was offended!
That's why I beat him.

953
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,407
- You seem to be righteous.
- Of course.

954
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,247
Because I was shooting too!
You know?

955
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:57,448
He was taking my advantage,
I should beat him!

956
00:58:58,591 --> 00:59:01,082
Help! How can you do this?

957
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:18,169
Let's go.

958
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:20,104
I haven't finished yet.

959
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,172
Let's run now.

960
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,139
Check please.

961
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:27,613
What's the matter?

962
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:29,013
I will tell you later.

963
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:31,188
Why do you run that fast?
Come on!

964
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,196
Run!

965
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:45,669
Cindy!

966
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,800
Cindy, run!

967
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:37,521
Thank you.

968
01:00:38,024 --> 01:00:39,321
Bye bye...

969
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:40,424
Take care.

970
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:44,154
You called me Cindy.

971
01:00:44,531 --> 01:00:45,828
Who is Cindy?

972
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,070
I think... I was confused.

973
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,133
Is that Tai-hung's mom?

974
01:00:58,178 --> 01:00:59,167
Yes!

975
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:04,608
Who wanted to kill us?

976
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:08,047
I think they must be my foe.

977
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:09,587
Leave it to me! I will be fine.

978
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:12,187
I'm leaving now.

979
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,651
You haven't got a helmet.

980
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:16,717
Yeah.

981
01:01:18,031 --> 01:01:19,225
How about this? OK?

982
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,194
I think it's not easy
to be noticed, bye bye.

983
01:02:12,452 --> 01:02:13,646
Why do you come so late?

984
01:02:15,855 --> 01:02:17,447
Would you treat me
to a cup of coffee?

985
01:02:22,629 --> 01:02:24,324
You embarrassed me.

986
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:29,159
Sorry.

987
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:33,638
I think... if we meet more...

988
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:36,164
our problem will be slowly solved.

989
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:42,013
But it's not a question
between you and me.

990
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:46,778
Sandy, you can't stay
close with Wai.

991
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:51,587
First, we've trustable information.

992
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:53,822
his foe wants to kill him.

993
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:56,226
We've just met that.

994
01:02:57,063 --> 01:02:58,360
Are you alright?

995
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:00,860
I'm fine.

996
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:03,260
Go ahead.

997
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,695
We are now investigating him.

998
01:03:06,172 --> 01:03:08,367
Once we get enough evidence,
we'll nail him.

999
01:03:09,108 --> 01:03:10,302
Why?

1000
01:03:11,644 --> 01:03:12,941
Confidential.

1001
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:15,146
Anyways, you can't stay with him.

1002
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,747
I won't do it
if I don't know the reason.

1003
01:03:26,859 --> 01:03:28,451
We've checked him for 7 months.

1004
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:30,453
His factory

1005
01:03:31,564 --> 01:03:34,158
is actually the biggest
distribution center for cocaine.

1006
01:03:34,634 --> 01:03:37,228
He may be the biggest
drugs dealer in these ten years.

1007
01:03:37,437 --> 01:03:38,836
Impossible!

1008
01:03:39,339 --> 01:03:42,240
He can't even pay my lawyer's fee,

1009
01:03:42,342 --> 01:03:43,434
how can it be?

1010
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:45,567
He need not let you
know how rich he is.

1011
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:52,782
Anyways, once we get enough
evidence, we will sue him.

1012
01:03:52,986 --> 01:03:54,385
He will be put to jail
for at least 20 years.

1013
01:03:59,192 --> 01:04:01,490
I'd see Crazy Ball leading a team...

1014
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:02,891
I was almost killed by him.

1015
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:07,297
Pao, what do you think?

1016
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:10,329
Did he mess up our place?

1017
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,467
No, he didn't do that.

1018
01:04:12,672 --> 01:04:15,072
That means it's between you two.

1019
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:18,571
Brother Pao-wing,

1020
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:21,302
I fought with him for Prince's sake.

1021
01:04:22,682 --> 01:04:24,377
Uncle Fatty, I'd like to turn
the conditioner to high cool.

1022
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:26,651
No one feels hot here.

1023
01:04:26,853 --> 01:04:28,844
Only you are hot.

1024
01:04:29,322 --> 01:04:32,416
Uncle Mei, he picks on me,
it's same as picking on Hung Tai.

1025
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:34,091
You can't put it that way.

1026
01:04:34,494 --> 01:04:37,088
We didn't ask you to kill him.

1027
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,421
It's you who wanted to be hero.

1028
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:41,064
Now, he comes back to take revenge,

1029
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,895
why should we offer help?

1030
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:45,631
Pao, you can't put it that way.

1031
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:47,430
He is our buddy, right?

1032
01:04:47,607 --> 01:04:51,304
Cheung-dee,
this Crazy Ball isn't a triad,

1033
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:52,569
he is a thief.

1034
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:55,608
If we help you,

1035
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,248
the other groups will tease us
of bullying a dummy,

1036
01:04:58,451 --> 01:04:59,941
you know?

1037
01:05:01,154 --> 01:05:03,247
You'd better be smart.

1038
01:05:03,523 --> 01:05:06,321
You are shit!
We'll lose face because of you!

1039
01:05:06,526 --> 01:05:08,426
You'd better fix it yourself.

1040
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:10,994
If you can't make it,
finally we will help.

1041
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:12,989
Cheung-dee, you can make it.

1042
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:19,904
You'd better fix it yourself.

1043
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:22,600
If you can't make it,
we will support you!

1044
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:24,899
Cheung-dee, you can make it.

1045
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,145
How is it? What did Uncle Mei say?

1046
01:05:33,286 --> 01:05:34,275
Nothing.

1047
01:05:38,357 --> 01:05:41,349
Boss, this bike is really great!

1048
01:05:41,461 --> 01:05:43,952
Really? How dare you
drive boss's bike?

1049
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,625
How about a car accident?
Can you pay for it?

1050
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,868
Never mind, this bike is
for riding, not for exhibiting.

1051
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:53,531
Give it to me. Take me the jacket.

1052
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:55,637
Yes.

1053
01:06:30,209 --> 01:06:32,700
Cheung-dee, I've something
important to tell you, contact me.

1054
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:41,616
Did your boyfriend tell you that?

1055
01:06:43,055 --> 01:06:44,647
Have you sold cocaine?

1056
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:47,553
I'm a triad member.

1057
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:49,891
But I haven't touched such thing.

1058
01:06:50,763 --> 01:06:52,355
Why do they suspect you?

1059
01:06:53,366 --> 01:06:55,857
I don't know, I think...

1060
01:06:56,836 --> 01:06:58,531
It's the problem of the VCD factory.

1061
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:00,702
I share it with Prince.

1062
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:03,071
But I won't go there
even once a month.

1063
01:07:04,076 --> 01:07:05,475
Are you the license holder?

1064
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:08,703
How can you sign the paper?

1065
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,507
I think we are a family,
I don't think he will set me up.

1066
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,320
I hope you haven't cheated me.

1067
01:07:19,158 --> 01:07:20,455
Why should I cheat you?

1068
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:23,685
The Americans can check it out
if anyone sells drugs in Hong Kong.

1069
01:07:24,463 --> 01:07:28,456
Think, if the FBIs join
with the HK police,

1070
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,191
whoever they pick on,
whoever can never escape.

1071
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,662
I'd see many guys go into fugitive.

1072
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:38,904
I'm not very smart,

1073
01:07:39,845 --> 01:07:41,244
but I'm not stupid.

1074
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:45,580
If you are not involved,
please make everything clear.

1075
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:47,914
Otherwise, no one can help you.

1076
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:49,880
I know.

1077
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:57,618
I have a question for you.

1078
01:07:58,297 --> 01:07:59,389
Go ahead.

1079
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,189
Why do you help me?

1080
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:04,566
Because...

1081
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:07,033
I think you are not that bad.

1082
01:08:08,874 --> 01:08:10,967
This isn't the reason which makes
you betray your boyfriend.

1083
01:08:14,981 --> 01:08:16,573
Well...

1084
01:08:17,516 --> 01:08:19,416
Maybe I love helping rascals.

1085
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:23,110
This sounds good.

1086
01:08:23,656 --> 01:08:24,748
Don't worry.

1087
01:08:46,912 --> 01:08:47,708
Still working?

1088
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:48,902
Why do you come?

1089
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:50,414
I just want to check whether
there is any new production.

1090
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:52,914
Brother Prince told me that
you can't come here along.

1091
01:08:53,986 --> 01:08:55,783
Are you sick? I'm you boss!

1092
01:08:55,988 --> 01:08:56,977
Brother Prince didn't mention that.

1093
01:08:57,156 --> 01:08:58,555
I tell you, leave me alone.

1094
01:08:58,924 --> 01:09:01,324
Let me give Brother Prince
a call first, OK?

1095
01:09:01,627 --> 01:09:02,423
Good!

1096
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:07,228
What are you doing?

1097
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:30,912
Speak up!

1098
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,285
Stop fighting!

1099
01:09:33,492 --> 01:09:35,790
It's none of my business! Stop!

1100
01:09:36,062 --> 01:09:37,757
Speak up! Tell me,

1101
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:39,656
when did Prince
start to sell cocaine?

1102
01:09:39,865 --> 01:09:42,663
I don't know, that's none of
my business! Don't beat me!

1103
01:09:42,835 --> 01:09:44,132
OK, I'll tell you...

1104
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,832
Speak up.

1105
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:51,265
Right after this factory was set up.

1106
01:09:51,444 --> 01:09:53,344
Boss, you are trapped this time.

1107
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:55,111
David.

1108
01:09:56,248 --> 01:09:57,237
Yes!

1109
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:58,815
Take all the cocaine away.

1110
01:10:00,786 --> 01:10:02,981
Boss, cops are coming!

1111
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:13,296
Pal, work now.

1112
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:14,262
Go there and check.

1113
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,322
Search every inch of here.

1114
01:10:18,738 --> 01:10:21,730
Uncle Mei, this is Cheung-dee,
I have something to talk to you.

1115
01:10:21,941 --> 01:10:22,930
I will come to you now.

1116
01:10:31,317 --> 01:10:35,117
Brother Cheung-dee,
do you know who I'm?

1117
01:10:35,454 --> 01:10:37,854
Crazy Ball, what do you want?

1118
01:10:38,557 --> 01:10:40,457
I hope I haven't got
a wrong address...

1119
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:44,221
Now, I'm staying with you son,
I'm fooling him!

1120
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:46,829
Leave him alone.

1121
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:48,431
I'm squeezing his face!

1122
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:53,833
Dad, help me! Help me, dad!

1123
01:10:54,507 --> 01:10:55,599
Don't lose your mind.

1124
01:10:56,008 --> 01:10:59,603
Since I'm staying at your home,
I can do anything I want.

1125
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:03,874
I've forgotten to tell you, do you
want to say hello to your woman?

1126
01:11:07,186 --> 01:11:08,380
Don't come back.

1127
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:11,955
Can you hear that?

1128
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:20,793
If you don't show up before ten,
we'll chain rape your woman.

1129
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:24,232
And I'll throw
your son the to the street.

1130
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,780
Stop!

1131
01:11:49,428 --> 01:11:52,920
Stop, off the engine.

1132
01:11:53,299 --> 01:11:54,288
Get down.

1133
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:56,257
Stay calm, don't lose your mind.

1134
01:11:57,102 --> 01:11:59,502
Squat...

1135
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:00,536
We are from the Anti-drugs Bureau,

1136
01:12:00,706 --> 01:12:02,105
Wai, you're now under arrest.

1137
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:03,667
My son is in danger!

1138
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:05,037
Slow down...
I beg you!

1139
01:12:05,144 --> 01:12:06,543
Let me go home to save him,
I beg you!

1140
01:12:11,884 --> 01:12:14,682
You dad is gutless chicken.

1141
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:16,446
- No!
- I said he is a chicken!

1142
01:12:16,622 --> 01:12:17,520
Leave him alone.

1143
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:21,618
Don't move! Stay calm.

1144
01:12:21,794 --> 01:12:23,489
Stay calm! I have to go. Please...

1145
01:12:25,464 --> 01:12:28,763
Don't hit auntie...

1146
01:12:28,934 --> 01:12:31,232
Bitch, how dare you hit me?

1147
01:12:31,403 --> 01:12:33,303
How dare you!

1148
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,134
No! Don't hit her!

1149
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,408
Don't mess up!

1150
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:42,008
Drag her inside and enjoy yourself,
I'll be the next.

1151
01:12:49,054 --> 01:12:50,146
Stay cool...

1152
01:13:02,268 --> 01:13:03,166
Take him back!

1153
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,010
My dad will come back to kill you!

1154
01:13:19,451 --> 01:13:20,748
Kill me!

1155
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:35,561
Let me go!

1156
01:13:37,536 --> 01:13:41,028
Michael, let me go!

1157
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:50,614
Micheal, let me go...

1158
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:02,354
Tell me what's happened.

1159
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:07,655
We're sorry about what happened...

1160
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:09,924
at you home last night.

1161
01:14:12,204 --> 01:14:13,398
Tell me.

1162
01:14:16,642 --> 01:14:18,337
Crazy Ball did go to you home.

1163
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:20,836
Your friend Ruby Kwan...

1164
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:24,839
was chain raped and assaulted
by more than one man.

1165
01:14:26,151 --> 01:14:29,348
She's safe,
and is now in the hospital.

1166
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,424
Go ahead.

1167
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,994
I'm sorry.

1168
01:14:45,037 --> 01:14:46,732
You son Wai Tai-hung...

1169
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:51,433
his eyes were stabbed
by hard substances...

1170
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:54,670
he may become blind.

1171
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:00,748
Why?

1172
01:15:00,853 --> 01:15:05,552
- Sit down...
- Why?

1173
01:15:05,758 --> 01:15:10,661
I told you many times and
you didn't trust me! Why?

1174
01:15:11,263 --> 01:15:13,163
Why?

1175
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:14,559
Cheung-dee, stay calm.

1176
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:18,132
You are his lawyer,
please talk to him.

1177
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:24,274
Stay calm,
would you control yourself?

1178
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,804
Don't move.

1179
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,974
No, OK?

1180
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,844
Why?

1181
01:15:33,952 --> 01:15:35,943
Why they allied to pick on me?

1182
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:37,747
It's happened.

1183
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:41,988
I'll try my best to help you!
I'll try hard to let you pay the bail.

1184
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:44,124
What? The judge let him pay the bail?

1185
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,525
What are you doing?

1186
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,930
He will escape.

1187
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:54,002
Two councilors and a priest?
So what?

1188
01:15:55,274 --> 01:15:58,072
It's useless to keep
his travelling document.

1189
01:15:58,477 --> 01:16:00,968
He doesn't need to take a plane
for fugitive, you fool.

1190
01:16:11,256 --> 01:16:15,955
Henry, I want two teams to
keep an eye on him round the clock.

1191
01:16:16,128 --> 01:16:17,527
Inform me if anything happens.

1192
01:16:17,663 --> 01:16:19,961
Nurse, where is Wai Tai-hung?

1193
01:16:20,799 --> 01:16:21,891
Cheung-dee.

1194
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:23,595
Thank you.

1195
01:16:30,175 --> 01:16:31,267
There is a cop.

1196
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:36,539
Where is Tai-hung?

1197
01:16:38,484 --> 01:16:39,781
Let me see him.

1198
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:55,691
Is that Sister Ruby?

1199
01:16:56,401 --> 01:17:01,600
- No, it's daddy.
- Daddy.

1200
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:05,706
How is it? Does it hurt?

1201
01:17:11,216 --> 01:17:14,310
I don't want you to go to prison.

1202
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:19,514
If you go to prison,
no one will love me.

1203
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:23,788
Don't worry.

1204
01:17:25,397 --> 01:17:30,198
I won't go to prison, I won't.

1205
01:17:37,242 --> 01:17:39,142
Daddy, please don't cry.

1206
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:43,809
I promise, I will study hard.

1207
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:49,485
I know you are a good boy.

1208
01:17:51,123 --> 01:17:54,422
Daddy promise,
I won't go to prison.

1209
01:17:56,829 --> 01:18:00,026
I promise. Who bullied us...

1210
01:18:00,232 --> 01:18:04,225
Will be very sorry.
He will regret deeply.

1211
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:09,768
Daddy!

1212
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:15,140
Daddy...

1213
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:35,225
Why do you follow me all day?

1214
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:50,279
It's me.

1215
01:18:51,984 --> 01:18:53,178
How did you get in?

1216
01:18:54,052 --> 01:18:55,246
Do you have any food here?

1217
01:18:56,088 --> 01:18:59,182
How can you do this?
This is my home.

1218
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:01,517
Except this place,
I have no where to hide.

1219
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,652
Why do you hide? You paid
the bail, why do you hole up?

1220
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:07,930
Don't be naive!

1221
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:10,765
You boyfriend sends
two teams to tail me.

1222
01:19:11,169 --> 01:19:13,660
I've just brushed them off
at the hospital.

1223
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,438
And, the Crazy Ball
is still searching for me.

1224
01:19:18,777 --> 01:19:20,574
Would you stop messing up?

1225
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,073
I want everything to be fine too.

1226
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:25,880
If I don't act like
what I used to be,

1227
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:27,212
I can't save myself.

1228
01:19:30,188 --> 01:19:31,382
Don't be silly.

1229
01:19:32,224 --> 01:19:33,418
If you were me,

1230
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:37,618
think of what happened
to my son and Ruby.

1231
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:38,990
Can you still sit right here?

1232
01:19:39,164 --> 01:19:40,153
I'm upset too...

1233
01:19:40,332 --> 01:19:41,731
- But...
- I know!

1234
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:42,925
So, please help me.

1235
01:19:47,706 --> 01:19:48,695
It's Michael.

1236
01:19:49,207 --> 01:19:50,799
Go into that room first.

1237
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:01,446
Has Wai contacted you?

1238
01:20:02,087 --> 01:20:03,486
Isn't he in the hospital?

1239
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:05,686
He brushed my men off.

1240
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:07,781
I haven't agreed to let you come in.

1241
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:13,924
Would you please separate your
job and your private matters?

1242
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:15,730
It's you who can't.

1243
01:20:16,001 --> 01:20:17,798
Do you come here for business
or for private purpose?

1244
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:20,465
Private.

1245
01:20:20,872 --> 01:20:23,864
For private matters, I don't
want you to come in, I'm tired.

1246
01:20:24,376 --> 01:20:26,071
We are still in a cool war.

1247
01:20:26,945 --> 01:20:28,936
If for business,
please let me see you warrant.

1248
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:35,051
You are my fiancee,
why do you help Wai?

1249
01:20:35,554 --> 01:20:36,748
Because he is my client.

1250
01:20:36,888 --> 01:20:38,082
No!

1251
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:42,583
Cause you like him.

1252
01:20:52,237 --> 01:20:53,829
No matter what you said.

1253
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,331
You are a wise woman.

1254
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:01,702
- I hope you won't be impulsive.
- I'm not.

1255
01:21:05,217 --> 01:21:08,311
OK, I won't bother you.

1256
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:19,122
No matter what,

1257
01:21:19,264 --> 01:21:21,255
if you can't find Cheung-dee,
get ready you coffin then.

1258
01:21:22,934 --> 01:21:27,428
Uncle Mei,
you should help Cheung-dee.

1259
01:21:28,874 --> 01:21:32,571
If he is in deep shit
because of serving the group,

1260
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,575
of course I will help him.

1261
01:21:34,813 --> 01:21:37,805
But he is selling drugs,
how can I help him then?

1262
01:21:38,016 --> 01:21:39,916
You know very well that
he isn't involved.

1263
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:45,386
Silly girl, are you sure
he hasn't done that?

1264
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:47,490
How do I know whether
he is dealing drugs or not?

1265
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:54,195
Crazy Ball harmed Tai-hung and me...

1266
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:56,590
he will avenge Cheung-dee too.

1267
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:58,864
Cheung-dee is safer than us.

1268
01:21:59,237 --> 01:22:02,832
Cause he is protected by cops,
you know?

1269
01:22:03,108 --> 01:22:09,013
Red wine of 1982?
It's great! First-class cigar!

1270
01:22:09,748 --> 01:22:11,545
Uncle Mei,

1271
01:22:12,017 --> 01:22:15,009
if you don't help,
no one can save him then.

1272
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:17,720
Let me think!

1273
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:21,290
You know, drugs trafficking
is a serious crime.

1274
01:22:21,493 --> 01:22:22,892
If I offer help...

1275
01:22:23,061 --> 01:22:25,552
the cops will think I'm involved too.

1276
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:32,868
Brother Prince.

1277
01:22:33,738 --> 01:22:35,933
Well, it's nice to see you here.

1278
01:22:36,174 --> 01:22:37,766
Enjoy you time
if you still have a chance.

1279
01:22:37,876 --> 01:22:39,366
I think you would
definitely be put in jail.

1280
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:41,909
That's why I would
like you to help me.

1281
01:22:42,447 --> 01:22:44,540
You need my help?
Are you kidding me?

1282
01:22:44,816 --> 01:22:46,306
I want to borrow money

1283
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:48,548
to hire a better barrister.

1284
01:22:49,988 --> 01:22:53,082
I think it's useless,
you will be shit this time.

1285
01:22:53,425 --> 01:22:54,824
You'd better talk to Uncle Mei.

1286
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:00,326
Would you seek help from
the gang to fix Ball, OK?

1287
01:23:01,133 --> 01:23:02,725
I've told you!

1288
01:23:02,901 --> 01:23:05,392
The gang won't get involved into it.

1289
01:23:07,839 --> 01:23:10,239
Brother Prince, please help me.

1290
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,602
If you don't help me, I'd be shit!

1291
01:23:13,445 --> 01:23:14,639
I beg you!

1292
01:23:15,013 --> 01:23:18,005
Brother Prince,
please help Cheung-dee, OK?

1293
01:23:19,251 --> 01:23:21,242
Are you begging mercy
on his behalf?

1294
01:23:21,419 --> 01:23:22,716
This is different!

1295
01:23:22,821 --> 01:23:24,721
I always love dealing with women.

1296
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,887
But it will be a trouble to help him!

1297
01:23:28,126 --> 01:23:30,720
Well, you'd better
stay with me tonight.

1298
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:33,830
If you serve me well,

1299
01:23:34,032 --> 01:23:37,832
then I'll call Martin tomorrow
to give you a helping hand.

1300
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,368
Just so simple.

1301
01:23:39,738 --> 01:23:41,035
Think carefully!

1302
01:23:56,421 --> 01:23:59,322
We are leaving,
you pay good attention,

1303
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:02,118
take good care of Cheung-dee.

1304
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,654
If there is anything wrong,
you'll be in deep shit.

1305
01:24:04,963 --> 01:24:06,157
He will pay your dinner,
understand?

1306
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:07,628
Yes, boss.

1307
01:24:07,799 --> 01:24:10,393
- Ruby, you'd better be smart.
- Got you!

1308
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:12,268
Don't you worry that
I can't feed her well?

1309
01:24:19,444 --> 01:24:22,743
Boss, I saw Prince's fellows
going with Cheung-dee.

1310
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:24,676
And Prince is staying with
Cheung-dee's woman.

1311
01:24:34,826 --> 01:24:36,316
Which motel do you like?

1312
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:39,662
Let's go to your favorite one.

1313
01:24:39,864 --> 01:24:43,766
Start a cocaine party first
to warm us up, OK?

1314
01:24:44,469 --> 01:24:45,561
You creep!

1315
01:24:45,737 --> 01:24:48,831
What the hell? It's your man who
asked you to serve me.

1316
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:50,538
Go home for your mom.

1317
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:54,978
You bitch!

1318
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,680
I can kill your man
just by one call.

1319
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:10,323
Damn it! You'll regret for this.

1320
01:25:22,274 --> 01:25:25,971
Smart guy! Long time no see.

1321
01:25:26,211 --> 01:25:28,111
Where is Cheung-dee?

1322
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:35,511
It's great!

1323
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:39,786
Would you let me go first?

1324
01:25:39,891 --> 01:25:42,382
Let's talk! Let me go first, OK?

1325
01:25:43,228 --> 01:25:46,322
Please tell me where Cheung-dee is.

1326
01:25:46,531 --> 01:25:48,123
I've told you!

1327
01:25:48,733 --> 01:25:52,225
He went with my fellows,
but I don't know where he is.

1328
01:25:57,676 --> 01:26:00,076
You are not sincere enough!

1329
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:02,705
This is very hot.

1330
01:26:07,285 --> 01:26:10,686
77292929, you'd better call him.

1331
01:26:12,824 --> 01:26:15,224
77292929?

1332
01:26:17,028 --> 01:26:18,427
Who is calling for Cheung-dee.

1333
01:26:18,563 --> 01:26:21,361
Prince! My number is 94938032.

1334
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:42,249
This is Cheung-dee,
who is looking for me?

1335
01:26:42,721 --> 01:26:45,713
Where are you?
Where are my men?

1336
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:47,690
They've gone.

1337
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,655
Come to my place right now.

1338
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:51,884
Where are you?

1339
01:26:52,063 --> 01:26:53,462
Where are you?

1340
01:26:53,998 --> 01:26:55,693
I'm staying at your turf,
you know that.

1341
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,597
I'm informed that Crazy Ball
is looking for us, better be careful.

1342
01:26:57,769 --> 01:26:59,066
Save me!

1343
01:27:04,976 --> 01:27:06,375
Where is your turf?

1344
01:27:07,278 --> 01:27:08,370
What turf?

1345
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:11,614
He told you about the turf?
I don't have any turf!

1346
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,843
He cheated you!
I don't have any turf!

1347
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:17,918
You bastard!
How can I be nice to you?

1348
01:27:18,022 --> 01:27:19,421
I haven't lied.

1349
01:27:23,027 --> 01:27:29,432
- It'll kill you...
- No...

1350
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:31,467
You ask for it.

1351
01:27:31,636 --> 01:27:33,831
I have no turf! He cheated you!
Don't trust him!

1352
01:27:33,972 --> 01:27:36,770
You love screwing women
by force, don't you?

1353
01:27:37,842 --> 01:27:41,243
Have you been screwed by force?

1354
01:28:15,547 --> 01:28:18,345
Tell Pao-wing and Uncle Fatty,

1355
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:21,713
no matter what and no matter
how much it will cost,

1356
01:28:21,986 --> 01:28:24,386
get Crazy Ball to sleep
under my son's body!

1357
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:25,285
Yes!

1358
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:29,190
Freeze... Stay where you are!

1359
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:33,320
Where is Crazy Ball? Tell me!

1360
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:06,822
Crazy Ball, stay where you are!

1361
01:29:07,065 --> 01:29:09,966
Stay where you are!

1362
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:11,968
Kill him!

1363
01:29:12,203 --> 01:29:13,795
Stop!

1364
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:22,973
There! go

1365
01:29:32,891 --> 01:29:34,791
Do you want him go! Never!

1366
01:29:58,349 --> 01:30:00,340
You have finally shown up!

1367
01:30:24,776 --> 01:30:26,175
Freeze, police!

1368
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:34,013
I've been an undercover next
to Chuen for one year.

1369
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:36,342
I know you are a nice guy.

1370
01:30:36,487 --> 01:30:37,977
But this is my duty.

1371
01:30:40,692 --> 01:30:44,685
You've been a cop for 1 year &
I've been a rascal for 10 years.

1372
01:30:46,264 --> 01:30:47,162
You are really great!

1373
01:31:17,562 --> 01:31:19,257
You are bleeding badly!

1374
01:31:20,031 --> 01:31:21,726
I'm fine!

1375
01:31:24,302 --> 01:31:25,894
I don't want to see you like this.

1376
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:27,934
- Let's call the ambulance.
- No! No!

1377
01:31:28,306 --> 01:31:30,797
I'm leaving,
I want to go to Mainland China.

1378
01:31:33,544 --> 01:31:34,738
Why do you come here?

1379
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,278
I... After seeing you now.

1380
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,645
I don't know
when I can see you again.

1381
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:45,320
Come on!

1382
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:47,923
You'd better go to the hospital, OK!

1383
01:31:48,326 --> 01:31:49,918
No...

1384
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:53,122
- Please surrender yourself.
- No way!

1385
01:31:56,934 --> 01:31:59,835
I promised Tai-hung,
I can't go to jail.

1386
01:32:03,174 --> 01:32:04,368
But...

1387
01:32:04,976 --> 01:32:06,568
I know...

1388
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,872
I come now...

1389
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,741
Just want to make sure one thing.

1390
01:32:17,288 --> 01:32:18,482
What?

1391
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:23,287
I would like ask one thing
which I haven't asked before.

1392
01:32:25,263 --> 01:32:26,560
Have you ever fallen for me?

1393
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:33,827
I understand!
I just want to know the truth...

1394
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:35,962
before my death...

1395
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:40,102
You won't die. You can't die.

1396
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:52,483
I can't find a way out, you know?

1397
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:55,219
Why not surrender yourself?

1398
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:00,062
No! No! I said I can't go to jail.

1399
01:33:08,339 --> 01:33:11,831
I have my way to set you free.

1400
01:33:28,993 --> 01:33:30,085
Stop!

1401
01:33:35,466 --> 01:33:36,763
You come to surrender yourself?

1402
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,067
I come to report my presence.

1403
01:33:41,172 --> 01:33:43,072
After the bail, right?

1404
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:44,606
You are not supposed
to confess now,

1405
01:33:44,776 --> 01:33:46,971
but what you said will
become evidence in court.

1406
01:33:47,512 --> 01:33:49,207
You are now under arrest.

1407
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:52,844
You are suspected to kill a man
named Chan Kam-ball.

1408
01:33:53,684 --> 01:33:55,379
If you have enough evidence,
you can charge me.

1409
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:58,115
But, I come for another thing.

1410
01:33:58,322 --> 01:33:59,619
You want to know

1411
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:02,988
who is the man
behind the VCD factory?

1412
01:34:08,032 --> 01:34:09,522
I want to become the stain witness.

1413
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:12,193
You just want to get the man
behind scene, right?

1414
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,537
What are you doing here?

1415
01:34:18,242 --> 01:34:19,231
Interpols against drugs.

1416
01:34:19,377 --> 01:34:20,366
You need not say anything now.

1417
01:34:20,545 --> 01:34:22,035
But your words will
become evidence in court.

1418
01:34:22,213 --> 01:34:23,805
Sir, why do you arrest me?

1419
01:34:24,148 --> 01:34:25,342
We are investigating...

1420
01:34:32,657 --> 01:34:34,648
Sir, this isn't mine,

1421
01:34:34,759 --> 01:34:36,954
these are gifts sent by my friends.

1422
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:38,455
Better talk to the judge.

1423
01:34:38,696 --> 01:34:39,594
- Take him back.
- Yes sir.

1424
01:34:39,797 --> 01:34:41,287
Pack up and take everything back.

1425
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:44,399
Sir.

1426
01:34:49,807 --> 01:34:50,603
Sir.

1427
01:34:53,544 --> 01:34:55,034
You claim this is a testimony?

1428
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,671
Tell me how you worked
as an undercover.

1429
01:34:58,983 --> 01:35:00,974
I lost consciousness.

1430
01:35:01,252 --> 01:35:03,743
When I woke up,
I didn't remember what happened.

1431
01:35:04,889 --> 01:35:07,084
Tell me, how can I nail him
by this testimony?

1432
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:10,626
Sir, my duty is
to tell you the truth.

1433
01:35:10,728 --> 01:35:12,628
I don't have to nail Cheung-dee Wai.

1434
01:35:12,997 --> 01:35:15,898
He'd be free from
the charge of drugs trafficking.

1435
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,792
If we can't charge him
with murdering,

1436
01:35:17,869 --> 01:35:20,861
he can walk out
from court with pride,

1437
01:35:21,005 --> 01:35:23,997
do you see the point?

1438
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:27,909
Sir, I'm sorry.

1439
01:35:34,552 --> 01:35:35,746
It's you.

1440
01:35:37,788 --> 01:35:39,983
How do you know I'm here.

1441
01:35:41,859 --> 01:35:44,157
You are not at home,
and you'll attend court tomorrow,

1442
01:35:44,528 --> 01:35:46,325
so you must be here
for some preparations.

1443
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:52,425
But... I have much to do tonight.

1444
01:35:56,474 --> 01:35:59,272
Actually I cherish
very much about our love.

1445
01:36:01,846 --> 01:36:04,542
Can you stop defending for Wai?

1446
01:36:08,786 --> 01:36:10,276
We are going to court tomorrow.

1447
01:36:13,124 --> 01:36:15,319
No matter who will be the winner,

1448
01:36:16,227 --> 01:36:19,526
I know we can no longer
stay with each other.

1449
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:23,258
I know.

1450
01:36:32,476 --> 01:36:34,171
Many things happened between us.

1451
01:36:35,846 --> 01:36:37,245
I don't want to know.

1452
01:36:39,517 --> 01:36:42,714
I just want to
marry you after this case.

1453
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:44,849
Let's go back to Canada.

1454
01:36:45,957 --> 01:36:49,449
Michael, I've mentioned that for one year.

1455
01:36:49,694 --> 01:36:51,093
It's you who doesn't
want to get married.

1456
01:36:51,295 --> 01:36:53,593
- Now, I want it.
- But I don't.

1457
01:36:59,503 --> 01:37:01,494
I hope you'd consider it carefully.

1458
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:04,940
Wai doesn't match you.

1459
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:08,508
He will be killed
by foes sooner of later.

1460
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:12,078
I know.

1461
01:37:14,952 --> 01:37:18,444
Please leave, I will think about it.

1462
01:37:22,426 --> 01:37:23,620
OK.

1463
01:37:30,901 --> 01:37:32,198
Sandy...

1464
01:37:34,438 --> 01:37:35,632
Be rational.

1465
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,641
Court.

1466
01:37:44,915 --> 01:37:47,816
Detective Li, you are ordered
to be the undercover...

1467
01:37:47,952 --> 01:37:50,944
Chan Kam-ball,
nick named Crazy Ball...

1468
01:37:51,155 --> 01:37:53,851
Did you witness
how Chan was killed?

1469
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:55,949
Or, did you reach the scene
after he was killed?

1470
01:37:56,027 --> 01:37:59,121
Did you see him face to face?

1471
01:37:59,363 --> 01:38:00,660
How could you tell that was Wai?

1472
01:38:01,032 --> 01:38:03,523
I have your medical report.

1473
01:38:03,868 --> 01:38:06,268
It states that you had
a stroke on that day.

1474
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:09,402
So, you reported
to your boss something...

1475
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,937
which you were not that sure.

1476
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:13,799
You didn't see the guy
killing Chan Kam-ball.

1477
01:38:14,178 --> 01:38:16,976
Court adjourn now,
it'll be continues at 2:30.

1478
01:38:20,351 --> 01:38:22,945
Sandy, will Cheung-dee be guilty?

1479
01:38:24,088 --> 01:38:25,487
I'm not so optimistic.

1480
01:38:26,023 --> 01:38:29,117
I can't find any alibi to help him.

1481
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:32,261
You should help him, please!

1482
01:38:33,464 --> 01:38:35,557
I will! I will try my best.

1483
01:38:37,935 --> 01:38:40,529
I wish I were the one being sued!
I don't want him to be in jail.

1484
01:38:44,008 --> 01:38:45,407
You really care!

1485
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:48,572
We have been in love.

1486
01:38:53,818 --> 01:38:55,615
Really? How long?

1487
01:38:56,253 --> 01:38:57,845
About a month.

1488
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:06,259
Don't worry,
I know what to do then.

1489
01:39:11,869 --> 01:39:15,361
Sandy, anything wrong?

1490
01:39:17,675 --> 01:39:20,769
I feel pressure.

1491
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,979
I don't know what to say...

1492
01:39:24,849 --> 01:39:26,248
What pressure?

1493
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:31,715
I feel that... no one can be trusted.

1494
01:39:41,999 --> 01:39:43,694
Any more witness that the defense
counsel would like to summon?

1495
01:39:44,435 --> 01:39:46,835
Your Honor, my I have a request?

1496
01:39:47,838 --> 01:39:48,930
Go ahead.

1497
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,632
I'd like to stop defending for Wai,

1498
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:55,306
because of a personal reason.

1499
01:39:56,747 --> 01:39:58,146
Are you sick? Do you worry that
we can't afford your fee?

1500
01:39:58,249 --> 01:39:59,147
Order.

1501
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:00,844
Chan and Ma has hired

1502
01:40:01,018 --> 01:40:03,919
Mr. Wong Lik-kan
to take my place.

1503
01:40:04,155 --> 01:40:05,452
Your approval is
very much appreciated.

1504
01:40:06,023 --> 01:40:08,423
Because there is a change of
lawyer for the defendant.

1505
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:10,056
The court is now adjourned.

1506
01:40:10,361 --> 01:40:12,352
It'll be continued
on June 6 at 10 a.m.

1507
01:40:13,797 --> 01:40:14,786
Court.

1508
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,359
I would like to get off
anywhere ahead. Thanks.

1509
01:41:12,957 --> 01:41:15,357
If his head wasn't hit strongly,

1510
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:17,585
theoretically speaking,
there is no harm to the brain.

1511
01:41:17,795 --> 01:41:18,887
Dr. Cheung, are you sure that

1512
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:20,896
detective David Lee's memory...

1513
01:41:21,098 --> 01:41:23,498
will not be affected by that punch?

1514
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:25,658
I can only say that the influence
may not be significant.

1515
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:28,167
Your Honor, nothing further.

1516
01:41:28,973 --> 01:41:30,770
Both lawyers have finished
their cross examinations.

1517
01:41:31,075 --> 01:41:33,066
They will proceed
to their final address...

1518
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,174
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

1519
01:41:36,146 --> 01:41:38,546
the defense counsel would
like to summon a new witness.

1520
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:40,606
Objection.

1521
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:44,145
The witness listed

1522
01:41:44,255 --> 01:41:45,449
have all been cross examinated.

1523
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:48,783
Your Honour,
this witness is very influential.

1524
01:41:48,959 --> 01:41:51,951
She provides very important
alibi to my client.

1525
01:41:52,463 --> 01:41:53,657
Please come here.

1526
01:41:59,436 --> 01:42:01,529
What reason makes you
summon this new witness?

1527
01:42:01,672 --> 01:42:03,367
And, what will she say?

1528
01:42:11,048 --> 01:42:13,539
OK, your request is approved.

1529
01:42:33,637 --> 01:42:35,935
I, sandy Leung,
swear that I would...

1530
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,233
tell everything that's true...

1531
01:42:38,809 --> 01:42:42,609
Miss Sandy Leung,
on May 10, 1998.

1532
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:44,245
Where were you in the afternoon?

1533
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:46,109
I was at home.

1534
01:42:46,383 --> 01:42:48,078
Who did you stay with?

1535
01:42:49,553 --> 01:42:52,044
Chueng-dee Wai,
the accused of this case.

1536
01:42:52,623 --> 01:42:54,022
The whole afternoon?

1537
01:42:55,059 --> 01:42:56,458
To be exact, two days!

1538
01:42:57,227 --> 01:43:00,628
From May 9th to May 10th.

1539
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:03,291
We haven't left my apartment.

1540
01:43:03,801 --> 01:43:05,496
So, what were you doing at home?

1541
01:43:07,204 --> 01:43:11,698
We're studying a case in which
he is charged with drugs trafficking.

1542
01:43:12,076 --> 01:43:13,976
He has become
the stained witness now.

1543
01:43:14,278 --> 01:43:15,870
He was dispensed with any charge.

1544
01:43:16,714 --> 01:43:19,911
Why did you stay 48 hours
at home to study the case?

1545
01:43:22,586 --> 01:43:25,282
Wai is my client,

1546
01:43:25,656 --> 01:43:27,351
and he is my boyfriend too.

1547
01:43:30,894 --> 01:43:33,988
Why didn't you choose to be the
witness from the very beginning?

1548
01:43:34,531 --> 01:43:37,932
Because my ex-boyfriend is on
the side of the prosecutor.

1549
01:43:39,002 --> 01:43:42,699
I don't want to disclose the
affair between Wai and me.

1550
01:43:43,674 --> 01:43:46,768
But until now, I have got no choice.

1551
01:43:47,077 --> 01:43:49,978
That means, during the 48 hours,

1552
01:43:50,314 --> 01:43:53,613
Wai and you didn't
leave the apartment.

1553
01:43:53,951 --> 01:43:56,442
Yes, in these two days,

1554
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,515
all the meals were cooked by me.

1555
01:44:01,392 --> 01:44:03,690
Order...

1556
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:06,159
You said she didn't
cook anything to you.

1557
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:10,731
First,

1558
01:44:10,901 --> 01:44:14,701
the jury had to consider
a very important question.

1559
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:17,532
That is, whether you believe

1560
01:44:17,741 --> 01:44:20,232
the witness Sandy Leung or not.

1561
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:25,414
If yes, the accused
should be pleaded not guilty.

1562
01:44:25,582 --> 01:44:28,073
You need not consider the evidence
provided by the prosecutor.

1563
01:44:28,419 --> 01:44:31,911
If you don't believe Sandy Leung,

1564
01:44:32,456 --> 01:44:36,051
you should consider all possible
doubtful points stated,

1565
01:44:36,794 --> 01:44:39,592
and grant all benefits
to the accused...

1566
01:44:40,297 --> 01:44:44,290
and to reach a verdict beneficial
to the accused.

1567
01:44:49,206 --> 01:44:52,004
Jury, have you reached any verdict?

1568
01:44:52,476 --> 01:44:53,374
Your Honor,

1569
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:56,204
we have reached
an unanimous verdict that,

1570
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,472
Mr. Wai is pleaded not guilty.

1571
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:04,647
Mr. Cheung-dee Wai
is pleaded not guilty,

1572
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:06,352
he is acquitted at once.

1573
01:45:09,927 --> 01:45:12,020
Court adjourn.

1574
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:26,538
Wai, you fell happy now?

1575
01:45:52,336 --> 01:45:54,031
Do you think I've ruined her?

1576
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:04,276
I'm impressed that
she is very much fond of you.

1577
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:12,138
What are you laughing at?

1578
01:48:15,379 --> 01:48:17,176
What will you do next?

1579
01:48:18,548 --> 01:48:21,449
I just want to say sorry.

1580
01:48:27,724 --> 01:48:29,521
What I have done is
what you've planned.

1581
01:48:30,193 --> 01:48:31,683
Ball and Prince died.

1582
01:48:32,429 --> 01:48:34,021
Uncle Mei was put behind bars.

1583
01:48:34,464 --> 01:48:36,762
Michael has lost faith and face.

1584
01:48:38,635 --> 01:48:40,330
You've got what you want, right?

1585
01:48:45,642 --> 01:48:47,234
Now, you need not go to jail.

1586
01:48:47,844 --> 01:48:52,144
I'm so happy to know that Tai-hung
won't have a prisoner daddy.

1587
01:48:59,256 --> 01:49:00,655
Give me a chance.

1588
01:49:05,429 --> 01:49:09,422
I have had a careful consideration,
it's not possible.

1589
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:12,764
Even we stay together,

1590
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:16,332
we'll separate 1 or 2 years later.

1591
01:49:19,142 --> 01:49:22,043
For some time,
I really really loved you.

1592
01:49:22,913 --> 01:49:24,210
But such feeling...

1593
01:49:25,682 --> 01:49:27,980
I know it won't exist again.

1594
01:49:36,326 --> 01:49:38,726
Why not leave us a happy memory?

1595
01:49:40,197 --> 01:49:43,394
When we get old,
it will still be sweet.

1596
01:49:51,274 --> 01:49:54,869
Cheung-dee, after this glance,

1597
01:49:56,246 --> 01:49:59,443
go back to take good care
of Tai-hung and Ruby.

1598
01:50:05,255 --> 01:50:08,053
After this glance,
I will never look back.
