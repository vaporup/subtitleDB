1
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,800
<b>LOOPER</b>

2
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,280
<i>Time travel has not yet been invented,</i>

3
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,160
<i>but 30 years from now, it will have been.</i>

4
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>It will be instantly outlawed.</i>

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,680
<i>Used only in secret by the
largest criminal organizations.</i>

6
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,360
<i>It's nearly impossible to dispose of
a body in the future,</i>

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
<i>I'm told, for tagging techniques
and things like that,</i>

8
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>So when these criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone,</i>

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,360
<i>they use specialized assassins
in the present, called Loopers.</i>

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>And so, my employers in the future
nab the target,</i>

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,240
<i>they zap them back to me, their Looper.</i>

12
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,960
<i>He appears hands tied, head sacked.</i>

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,400
<i>And I the necessaries, collect my silver.</i>

14
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,960
<i>So the target is vanished from the future,</i>

15
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,800
<i>And I've just disposed of a body
that technically does not exist.</i>

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
<i>Clean.</i>

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
- How's your French?
- Slow.

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,120
- How's the coffee?
- Burned.

19
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Two, Jed.

20
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Hey Joe.

21
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,160
Be at the club tonight?

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Yeah.

23
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Four, Jed.

24
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
You walk around.

25
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,760
Around the bike, I'm not kidding!

26
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Hey, I don't want no problems,

27
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
- you're rude, if you had a mama...
- Wide around, you shit!

28
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,680
she didn't raise you right.

29
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
That's funny, because I'm gonna pick

30
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
your mother later on my bike,

31
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,800
and I'll take my Blunderbuss...

32
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,680
- Hey Seth.
- Hey Joe.

33
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,960
- That's new.
- Yeah, thanks.

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,400
God damn thing won't fucking tart.

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
So you're going to the Belle?

36
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
- So you bought a slab bike?
- Yep!

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,640
How much did that thing set you back?
How much?

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
I was gonna pull up it tonight.

39
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,080
Congratulations, you're
pulling up with me instead.

40
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Don't.

41
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
If we're going in, don't do that.

42
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,360
- Chicks dig the TKs.
- Ain't true, pal.

43
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,440
- Yes, they do!
- Well that's tacky. Don't do it.

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,160
<i>About 10% of the population
has this TK mutation.</i>

45
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
<i>When they first appeared,</i>

46
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,880
<i>everyone thought
we were gonna get superheroes.</i>

47
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
<i>But it turns out this was it.</i>

48
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,920
<i>Now it's just a bunch of assholes
who think they'll blow your mind</i>

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
<i>floating quarters.</i>

50
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
<i>It's like this whole town.</i>

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,080
<i>Big heads, small potatoes.</i>

52
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,760
Full house tonight, Joe.

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,160
We'll stick back stage.
Just meetin' up, in and out.

54
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Cash in your Blunderbusses?

55
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Hardly. Right, Seth?

56
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,600
Hardly. I'm with Joe.
Just meetin' up and in and out.

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,800
- Hey, Suzie!
- Hey!

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,600
- You're working a shit tonight?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Yeah, but a Gat Man bought me
out already for the night.

60
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Sweetie, I gotta work.

61
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
Joe.

62
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
What?

63
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,800
Zack, he's in there right now with Abe.

64
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
- For what?
- Closed his loop.

65
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
No shit.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,680
<i>There's a reason we're called Loopers.</i>

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,400
<i>when we sign up for this job,
taking out the future's garbage,</i>

68
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
<i>we also agree to a very specific provisal.</i>

69
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,080
<i>Time travel in the future is so illegal,</i>

70
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,040
<i>that when our employers
wanna close our contracts,</i>

71
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
<i>they'll also wanna erase any trace</i>

72
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
<i>of their relationship
with us ever existing.</i>

73
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,600
<i>So if we're still alive 30 years from now,</i>

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,080
<i>they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us,</i>

75
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,720
<i>and we'll kill him like any other job.</i>

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
<i>This is called 'closing your loop. '</i>

77
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,360
<i>And you get a golden pay day,
you get a handshake,</i>

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,440
<i>and you get released from your contract.</i>

79
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,280
<i>Enjoy the next 30 years.</i>

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward thinking people.</i>

81
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,640
So we're... celebrating?

82
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
Look out!

83
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
You did it!

84
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,720
- Jesus.
- Fuck, Joe!

85
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,840
What's that, fourth loop
closed this month?

86
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Loop closed! Here we go.

87
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,160
Loop closed, baby!

88
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah.

89
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Seth. Jesus...

90
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
They'll be here any minute,
Are they here?

91
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
- No. Who?
- Christ.

92
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
Joe, Christ!

93
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
- What are you doing?
- Give me the gun.

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
- Alright...
- Come on.

95
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,360
- Get away from the window.
- Christ, Joe.

96
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,040
Quiet down.

97
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,960
You can protect me a little, right, Joe?

98
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
- Just so they don't...
- What did you do?

99
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,600
Jeez.

100
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,640
This is like a nightmare.
This is a nightmare.

101
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
<i>I knew then what he did,</i>

102
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,280
<i>so I don't know why I asked.</i>

103
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
What did you do?

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,400
He... he was singing.

105
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,760
through the gag-it-sack,
but I could hear the tune.

106
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Deep memories...

107
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,680
My mom in a dark room,

108
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,160
taking care of me, singing that tune.

109
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,760
That's how I knew... it was me.

110
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,640
I...

111
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,720
Joe, I couldn't.

112
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,880
I couldn't, I had to see.

113
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,960
He told me...
I remember.

114
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,840
He told me... there's a new

115
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,280
holy terror boss in the future,

116
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
and he's closing all the loops.

117
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
The Rainmaker, they call him.

118
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,640
He told me and...
and then he wanted a cigarette,

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
so I untied him and he gives me this look.

120
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,720
And he just starts running.

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
I had my Blunderbuss,
so I know I've got

122
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,040
fifteen strides 'till
he's out of my range.

123
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
And they come, and they go,

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
and I just watch him till he's gone.

125
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
<i>This is called, 'letting your loop run. '</i>

126
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,960
<i>It's not a good thing.</i>

127
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,920
What do I do?

128
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,360
You're the only friend I got, Joe.
You gotta help me.

129
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,760
Fucking idiot coming here.

130
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,320
You can't be here.

131
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,480
I'll give you some money,
that's it, then you leave.

132
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,880
Joe, a little money! Where am I gonna go?

133
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,360
You hop a freight train,
you beat it the hell out of town...

134
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,320
Shut up and don't move.

135
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,680
Tell Cor to watch the window outside.

136
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,800
Yeah, I'm on my way.

137
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,320
Kid Blue, Joe, come on!

138
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Just a minute!

139
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,040
Open this goddamn door!

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,560
I can't do anything for you, Seth.

141
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,520
You gotta hide me! Please, Joe! Please!

142
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,400
Hide me! Please, Christ!

143
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,560
Please, buy me some time, and I'll go!

144
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,480
Please!

145
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,680
Are you gonna make me
bust this door down?!

146
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, hold on!

147
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,840
Please...

148
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,640
Move!

149
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,520
Come on, Joe! Open up!

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,280
Ok...

151
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,920
Jeez...

152
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,880
That took a while.

153
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,640
You think it's easy lookin' this good?

154
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,480
Tye is gonna watch your apartment
while we go have a talk with Abe.

155
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,400
- There's coffee in the tin.
- Thank you.

156
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Give me two minutes.

157
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,160
Do you know why they call that
pea shooter here a Blunderbuss?

158
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,440
Cause it's impossible to hit
anything further than 15 yards.

159
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
Impossible to miss anything closer.

160
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,960
It's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

161
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,440
Not like a Gat.

162
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,040
A Gat has a range.

163
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Accuracy.

164
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Kid, cut it out, or you'll
blow your other foot off.

165
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,360
What the hell's goin' on out there?

166
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
- How you doin', Abe?
- Hey.

167
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,160
You didn't shoot your other
foot off, did you, Kid?

168
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
Right.

169
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,520
My great-grandfather
told my grandfather,

170
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,320
mens are like spiders.

171
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,280
It's the little ones you
gotta be careful of.

172
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,720
I don't know if I agree with that.

173
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,920
Yeah?

174
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,040
What the fuck did my
great grandfather know?

175
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,040
<i>This man is from the future.</i>

176
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>He was sent back here by the mob.</i>

177
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,680
<i>A one way ticket to run the Loopers.</i>

178
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
<i>That's low effort, even for Abe,</i>

179
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
<i>so to pass the time, he recruited
some real muscle, the Gat Men.</i>

180
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
<i>Now he runs the city.</i>

181
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,800
<i>Any other city, that'd be impressive.</i>

182
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,280
How can you kids stand
to wear those chilipers?

183
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,200
- ... cravats.
- Ties.

184
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,080
Ridiculous. You're aware
we don't have a dress code.

185
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Fashion.

186
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,800
You know... well, you don't know.

187
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,520
The movies that you're dressing like
are just copy of other movies.

188
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
It's Goddamn twentieth
century affectations.

189
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,680
Do something new,

190
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Put a... glowing thing around your neck,
or use rubberized...

191
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Just be new.

192
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
- OK.
- Well.

193
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,200
Well, it's nice chatting with you, Abe.

194
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,600
You do like you, Joe.

195
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,600
But I'm sure enough that
Seth paid you a visit,

196
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,480
and we're gonna have to do
something about this.

197
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,000
Seth?

198
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,320
You're expecting that we're
going to break your fingers

199
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,040
with a hammer or... something awful,

200
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,520
but, I'm gonna diffuse
that tension right now.

201
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,080
That's not gonna happen.
What is gonna happen,

202
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,840
is that I'm gonna talk for a little.
Not even that long.

203
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
And then you're gonna
give up your friend.

204
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,840
My friend? Seth!
Sorry, I'm... I'm confused.

205
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
Well then, I'll talk a little.

206
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,760
You know, you were the
youngest Looper I ever hired.

207
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
You looked Goddamn ridiculous, they said.

208
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,680
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

209
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,480
I remember they brought you in,
I forget what it was for.

210
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,240
Watch shop.

211
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,840
That's... yeah.

212
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,520
You rolled one of our fronts,
the watch shop.

213
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,320
And they had you, you know,

214
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,280
you know this kid,

215
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,040
like an animal. But you...
you looked at me,

216
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,200
your hair stuck to half your face,

217
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,280
just one eye looking at me.
I could see.

218
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,440
I could see in it happen on the TV,

219
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,000
the bad version of your life.
Like a vision,

220
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,800
I could see, how you'd turn bad.

221
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
So I changed it.

222
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,280
I cleaned you up,
and put a gun in your hand.

223
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I gave you something that was yours.

224
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,800
And I am grateful for that, Abe.

225
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,200
I gave you something that was yours.

226
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,160
And I remember that, kid...

227
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,400
And I think if you ask yourself,

228
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
if you ask who would I sacrifice
for what's mine,

229
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,080
I think Seth would be deep
and cozy inside that circle.

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,120
Hey...

231
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,680
Now I'll show you how much I know you.

232
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm not even gonna break you,

233
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,080
I'm just gonna set you back aways.

234
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,240
Now we know that you've
been stashing half your bars.

235
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,480
Which is smart, no law against it.

236
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,160
You're gonna get out,
you're gonna go overseas, right?

237
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,960
- Studying up your Mandarin?
- French.

238
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,000
French?

239
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
You give him up,
or you give us half your stash.

240
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,320
You're willing to dump your silver
in the dirt... for Seth.

241
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,080
- You gonna kill him?
- Not if we can help it.

242
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,720
It's too cataclysmic
a change for the future.

243
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,960
Now, what we'll do is
dangerous in that regards,

244
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
well not... that dangerous
than just killing him,

245
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,480
on top of which a man from
the future runs free long enough,

246
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,960
this... time travel shit just...

247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,120
fries your brain like an egg.

248
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,920
Why the fuck French?

249
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm going to France.

250
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,240
- You should go to China.
- I'm going to France.

251
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm from the future,
you should go to China.

252
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,560
- I'm going to France.
- You're going...

253
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,160
Floor safe's under the rug.

254
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,800
6-7-4-2.

255
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
It's the little ones that get you.

256
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,080
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe?

257
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,400
On the house.

258
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,280
Call the Doc.

259
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
d

260
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,760
Be at 75 Wire street

261
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,200
in 15 minutes.

262
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,920
Wait!

263
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,800
Wait!

264
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,480
Wait.
Wait...

265
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,880
I can't remember my mother's face.

266
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,720
She used to run her hands through my hair.

267
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
Just like this...

268
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,320
I think I've just let my
best friend get killed tonight.

269
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
# For sync: 1 sec. loop in movie #

270
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,360
For silver.

271
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
Shit!

272
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes. Shit...

273
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
Sorry.

274
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm gonna give you some money.

275
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
I've been stashing my silver for years,

276
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,440
and I'm gonna give you half of it.

277
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,880
It means you can leave.

278
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,160
You wanna give me half your silver?

279
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
Silver's got strings.

280
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,320
I got my job...

281
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,680
you got yours.

282
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,440
It's sweet of you to worry about me,
but I'm doing fine.

283
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,280
Why don't we just stick
to 'services rendered'?

284
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,040
Is this what you want?

285
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,960
"HOP A TRAIN OUT OF TOWN. RUN."

286
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,400
- There's 24 of it.
- Count.

287
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,600
Two more trips, just do it.

288
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,320
Goddammit!

289
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
Look, the Kid, I'm sorry!

290
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,680
Tell Abe I'm gonna fix this!
I'm gonna find him.

291
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,800
Tell him I'm gonna kill him!

292
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Motherfucker!

293
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,600
Shit!

294
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
You got any aspirin?

295
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,400
All of them, please.

296
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,160
I'm gonna take that coat too.

297
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,040
What are you doing?

298
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,920
What are you doing, Joe?
I told you to run.

299
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Don't do it, you idiot.

300
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,680
Fucking Kid Blue.

301
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,120
That's two more trips, just do it.

302
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
You stupid little shit.

303
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,480
Walk the pavement,
sweep the train yard,

304
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,720
every second that passes is bad.
Get on it!

305
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,160
Little shit!

306
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,880
I can fix this.

307
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,080
- I can find him!
- Go home.

308
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Let the grown ups work...

309
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Kid Blue.

310
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,960
You bastard.
How do I find you?!

311
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,760
Coffee?

312
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,960
Please.

313
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,320
Black, and some water.

314
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,120
Anything else?

315
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,080
Are we eatin'?

316
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,240
I ordered something.

317
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,640
Steak and eggs. Rare and scrambled.

318
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,480
Two steak and eggs, coming up.

319
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,080
It must hurt.

320
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,400
I wasn't sure you'd remember her.

321
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,800
Yeah, I put it together.

322
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,320
Clever.

323
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,720
You know...

324
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,800
There's another girl who
works here on the weekends.

325
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,520
- Jenny.
- Right.

326
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,800
Less letters.

327
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,640
That'd be better.

328
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,760
- How's your French coming?
- Good.

329
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,400
You gonna tell me how
to be learnin' Mandarin?

330
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,440
I never regretted learning French.

331
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,800
No? Well, you'll get there eventually.

332
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,800
Look, obviously.

333
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,400
Alright, listen. I know this
is a hard situation for you,

334
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,240
but we both know how this has to go down.

335
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,400
I can't let you walk away
from this time alive.

336
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,080
This is my life now, I earned it,
you've had yours already.

337
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,920
So why don't you do what old men do,

338
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,080
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

339
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,360
Why don't you take your little gun
out from between your legs and do it...

340
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
.. Boy.

341
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,000
It's hard staring into your eyes.

342
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,920
It's too strange.

343
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,400
You're face looks backwards.

344
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,480
Yeah.

345
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,960
So, do you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already, as me?

346
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,400
I don't wanna talk about time travel shit.

347
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,080
Cause if we start talking about it,
then we're gonna be here all day

348
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,680
talking about it,
making diagrams with straws.

349
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,520
It doesn't matter.

350
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,040
If I hurt myself, it changes your body.

351
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,680
This is what I do now,
change your memory.

352
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,120
It doesn't matter!

353
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,120
My memory is cloudy.

354
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,120
Too cloudy,

355
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,760
cause my memories aren't really memories,

356
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,840
they're just one possible eventuality now.

357
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,600
And they grow clearer...

358
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,760
or cloudier as they become
more or less likely.

359
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,960
But then they get to the present moment,

360
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,960
and they're instantly clear again.

361
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,560
I can remember what you
do after you do it.

362
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,320
And it hurts.

363
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,120
So even when we're apart,

364
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,680
you can remember what I do after doing it?

365
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,200
Yes. But this is a precise
description of a fuzzy mechanism.

366
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,120
It's... it's messy.

367
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,760
All I know,

368
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,160
I know two things.
I know what's happening in my head,

369
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,440
and I know that
you're still gonna meet her.

370
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
Who?

371
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,760
She's gonna save your life.

372
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,080
For a long time she thought
we were gonna...

373
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,400
we'd have a baby.

374
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,720
Would have been a great mother.

375
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,200
She wanted it so much.

376
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,720
Yeah, but she...

377
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,560
How?

378
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,160
You say she saves my life?

379
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,800
Yes.

380
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,320
Let's take a look at your life.

381
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,880
You're a killer, you're a junkie

382
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,880
with a fucking child mentality.

383
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,560
What's mine? My life, save your life?

384
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,920
You're asking me how?

385
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,240
The question is why? Why would
some sacrifice their life?

386
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,600
Why would someone waste themselves?

387
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,000
Cut your high and mighty bullshit.
I don't need my life...

388
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Shut your fucking child mouth.

389
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,480
You're so self absorbed and stupid,

390
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,840
and she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna take...

391
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,920
You are gonna take her love...
like a sponge.

392
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,400
And you think, maybe
I'm clear of the past,

393
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,120
maybe I'm safe.

394
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,880
Yesterday...

395
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,960
Yesterday what?

396
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,000
Thirty years from now is yesterday.

397
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,440
And I can remember it.

398
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,320
And I'm gonna tell you what happens
to this beautiful woman,

399
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,520
who saved your worthless fucking life.

400
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,680
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

401
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, Seth said... that night.

402
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,440
A new boss from the future,
he used the words 'holy terror'.

403
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,280
Yeah, the reign of terror.

404
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,840
Mass executions,

405
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,120
vagrant purges, everywhere at once.

406
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,120
Legend is that the Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

407
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,200
In the span of six months, he took total
control of the five major syndicates.

408
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,280
That would take an army.

409
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,520
But he didn't have an army.
The story is that he did it alone.

410
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,160
Alone, alone.

411
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,000
- So how did he do it?
- That's the mystery.

412
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,400
There's no pictures of him,
either if it's a him.

413
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,120
It's insane.

414
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,840
There's stories he has a synthetic jaw,

415
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,080
saw his mom shot, shit like that.

416
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,560
But word spread about him
through the ex-Looper grapevine,

417
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,320
because the first thing he did
was start closing loops.

418
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,560
All of them.

419
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,520
You know what this is?
This number?

420
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,760
Here, wait, slow down.

421
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,920
It could lead us right
to the Rainmaker, Joe.

422
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,320
It was in the hospital records.
Write this down!

423
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,080
0, 7, 1, 5, 3, 9, 0, 2, 9, 3, 5!

424
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,520
This is a piece of identifying
information on the Rainmaker.

425
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,080
He's here. He lives here, now.
In this county.

426
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,200
And I'm gonna use it to find him
and I'm gonna kill him.

427
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,520
And I'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

428
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,920
Fuck you. And your wife.

429
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,280
None of this concerns me.

430
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,320
This is gonna happen to you, you stupid...

431
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,280
It happened to you,
it doesn't have to happen to me!

432
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,480
You got a picture right there in my watch?
Let me see it.

433
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,560
Show me the picture, and
as soon as I see her, I'll walk away.

434
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,120
I'll fucking marry someone else.

435
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,800
I promise.

436
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,360
So when I see that picture,
that fog inside your brain

437
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,480
should just swallow up
all the memories, right?

438
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,480
She'll be gone.

439
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,720
If you give her up, she'll be safe.

440
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,640
Giving her up?

441
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,080
Yeah, give her up!
You're the one that got her killed!

442
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,520
If she never meets, you she's safe!

443
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,880
You don't understand,
we don't have to give her up.

444
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,880
I'm not gonna give her up.

445
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,560
I'm gonna save her.

446
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,400
Get to the fields!
We can lose them in the fields!

447
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,360
Hop a train!
Stay out of town!

448
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,120
What the hell is everybody doing?!

449
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,280
You wait for my signal!

450
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,240
- Out back, he's running!
- He went off the back!

451
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,320
Shit!

452
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,200
No, alive!

453
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,680
Fuck! Shit mob! Come on!

454
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,400
Come on, you piece of shit! Come on!

455
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,680
Get the tracker! The tracker!

456
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,640
Come on! Come on!

457
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,280
Shit!

458
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,880
Come on baby, time to get up.

459
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,480
Listen up, fucker!

460
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,680
I have shot and buried

461
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,280
three vagrants in the past year!

462
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,520
So I don't know care
what a hobo sob story you got!

463
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,400
I get a dozen a week, pal,
it cuts no cash with me.

464
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,920
But if you show your face here again,

465
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,120
I will cut you the fuck in half!

466
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,800
Well... you found him.

467
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,720
Tracking Seth's bike, that was clever.

468
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,720
And you rustled up the posse
and went out to get him.

469
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,880
I could do it again.

470
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,120
You can fuck up again? Really?

471
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,360
I got too much riding, Kid.

472
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,280
I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.

473
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,880
Put your Gat on the table.

474
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,720
I wanted you to say I did good.

475
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,640
It's all I wanted.

476
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,960
This is all I have.

477
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,120
Please just give me one more chance.

478
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,520
I'll bring him here alive,
and I'll hold him...

479
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,560
and you could put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

480
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
No, no!

481
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,160
Hey, who's there?

482
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,960
Stop right there, I will shoot you.

483
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,400
You stop! Stop right there!

484
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,480
I'm telling you to stop.
You stop!

485
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,680
Hey! Look up at the light.

486
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,280
Look up at me.
How long since you dropped?

487
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,640
- Dropped?
- Dropped.

488
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,280
- A day.
- A day...

489
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,120
I can't feel my legs.

490
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,000
That's because you're going through
withdrawal, you fucking junkie.

491
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,640
You gotta help me.
I'm gonna die.

492
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,640
I'm thirsty...

493
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,680
Water. Water!

494
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,640
Sid!

495
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,560
Come inside, baby.

496
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,080
- Who's that man?
- He's just a vagrant, baby.

497
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,280
- No, he's not.
- Yeah?

498
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,280
His shoes are too shiny.

499
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,560
Well, you're a smart monkey.

500
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,880
- Is he sick?
- Yep.

501
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,480
- Will he get better?
- Yeah.

502
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,480
Promise?

503
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,360
Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

504
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,720
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Sara.

505
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,640
Hey!

506
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,560
The first time I saw her face,
the first time I saw her face...

507
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,240
Look at me.

508
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,400
No!

509
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,120
The first time I saw her face...

510
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,640
The first time I saw her face...
the first time I saw her face...

511
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,800
Morning, monkey. Want something to eat?

512
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,760
The man's up.

513
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,160
Is he staying here now?

514
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,720
No.

515
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,880
Toss it.

516
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,960
- I'm about to finish cleaning it.
- Put it down.

517
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,640
- How are you feeling?
- I'd say I'm a 30%.

518
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,280
You take it slow, by the end
of the week you'll be a 50.

519
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,560
I took you in so you wouldn't die.
Now you're not gonna die,

520
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,440
so just take the morning to rest,
then you need to get off my farm.

521
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,600
- I can't do that.
- I'm sorry?

522
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,360
I'm gonna stay here for a little while.

523
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,720
- I'm not cool with that.
- I'm sorry.

524
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,640
Well, I'm sorry too,

525
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,800
you just lost your
'take the morning to rest' privileges,

526
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,720
get off my farm.

527
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,680
- No.
- Get off my farm.

528
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,880
You couldn't scare a retarded
hobo with that thing, literally.

529
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,720
This is a Remington 8-70,
one blast cuts you the fuck in...

530
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,840
...Fuck in half, yeah. That's telling,

531
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,760
you're holding a gun,
I say I'm not afraid,

532
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,080
so you describe the gun to me.

533
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,040
It's not the gun I'm not afraid of.

534
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,640
What are you gonna do?
Shoot in the air?

535
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,200
Try to scare me? Go ahead.

536
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,000
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not gonna kill me.

537
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,840
So now I saved your life,
that makes me weak?

538
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,280
Look, I'm not a threat to you,
or your boy.

539
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,920
I need to be on your property.
Alright, there's no contact at all,

540
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,480
I'm gonna stay in the fields.

541
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,320
There's just one thing I need you to do,

542
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,120
and you'll never have
to deal with me again.

543
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,360
Just verify for me this is
your house on the map,

544
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,680
so I know I'm in the right place.

545
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
- What's this?
- It's a map.

546
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,080
Yeah, it's my house. Why is it marked?

547
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,640
Okay, it doesn't matter. Look,

548
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,600
I'm gonna be out of the barn in an hour.

549
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,040
If you can spare it,
I'm gonna take this canteen.

550
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,840
Is there somewhere
I can fill it up with water?

551
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,480
This number, how did you get this?

552
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,080
Does that mean something to you?

553
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,920
What?!
Hey... hey, hey!

554
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,080
Yeah, you're right, I'm not a killer.

555
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,720
But I'm fine with how a blast of rock salt
to your face won't kill you.

556
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
Now you gonna tell me who you are

557
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,640
and what the fuck you're doing on my farm.

558
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,320
Time travel hasn't been invented yet.

559
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,680
But in 30 years it will have been.

560
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,120
They've been used
by the big criminal syndicates.

561
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,800
You're a Looper?

562
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,120
I can't go back to the city
with Abe, my boss,

563
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,040
his men have been searching for me 24/7
so they find me,

564
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,720
or find him.

565
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,640
All I got is that map.

566
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,400
You have three houses marked on them.
Yours is one of them.

567
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,040
I know he's coming here.

568
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,160
So what do you know about Loopers?
You know what we do?

569
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,880
So he's coming here...

570
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,320
to murder my son,

571
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,360
cause he thinks he might be this...
Rainmaker?

572
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,840
And once he kills the Rainmaker,
what happens?

573
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,360
I think... he thinks that if
he'd killed the Rainmaker,

574
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,480
then he never would have been sent back,
so he'd just vanish.

575
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,400
He'd disappear just like he appeared.

576
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,880
He'd be back with his wife.

577
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,040
Who is he, this guy you let run?

578
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,920
Is it just some random
guy from the future?

579
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,160
He's... this is somebody.
You know what... the numbers mean?

580
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,160
This is Sid's birth day.

581
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,280
And this is the main code of
the hospital he was born in.

582
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,760
How many other kids were born in
that hospital in that day with your son?

583
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,360
- Like two?
- Sound right.

584
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,920
Three kids, three houses
marked on this map.

585
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,480
He knows one of them is the Rainmaker,
he doesn't know who he is.

586
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,440
What's he gonna do?

587
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,760
God...

588
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,960
Will he really do this?

589
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,320
Think about doing this would fix

590
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,240
what he thinks it will fix.

591
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,000
If he comes here, will you stop him?

592
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,400
I'm asking, can I trust you?

593
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,240
I don't care if you trust me.
I don't care about your son!

594
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,440
I've lost my life, if I kill
this man, I get it back.

595
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,840
He'll kill the other two kids,
and come here last.

596
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,640
Pull out facing me.

597
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,160
And those Goddamn cane, we're just blind!

598
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,320
He can get 50 yards from this place
without a hawk spotting him.

599
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,920
It would make sense if we burn
the fields. Level them.

600
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,080
How much gas you got in that barn?

601
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,160
No, you can't burn down the cane fields.

602
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,040
This stuff's half dead anyway.

603
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,200
Yeah, it's the seed for next year.

604
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,080
It's not gonna happen. Fucking not.

605
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,200
See, you use what you need,
and you set up anywhere,

606
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,360
but one thing: I don't want
you talking to Sid.

607
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,440
I watch my son, you watch
the cane, that's the deal.

608
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,560
Good by me.

609
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,560
Fine.

610
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,800
Alright, hold still.

611
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,680
It's easy for things to get
infected in a farm...

612
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,960
so I fill it off.

613
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,120
Pussy.

614
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,240
I'm gonna be out here and
you're in the house,

615
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,400
we need a way to communicate.

616
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,800
There's a diner bell in the barn.

617
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,960
Ring the bell if someone's coming on here.

618
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,520
Diner bell. We need... buzzers,
walkies or something.

619
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,440
I don't know what
we've got, but I'll look.

620
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,120
Sid.

621
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,160
How's the math coming?

622
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,560
I want to help the man.

623
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,840
Help him with what?

624
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,400
I could help with my toys.

625
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,160
No. Let me turn to you.

626
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,000
I need you to stay away
from that man. Ok?

627
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,600
You just let him do his thing,
but you stick with me. Ok?

628
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,840
Is he not good?

629
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,960
Well, we're gonna see what he is.

630
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,120
Alright? But I need you to stick with me.

631
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,280
Give me that pop-ups.

632
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,000
Tell me if you hear her coming.

633
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,600
- What you're doing here?
- Communication.

634
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,560
But I need to make it stronger.

635
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,720
- How do we do that?
- Bigger battery.

636
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,240
Smart.

637
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,240
Do you kill people?

638
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,000
- Let's say I kill people.
- With your gun?

639
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,720
- Why, you want a gun like mine?
- Yeah.

640
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,960
What you gonna do with it.
Pole vaulting?

641
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,480
It's bigger than you.

642
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,200
Stop bad things from happening.

643
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,960
So hum... how long you and your mum
been out here on the farm?

644
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,200
- She's not.
- She's not what?

645
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,680
Sara doesn't know...
but I remember my real mom.

646
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,040
When I was a baby, I couldn't stop it.

647
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,320
Couldn't stop what?

648
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,960
I couldn't stop her from getting killed.

649
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,480
I saw it, but I couldn't stop it.

650
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,360
I was not strong enough.

651
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,040
You should... you should talk
to your mum about this.

652
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,280
She's not my mum.
She's a liar.

653
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,280
Spotted in coming out of
a sewer tunnel in the West End.

654
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,640
He's on the run.

655
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,680
He is heading to the
western tower street,

656
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,200
possibly to whore selling.
We have a visual.

657
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,800
You can't take that thing out
with a plough or something?

658
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,040
Listen, I found a...

659
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,520
In the barn I found some parts,
and I made a... a thing.

660
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,640
Here.

661
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,080
So if you see something, just press that.

662
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,960
When?

663
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,320
Last night, he woke me up.

664
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,280
Don't tell him, I told him I wouldn't.

665
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,960
You said you were his mom.

666
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,400
Yeah.

667
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,240
He told me you're not.

668
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,760
He said that?

669
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,680
Yeah...

670
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,040
- If he's not your son, who is he?
- He's my son.

671
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,400
I had Sid when I was 22...

672
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,680
but I didn't want to give
up my life in the city.

673
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,040
So I dropped him here, on the farm,

674
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,240
and my sister, when she saw
how I was living,

675
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,400
so she took him.

676
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,120
And my sister, she raised him.

677
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,400
She loved him.
He called her Mom.

678
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,560
- How did she get killed?
- Jesus Christ.

679
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,760
He remembers it.
You gonna have to talk to him about it.

680
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,000
I told you one thing,

681
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I told you to stay away from my son.

682
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,440
- He asked about my gun.
- Stay out of it!

683
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,280
Stay the fuck away from my son!

684
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,320
Where does 56 go?

685
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,920
Good, you're smart.

686
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,800
21?

687
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,560
How long you cannot sleep?

688
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,640
I don't know... a little while.

689
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,920
It's a good question.
Where's the token going?

690
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,400
Good! 32.

691
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,800
We should help Joe watch.

692
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,040
Joe?

693
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
Cause he can't stay awake all the time.

694
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,080
- Ain't our business. Ok?
- He's keeping us safe.

695
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,680
Let's do this now. Okay?

696
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,880
You have 32 there,
I know you know this one.

697
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,160
No. Eight times three is what?

698
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,440
32.

699
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,440
- Eight times three is what?
- 32.

700
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,920
I want you to count three eights.

701
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,320
8, 16...

702
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,000
32.

703
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,880
Are you telling me you want a long time?

704
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,360
No.

705
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,440
Then why don't you put that were it lies?

706
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,440
A long time.

707
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,400
He's protecting us, cause you can't do it.

708
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,800
Ok, I told you to stay away from him.

709
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,520
I never did anything.

710
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,800
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- So.

711
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,240
- I told you...
- So!

712
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,080
You do what I tell you, Sid!

713
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,040
You can't tell me what to do,
cos you're not my mom.

714
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,080
You're not my mum, you're a liar.

715
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,800
You're going to get killed,
cos you won't stop lying.

716
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,560
- Sid, calm down...
- Liar, you're lying to me,

717
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,560
I hate you, you're a liar!

718
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,160
Come on, kill me, I hate you, liar!

719
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,680
I hate you, liar, you're lying to me...

720
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,840
- Calm down. Calm down!
- ... I hate you!

721
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,800
Liar!
Liar!

722
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,120
You're not my mum, you're a liar!

723
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,360
<i>You're not my mum, you're a liar!</i>

724
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,080
<i>You're not my mum, you're a liar!</i>

725
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,880
<i>Liar!
Liar, liar!</i>

726
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

727
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,680
It's OK, sweetie.

728
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,400
Holy shit.

729
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,880
How are you ma'am.

730
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,880
Hey, man.
What can I do for you?

731
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,880
Would you start by
accepting my apologies

732
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,000
this late visit, I hope I
not interrupt your dinner.

733
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,920
No, that's fine.

734
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,760
I've been walking into all the empty
farms around there in the hot sun,

735
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,920
I just...

736
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,600
take this one off the list,

737
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,920
- or I'd have to come back tomorrow
- What this is about?

738
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,920
You're alone here, madame?

739
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,520
My husband should be back
from the city anytime now.

740
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,040
Happy to hear it.

741
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,360
Can I trouble you for some water?

742
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,520
I'll get you some,
and you take the glass with you.

743
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,880
I'm sorry ma'am. My business today, is...

744
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,760
ticking off the list business,
it's gonna require me coming here.

745
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,080
If that's all right.

746
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,720
Will you tell me what this is about?

747
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,640
I will, yeah.

748
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,360
Can I come in?

749
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,200
Madame?

750
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,880
I am a sworn police officer,

751
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,000
and I'm looking for fugitives.

752
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,560
Have you seen anybody those past two days?
Vagrants?

753
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,600
Vagrants are always wandering around.

754
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,080
- That man?
- He is young? No.

755
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,640
We're looking for his father too,
similar look and build,

756
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,240
end fifties.
You may meet each of them together.

757
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,760
You recognize them?

758
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,840
- No.
- Keep it.

759
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,080
Your kids are with your husband?

760
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,960
- Yeah, just one.
- How old?

761
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,000
Ten.

762
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,200
I show you the barn, and then the house,

763
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,640
and then you can be on your way.

764
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,880
I took the liberty with your barn.
Apologies.

765
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,920
So... The house.

766
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,000
- 10, you said, your boy?
- Yeah.

767
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,000
And your husband?

768
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,400
I just got to check in, the Home Office.

769
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,680
You said the boy is the city
with his father. When is he getting back?

770
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,080
Can't tell you.

771
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,920
This Goddamn thing.
You never get the signal this far out.

772
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
Piece of shit.

773
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,040
Ok, here we go.

774
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,400
Is this man dangerous?

775
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,200
He shoots men down for a living.
He is a cold-blooded killer.

776
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,080
My boss says half of the city
is looking for him.

777
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,200
Half of the city then me, so...

778
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,640
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a prize.

779
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,560
A chunk of money like that.

780
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,320
You think of it.

781
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,680
- I will.
- Alright.

782
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,520
You show me upstairs?

783
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,800
There's drafts in the house.

784
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,840
My grand dad dug this tunnel when
the vagrants rixe got bad.

785
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,240
the cuest nuts.

786
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,680
Thank you Grand dad.

787
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,560
That wasn't the man?

788
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,320
No. It's funny, I know though,

789
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,920
his name's Jessie.

790
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,720
I like him, he's good.

791
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,280
He's gonna go away
once he didn't find me.

792
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,240
He won't harm your mum...
Sara.

793
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,000
Where is your mum?

794
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,480
Where's my mum?

795
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,840
she... she gave me up.
I was younger than you.

796
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,880
They were vagrants, and she was alone.

797
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,000
For a long time, I thought

798
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,920
she was stupid for getting
on that junction,

799
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,560
resigning, but now I see, she was...

800
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,520
so alone.

801
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,480
That's what she had.

802
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,080
And she sold me to a begging little gang,

803
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,160
I got away and I ran,
I went on this train,

804
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,320
I remember seeing there an empty car.

805
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,320
I saw myself over and over again,

806
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,480
killing those men who bought me.

807
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,040
When I got my mum, she was... finding her

808
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,480
would tear me apart... saving my mum.

809
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,400
What did you do then?

810
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,040
A man in the city found me,

811
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,920
put a gun in my hand,
gave me something to worry.

812
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,640
It's just that men try to figure out
what they would do

813
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,960
to keep what's theirs.
Their take out.

814
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,360
This is the only kind of man there is.

815
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,200
I'm not going to let Sara get killed.

816
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,400
I think we're clear.

817
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,720
All working girls, yeah?

818
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,880
This whole block,

819
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,640
back-up all blocks over.

820
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,440
Hello Joe...

821
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,600
Watch out those too, I can arrange.

822
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm an arranger, stranger.

823
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,840
But if you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

824
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,280
What?

825
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,960
What happened?

826
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,800
That's pretty good.

827
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,920
In the city, young guys
would head on me by...

828
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,480
flying fucking quarters.

829
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,480
I wouldn't tell that I was TK, but...

830
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,920
I would keep their quarters down.

831
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
This one guy...

832
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,400
busted a vein, I saw, in his eye,

833
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,760
trying to get it high.

834
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,040
He's you.

835
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,680
Your loop.

836
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,880
You lied to me.

837
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,120
But I know you're not lying when you
said you're gonna kill this guy...

838
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,480
your own self.

839
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,920
You protected Sid from that Gat man.

840
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,600
- Come on...
- Yeah.

841
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,160
- Yeah...
- He saved your ass, didn't he?

842
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,880
He saved my ass, yeah.

843
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,200
He's a...

844
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,640
He's a good kid.

845
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,160
Yeah, he is.

846
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,960
You know when I came back,
after my sister died,

847
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,400
I remember seeing him,

848
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,400
for the first time in two years
just sitting on the porch,

849
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,760
I drove up, crying,
I had been in this...

850
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,480
party all night in the city,
when I called...

851
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,440
and so I was wearing this
ridiculous party dress,

852
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,640
my, ridiculous shit.

853
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,120
And I don't know if he...

854
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,760
if he even remembered me, but...

855
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,920
but he looked at me.

856
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,800
I abandoned him.

857
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,200
I abandoned my baby.

858
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,560
And I've seen so many men in the city,

859
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,800
This empty look in their
eyes, and just lost...

860
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,680
So whether he loves me back, or not,

861
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,600
as long as I'm there to raise him..

862
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,160
he's gonna be taken care of.

863
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,920
He's gonna be safe.

864
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,600
He's never gonna get lost.

865
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,280
- Hello Joe.
- Jessie.

866
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,920
Put this down, let her go.

867
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,880
Sarah, Jessie here is the best
shoot with the Gat that I know.

868
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,760
So when he lets you go, just sit down
on the couch, don't do anything stupid.

869
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,360
He's coming here, Jessie,
my loop is coming here.

870
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,880
I've got to take you in there.

871
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,360
I've got 948 bars of pure silver.

872
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,080
I close my loop, I get back with Abe,

873
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,280
whatever he gives me back,
I'll split with you.

874
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,280
Was that your plan?

875
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,160
Okay, take all of it.

876
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,680
Are you delusional?
You didn't ride with anyone.

877
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,480
As long as Abe has got one Gat man's down,

878
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,160
he gonna be hunting you
'till his dying day.

879
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,200
We're gonna go now.
I'm gonna get my truck,

880
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,560
and we're just gone...

881
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,000
I'm sorry.

882
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,720
The Rainmaker...

883
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,160
My God...

884
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,520
Sid. Sid!

885
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,360
Sid!

886
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,040
It's him!

887
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,960
What is he, some TK freak?

888
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,040
You knew.

889
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,320
- What are you doing with those guns?
- How did your sister die?

890
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,440
- What are you doing with those guns!
- How did your sister die!

891
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,040
How did she die,
is that what happened to her?

892
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,680
- No. No, no.
- Did he kill her like that?

893
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,600
No, listen, he was climbing
a bookshelf, okay,

894
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,440
and it... it fell back on him, and...

895
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,720
- he can get scared and explode...
- Jesus, fuck!

896
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,560
.. but one day he'll learn to control it.

897
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,760
Yeah, I know he will,
and imagine what he's gonna do!

898
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,440
But if he did good with it, though,

899
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,640
if he grew up, wouldn't it raise him?

900
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,960
If he grew up good?

901
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,600
He doesn't.

902
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,960
You stay away from him, Joe!

903
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,520
Sid! Sid, stay away from Joe, baby.

904
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,960
Won't you, baby?

905
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,560
Come here, it's okay.

906
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,600
It's okay, baby.

907
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,320
Now right now two things have happened.

908
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,600
My loop knows Sid
is the kid he's looking for,

909
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,120
and my gang knows I'm here.

910
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,400
That means that in 15 minutes

911
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,400
one or both of them
is coming down the highway.

912
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,240
Back-up the Gat man's truck,
take everything that fits and go,

913
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,960
driving North, away from the city.

914
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,600
Thank you.

915
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,760
I've got everyone here, all our men.

916
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,640
Arm them up, let's go.

917
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,920
I got him Abe. I got him!

918
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,920
Well, cheers...

919
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,880
Right, motherfuckers!

920
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,640
I got him!

921
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,640
He had a sweet on
this one particular whore, so

922
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,760
I checked her building...

923
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,040
They found Joe too,
they're on a farm on the east side.

924
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,120
That's why all the Gats came here,

925
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,040
the whole crew is armed
up to make up a sweep.

926
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,080
Joe.

927
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,880
Fuck Joe!
Save your bullets, I've got the loop!

928
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,800
Not such a fucker mellow,
I'll bring him up to see Abe.

929
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,680
Gats, shoot!

930
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,800
Shoot!

931
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,440
Holy shit.

932
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,960
Joe!

933
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,440
I used to put a gun in that kid's hand,

934
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,720
I guess it comes back around.

935
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,520
Like your Goddamn ties...

936
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,640
Take this truck, you take
your gold and go live your life.

937
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,080
Nobody's coming after you.
I've fixed it.

938
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,560
Are you gonna kill the boy,
is that how you fix it?

939
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,080
You're Goddamn right
I'm gonna kill that boy.

940
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,080
You've just got your life back.

941
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,920
My life!?
Your life!

942
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,720
Becoming you.

943
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,320
Goddammit! You've lost your fucking mind,

944
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,400
You let the boy live,

945
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,520
he will take everything you've got!

946
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,680
And everything I've got!

947
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,280
You've seen what he becomes.

948
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,960
I haven't seen that yet.

949
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,480
Okay baby, we're gone.

950
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,640
Put your seatbelt on.

951
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,840
- Stop.
- Tap down, baby, it's okay.

952
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,440
- Stop, please, he's gonna shoot us.
- Tap down, baby!

953
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,200
Stop. He's gonna
shoot us! Stop!

954
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,960
- Please, get...
- Stop! Stop, stop!

955
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,680
- Sid...
- I'm sorry.

956
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:42,600
It' okay. It's okay,
I'm gonna get you down.

957
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,120
Ok, we'll go and hide in the cane.

958
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,720
Go. Go!

959
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,760
Go.

960
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,280
No!

961
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,200
No, Sid, no...

962
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:13,080
Noooooon...

963
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,720
It's okay, baby...

964
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,520
It's okay...

965
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,160
I love you, calm down.

966
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,200
Good boy...

967
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,400
Mummy loves you.

968
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,280
Mummy loves you.

969
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,080
I's okay...

970
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,320
Mom.

971
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,680
You did good, you did so good,

972
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,200
Good boy.

973
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,000
Okay, listen to me.

974
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,080
I need you to run into the fields.

975
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,560
No mom, no, I don't wanna leave you.

976
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,000
- It's okay.
- I don't want to leave you, Mom. No!

977
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,120
It's okay, baby. Go, Go!

978
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,640
Move! Move, Goddammit!

979
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,920
Move.

980
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,960
<i>Then I saw it.</i>

981
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,520
<i>I saw a mum who would die for her son.</i>

982
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,720
<i>A man who would kill for his wife.</i>

983
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,960
<i>A boy angry and alone.</i>

984
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,200
<i>Lay down and frightened.
The bad path, I saw it.</i>

985
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,480
<i>and the path was a circle.</i>

986
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,880
<i>Round and round.</i>

987
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,360
<i>So I changed it.</i>

988
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,680
Sid!

989
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,360
Where is Joe?

990
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,520
He had to go away, baby.
