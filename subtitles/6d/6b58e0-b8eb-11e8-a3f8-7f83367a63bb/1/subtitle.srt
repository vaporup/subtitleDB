1
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:25,020
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.

2
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:29,651
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.

3
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:34,996
They lost 14 banks in one week.

4
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,836
There's nothing available for you,
right now.

5
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:59,804
They use their tongues to
deceive you. Venom is on their lips.

6
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:06,273
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

7
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:10,816
The fear of God
is not before their eyes.

8
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:19,123
They have taken
the hearts and minds of our leaders.

9
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,453
They have blinded us to the truth.

10
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,754
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?

11
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:34,922
Outside the limit of our sight
they're feeding off us.

12
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,973
Perched on top of us
from birth to death, are our owners.

13
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:47,065
They have us. They control us.
They are our masters.

14
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:51,191
Wake up.
They're all around you.

15
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:23,430
<i>Sometimes when I watch TV
I stop being myself. I'm a star</i>

16
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:29,519
<i>I have my own talk show Or I'm
on the news getting out of a limo</i>

17
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:34,896
<i>All I ever have to do is be famous
People watch me</i>

18
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:38,616
<i>And they love me</i>

19
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:44,451
<i>I never grow old, and I never die</i>

20
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:06,514
Excuse me,
do you need anybody?

21
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:12,064
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.

22
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:17,031
This is a union job.

23
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:29,783
May I please speak
with the shop steward, sir?

24
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,288
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.

25
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:15,666
Excuse me, when do I get paid?

26
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:18,420
Thursday.

27
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:33,689
Do you need a place to stay?

28
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,614
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.

29
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:13,223
I don't like being followed
unless I know why.

30
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,228
I don't turn up with anybody
until I see where he's going.

31
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,340
They'll be serving food up soon.

32
00:08:57,024 --> 00:09:03,477
This is Gilbert. Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

33
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,943
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,949
If you can use them,
you can fix the shower over there.

35
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,499
Let's get something to eat.

36
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:40,180
- More?
- Yeah.

37
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:52,654
I've got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

38
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,117
I haven't seen them in six months.

39
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:03,419
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.

40
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:12,429
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.

41
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:19,396
The golden rule: He who has the gold
makes the rules.

42
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:28,737
If they close one more factory, we
should take a sledge to their foreign cars.

43
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:34,025
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.

44
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:39,785
The whole deal
is some kind of crazy game.

45
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:44,746
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.

46
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:51,582
Only everyone is out for themselves
and looking to do you in.

47
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:58,518
You do what you can, but I'm going
to do my best to blow your ass away.

48
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:10,821
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.

49
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:15,408
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.

50
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:21,406
Everybody has got
their own hard times, these days.

51
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:49,892
<i>You thought press-on nails would
impede all the active things you do</i>

52
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:55,567
<i>We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking,
easy-to-apply nails</i>

53
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:59,864
<i>There's seven different colors</i>

54
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:04,291
<i>Our impulses are being redirected</i>

55
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,004
<i>We live in an artifiicially-induced
state of consciousness</i>

56
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:15,292
Goddamn hacker. That's the second
time tonight that asshole has cut in.

57
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:20,256
<i>The movement began eight months ago
by a group of scientists</i>

58
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:25,635
<i>They accidentally discovered
these signals being sent</i>

59
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:31,978
That thing's giving me a headache.

60
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:35,978
It must have taken him months
to figure out how to do this.

61
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:42,735
<i>The under-class is growing
Human rights are non-existent</i>

62
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:50,832
<i>In their repressive society, we
are their unwitting accomplices</i>

63
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:57,720
<i>Their intention to rule rests with
the annihilation of consciousness</i>

64
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:04,892
<i>We have been lulled into a trance
They have made us indifferent</i>

65
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:10,642
<i>We are focused
only on our own gain</i>

66
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:23,281
<i>They are safe
as long as they are not discovered</i>

67
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:29,081
<i>That is their method of survival
Keep us asleep Keep us selfiish</i>

68
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:34,916
<i>- Keep us sedated
- Blow it out of your ass.</i>

69
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:06,919
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.

70
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:14,394
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.

71
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:30,073
<i>The sleeping middle-class
is suddenly becoming poor</i>

72
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:36,455
<i>We are their cattle
We are being bred for slavery</i>

73
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:42,964
<i>- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal</i>

74
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:48,715
<i>The signal must be shut off
at the source</i>

75
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,966
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.

76
00:15:55,729 --> 00:16:01,482
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.

77
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,660
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP

78
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,972
There's nothing wrong with it.

79
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:02,056
Only a few seconds got on the air.

80
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,099
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.

81
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:13,936
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work. We've discussed this.

82
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:17,158
We have no other choice.

83
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:31,716
Robbing banks. Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.

84
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,513
We've got to find strong people
who'll work with us.

85
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:18,505
I'm just leaving. Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.

86
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:24,261
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.

87
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:27,727
Now your hands.

88
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:32,600
You're a working man.
The revolution ...

89
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:38,405
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.

90
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:44,699
This world may have blinded me,
but the Lord let me see.

91
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:48,199
You'll be back.

92
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:10,472
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.

93
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:14,188
An epidemic of violence
is what they're saying.

94
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:18,102
I was talking
to one old boy from San Anselmo.

95
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:24,656
He says up there they're talking
end-of-the-world kind of stuff.

96
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:44,262
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.

97
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:51,519
A whole lot of people going crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

98
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:59,518
The truth is, this kind of shit
happens at the end of every century.

99
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:03,984
It's just people
afraid to face the future.

100
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,664
What's happening?

101
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:22,249
I was inside there. It's full of boxes
and some kind of lab setup.

102
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:26,762
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.

103
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:34,137
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.

104
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:38,020
Gilbert is in there helping them.

105
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:48,446
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.

106
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:54,284
I don't bother nobody. Nobody bothers
me. You should do the same.

107
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:07,591
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.

108
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:15,725
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

109
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:07,402
Step down. Easy. This way.

110
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:16,162
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.

111
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,114
Go, go!

112
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:43,425
Frank!

113
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,401
Leave us alone.
We know you.

''Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil.''

115
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,135
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

116
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,825

- She served tortillas! So dated!

- Go for it, man.

You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.

152
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:29,348
I take these glasses off,
she looks like a regular person.

153
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:35,320
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.

You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.

Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.

Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?

161
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:46,548

- Cut yourself shaving?

You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

164
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:02,814
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.

165
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:11,827
You stumbled onto something here,
but maybe we can all benefit from it.

166
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:18,125
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk this over.

167
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:42,683
You bastards die just like we do.

168
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:35,986
I have come here to chew bubblegum
and kick ass.

169
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:42,582
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

170
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:03,682
Near the entrance. Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s. Long hair.

171
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:08,976
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.

172
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,590
And who are you?

173
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:45,470
Come to show them where I am.

174
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:57,116
Drop it.

175
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,951
Drop it.

176
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:10,047
Beat it.

177
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:51,952
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.

178
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:58,676
Close the door.

179
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,345
Drive.

180
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,060
Not too fast.

181
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,262
They're gone.

182
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,058
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?

183
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,642
- Are you married?
- Yes.

184
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,856
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.

185
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,453
Live alone?

186
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,906
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.

187
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:16,539
I'm afraid I must insist.

188
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,661
Hi, Holly!

189
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:30,819
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.

190
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:37,373
It's like a drug. Wearing
these glasses makes you high ...

191
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:40,124
... but you come down hard.

192
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:46,459
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.

193
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:53,183
I'm sorry,
but I needed you to get away.

194
00:46:53,393 --> 00:47:01,483
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.

195
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:11,197
We're in trouble. They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.

196
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:16,701
We're being controlled by these things
and we've got to stop them.

197
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:24,461
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

198
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:28,623
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

199
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:37,267
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.

200
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:45,901
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.

201
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:51,402
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.

202
00:47:56,246 --> 00:48:04,159
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ... It's your way.

203
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:50,713
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.

204
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:57,761
Go ahead.

205
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:24,289
I'm sorry I have to be here.

206
00:49:37,263 --> 00:49:43,100
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.

207
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:50,433
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?

208
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:57,359
Assistant program director. Cable 54.

209
00:49:57,575 --> 00:50:04,111
A TV station? They're sending
signals out of TV sets.

210
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:23,008
No, I'm all right.

211
00:50:31,692 --> 00:50:37,149
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.

212
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:56,170
Yes, I'll hold.

213
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,882
Frank?

214
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:09,555
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.

215
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:13,549
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?

216
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:17,351
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

217
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:20,316
You ain't showing me nothing.

218
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:24,737
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.

219
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:29,655
Get out of here.

220
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,320
No!

221
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:33,697
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.

222
00:55:38,454 --> 00:55:40,944
Wait!

223
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:44,533
You'd better find someplace to hide.

224
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:48,036
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!

225
00:55:48,254 --> 00:55:52,751
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.

226
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:02,844
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

227
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:07,474
You can't even save yourself.

228
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:16,405
I'm giving you a choice. Put these on
or start eating that trash can.

229
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:21,191
- Not this year.
- Okay.

230
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,367
Come on.

231
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:51,980
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.

232
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,944
Put on the glasses.

233
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,253
I told you
I didn't want to be involved.

234
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:32,356
Dirty motherfucker.

235
00:57:47,123 --> 00:57:51,167
Take a look. Put them on.

236
00:57:56,881 --> 00:57:58,838
No!

237
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:39,649
I'm sorry.

238
00:59:56,583 --> 01:00:00,166
Put the glasses on. Put them on!

239
01:00:22,942 --> 01:00:25,814
Fuck you!

240
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:24,623
Look! They're everywhere.

241
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:28,122
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.

242
01:01:29,926 --> 01:01:35,264
Hold on. You aren't the first one
to wake up out of a dream.

243
01:01:35,473 --> 01:01:37,928
What's that?

244
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:52,728
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.

245
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:34,984
I want a room.

246
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:25,696
Ain't love grand?

247
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:34,171
CONFORM

248
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:52,597
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.

249
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:02,570
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?

250
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:07,447
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.

251
01:04:07,665 --> 01:04:12,208
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?

252
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:18,087
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

253
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:24,136
When you get your master plan,
you let me know.

254
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:36,857
If we can see, we've got to find
the people who made these.

255
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:42,730
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

256
01:04:59,174 --> 01:05:04,050
A long time ago,
things were different.

257
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:12,677
Daddy took me down to the river and
told me about the power and the glory.

258
01:05:12,896 --> 01:05:15,648
I was saved.

259
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:23,484
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.

260
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:29,660
I ran away when I was 13.

261
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:37,117
He tried to cut me once
with a big old razor.

262
01:05:37,336 --> 01:05:44,502
He held it up against my throat.
I said: ''Daddy, please.''

263
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:52,300
He kept moving back and forth,
like he was sawing down a tree.

264
01:05:57,064 --> 01:06:02,485
Maybe they've always been with us,
those things out there.

265
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:08,235
Maybe they love it,
seeing us hate each other.

266
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:13,871
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.

267
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,461
I've got news for him.

268
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:24,538
There's going to be hell to pay.

269
01:06:24,758 --> 01:06:29,965
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.

270
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:56,486
Frank?

271
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:15,761
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.

272
01:07:17,936 --> 01:07:21,387
The world needs a wake-up call.

273
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:27,060
We're going to phone it in.

274
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:46,459
Hey brothers ...

275
01:07:48,174 --> 01:07:51,709
There's something new going down.

276
01:08:18,663 --> 01:08:25,543
They're using candyfloss packaging
to cover up a toxic waste dump.

277
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:43,553
Frank, glad you made it. Take your
glasses off. We're all human in here.

278
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:57,742
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.

279
01:08:58,952 --> 01:09:02,701
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.

280
01:09:04,499 --> 01:09:07,252
Go ahead.

281
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:31,433
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.

282
01:09:31,651 --> 01:09:35,899
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.

283
01:09:36,114 --> 01:09:43,492
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.

284
01:09:43,705 --> 01:09:47,620
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.

285
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:54,667
Promotions, bank accounts,
new houses, cars.

286
01:09:54,882 --> 01:10:00,304
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.

287
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:09,685
<i>Fluorocarbons have increased since
1958 Earth is being acclimatised</i>

288
01:10:09,897 --> 01:10:14,275
<i>They are turning our atmosphere
into their atmosphere</i>

289
01:10:14,486 --> 01:10:19,443
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.

290
01:10:19,657 --> 01:10:25,862
The earth is just another developing
planet. Their third world.

291
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:30,125
<i>deplete the planet,
move on to another</i>

292
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:37,582
<i>They want benign indifference
We could be pets or food</i>

293
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,134
<i>But all we really are is livestock</i>

294
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:49,382
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.

295
01:10:49,603 --> 01:10:55,025
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?

296
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:58,069
Once.

297
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:02,442
- What's that?
- One of their watches.

298
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:07,865
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.

299
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:17,957
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...

300
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:24,258
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.

301
01:11:24,471 --> 01:11:30,758
Listen up. We're obviously
not getting to enough people.

302
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:37,016
There should be twice as many people
here. We're getting too sloppy.

303
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:43,402
Their detection
is becoming more effective.

304
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,949
Stay aware. Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.

305
01:11:50,163 --> 01:11:53,781
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.

306
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,497
Stop talking about it. It's time
we started spilling some blood.

307
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:08,549
Wait a minute! We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

308
01:12:08,764 --> 01:12:12,715
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.

309
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:17,811
We locate their signal
and shut it off.

310
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:25,154
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.

311
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:28,235
KRDA is clear.

312
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:33,196
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.

313
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:45,832
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal is coming from.

314
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,966
I've got to talk to someone.

315
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:09,029
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

316
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:14,152
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.

317
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:22,831
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

318
01:13:32,056 --> 01:13:35,306
I just want to ...

319
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:37,934
Can we ...?

320
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,893
Get out!

321
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:40,547
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.

322
01:15:41,392 --> 01:15:45,520
There's nothing you can do out there.

323
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:52,525
If I can get this working,
I can listen in.

324
01:15:58,575 --> 01:16:01,066
- Frank...
- What?

325
01:16:01,286 --> 01:16:04,536
- Get set.
- Shit!

326
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:13,547
- What was that?
- I don't know.

327
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:24,632
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...

328
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:28,683
Move! Down there!

329
01:16:29,731 --> 01:16:32,816
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.

330
01:16:37,447 --> 01:16:40,116
Two seconds.
One second.

331
01:16:43,744 --> 01:16:46,995
If you need assistance
in finding your destination, -

332
01:16:47,207 --> 01:16:52,283
- bilingual instructions
are posted in each corridor.

333
01:16:54,463 --> 01:16:58,164
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

334
01:16:58,385 --> 01:17:02,464
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.

335
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,678
Some kind of underground base.

336
01:17:06,892 --> 01:17:12,729
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.

337
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:26,657
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.

338
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,534
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!

339
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,961
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.

340
01:17:45,222 --> 01:17:47,891
I'm hearing something.

341
01:18:04,825 --> 01:18:10,448
By the year 2025,
America and the entire planet -

342
01:18:10,664 --> 01:18:15,491
- will be under the protection
of this power alliance.

343
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:22,923
The gains have been substantial for us
and for you, the human power-elite.

344
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:39,560
You have given us the resources
we need for our expansion.

345
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:43,940
In return, the per-capita income
of each of you has grown.

346
01:18:44,156 --> 01:18:49,232
This year alone,
it's an average 39%.

347
01:18:57,961 --> 01:19:01,709
I've received word that our forces
have won a major victory.

348
01:19:01,923 --> 01:19:07,961
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed.

349
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:12,259
The situation is normal again.

350
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:19,303
Hi boys, I didn't know
you'd been recruited.

351
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:24,352
You should have dressed
for the party now you can afford it.

352
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:32,202
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?

353
01:19:32,411 --> 01:19:37,537
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.

354
01:19:39,127 --> 01:19:46,208
I knew we had a lot in common
the first time we met.

355
01:19:53,766 --> 01:19:59,601
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.

356
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:06,777
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?

357
01:20:06,987 --> 01:20:13,025
I know it's only for emergency,
but they're so much fun.

358
01:20:14,745 --> 01:20:20,451
You think that's something,
take a look at this.

359
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:23,953
<i>- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters</i>

360
01:20:24,171 --> 01:20:29,462
<i>Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda
is now ready</i>

361
01:20:29,677 --> 01:20:33,211
That's where they come from.

362
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:59,412
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.

363
01:20:59,623 --> 01:21:05,707
It puts a bend in the light and
you move from place to place.

364
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,583
The whole thing
works like one big airport.

365
01:21:12,469 --> 01:21:19,217
They've got their act together,
believe you me.

366
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:33,234
Evening, boys. Looking sharp.

367
01:21:33,448 --> 01:21:37,113
Wait till you see
what I'm going to show you now.

368
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,039
Here's the brains of the operation.

369
01:21:50,256 --> 01:21:54,752
The signal goes out through
the satellite all over the world.

370
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:59,845
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.

371
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:20,191
This is as far as we go.

372
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:32,291
Can you get us inside? I've never
seen the inside of a TV studio.

373
01:22:32,506 --> 01:22:38,626
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.

374
01:22:38,846 --> 01:22:42,974
Those boys over there
are friends of mine.

375
01:22:43,183 --> 01:22:49,435
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?

376
01:22:49,648 --> 01:22:54,191
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?

377
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,858
Right here.

378
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:01,192
Watch the door.

379
01:23:05,205 --> 01:23:10,412
- Soundproof. Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.

380
01:23:11,294 --> 01:23:19,124
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.

381
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:22,630
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.

382
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:28,090
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.

383
01:23:28,311 --> 01:23:34,729
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.

384
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:38,987
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.

385
01:23:39,197 --> 01:23:43,858
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.

386
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:49,071
If we help them, they'll leave us
alone to make some money.

387
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:54,794
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.

388
01:23:55,004 --> 01:23:59,334
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?

389
01:23:59,551 --> 01:24:04,675
We all sell out every day,
might as well be on the winning team.

390
01:24:07,183 --> 01:24:09,554
See you, boys.

391
01:24:10,353 --> 01:24:12,476
Let's go.

392
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:21,482
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.

393
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:35,789
What the hell is going on?

394
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:53,385
Down!

395
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:07,949
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.

396
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:15,705
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?

397
01:25:15,918 --> 01:25:19,998
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.

398
01:25:20,213 --> 01:25:25,753
Security alert. Sections Delta
and X-ray report to the fourth floor.

399
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:28,424
Who's Holly?

400
01:25:30,307 --> 01:25:32,549
Shit!

401
01:25:35,353 --> 01:25:41,356
I hate to interrupt. Could you
tell me how to get to the roof?

402
01:25:41,567 --> 01:25:47,487
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.

403
01:26:01,379 --> 01:26:06,455
There's got to be more than one way
to get up there.

404
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:13,007
Security 950. They're on the move.

405
01:26:53,973 --> 01:26:59,845
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st. We've got them.

406
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,786
Holly!

407
01:27:42,521 --> 01:27:44,762
Come on!

408
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:50,142
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.

409
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:27,226
Frank! Are you and Holly clear?

410
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:32,101
I'm clear, are you?

411
01:28:34,781 --> 01:28:37,450
Don't do it.

412
01:28:42,997 --> 01:28:45,951
Don't interfere. You can't win.

413
01:28:55,676 --> 01:28:58,167
Drop your weapon.

414
01:28:59,847 --> 01:29:04,425
Stand away from the dish
or we'll open fire.

415
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:11,179
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds. Nine ...

416
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:14,354
Eight. Seven.

417
01:29:15,738 --> 01:29:18,229
Six.

418
01:30:00,573 --> 01:30:04,488
<i>The Oscar winners
give a press conference</i>

419
01:30:04,703 --> 01:30:10,408
<i>- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?</i>

420
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:15,537
<i>All the sex and violence on the
screen has gone too far for me</i>

421
01:30:15,755 --> 01:30:22,671
<i>I'm fed up with it Film makers
have to show some restraint</i>

422
01:30:36,484 --> 01:30:38,523
<i>What's wrong, baby?</i>
