1
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,585
In order for you to hear me,

2
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:11,951
my words are soft
I ike a seagul I' s footpr int.

3
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,431
Wonton noodles.

4
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,363
Thank you.

5
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:58,301
Where' s the cute mute gi r I from last t ime?

6
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:01,842
What' s the use of cuteness when you' re mute?

7
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,977
Would you have let me marry a dea f gi r I?

8
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,415
What a pi ty. She was cute, but she was mute.

9
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,155
She i s not a mute.

10
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,189
She' s hear ing- impa i red.

11
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,124
We can hear.

12
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,196
She can' t.

13
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,535
She has a name, and her name i s Yang Yang.

14
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:30,236
Her s ign language name i s: Yang Yang.

15
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,792
Are you okay?

16
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,328
Eat something.

17
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,039
I don' t want to.

18
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,218
What' s wrong?

19
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:27,553
You don' t make those char i ty boxes anymore.

20
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,755
Rejected?

21
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,190
Reject ion.

22
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,030
I don' t even know i f our love ever started.

23
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:39,604
Has i t rea I I y started?

24
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:40,628
I don' t know.

25
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:43,806
I know.

26
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,877
Before I met your mother,

27
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:48,874
I' ve been rejected 23 t imes.

28
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:50,681
23 t imes?

29
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,850
Quiet down or your mom wi I I hear me.

30
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,976
Turn on the faucet.

31
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,718
Come.

32
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,551
Dad, I' m surpr i sed
you have such a r ich hi story.

33
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:03,592
I t was just tough luck,

34
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,558
not being able to meet your mother f i rst.

35
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:09,527
She' s a good woman.

36
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,800
Even though she' s loud and nagging,

37
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:15,668
but she st i I I takes care of
the household and us.

38
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:17,371
Just now,

39
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,005
she yel led at you outs ide,

40
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,912
then she came in and tel I s me to console you.

41
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,276
That' s how she i s.

42
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:28,476
She seems tough but she' s soft hearted.

43
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,479
What do you mean?

44
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,984
She' s got a kni fe for a mouth
and tofu for a heart.

45
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,321
0h.

46
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:38,227
Honest I y,

47
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,297
what k ind of gi r I s do you I ike?

48
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,293
When you' re in a stable relat ionship,

49
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,903
don' t forget to br ing her home
so we can meet her.

50
00:06:58,883 --> 00:06:59,815
Dad,

51
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:04,416
would you let me date...

52
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,921
a gi r I who can' t hear?

53
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,005
Dear,

54
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:26,939
What' s up? Did he say anything?

55
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,281
I s he st i I I sad?

56
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:34,886
What k ind of a gi r I,

57
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,911

58
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:40,089
I would I ike to see i f she i s fat or sk inny.

59
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:43,450
She can' t hear.

60
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:47,396
Can' t hear?

61
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,666
You mean "can' t hear"
as in her ears don' t work?

62
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:55,066
Duh. What el se could i t be? Her nose?

63
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,010
Move the cha i rs.

64
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,350
Dear, you okay?

65
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:09,382
I' m f ine.

66
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,490
Tian Kuo sa id that a I though she can' t hear,

67
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:17,628
she i s a hard work ing,
opt imi st ic, cute, I i vel y,

68
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,858

69
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:20,691
0h.

70
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,734
She i s nice to her s i ster,
and everyone around her.

71
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:24,268
Uh.

72
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,257
Tian Kuo sa id so.

73
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,166
There' s nothing wrong
wi th not being able to hear.

74
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,571
So long as you don' t say anything
no one wi I I know.

75
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,009
What i f you need to say something?

76
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,712
Then wr i te i t down.

77
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,048
Don' forget that Tian Kuo know s ign language.

78
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:47,651
Tian Kuo does, but we don' t.

79
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,091
No.

80
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,153
That' s true.

81
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:59,492
(March to Dea f I ympics- X iao Peng #1)

82
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,050
Tian Kuo.

83
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,228
Huang Tian Kuo.

84
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,220
Come down and go del i ver lunch boxes.

85
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,929
How many take outs?

86
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:32,103
Three.

87
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,092
Three take- outs.

88
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,507
Where i s he?

89
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,202
Doesn' t he know we' re busy?

90
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,072
What.

91
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,876
Your s ign language sucks.
Luck i I y I understand.

92
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:48,953
Go. Go. Go.

93
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,221
I don' t need you to tel I me.

94
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,245

Buy or eat something wi th thi s money.

00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,639
0h, yeah, and...

111
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,308
Cheer up.

112
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:53,445
Ah?

113
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:56,949
Yes, yes, yes...

114
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,811
Cheer up i s the way to go.

115
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,347
Are you st i I I mad at me?

116

I' m love- s ick. Don' t hi t me.

121
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,622
Gi r I s should' nt be so narrow minded.

I a I ready sa id I didn' t look down
on sma I I money.

123
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,492
Wi I I you stop being unreasonable?

124
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,891
Who would be angry for cash or coins?

125
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,839
Don' t think you' re the onl y one wi th digni ty.

126
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,363
I have temper too.

127
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,375
I t' s f ini shed.

128
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:19,373
She' I I never ta lked to me aga in.

129
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,380
I sn' t an apology enough?

130
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:56,512
What' s up?

131
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,148
Are you okay?

132

I' m f ine.

133
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:03,854
We' re going to eat later.

134
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:04,821
You want to come?

135
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,052
Sure.

136
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:32,106
Just go back.

137
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:33,547
You?

138
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:35,816
I' I I wa i t for them.

139
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,248
I can wa i t wi th you.

140
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:39,851
There' s no need.

141
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,988
We' re going to eat later.

142
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:44,826
I can go wi th you guys.

143
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,297
I don' t want you to come.

144
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:44,119
(The end i s near. Start plant ing trees.)

145
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,461
(0ne tree.)

146
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:59,926
(Two trees.)

147
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:15,418
(Three trees make a beaut i ful forest.)

148
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,219
(0ne acre of ra in forest vani sh each second)

149
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,588
(which i s the s i ze of two footba I I f ields)

150
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,524
(137 spec ies of anima I s

151
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:30,427
(I f the s i tuat ion cont inues,)

152
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:32,863
(The water bi rds may soon be ext inct.)

153
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:34,731
(So to prevent that from happening to you,)

154
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:37,825
(Take me and plant me in your home.)

155
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:48,537
Have you ever thought that
we might not get a long?

156
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:57,614
Not everyone can love water bi rds and trees.

157
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,489
Maybe someone wants me to di sappear.

158
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:03,815
And you...

159
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,520
become ext inct.

160
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,407
You drank a Icohol?

161
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,190
What were you think ing?

162
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,327
You' ve just recovered, you can' t dr ink.

163
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,658
What i f i t a ffects your tra ining?

164
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,157
Have you forgotten your dream?

165
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:55,269
You onl y care about my dreams.

166
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,501
What about yours?

167
00:22:58,141 --> 00:22:58,971
What?

168
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:03,613
What i s your dream?

169
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:07,845
Doesn' t I i v ing for another person bother you?

170
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,219
What are you ta lk ing about?

171
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:10,811
Your dream i s my dream.

172
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:15,323
Why must you stea I my dream?

173
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,098
Stea I?

174
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,132
You are you, and I am I.

175
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:37,811
Why do you project my dream on yoursel f?

176
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,950
No one can I i ve for another person.

177
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:45,013
I may not be able to hear,
but I st i I I need my own I i fe.

178
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:49,085
I won' t get gold meda I s my ent i re I i fe.

179
00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:55,096
You shouldn' t sacr i f ice your I i fe for me.

180
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:10,576
Can you tel I me what happened?

181
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,751
The coach told me,

182
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,183
My performance has regressed.

183
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,459
I t' s probabl y going to a ffect my el igibi I i ty.

184
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,864
You can' t compete anymore?

185
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:34,030
No I can' t.

186
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:40,777
I' ve lost the chance to compete thi s year,

187
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:45,043
the chance to show the wor Id
how hard I' ve worked,

188
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:59,258
and the chance for you
to wave that f lag for me.

189
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:02,028
Al I of the hard work i s wasted.

190
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,464
Sorry.

191
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:13,103
Sorry.

192
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,836
I t' s a I I my faul t.

193
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,379
Sorry.

194
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,216
Don' t you understand?

195
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:33,219
Al I thi s has nothing to do wi th you.

196
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:37,932
I' m not sorry that I cannot get a meda I,

197
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:44,638
i t' s because I can' t get the meda I for you!

198
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,477
For me?

199
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,077
You work so hard.

200
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:55,151
You never go out dat ing.

201
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:57,051
You sk ip mea I s.

202
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:02,192
You' ve sacr i f iced everything for me,

203
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:05,261
but I can' t win a gold meda I for you.

204
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:08,264
How can I face you?

205
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:12,826
How wi I I we pay the loan
wi thout the pr i ze money?

206
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,962
Don' t worry about the loan...

207
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,337
I' m your elder,
but I let you take care of me.

208
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:09,752
Who' s tak ing care of whom, does i t matter?

209
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,831
I don' t want to be your burden.

210
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,549
You are not my burden.

211
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:34,380
You are my s i ster.

212
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:44,293
I onl y need to stand st i I I when I perform.

213
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,129
But when you swim,

214
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:51,465
you' re compet ing in mi I I i-seconds.

215
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,137
To have you as an elder s i ster,

216
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,037
makes me so proud.

217
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:07,310
When we were k ids.

218
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:12,647
You ignored those who bul I ied you.

219
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,614
You never got angry.

220
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:18,623
Yet when someone bul I ied me,

221
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:24,797
you would go and beat them up.

222
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:28,371
Hav ing you as my elder s i ster,

223
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:33,741
I feel so proud.

224
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:45,245
You' ve never been a burden to me.

225
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:50,860
I f there i s a next I i fe,

226
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,355
Wi I I you st i I I be my s i ster?

227
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,514
(Happy Mea I Box Boy: How are you?)

228
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:45,879
(Me too. You need to rest.)

229
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,326
(March to Dea f I ympics- X iao Peng #1:)

230
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:58,161
(You have the wrong person.)

231
00:29:58,161 --> 00:30:02,532
(You must have mi staken me for another gi r l)

232
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:03,430
(I am Yang Yang.)

233
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:07,971
(I know you are Yang Yang.)

234
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,806
(Since you never repl y to my messages,)

235
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,608
(and I can' t stop think ing of you,)

236
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:14,077
(I fantas i zed that you
wrote me many messages)

237
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,578
(Then I repl ied to them.)

238
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,102
(I can go to s leep now.)

239
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,816
(Are we that fami I iar?)

240
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:30,026
(Do you think that we won' t get a long)

241
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:33,894
(because of hear ing problems?)

242
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:43,006
(Do you have a dream?)

243
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:44,707
(Yes.)

244
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,210
(Marry a gi r I,)

245
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,578
(have two k ids.)

246
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,138
(0ne boy, one gi r I.)

247
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:59,589
(I s i t an imposs ible dream,)

248
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,922
(for a hear ing person to date someone)

249
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:08,665
(who i s hear ing impa i red?)

250
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,964
(I t' s eas ier than your s i ster winning a meda l)

251
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,391
Why i s she ignor ing me aga in?

252
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:48,964
Did I say something wrong aga in?

253
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:26,564
Yang Yang

254
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,211
I love you.

255
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:47,824
I love you.

256
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:51,998
She' s gone aga in.

257
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:18,321
I t' s so beaut i ful here.

258
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:27,134
Do you remember catching crabs
when we were k ids?

259
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,308
I do.

260
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:37,680
We a lways returned home
a I I di rty and smel I y.

261
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,810
Mom used to yel I at us so angr i I y.

262
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:50,487
I laughed and sa id that
you ran I ike a water bi rd.

263
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:54,630
A boy once told me,

264
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,394
That I looked I ike a water bi rd.

265
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:02,601
He' s seen you run as wel I?

266
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,547
I s that boy Tian Kuo?

267
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,719
Yes.

268
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:23,292
He looks I ike a good guy.

269
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,283
You two are a good match.

270
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:29,964
I' m not going to date him.

271
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,091
Why?

272
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:43,100
He can' t hear ei ther.

273
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:54,590
Do you I ike him?

274
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,760
I' ve often thought of him.

275
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,294
How come you can' t just say you I ike him?

276
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:14,471
I s i t because of me?

277
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:27,056
Egrettas f I y according to seasons.

278
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:30,293
I hope you can be I ike an water bi rd,

279
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:32,318
and not be conf ined to one place.

280
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:39,995
I f you leave me one day,

281
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,107
and f I y freel y I ike a water bi rd.

282
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:47,302
I would be very happy.

283
00:35:47,743 --> 00:35:50,268
You don' t want me to stay by your s ide?

284
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:51,807
No, I don' t mean that.

285
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:58,254
I want you to bel ieve that
I can be independent.

286
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,313
I didn' t say I don' t bel ieve you.

287
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,758
I f you bel ieve that I could be independent,

288
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,817
why would you reject a dea f person?

289
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:11,434
I t' s because you spend a I I your t ime on me.

290
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:15,605
You think you can' t take care of him.

291
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,267
You don' t think
the dea f can take care of others.

292
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,579
Dad a lways encouraged us,

293
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,845
and told us to never gi ve up.

294
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:32,154
I did not gi ve up swimming.

295
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:35,419
You should not gi ve up on him.

296
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,043
What' s up?

297
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,588
- For me? - Yeah.

298
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:11,961
When did i t arr i ve?

299
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:12,595
I don' t know.

300
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,863
I thought i t belonged to a customer,

301
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,898
but i t sa id Tian Kuo.

302
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,526
You are Huang Tian Kuo, so i t must be yours.

303
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,104
There' s money too.

304
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:26,466
Lots of i t.

305
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,257
Why did you come back?

306
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,225
She probabl y hasn' t gone too far...

307
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:50,598
So what i f I get her back.

308
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,864
Ah?

309
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:54,796
Even i f I get her back,

310
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,298
would you guys accept her?

311
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:11,375
That' s the gi r I who can' t hear?

312
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,591
The hard- work ing, opt imi st ic, cute,

316
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:32,639
Dear.

317
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,812
We should f ind t ime to learn s ign language.

318
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:37,680
Huh?

319
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,772
Ah what?

320
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:41,117
You know.

321
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:42,952
Mommy just loves to ta lk.

322
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,788
Somet imes my chin
gets sore because I ta lks too much.

323
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:48,424
I t' s good to let i t rest every once in a whi le.

324
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,926
That would be better, r ight?

325
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:53,896
Yes, then my ears can rest too.

326
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:54,930
You think I' m noi sy?

327
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,591
You' re the one that sa id i t, not me.

328
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,390
So you guys are okay?

329
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,804
Thank you mom, thank you dad.

330
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:04,902
I love you guys.

331
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:07,834
I love you guys to death.

332
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:58,081

333
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,478
I want to inv i te you home for dinner.

334

00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:21,420

You didn' t come here to see my parents

425
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:15,101

427
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:18,903

We didn' t ta lk.

437
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,411
We used s ign language.

438
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:03,417
Sign language?

439
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:12,599

How did you become
so sk i I led in s ign language?

446
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:37,820
When I was in col lege,

447
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,917
I met a s ign language teacher.

448
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:42,827
He asked me i f I was interested.

449
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,931
So I studied under him.

450
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,994
You must have been a di I igent student.

451
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:55,803
Honest I y, a fter I met you,

452
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:58,606
I spent a lot of work on my s ign language.

453
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:19,593
When I was young,

454
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,635
I did not I ike s ign langugage,

455
00:52:23,905 --> 00:52:26,305
because I a lways have to trans late
for X iao Peng,

456
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:28,100
so I never have enough t ime for mysel f.

457
00:52:29,177 --> 00:52:30,405
Unt i I one day,

458
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:34,011
X iao Peng asked me i f the piano sounds nice.

459
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,308
Then I started cry ing.

460
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:39,650
From that day on,

461
00:52:40,188 --> 00:52:42,713
I studied s ign language di I igent I y.

462
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:47,393
I want her to understand a I I of the sounds.

463
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:51,490

464
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:52,631

466
00:52:58,873 --> 00:52:59,931
Why?

467
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:04,744
I think i t sounds I ike longing.

468
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:33,769
When did the water bi rd
I gave you have s ibl ings?

469
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,311
Whenever I think of you,

470
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,580
I' I I throw in a dol lar.

471
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,571
Slowl y, each one f i I led to capac i ty.

472
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:42,908
So I had to buy a new one.

473
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:48,518

474
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:52,923
but can you let me go f i rst?

475
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:59,151

479
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:13,870
Go. Go. Go.
