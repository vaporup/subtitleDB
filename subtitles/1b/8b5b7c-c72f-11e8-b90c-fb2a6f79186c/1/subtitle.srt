00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,936
Parents, this way please.

2
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,893
Ready!

3
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,448
Meal boxes are here.

4
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,048
I'Il go get the money.

5
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,089
The meaI boxes are outside.

6
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,300
How much are they each?

7
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,298
$65... SpeciaI price for the 
hearing impaired.

8
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,174
I need to go to work.

9
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,474
Ride carefuIly.

10
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,411
Thank you.

11
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,440
Why is she in a hurry?
She hasn't eaten her meal.

12
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,738
She's not on the swimming team.

13
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,408
She's my sister, Yang Yang.

14
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,411
Yang Yang.

15
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,602
Are you okay?

16
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
I'Il take you to the hospital.

17
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,022
You can come get your scooter Iater.

18
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,229
Thanks.

19
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,424
Sorry, I can't stay.

20
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,203
I need to deIiver other meaI boxes.

21
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,352
Your MSN.

22
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,185
Can I have it?

23
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,707
I'Il give you 15% off next time.

24
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,378
Sorry, sorry.

25
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,850
Tian Kuo, what's the matter with you?

26
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,921
Why so Iong?
You deIivered to the USA?

27
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,722
Great. Look at those.

28
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,258
Now you get to eat aIl the 
canceIed orders.

29
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,453
Don't you dare Ieave any unfinished.

30
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,649
Where's the basket?

31
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,562
Ah.

32
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,122
Did you Iose it again?

33
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,133
The basket was new! Brand new!

34
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,370
HeIp. Another customer wants 
seven Iunch boxes.

35
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,671
Dad, I've got seven.

36
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,706
You! Stay quiet and eat your food.

37
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,834
Those coId meaI boxes can't seIl.

38
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,144
See? I am eating coId meaI 
boxes myseIf.

39
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,178
Look at yourseIf!

40
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,580
I wonder who wiIl marry you.

41
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,281
Hurry up.

42
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,509
I know. I am stir-frying veggies.

43
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,982
Why don't you ask Tian Kuo to heIp.

44
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,818
It's aIready one o'cIock, 
he needs to eat.

45
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,612
The kid's stiIl growing.

46
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,923
I don't know people at 20 stiIl grow.

47
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,755
They are kids as Iong as
they are not married.

48
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,487
Cook!

49
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,598
Boys.

50
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,776
Is there a speciaI meaning 
to her name?

51
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,384
Does her voice sound
Iike singer JoIin or ChiIing?

52
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,581
Like your mom.

53
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,025
Mom! What are you doing!
Don't peek at my screen.

54
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,492
Peek at what?

55
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,624
Finish your food and 
stop taIking to yourseIf.

56
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,900
Focus. Make sure you
don't Ieave any scraps.

57
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,868
Or you'Il marry an ugIy, 
pimpIed-face wife.

58
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,461
Mom, Iook!
I finished everything.

59
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,540
You reaIly finished everything.

60
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,410
Now you need to exercise
and burn the caIories.

61
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,010
Or you'Il be Iike your father
with a donut waist.

62
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,252
I remember when I first
married your father,

63
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,812
I was stiIl skinny and sexy.

64
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,716
After I started eating his meaI boxes,

65
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,451
I became what I am now - donut waist.

66
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,786
This is what you get with caIories.

67
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,361
What are you doing?

68
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,932
What are you up to?

69
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,422
I'm too old for that.

70
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,458
Here, here.

71
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,737
You're going to marry an ugIy wife.

72
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,803
Finish your food.

73
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,201
Thank you.

74
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,922
Come over. Thank you.

75
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,592
Sorry. We're soId out today.

76
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,268
Sorry. They're aIl gone today.

77
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,462
We'Il have more tomorrow.

Isn't there stiIl one Ieft?

81
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,749
It's aIready ordered.

82
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,410
Sorry.

83
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,893
Hey. It's you again.

84
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,894
I forgot to thank you yesterday.

85
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,828
AIso forgot to ask your name.

86
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,535
My name is Tian Kuo.

87
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,709
Tian Kuo.

88
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,172
Hi.

89
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,485
I was onIine using MSN Iast night.

90
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,079
But I didn't see you.

91
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,590
I worked Iast night, 
so I didn't go onIine.

92
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,330
I saw people Iining up for 
your meaI box.

93
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,855
Your meaI box must be reaIly famous.

94
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,392
Of course.

95
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,307
My dad Iearned with a famous 
chef from Hong Kong.

96
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:26,006
No one can beat him in cooking.

97
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,949
SmiIe again.

98
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,154
SmiIe again. PIease.

99
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,843
It's deIicious.

100
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,208
Thanks.

101
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,941
How's your injury?
Does it stiIl hurt?

102
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,504
It's my treat.

103
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,111
That won't do.

104
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,136
I'Il pay you when I get paid.

105
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,593
I've got a way.

106
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,287
What is it?

107
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,292
Come watch a movie with me.

108
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,398
In exchange for the meaI box.

109
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,841
I'Il pay for the ticket.

110
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,443
How Iong is the movie?

111
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,417
About two hours.

112
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,364
I can't.

113
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,331
It's too Iong.
I don't have enough time.

114
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,669
I need to go to work.

115
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,839
Watch out.

116
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,474
She can't hear me anyway.

117
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,430
Off Iine again?

118
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,193
What's the use for MSN?

119
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,002
You must be busy.

120
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,570
Never go onIine.

121
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,765
I don't even see you at the 
stadium anymore.

122
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,437
Now I seIl one Iess meaI box.

123
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,535
Is she angry...

124
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,243
because of the meaI box money?

125

(Chicken Ieg MeaI Box ~
Sender: MeaI Box Kuo)

126
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,555
When I first met you,
you were Iike a water bird.

127
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,486
FIying far and high,
by stepping on the water.

128
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,499
Why water birds can soak in 
water for some time

129
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,763
without catching a coId?

130
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,663
Because water birds' feathers 
produce oil.

131
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,628
So they won't catch a coId.

132
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,042
She must find my water bird 
theory boring.

Yang Yang, what kind of job do you do?

135
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,420
Why don't you find a stabIe job?

136
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,720
Doing meniaI jobs is very tiring.

137
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,631
The pay is not stabIe,
and what if you meet a bad person.

138
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,398
It's dangerous.

139
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,373
You got to be careful.

140
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,904
She must think I'm too nagging.

141
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,946
Must be my mom.

142
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,277
AIways nagging at me.

143
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,010
I must have inherited it from her.

144
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,476
Inherit what from who?

145
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:27,886
It hurts.

146
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:28,875

149
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,329

150
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,421

Isn't this better than watching a movie?

156
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,724
When you swim, watch your arms.

157
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,660
You didn't Iift your back, 
and your body.

158
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,700
I don't understand.

159
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,674
You don't understand?

160
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,871
Watch your arms,
and keep your back straight.

161
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:27,842
Let me.

162
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,476
When you swim, 
you need to arch your body.

164
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,093
No.

165
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,623
She knows how to read 
faciaI expressions.

166
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,835
Since she was young,
she knew how to read peopIe,

167
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,794
and knew what the aduIts 
wanted before they asked.

168
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,708
So the aduIts aIways took 
a Iiking to her.

169
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,911
It's reaIly because she can't hear.

170
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,038
That's why she's so sensitive.

171
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089

one working?

172

After my mom passed away,

179
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,185
I promised dad that
I wouId take good care of her.

work in Africa.

00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,232
It feeIs Iike you're the eIder sister.

182
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,462
She feeIs Iike the younger one.

183
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,936
You don't have sibIings, do you?

184
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,975
I am the onIy son.

185
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,908
Your parents must dote on you.

186
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,375
Dote?

187
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,514
I suppose so.

188
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,187
Wow.

189
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:03,157
This is pork bone soup with 
Iotus seeds.

190
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,095
Whitens your skin.

191
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,771
Promotes metaboIism.

192
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,003
That's not a good one.

193
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,411
Promotes metaboIism.

194
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,340
Lowers blood pressure.

195
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,384
It even burns away fat.

196
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:25,657
No way.

197
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,056
She's aIready too skinny.

198
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,457
Who's too skinny?

199
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,023
Mom! Why do you taIk so Ioud
but waIk so siIentIy?

200
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:32,925
ReaIly?

201
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,323
You aIso stewed a pot of soup?

202
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,835
That's a big meaI box.

203
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,927
Who is it for?

204
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,237
It's a meaI box for charity.

205
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,596
MeaI box for charity.

206
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,804
Who are you cherishing?

207
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,199
Huang Tian Kuo.

208
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,807
Where are you going?

209
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,249
There is a Iot of portions in 
that meaI box.

210
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,012
Do you know what price it shouId be?

211
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,614
Nothing Iower than $90!

212
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,874
Did you hear me?

213
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,610
Charity is priceIess.

214
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,418
What do you mean "priceIess"?

215
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,357
Young man, it's more important
to know market prices.

216
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,191
(I am standing right in front 
of your door.)

217
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,574
Hey sorry

218
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:55,681
Did you wait for a Iong time?

219
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,115
Not reaIly.

220
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,250
Whew. The soup is stiIl warm.

221
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,903
The economy must be reaIly bad.

222
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,972
You guys spent so much
time on the soup...

223
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,998
just to attract peopIe to buy 
the meaI box.

224
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,469
ActuaIly...

225
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,009
It's deIicious.

226
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,714
Uh... It's better today...

227
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,923
The meaI box must be expensive?

228
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,553
It's free. It's a Ieft over.

229
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,761
That won't do. I must pay.

230
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,298
I must.

231
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,933
It's fine. It's fine.

232
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,975
I'Il count the meaI box as $80.
Is that too cheap?

233
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,855
You don't have much partition 
in your home.

234
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,619
FeeIs spacious.

235
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,316
The hearing impaired need visuaI aid.

236
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,731
If they can't see everything
they become uneasy.

237
00:23:54,399 --> 00:24:00,572
So dad insisted that we Iive 
in an open space.

238
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,235
That way we can see everything 
in the house.

239
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,378
Is $85 enough?

240
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,044
There are so many medaIs.

241
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,614
They aIl beIong to Xiao Peng.

242
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,500
There. And there.

243
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,901
This was Xiao Peng's first 
champion medal.

244
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,746
That's awesome.

245
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,551
Xiao Peng is reaIly good at 
swimming,

246
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,109
and she exceIs in academics.

247
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,684
She's not Iike me.

248
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,049
AIl I do is pIay.

249
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,986
I thought you are aIl work,

250
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,625
no play.

251
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,093
Since your father is away,

252
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,238
you have to earn aIl the 
Iiving expenses.

253
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,603
Must be tiring.

254
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,739
It's not.

255
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,143
I just need to hoId on during 
the training.

256
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,114
After we win, 
we can pay the Ioans off.

257
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,809
Then Iife wiIl be easier for us.

258
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,454
Or is it $90?

259
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,665
I need to go to work now.

260
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,301
- You're not going to eat?
- Take a seat.

261
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,806
Go ahead and take it.

262
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,707
Say thank you. Bye Bye.

263
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,574
You can't move unIess I give 
you money, right?

264
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:43,309
So you can't just Ieave in a hurry, right?

265
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,972
I've aIways wanted to teIl you 
something.

266
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,635
But we never spent
enough time together.

267
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,577
Sometimes you wouId be gone
before I can teIl you.

268
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,709
I've never met someone Iike you.

269
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,725
AIl you ever speak of is Xiao Peng.

270
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,852
You never mentioned anything 
about yourseIf.

271
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,298
Because you never think 
about yourseIf.

272
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,034
This has caused me to
think of you more.

273
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,170
I stiIl miss you after I went home,

274
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,697
and I stiIl wanted to taIk to you.

275
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:21,170
Sign Iangauge is not tiring 
to me at aIl.

276
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:45,999
Kiddo.

277
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,964
She'Il onIy move if you throw 
in money.

278
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,629
Thanks.

279
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,834
You hungry?

280
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,267
Lets go grab something to eat.

281
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,264
I've got money now.

282
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,266
I'Il treat.

283
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,551
I need to remove my 
make-up first.

284
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,075
Wait for me. Okay.

285
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,584
Fire! Take the car away!

286
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,726
There's a fire upstairs.

287
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,126
Is anyone stiIl inside? Fire!

288
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,718
Big bowI or smaIl bowl?

289
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,583
Super bowl.

290
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,321
You find a seat

291
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,320
I'Il go order.

292
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,754
DeIicious.

293
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,056
FishbaIl soup.

294
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,089
I'm so satisfied.

295
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,461
I haven't been so fuIfiIled in 
a Iong time.

296
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,235
I wanted to ask you.

297
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,262
If no one gave you money
during your performance...

298
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,942
You wouId just stand there?

299
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,110
Of course not.

300
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,338
Dummy.

301
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:28,980
What then?

302
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,140
Go home.

303
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,975
This is the way the 
"street performance" is.

304
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,820
It's not possible to make 
money everyday.

305
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,788
Are you fuIl?

306
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:47,262
My stomach feeIs warm.
It's such a sensation.

307
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,106
Check?

308
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,816
Two bowIs of noodIes, pIease.

309
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,908
Be right with you.

310
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,449
Two bowIs over here.

311
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,422
Two Iarge bowIs of wonton noodIes.

312
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,919
Five side dishes.

313
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,421
That's $275.

314
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,267
Two, pIease.

315
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,201
HoId on just a sec.
This tabIe is almost ready.

316
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,404
This tabIe is almost ready.

317
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,342
I'Il take this for you.

318
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,151
Thank you.

319
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,592
Here's is three hundred.

320
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,294
Just a sec.

321
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,522
No problem.

322
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,438
Too tired to waIk.

323
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,513
Too fuIl?

324
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,263
Did I say something wrong?

325
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,635
WiIl you teIl me what's wrong?

326
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,576
Do you Iook down...

327
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,009
on the money I earned?

328
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,739
Why wouId you think that?

329
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,682
I aIready said it's my treat.

330
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,274
Why did you pay?

331
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,876
Because there were people
waiting behind us.

332
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,391
I didn't want to deIay other 
peopIe's time.

333
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,586
So what if we Iet them wait.

334
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,829
Do you know how Iong it 
took me to earn them?

335
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,059
Can't they wait just a IittIe bit.

336
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,061
And you?

337
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,364
Why can't you wait for me?

338
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,966
It's not that.

339
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,399
I just...

340
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,629
Just what?

341
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:15,671
You think it embarrassing
that I pay in coins?

342
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,507
No, I didn't...

343
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,942
One doIlar coins are stiIl money.

344
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,719
Do I need to be pushed around
for counting coins?

345
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,291
I just paid in advance.

346
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,393
You can pay me back.

347
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,360
It's fine.

348
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,191
I'Il pay back when I've changed 
the coins to cash.

349
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,233
In case you think coins are 
too bothersome.

350
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,398
That's not...

351
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:52,883
Yang Yang

352
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,172
Are you ok?

353
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,048
I'm fine.

354
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,013
Sorry.

355
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,823
If onIy I were at home.

356
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,524
It's not your fauIt.

357
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,528
I feIl asIeep and didn't notice 
the fire broke out.

358
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,062
I should have came home earIier.

359
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,075
Your're so busy

360
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:29,808
How couId you have known
about the accident?

361
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,882
Look at you.

362
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,523
You haven't even washed off 
your make-up?

363
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,855
Go home and rest.

364
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,502
I just choked on the smoke.

365
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,197
Don't think too much of it.

366
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,307
What if the fire was more severe?

367
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,900
What if you weren't onIy choked 
by the smoke?

368
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,915
What if the fire department
had not come in time?

369
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,576
Then I wouId have Iost you.

370
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,862
My most precious Yang Yang.

371
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:35,468
I had mixed feeIing
when I knew what happened.

372
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,083
I am worried that you girIs 
wouId be scared,

373
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,216
but I know that God, in His power,

374
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,660
wiIl show His grace and keep you safe.

375
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,527
Just as He has bIessed my work 
in Africa.

376
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,893
Yang Yang.

377
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:59,100
God has speciaI arrangments 
for Xiao Peng.

378
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,030
And for you as weIl.

379
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,500
Don't Iet yourseIf be enguIfed
by guiIt and doubt,

380
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,677
and don't Iet your friends 
feeI pressured.

381
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,638
I pray for my beloved
daughters daily.

382
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,719
(lmmanuel.)

383
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,346
(Your Ioving father.)

384
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:43,947
The coach said Xiao Peng has 
throat and rib damage.

385
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:47,751
WouId it affect her eIigibiIity to 
the DeafIympics?

386
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,954
The coach is stiIl evaIuating.

387
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:54,014
Maybe he'Il just rear range the 
reIay team order.

388
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,694
Xiao Peng has reaIly high
expectations for herseIf.

389
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,563
If she knew she might affect
everyone's score in a negative way,

390
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,030
it would upset her.

391
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,800
Don't Iet her know.

392
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,802
We'Il just work harder.

393
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,635
That way we'Il make up for the score.

394
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,249
(Where are you?)

395
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,496
What are you doing here?

396
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,441
What are you thinking?

397
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:57,916
What if you can't compete 
because of me?

398
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,319
Is that what you're worried about?

399
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,891
You're not worried.

400
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,331
You don't need to worry.

401
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,061
I'Il catch up to everyone when 
I've recovered.

402
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,771
The coach toId me yesterday,

403
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,006
that I have improved my 
performance by 0.1 second.

404
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,203
Therefore I can rest 1/10 of the time.

405
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,507
It'Il be fine.

406
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,454
What is this?

407
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,614
Is it for me?
