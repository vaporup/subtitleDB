1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,963
<i>Earth, before the war.</i>

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,729
<i>New York, before I was born.</i>

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,845
<i>A place I've only
seen pictures of.</i>

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
<i>I know you...</i>

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>But we've never met.</i>

6
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,764
<i>I'm with you...</i>

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,326
<i>But I don't know your name.</i>

8
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,768
<i>I know I'm dreaming. But it
feels like more than that.</i>

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,761
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,088
<i>How can that be?</i>

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,168
<i>March 14th, 2077.</i>

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,409
<i>Five years since
the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,530
<i>And I'm still haunted
by these dreams.</i>

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>Victoria and I were
assigned together.</i>

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,484
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll I join the others.</i>

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,170
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,324
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,366
<i>It's been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,003
<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,323
<i>Without the moon, the Earth
was thrown into chaos.</i>

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,841
<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,330
<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,528
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,681
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,282
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,447
<i>We won the war,
but lost the planet.</i>

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,645
<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,641
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,841
<i>We built the Tet,
our mission control.</i>

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,362
<i>A temporary space station
before the migration to Titan,</i>

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,562
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,290
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,929
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,645
<i>Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.</i>

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,404
<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,483
<i>which convert Earth's sea water</i>

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,568
<i>into fusion energy
for the new colony.</i>

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,166
<i>The survival of humanity
depends on it.</i>

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
Thank you for the coffee.

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,970
<i>Remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,527
<i>They attack our drones
at night,</i>

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,927
<i>and try to kill me
during the day.</i>

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>There's still fight in them,
but I don't know why.</i>

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,160
<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>That we are an effective team.</i>

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,207
<i>Vika's my
communications officer.</i>

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,362
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,208
<i>I handle drone maintenance.</i>

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,286
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,126
<i>Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.</i>

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,122
<i>I can't shake
the feeling that Earth,</i>

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,402
<i>in spite of all
that's happened...</i>

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,166
<i>Earth is still my home.</i>

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,842
Jack Harper, Tech-49.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,001
Morning, Bob.

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,845
<i>Tower, comm check.</i>

57
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,850
<i>Drone Maintenance Technician
49, hydro rig support.</i>

58
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,930
All Bubbleship systems
are green.

59
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,127
I'm good to go.

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,567
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,688
Always am.
No, you're not.

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,841
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.

63
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,402
All right, Tet's coming
online in 30 seconds.

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,723
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.

65
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,682
I got 'em. Hydro rigs
are sucking seawater.

66
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,247
You got 'em, Bob?

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,883
Drone 185 looks good.

68
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,684
Jack,
we've got two drones down.

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,241
Shit.

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,004
Stand by,
Mission coming online.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,082
<i>And we have Tet contact.</i>

72
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,091
Morning, boss.

73
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,442
<i>Tower 49,
this is Mission Control.</i>

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,682
<i>How y'all doing
this lovely morning?</i>

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,004
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.

76
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,722
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.

77
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,769
I have two...
<i>You have two drones offline.</i>

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,763
<i>Perimeter's compromised.</i>

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,730
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.

80
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,606
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,566
Linking to beacon now.

82
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,962
<i>You'll go there first.</i>

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,771
Got it. On my way.

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,321
<i>Mission, Tech-49 is
en route to Grid 37 now.</i>

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,528
<i>Can you plug that hole
with Drone 109?</i>

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,127
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.

87
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,602
<i>Jack better find those drones
and get 'em flying.</i>

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,967
<i>Those rigs can't be
exposed overnight.</i>

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,121
Copy that.

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,090
<i>Tower,
didn't he fix 166 recently?</i>

91
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,049
Jack has fixed all
the drones recently.

92
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,884
And, if we had the parts
that we've been asking for,

93
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,530
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton crew down here.

94
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,331
<i>Understood.
We're doing the best we can.</i>

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,681
<i>Are you an effective team?</i>

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,729
We are an effective team.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,283
<i>Your directive today
is to rehabilitate 166</i>

98
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,204
<i>and find 172.</i>

99
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,521
<i>Get 'em flying by sundown,</i>

100
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,570
<i>and I'll buy you two a round of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.</i>

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,079
You had better be ready, Sally.

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,605
Two weeks now,
we're keeping track.

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,681
Okay.

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,807
Come on, Bob. Work
with me, here, buddy.

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,930
Tech-49?

106
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,570
<i>Tech-49?</i>

107
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,041
<i>Jack?</i>

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,561
Copy, Tower.

109
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,563
What happened?
I lost you for a second.

110
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,121
Really?

111
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,244
<i>Coming up on location.</i>

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,001
There it is.

113
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,722
I've got multiple scav kills.

114
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,082
Drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight.

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,321
Got any movement?

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,007
No sign of scavenger activity.

117
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,403
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.

118
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,251
Copy that.
I'm coming in hot.

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,324
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

120
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,689
I always do.

121
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,327
You know,
I read about this game.

122
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,043
It was played right here.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,490
The last Super Bowl.

124
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,130
Please don't tell me
it was a classic.

125
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,766
A classic game.

126
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,161
Down by four.

127
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,851
<i>The ball</i>

128
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,488
<i>was on the 50-yard line.</i>

129
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,170
<i>Seconds left on the clock.</i>

130
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,970
The ball is snapped,

131
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,211
and the QB fumbles.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,730
Disaster.

133
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,643
Looks like the game is over.

134
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,204
I'm reading the whole
central core off-alignment.

135
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,362
You don't have the necessary
tools down there.

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,280
<i>And a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that.</i>

137
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,364
But this QB runs back,
and picks up his own fumble.

138
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Hold on, what did you just do?

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,411
<i>There's a wall of linebackers
closing in on him.</i>

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,201
<i>So, he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end.</i>

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,044
A Hail Mary.

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,128
Eighty-thousand people
on their feet,

143
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,402
watching this ball
sail through the air.

144
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,403
Downfield is a rookie wide
receiver, third string.

145
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,041
He just leaps out of the pack.

146
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,609
Touchdown!

147
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,801
Contact! West contact!

148
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,529
<i>Jack?</i>

149
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,246
It's okay, Vika.

150
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,084
It's just a dog.

151
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,361
Hey.

152
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,883
Now, go on. You gotta
get out of here.

153
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,281
Go on, get!

154
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,568
Get out of here! Go!

155
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,769
<i>Tech-49, Jack Harper.</i>

156
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,799
You're welcome.

157
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,769
166 is back online.

158
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,565
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel
cells stolen in just over a month.

159
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,001
These scavs are getting bolder.

160
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,361
<i>Well, the hydro rigs
are taking all the water.</i>

161
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,411
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

162
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,844
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

163
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,844
We won the war.

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,525
Now we have to leave.

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,529
Two more weeks, Jack.

166
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,527
<i>Then we'll be on
our way to Titan.</i>

167
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,841
Yep.

168
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,487
That drone is out
there somewhere.

169
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,044
We just have to find it.

170
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,523
Without a beacon, that's like
finding a needle in a haystack.

171
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,210
So we go to our ground game.

172
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,651
Tower, I've located 172

173
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,562
down a sinkhole.

174
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,802
No visual, but I can hear it.

175
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,082
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,446
How's it look?

177
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,401
It's good, it's good. There's no
sign of scav activity on top.

178
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,608
<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

179
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,480
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,002
<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

181
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,364
<i>Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.</i>

182
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,922
Requesting backup
to his location ASAP.

183
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,007
I've got a visual on Drone 172.

184
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,046
Jack?

185
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,764
What the hell?

186
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,371
Shit.

187
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,361
Ha!

188
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,201
Jack!

189
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,282
Tech-49,
Jack Harper.

190
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,607
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

191
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,161
Hey!

192
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,522
Oh, no.

193
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,961
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!

194
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,128
"How can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

195
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,363
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"

196
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,721
Jack?

197
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,526
Yep, I'll be right there.

198
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,722
<i>How does 109 look?</i>

199
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,959
Can it fly?

200
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,724
Barely.

201
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,441
And without armor,
she's a sitting duck.

202
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,604
Well, I'll talk to Sally about
that shielding in the morning.

203
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,879
Okay.

204
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,959
Again.

205
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,202
What, Jack Harper?

206
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,649
Where did you get this?

207
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,205
It was growing in...

208
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,719
Come on, Jack,
you know the regulations.

209
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,960
I know you think I'm a stickler

210
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,439
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins

211
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,488
could be in something
like that.

212
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,279
It's a flower, Vika.

213
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,486
Yeah, that's not the point.

214
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
It's that we are
so close to the end,

215
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,565
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

216
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,090
Okay.

217
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,768
Every day,
you have to go down there

218
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,565
and see what was lost.

219
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,205
But we've done our job, Jack.

220
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,882
It's time to go.

221
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,089
I don't think they were
trying to kill me today.

222
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,204
The scavs.

223
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,169
They were trying to catch me.

224
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,451
Well, they can't have you.

225
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,051
Come on.

226
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,123
You should come with me
sometime, before we leave.

227
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,241
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

228
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,361
I'll show you something.

229
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,924
Hey, hey!

230
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,001
Oh, my God.

231
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,726
<i>It was</i> a <i>six-stage meltdown
from inside the hydro rig's core.</i>

232
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,530
<i>It's offline permanently.</i>

233
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,445
<i>Tower 49, you have put
the whole operation at risk.</i>

234
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,682
<i>I need to know
exactly what happened.</i>

235
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,571
<i>Jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells</i>

236
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,768
<i>and got it into the suction.</i>

237
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,365
<i>Tower, hold.</i>

238
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,089
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?

239
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,571
Yes.

240
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,364
<i>It's gotta be scav.</i>

241
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,564
It's not one of ours.

242
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,731
Jack, the signal is
being directed off-planet.

243
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,765
On my way.

244
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,089
<i>Tower, our logs show you are missing
an additional nine fuel cells.</i>

245
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,319
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

246
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,482
Negative, Mission,
that number is 10.

247
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,042
Drone 172 was lost last night.

248
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,087
109 is combat-ready as soon
as we get that shielding.

249
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,323
We can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field.

250
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,441
I've run the numbers.

251
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,443
<i>We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.</i>

252
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,046
<i>I'm tasking the drones
to defensive positions.</i>

253
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,759
Copy.

254
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,199
<i>Our job is to run those rigs. Your
directive is to protect them.</i>

255
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
<i>We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?</i>

256
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,041
Copy.

257
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,288
<i>Are you and Jack
an effective team?</i>

258
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,566
Damn right we are.

259
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,489
Jack?

260
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,120
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

261
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,559
<i>Jack?</i>

262
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,722
Yeah, I got it.

263
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,922
They have some kind
of a repeater.

264
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,529
The scavs are using
the building as an antenna.

265
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,681
Can you decrypt?

266
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,044
It's a set of coordinates.

267
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,284
<i>Grid 17.</i>

268
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,409
<i>It's a goddamn homing beacon.</i>

269
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,766
Grid 17.

270
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,361
What the hell is out there?

271
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,207
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.

272
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,123
<i>What is going on?</i>

273
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,410
Why would the scavs send
a signal off-planet, Jack?

274
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,645
I'm shutting it down.

275
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,490
Tech-49, check your course. You're
headed right for the border.

276
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,128
<i>That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.</i>

277
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,288
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.

278
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,725
I'm gonna do a perimeter check
before I head home.

279
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,248
I may go off-comm.

280
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,679
Jack,
we should keep in contact.

281
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,920
Just let me know where you are.

282
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,090
<i>Do you copy?</i>

283
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,124
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

284
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,002
That's right, Bob.

285
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,524
You know where we're going.

286
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,406
Are you gonna miss me?

287
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,808
I'm gonna miss this place.

288
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,327
It would have been great.

289
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,962
It would have been great.

290
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,688
<i>Vika? Vika,
did you get that?</i>

291
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,370
<i>Jack, where have you been?</i>

292
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,488
An object came down in 17.

293
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,039
That's the beacon coordinates.

294
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,159
Exactly.

295
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,003
<i>I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.</i>

296
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,571
Jack, Mission's almost offline.

297
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,370
<i>I'm en route now.</i>

298
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,721
Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17.

299
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,042
It came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon.

300
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,201
My tech's en route now.

301
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,562
<i>Tower,
we're going offline soon,</i>

302
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,842
<i>but drones are already
mobile and executing.</i>

303
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,729
<i>Have your tech stand down.</i>

304
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,325
Copy.

305
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,848
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

306
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,650
<i>That's a negative, Tower.</i>

307
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,087
With Tet offline,
we need our eyes on this.

308
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,083
I want to know
this site is secure.

309
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,559
Sally, my tech's concerned about
the security of the site.

310
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,881
<i>Tower, you have lost
enough assets for today.</i>

311
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,008
<i>Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?</i>

312
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,400
Copy, Command, I'm...

313
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,923
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.

314
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,684
<i>I'm on site.</i>

315
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,081
<i>Jack.</i>

316
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,925
<i>I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.</i>

317
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,050
Vika, I think it's one of ours.

318
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,284
This thing is ancient.
It looks...

319
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,280
...pre-war.

320
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,761
The scavs brought
this thing down, Jack.

321
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,251
There's no sign of scavs.

322
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,765
<i>Technician,
this is your Control.</i>

323
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,083
I'm ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately.

324
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,443
Touching down.

325
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,764
They're human.

326
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,763
Tower, we have got survivors.

327
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,925
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.

328
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,011
They are human.

329
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,960
Stand down!

330
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,088
Vika, the drones are
firing on survivors.

331
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,767
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.

332
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,046
Stand down!

333
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,649
<i>Jack Harper, Tech-49.</i>

334
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,882
<i>Back off, you son of a bitch!</i>

335
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,844
<i>Back off!</i>

336
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,328
Open the door.

337
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,205
Vika!

338
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,246
Get the med kit.

339
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,362
Get the med kit!

340
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,047
This has to be reported.

341
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,599
Be sure and report
that the drones

342
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,240
killed the crew from
one of our own ships.

343
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,051
See what Command makes of that.

344
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,167
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

345
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,521
Jack.

346
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,606
Here.
You're still dehydrated.

347
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,682
Where are we?

348
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,446
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.

349
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,008
What's your name?

350
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,725
I'm Julia.

351
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,606
Julia...

352
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,082
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you,

353
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,289
but you were in a crash.

354
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,204
Your ship came down.

355
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,641
Jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage.

356
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,969
But none of your crew survived.

357
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,286
What do you mean?

358
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,848
You're the only one
that made it.

359
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,570
I'm sorry.

360
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,283
You've been in delta sleep
for a long time.

361
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,646
Some disorientation is normal.

362
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,131
How long?

363
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,170
Sixty years.

364
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,004
At least.

365
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,406
I have to get back to our ship.

366
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,563
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.

367
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,201
Vika...

368
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,370
Don't touch me.

369
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,047
Your ship's re-entry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface.

370
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,531
Do you know
anything about that?

371
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,881
What was your mission?

372
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,285
It's classified.

373
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,886
Well, we have
no record of an <i>Odyssey...</i>

374
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,319
I can't tell you anything

375
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,080
until I get the flight
recorder from my ship.

376
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,245
Julia, a lot has
changed in 60 years.

377
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,089
While you were in delta sleep,

378
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,445
Earth was attacked.

379
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,962
Call them scavs.

380
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,609
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

381
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,402
Then they invaded.

382
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,090
We won the war,

383
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,689
but Earth was ruined.

384
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,007
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.

385
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,449
Or on the space station,
getting ready to go.

386
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,445
We're here for security
and drone maintenance.

387
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,531
We're the mop-up crew.

388
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,328
You've lost people.

389
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,961
Everything.

390
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,720
If you want to be alone,
we understand.

391
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,487
The drones killed
her entire crew.

392
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,641
If I hadn't gotten there...

393
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,365
I want her gone first thing.

394
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,931
Vika...

395
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,882
Do you have any memories
before the mission?

396
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,687
Before the security wipe?

397
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,886
Our job is not to remember.

398
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,891
Remember?

399
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,210
Do you remember her?

400
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,401
Jack...

401
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,365
That was a scav beacon
that brought her down.

402
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,285
We don't know who she is.

403
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,451
Or what she is.

404
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,727
Let's just get
through the night.

405
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,724
Okay?

406
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,570
You fly that thing?

407
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,725
Yes.

408
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,289
What happens now?

409
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,768
The Tet will be online soon.

410
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,242
Victoria will
report your rescue.

411
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,327
They'll send
someone down for you.

412
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,284
From the Tet?

413
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,286
Yes.

414
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,566
I need to get the flight
recorder from my ship.

415
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,440
The scavs, they move at night.

416
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,599
They could be
all over it by now.

417
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,523
I need to know what happened.

418
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,929
You need to know what happened.

419
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,643
Please.

420
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,130
Jack?

421
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,328
Jack, what are you doing?

422
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,766
Vika, she's a flight officer.

423
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,203
She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

424
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,850
Now, you would
want the same thing.

425
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,684
<i>Jack, I...</i>

426
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,486
I can't protect you.

427
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,843
No, I understand.

428
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,642
This one's on me.

429
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,930
I couldn't save them.

430
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,449
Jack. Jack!

431
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,565
Jack, can you hear me?

432
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,570
All right, it's time to go.

433
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,131
Jack.

434
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,485
I found it.

435
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,799
Jack!

436
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,205
<i>Tower 49, how are y'all
this lovely morning?</i>

437
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,962
Another day in paradise.

438
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,401
Sally...

439
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,208
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol

440
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,001
and went off-comm

441
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,170
near the canyons in 17.

442
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,530
Now,
I know we're low on drones,

443
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:02,323
but, um, requesting one
to sweep the area.

444
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,409
Just a quick scout.

445
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,647
<i>Copy 49,
tasking 185 to Grid 22.</i>

446
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,923
"And how can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

447
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,564
"For the ashes of his fathers"

448
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,610
"And the temples of his Gods"

449
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,440
I've been watching you, Jack.

450
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,481
You're curious.

451
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,847
What are you looking
for in those books?

452
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,125
Do they bring
back old memories?

453
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,641
You won't get anything from me.

454
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,484
My memory has been
wiped to protect...

455
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,564
...the security of
the mission. Yes.

456
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,119
You can't have
your precious memory

457
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,441
falling into the wrong
hands, now, can you?

458
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,245
Tell me.

459
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,769
Have you ever met
a scav up close?

460
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,485
Of course not.
You just repair drones.

461
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,248
"Don't go into
the radiation zone."

462
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,483
"Don't ask too
many questions."

463
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,368
Not part of
the job description.

464
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,247
Lights.

465
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,203
We're not alien, Jack.

466
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,291
We're human.

467
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,488
Of course, for us,
being human is a problem.

468
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,846
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.

469
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,843
Vocal scrambling.

470
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,080
Can you hear me, Jack?

471
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,690
Keeps your drones confused.

472
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,561
Well, most of the time.

473
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,239
The drones are programmed...

474
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,844
To kill humans, Jack.

475
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,050
You saw what they did
to those sleep pods.

476
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,405
You almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman.

477
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,690
Why did you do that?

478
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,610
Anyone would have.

479
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,966
"Anyone."

480
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,641
Interesting.

481
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,290
We're wasting our time.

482
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,763
The drone will track him here.

483
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,080
That's Sergeant Sykes.

484
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,407
He thinks I'm a fool for
having brought you here.

485
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,368
I hope you prove him wrong.

486
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,119
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail

487
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,439
somewhere near
the west canyons.

488
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,930
Can you confirm the sequence?

489
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,411
<i>Stand by.</i>

490
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,527
<i>DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.</i>

491
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,169
<i>Vika, are you okay?</i>

492
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,886
<i>Everything good
between you two?</i>

493
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,485
Of course.

494
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,961
<i>You're still an effective team?</i>

495
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,089
We're great.

496
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,880
Never better.

497
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,401
<i>We were running
a ground game, and losing.</i>

498
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,801
So, we decided,
"What the hell?"

499
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,287
"We've got to
throw the long ball."

500
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,842
It took us decades just
to crack the GPS codes.

501
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,651
That's how you brought
down the Odyssey.

502
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,410
Why?

503
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,041
The <i>Odyssey's</i> compact
reactor, courtesy of NASA.

504
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,771
Very hard to come by.

505
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,323
Did you like
the show last night?

506
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,088
That was just one fuel cell.

507
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,204
Imagine what 10
of them will do,

508
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,524
with a core of
weapons-grade plutonium.

509
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,083
We have a nuke, and we
have a drone to carry it.

510
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,211
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.

511
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,840
But it knows you, Jack.

512
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,126
We need you to
program the drone.

513
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,884
Have it carry our
nuke up to the Tet.

514
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,130
End this war.

515
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,804
There are people up there.

516
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,121
Sergeant.

517
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,887
Program the drone
to return to the Tet.

518
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,008
It needs to go
right to the center.

519
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,084
Screw you.

520
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,921
We haven't got time for this.

521
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,766
Hey. Hey!

522
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,801
No.

523
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,961
Let's go!
Get him up.

524
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,840
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.

525
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,968
<i>Copy, Tower,
we're seeing the same thing.</i>

526
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,686
Permission to task
two additional drones?

527
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,046
If one drone is here,
more will come.

528
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,406
And they won't stop
until they find me.

529
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,881
They'll turn
this place to dust.

530
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,171
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.

531
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,850
It's your only chance.

532
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,842
I've been to your

533
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,402
"radiation zones."

534
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,244
If you're looking
for the truth,

535
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,927
that's where you'll find it.

536
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,048
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.

537
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,285
What makes you
think he's different?

538
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,046
She does.

539
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,001
<i>Mission, I've found
my tech over in 37.</i>

540
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,650
<i>You can call off the search.</i>

541
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,326
<i>Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.</i>

542
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,609
<i>Tasking the other drones
back to rig support.</i>

543
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,367
Where are we going now?

544
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,964
Who are you?

545
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,401
What aren't you telling me?

546
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,685
Jack, I...

547
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,530
What were you
doing on the <i>Odyssey?</i>

548
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,403
What was your mission?

549
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,246
It was a research flight
to Titan. My first.

550
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,890
That's what it was
supposed to be.

551
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,722
Six weeks to launch, deep space
scanners picked up an alien object.

552
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,406
We were reassigned
to investigate.

553
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,486
They put us all in delta.

554
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,565
They must have woken
you and Victoria first.

555
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,286
What?

556
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,408
That object

557
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,562
was the Tet, Jack.

558
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,483
The Tet was our mission.

559
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,962
That's impossible.

560
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,445
That's impossible!

561
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,003
Who are you?

562
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,083
I'm your wife.

563
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,284
I don't know what happened, but
you're not who you think you are.

564
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,327
Jack, we were here.

565
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,684
You asked me to meet you, brought
me up on top of the world.

566
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,130
I could tell
you were nervous that day.

567
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,967
It was right here, Jack.

568
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,644
You said,

569
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,962
"Look through here,

570
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,720
and I'll show you the
future."

571
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,844
And I held up a ring.

572
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,841
And you said...

573
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,570
"Yes."

574
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,882
There you are.

575
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,168
There you are.

576
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,401
Hi.

577
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,449
Hello.

578
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,805
Come on.

579
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,527
<i>Vika, I'm coming in.</i>

580
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,930
<i>Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?</i>

581
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,245
<i>Do you copy?</i>

582
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,681
Vika, open the door.

583
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,002
Stay away from me.

584
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,009
I don't want to hear it.

585
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,842
It's not safe here,
and we need to leave, now.

586
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,443
It was always her.

587
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,691
Wasn't it?

588
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,211
Vika...

589
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,489
She's my wife.

590
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,686
Mission, this is Tower 49.

591
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,205
<i>Go ahead, 49.</i>

592
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,725
No.

593
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,328
I'm having a problem
with my technician.

594
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,244
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

595
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,050
He found a survivor
at the crash site.

596
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,239
You've gotta listen to me.

597
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,402
She's impeding his abilities,

598
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,328
and he is unfit for service.

599
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,811
No, no, no.

600
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,691
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.</i>

601
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,208
<i>Are you still
an effective team?</i>

602
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,286
Vika...

603
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,169
Open the goddamn door, Vika!

604
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,044
No.

605
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,239
We are not an effective team.

606
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,090
Vika, please.
We have to go now.

607
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,561
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Jack.

608
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,242
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.

609
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,565
I'm going to Titan.

610
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,201
There is no Titan.

611
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,325
They lied to us.

612
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,807
Just stay away from me.

613
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,249
Vika, please,
there are things...

614
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,447
Things you need to know.

615
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,443
I don't want to know!

616
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,921
Jack...

617
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,361
<i>Hi, Jack. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.</i>

618
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,371
What have you done?

619
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,286
<i>You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.</i>

620
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,363
<i>Sometimes things go wrong.</i>

621
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,089
"Go wrong"?

622
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,251
You killed her.

623
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,281
<i>I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.</i>

624
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,643
<i>Jack, we want to bring you in.</i>

625
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,481
<i>I've been
authorized to tell you</i>

626
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,807
<i>we're going to
assign you a new mission.</i>

627
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,849
<i>You and the survivor.</i>

628
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,649
<i>There's</i> a <i>lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.</i>

629
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,282
<i>We can debrief,
then anything's possible.</i>

630
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,525
<i>It's time to come home, Jack.</i>

631
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,004
<i>Jack?</i>

632
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,885
<i>Jack?</i>

633
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,081
Jack...

634
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,205
I'm sorry.

635
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,245
Hang on.

636
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,201
Lightning.

637
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,761
That's the plan.

638
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,520
We need cover.

639
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,646
There.

640
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,483
Are you okay?
No.

641
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,924
Don't worry,
we're staying out of there.

642
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,441
Are we gonna die?

643
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,601
No!

644
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,365
Maybe.

645
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,601
Jack!

646
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,688
Son of a bitch.

647
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,761
Wait here.

648
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,445
Who is it?

649
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,005
Hey!

650
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,011
Wait!

651
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,170
Wait!

652
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,970
Hey!

653
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,726
Drop your weapon!

654
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,004
It's okay.

655
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,806
Don't move!

656
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,290
We have to shut
that drone down.

657
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,441
Stop moving!

658
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,687
Jack!

659
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,089
It's okay.

660
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,405
Julia.

661
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,370
Julia!

662
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,761
Don't.

663
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,401
Don't touch me.

664
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,206
Hold on.

665
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,330
Just hold on.

666
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,643
Jack Harper, Tech-52.

667
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,644
Hey.

668
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,529
There you are.

669
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,045
What happened?
Are you okay?

670
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,603
That bogey came across the
border and then I lost you.

671
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,481
False alarm.

672
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,485
I should get back out there.

673
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,169
You come all the way home,
and I don't get a kiss?

674
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,082
What's going on up there?

675
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,408
I was thinking...

676
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,403
Why don't you
come down with me?

677
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,560
To the surface?

678
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,649
We could go right now.

679
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,565
Now?

680
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,487
Yeah.

681
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,010
Are you serious?

682
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,686
You won't believe
what's down there.

683
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,929
Jack...

684
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,729
You know the regulations.

685
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,085
Yes.

686
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:21,770
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.

687
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,365
Okay.

688
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,889
This is gonna hurt.

689
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,327
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

690
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,843
You always loved this song.

691
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,450
I'm not him.

692
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,284
I know I'm not.

693
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,568
But I've loved you...

694
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,522
...for as long
as I can remember.

695
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,406
I don't know
how else to say it.

696
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,406
You know what
you said to me once?

697
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,090
You said when it was all over, you
would build me a house on a lake.

698
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:41,806
We would grow old
and fat together.

699
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,884
And we would fight.

700
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,447
Maybe drink too much.

701
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,561
Real romantic.

702
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,364
And then we would die

703
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,046
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake.

704
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,485
And the world would
forget about us.

705
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,085
But we would
always have each other.

706
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,610
I remember.

707
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,051
Those memories are yours, Jack.

708
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,045
They're ours.

709
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,281
They are you.

710
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,771
Good morning.

711
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,361
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life here.

712
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,526
You still can.

713
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,443
I have to go.

714
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,366
Those people need my help.

715
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,282
We'll come back when it's over.

716
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,446
Promise me.

717
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,682
We'll come back when it's over.

718
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,887
You had me worried
for a second.

719
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,322
I thought you
weren't coming back.

720
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,043
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

721
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,560
You look like shit.

722
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,044
You should see the other guy.

723
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,964
If I had told you what
you'd find out there,

724
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,009
you would have
thought I was crazy.

725
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,003
I still do.

726
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,887
Malcolm Beech.

727
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,406
Julia Harper.

728
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,006
Come on.

729
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,559
<i>Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail</i>

730
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,879
<i>somewhere near
the West Canyons.</i>

731
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,723
<i>Can you confirm the sequence?</i>

732
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,370
<i>Stand by.</i>

733
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,761
<i>DNA confirmed, it's Jack.</i>

734
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,883
<i>Mission,
185 just went off-grid.</i>

735
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,327
<i>Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.</i>

736
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,725
I'd been in the army less than a
year when that unholy Tet arrived.

737
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,208
I saw the moon get taken out.

738
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,647
Right up there
in the night sky.

739
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,761
I couldn't believe it.

740
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,205
After that, nature took over.

741
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,850
There's bedrock around Chicago,

742
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,289
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes.

743
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,969
Most people just starved.

744
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,684
Then the Tet sent
troop ships down.

745
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,809
The doors opened,

746
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,088
and out you came.

747
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,960
Astronaut Jack Harper.

748
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,607
Thousands of you.

749
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,291
Memory wiped.

750
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,765
Programmed to kill.

751
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,206
They had taken one of our best

752
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,002
and turned him against us.

753
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,925
No soul.

754
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,850
No humanity.

755
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,165
The Tet.

756
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,727
What a brilliant machine.

757
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,406
Feeding off one planet
after another for energy.

758
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,204
Phase Two was drones.

759
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,323
Repairmen.

760
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,643
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry.

761
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,924
Then one day,

762
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,122
I saw you set down.

763
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,169
Another drone to fix.

764
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:52,162
But in the rubble
that day was a book.

765
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,968
You picked it up.

766
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,407
You studied it.

767
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,526
And I thought I saw a way.

768
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,889
When you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her,

769
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,206
I knew.

770
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,205
You were in there somewhere.

771
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,682
I just had to find
a way to bring you back.

772
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,130
Watch it, watch it.

773
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,163
Eyes on it.
Steady.

774
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,322
Give it some space.

775
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,729
Come on, you're
making it nervous.

776
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,606
That is one
pissed-off weapon.

777
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,563
No, it's just a machine.

778
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,962
<i>I'm the weapon.</i>

779
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,882
I would love to be there to see

780
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,207
that thing's face
when this goes off.

781
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,762
That would be
a one-way trip.

782
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,402
Yeah, but it would be worth it.

783
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,962
Welcome back, Commander.

784
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,771
Open the doors!

785
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,286
Shit!

786
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,526
Spread out!

787
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,529
Head down, keep your head down!

788
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,921
Jack!

789
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,245
Follow me!

790
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,126
Come on, you son of a bitch!

791
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,641
Hey!

792
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,286
Jack.

793
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,489
I'm okay.

794
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,325
The drone.

795
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,649
Send the drone.

796
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,689
It's gone.

797
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,962
I thought we had it.

798
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,724
I really did.

799
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,687
I can take the bomb myself.

800
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,161
Ah...

801
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,640
You know it will
swat you like a fly.

802
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:48,571
Not if I go.

803
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,800
No.

804
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,521
She asked you to bring me up.

805
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,525
So bring me up.

806
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,371
We'll go together.

807
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,040
It reminds me of home.

808
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:34,690
Ready?

809
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,285
Jack.

810
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,369
Dream of us.

811
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,725
Jack...

812
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,328
<i>Flight recorder
playback for the Odyssey mission.</i>

813
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,960
<i>3 May, 2017.</i>

814
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,764
Okay, Bob.

815
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,449
Ready for space?

816
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:50,047
<i>Good morning, Odyssey, from
your friends here at Mission Control.</i>

817
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,280
<i>Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.</i>

818
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,681
<i>Thank you for that
fantastic wake-up call.</i>

819
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,126
<i>Pre-rendezvous
checks complete.</i>

820
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:59,682
<i>Electrical guidance
and nav systems, all good.</i>

821
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,049
Range behind object,
250 clicks...

822
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:07,000
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.

823
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,004
<i>Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.</i>

824
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,204
<i>After 39 days of sleep, sounds
like you're ready to go.</i>

825
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,564
I'm ready to go.

826
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,570
<i>Your next burn will
bring you up level</i>

827
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:20,883
<i>and co-speed at 50 kilometer
range, where you'll hold.</i>

828
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,682
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object

829
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,007
for sensor scan and evaluation.

830
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,890
Targets look good.

831
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:31,362
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...

832
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,567
Ignition.

833
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,721
<i>We see a good burn.</i>

834
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,406
<i>Are you reading any
output from the object?</i>

835
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,601
Negative.

836
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,683
Zero heat.
No EMR.

837
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,731
There's no sign of life.

838
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,769
<i>How is the rest
of the crew doing?</i>

839
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,241
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen
should be up here shortly.

840
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,722
The rest of the crew
remains in delta sleep.

841
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,279
<i>Copy that.</i>

842
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,601
<i>You missed a hell
of a game last night.</i>

843
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,684
What did I tell you guys? No
spoilers about last night's game.

844
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,241
I'm looking forward to
watching it when I get back.

845
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,400
You're not talking about
football already, are you?

846
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,721
<i>Good morning, Vika.</i>

847
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,120
<i>Good morning, Sally.</i>

848
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,049
<i>How are you doing
this lovely morning?</i>

849
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,771
Another day in paradise.

850
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,401
Hey.

851
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,401
One for history.

852
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,521
Yeah.

853
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:37,969
<i>Tech-49,
I have you on approach.</i>

854
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,085
Hello, Sally.

855
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,602
It's a busy morning, huh?

856
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,003
<i>I'm picking up
a second passenger, Jack.</i>

857
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,926
It's Julia Rusakova,

858
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,125
the female survivor
from the crashed module.

859
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,962
<i>State your intention.</i>

860
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,287
Deliver the survivor,
as requested.

861
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,484
We are

862
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,801
a more effective team.

863
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,649
<i>Proceed to entry.</i>

864
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,486
<i>Mission, we have a situation.</i>

865
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:24,645
<i>The last burn was spot-on to give
us a 50-click hold from object,</i>

866
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,322
but radar range
still decreasing.

867
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,290
We're accelerating
toward the object.

868
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,010
We're going to need
full OMS burn to pull away.

869
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,810
Initiate now.
Entering target.

870
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,571
Gimbals set.
Target's good.

871
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,683
Arm forward engines.
Engines on.

872
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,842
Ready? Let's go.

873
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,364
Mission, we're in full OMS
burn, trying to back out.

874
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,159
There's a lot of vibration.

875
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,919
We're not getting
away from this thing.

876
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,526
<i>Odyssey, telemetry shows
structural overstress.</i>

877
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,047
<i>Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?</i>

878
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,367
Cutting off burn.

879
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,524
Mission.

880
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,645
Mission?
Mission?

881
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,046
Sally?

882
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:16,049
Increased acceleration
toward the object.

883
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,282
Estimated contact
within two minutes.

884
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,808
I'm going to eject
the sleep module.

885
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,488
It's programmed for
reinsertion into Earth orbit.

886
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,564
I'll fly the Command module
out if I break free.

887
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,529
I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.

888
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,761
That's an order!

889
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,041
Jack, no, we're a team.

890
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,405
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!

891
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,731
Dream of us.

892
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,361
Jack...

893
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,888
<i>Tech-49,
enter at headway speed.</i>

894
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:11,287
Entering at headway.

895
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,646
You buck up, Bob.

896
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,321
Don't go all shaky on me.

897
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,124
<i>Jack, I can't help notice</i>

898
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:12,001
<i>your respiration
and heart rate have increased.</i>

899
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:15,320
I'm just excited to
finally meet you, Sally.

900
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,526
<i>There's been a pattern of
insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

901
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,086
Yeah.

902
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,523
I feel bad about that.

903
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:30,520
<i>Voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

904
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,489
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

905
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,290
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

906
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:43,562
I want Julia to live.

907
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,685
I want our species to survive.

908
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,688
This is the only way.

909
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:01,206
<i>Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.</i>

910
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,523
<i>Welcome home, Jack.</i>

911
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,481
Come on.

912
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,524
<i>Jack,
you're doing the right thing.</i>

913
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:23,402
I don't know what you
are, or where you're from,

914
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:28,289
but I'd like to tell you
about something I read.

915
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:32,369
A story from Rome,

916
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,840
a city you destroyed.

917
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,364
It's a classic.

918
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,369
There was a guy, Horatius,

919
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:46,369
held the bridge alone
against a whole army.

920
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,000
And what Horatius said was,

921
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,208
"How can a man die better..."

922
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:55,968
<i>You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.</i>

923
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:58,521
Everybody dies, Sally.

924
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,364
The thing is, to die well.

925
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:13,883
<i>Jack, that's not
the survivor you promised me.</i>

926
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,642
No, it's not.

927
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:42,881
What Horatius said was,

928
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:46,044
"How can a man die better"

929
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:51,567
<i>"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

930
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:55,328
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!

931
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,164
<i>"For the ashes of his fathers"</i>

932
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,771
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

933
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,448
<i>I created you, Jack.</i>

934
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,682
<i>I am your God.</i>

935
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,764
Fuck you, Sally.

936
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,161
<i>Earth, after the war.</i>

937
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,282
<i>Three years have passed
since I saw your face.</i>

938
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:28,566
<i>I wonder if I come to
you at night, in dreams.</i>

939
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,967
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

940
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,966
<i>Do I haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine?</i>

941
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,925
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

942
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,250
<i>when you look at her.</i>

943
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,323
Mommy, look.

944
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,168
<i>If we have souls, they are
made of the love we share.</i>

945
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,007
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

946
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,401
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

947
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:38,641
<i>For three years, I searched
for the house he built.</i>

948
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,931
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

949
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:48,161
<i>Because I know him.</i>

950
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,922
<i>I am him.</i>

951
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,321
Who's that?

952
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:12,086
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

953
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,171
<i>And I am home.</i>
