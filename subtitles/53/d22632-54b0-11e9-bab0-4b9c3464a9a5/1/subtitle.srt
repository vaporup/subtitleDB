and go with Swigert. . .

00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,787
<i>wishing everyone back on Earth...</i>

670
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,030
<i>a pleasant evening.</i>

671
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,871
All right.

672
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,570
FRED JR. : Daddy was funny.

673
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,410
They might air a few minutes
on the news tonight.

674
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,073
You'd think so.

675
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:36,975
Bye.

676
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,587
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise show. . .

677
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,653
l'd say that was
a pretty successful broadcast.

678
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,659
<i>CAPCOM 1 : That was an excellent show.</i>

679
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,161
Thank you very much, Houston.

680
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,459
CAPCOM 1 : We've got a couple
of housekeeping procedures.

681
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:56,128
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

682
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,667
Roger that. Rolling right, 0-6-0.

683
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:08,411
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

684
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,649
Roger that.

685
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,832
[Alarm sounding]

686
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,772
[Loud crashing]

687
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,283
We've got a problem here.

688
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,518
- What did you do?
- Nothing. l stirred the tanks.

689
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,825
This is Houston. Say again, please.

690
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,467
Houston, we have a problem.

691
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,395
We have a main bus B undervolt.

692
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,633
- We've got a lot of thruster activity.
- What's with the computer?

693
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,972
JlM: lt just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

694
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,479
JACK: l'm checking the quad.
FRED: That was no repress valve.

695
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,481
Maybe it's in quad C .
l'll reconfigure the RCS.

696
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,650
We've got a ping light.

697
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,586
We've got multiple caution and warnings.
We've got to reset and restart.

698
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,454
l'm going to SCS.

699
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,093
Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

700
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:32,827
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

701
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,427
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.

702
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,270
Fuel cells one and three are. . . .

703
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,676
What's going on?
Flight, let me get back to you.

704
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,678
Flight, GNC . They're all over the place.

705
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,943
- They keep going close to gimbal lock.
- l keep losing radio signal.

706
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,984
Their antennae must be flipped around.

707
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,578
- They'll have to do it manually, if at all.
- One at a time, people.

708
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:58,584
ls this an instrumentation problem
or real power loss?

709
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,592
lt's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

710
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,630
lt's got to be instrumentation.

711
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,258
Get the hatch plugged.
A meteor may have hit the LEM.

712
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,336
FRED: The tunnel's really torquing
with all this movement.

713
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:13,671
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
associated with a master alarm.

714
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,573
Shit, it's main bus A.

715
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,772
<i>CAPCOM 1 : Main bus A undervolt?
FRED: Main bus A undervolt down to. . . .</i>

716
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:24,415
lt's reading 25-and-a-half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

717
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,845
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

718
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,617
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

719
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,590
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

720
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,184
<i>CAPCOM 1 : You are breaking up.
JACK: Can't get this hatch to seal.</i>

721
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,756
Just stow it. lf we'd been hit by a meteor,
we'd be dead by now.

722
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,957
l'm gonna try to get us out of this.

723
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,594
Houston, did you say switch to omni bravo?

724
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,696
CAPCOM 1 : Roger that, 1 3.
FRED: The signal strength went way down.

725
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:50,301
lt's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

726
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,972
<i>CAPCOM 1 : We need a confirmation.
What systems are down?</i>

727
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,479
SMRCS, Helium one. . . .

728
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,849
A and C are barber pole.

729
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,022
Houston, l'm switching over
Quad C to main A.

730
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,183
CAPCOM 1 : Roger that, 1 3.

731
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,388
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.

732
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:12,998
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

733
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,565
What don't we have?
AC bus one, AC bus two.

734
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,137
Command module computer. O2 flow high.

735
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,741
lt may be a caution and warning failure.

736
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:28,213
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

737
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:33,352
<i>l can see it outside window one right now.</i>

738
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,319
<i>lt's definitely a gas of some sort.</i>

739
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,124
lt's got to be the oxygen.

740
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,174
Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

741
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,378
CONTROLLER: Give me an alignment.

742
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,888
GENE: Let's think about things
we can connect.

743
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,423
Let's start back at the beginning.

744
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,560
[All talking franticly]

745
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,265
GENE: Listen up. Quiet down, people.

746
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,901
Let's stay cool, people.

747
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,880
Procedures, l need
another computer up in the RTCC .

748
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,441
l want everybody
to alert your support teams.

749
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,282
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

750
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,721
Let's work the problem, people.

751
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,086
Let's not make things worse by guessing.

752
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:49,391
<i>CAPCOM 1 : 13 , this is Houston. We're going
around the room. We'll get you answers.</i>

753
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,430
<i>JACK: We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.</i>

754
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,000
Take a look at the O2 on number one.

755
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,699
200 pounds and falling.

756
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,702
O2 tank two still zero.

757
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,306
<i>EECOM: Tank one: 21 8 psi and falling.
FRED: ls that what you're getting? Confirm.</i>

758
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:14,150
CAPCOM 1 : Wo're seeing the same, 1 3.
GENE: Can we review our status, Sy?

759
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,385
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

760
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,860
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

761
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,364
l'll get back to you, Gene.

762
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,371
We're not gonna have power much longer.

763
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,007
The ship's bleeding to death.

764
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,944
EECOM: Flight?
GENE: Yeah. Go, EECCM.

765
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,849
Flight, l recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

766
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,721
What the hell good is that gonna do?

767
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,227
lf the leak's there, we can isolate it.

768
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:02,034
We can save what's left in the tanks,
and run on the good cell.

769
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:06,596
You close them, you can't open them again.
You can't land on the moon with one cell.

770
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,603
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

771
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,344
From my chair here, this is the last option.

772
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,381
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

773
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:42,169
Capcom, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

774
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,108
13, this is Houston.

775
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:49,439
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

776
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,045
Are you saying you want the whole smash?

777
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,750
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shutdown?

778
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,919
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did l hear you right?

779
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,624
Yeah, they heard me right.

780
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,926
Tell them we think that's the only way
they can stop the leak.

781
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,300
Yeah, Jim. . .

782
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,773
<i>we think that closing the react valves
may stop the leak.</i>

783
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,646
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

784
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,790
Yes, Houston, we copy.

785
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,464
We just lost the moon.

786
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,371
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

787
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,246
Let's see what this does.

788
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,656
lf this doesn't work. . .

789
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,951
we're not gonna have enough power left
to get home.

790
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,107
- Shit!
- God damn it!

791
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,445
FRED: Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

792
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,120
How long does it take to power up the LEM?

793
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,319
Three hours by the checklist.

794
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,688
We don't have that much time.

795
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,356
Shit!

796
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,335
JlM: Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here. . .

797
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:53,031
let's power down everything so we can save
as much as we can for re-entry.

798
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,801
Fifteen minutes of oxygen, that's it.
The command module will be dead.

799
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,677
Okay, guys, listen up. Here's the drill.

800
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,782
We're moving the astronauts to the LEM.

801
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,545
We've got to get oxygen up there.

802
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:08,520
TELMU , Control, l want emergency
power procedure. Essential hardware only.

803
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:12,889
GNC , EECOM, we'll be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

804
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,860
We've to transfer the guidance system
to another computer.

805
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,796
l want those numbers up and ready
when they're in position.

806
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:23,167
EECOM: Transfer all data over the LEM
computer before the command module dies.

807
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,467
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.

808
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,698
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

809
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:33,537
<i>Power up the LEM at the same time,
so get somebody over there.</i>

810
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,048
We already have Freddo in the LEM.

811
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,209
<i>CAPCOM 1 : We've got serious time pressure.</i>

812
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,879
<i>Get the guidance program transferred...</i>

813
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:43,548
<i>before you're out of power
in the command module...</i>

814
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,192
<i>or you're not gonna be able to navigate.</i>

815
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,261
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

816
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,560
We're looking at less than
1 5 minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

817
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:59,667
JlM: We've got 1 5 minutes, Freddo.
lt's worse than l thought.

818
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:05,240
<i>Houston, l've moved
from the command module into the LEM.</i>

819
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,907
lf Jack can't get that data transferred
before they go dead--

820
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,281
They won't know which way they're pointed.

821
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,082
- That's a bad way to fly.
- l'll be in 21 0 if you need me.

822
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,453
<i>JACK: Houston, this is 13 .
Are you back with me now?</i>

823
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,861
<i>CAPCOM 1 : Aquarius, this is Houston.
You now have about 1 2 minutes to power up.</i>

824
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:30,302
l can't see any stars. Man, there's
a lot of debris floating around out there.

825
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,568
Houston, l have completed
the steps on Page 1 5.

826
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,610
l'm ready to power down the computer.

827
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:42,280
l'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack,
before you shut down the computer!

828
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:43,876
Okay, Jim.

829
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,919
l need this back before they power down.

lt's the option

Okay, hold it. Let's hold it down.

01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,051
The only engine we've got
with enough power for a direct abort. . .

955
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,212
is the SPS on the service module.

which means free-return trajectory.

Once we get the guys around the moon. . .

963
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,871

01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,920
You wanna look?

987
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,660
FRED: Oh, look at that.

988
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,340
<i>CAPCOM 2: Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.</i>

989
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,581
FRED: Mare Tranquillitatis.

990
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,087
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

991
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,118
Coming up on Mount Marilyn.

992
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,852
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.

993
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,953
l've seen it.

994
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:05,967
<i>CAPCOM 2: Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

995
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,634
<i>JACK: We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.</i>

996
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,813
<i>So long, Earth. Catch you on the flip side.</i>

997
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,323
<i>JACK: [On TV] When you go
into the shadow of the moon...</i>

998
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,825
<i>and the moon is between you and the sun...</i>

999
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,955
<i>you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...</i>

1000
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,089
<i>on the clearest nights here on Earth.</i>

1001
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:37,103
<i>And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surtace.</i>

1002
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:42,502
<i>lt must be an awe-inspiring sight.
l can't wait to see it myself.</i>

1003
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:47,470
<i>The problem now is not so much a question
of adequate oxygen supply...</i>

1004
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,675
<i>but it is the rate of consumption of water...</i>

1005
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,876
<i>which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...</i>

1006
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,045
<i>to maintain the electronic systems....</i>

1007
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,593
FRED: Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1008
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,926
l can see our landing site.

1009
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,071
JACK: Look at the Tsiolkovsky Crater.

1010
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,509
l can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1011
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,478
FRED: lt's like snow. lt's beautiful.

1012
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,084
That's Mare lmbrium to the north.

1013
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,148
<i>CAPCOM 2: 13 , this is Houston.</i>

1014
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:07,983
<i>We're reading your telemetry.
lt's good to see you again.</i>

1015
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,547
Good to see you, too, Houston.

1016
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:14,783
<i>CAPCOM 2: We are picking you up
at a velocity of 7 ,062 feet per second...</i>

1017
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,525
<i>at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.</i>

1018
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,666
<i>Stand by for your PC + 2 burn data.</i>

1019
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:26,900
FRED: Got to tell you, l had an itch to take
this baby down, do some prospecting.

1020
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,173
Damn, we were close.

1021
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,507
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?

1022
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,518
l'd like to go home.

1023
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,215
We got a burn coming up.

1024
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,588
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1025
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,555
Let's get an idea where we stand
on the consumables.

1026
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,531
Jack, get into the Odyssey. . .

1027
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:00,062
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1028
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:03,833
Let's go home.

1029
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,437
<i>CAPCOM 2: Aquarius, we got some
PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.</i>

1030
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:12,509
So you're telling me
you can only give our guys 45 hours?

1031
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,720
That brings them to about there.

1032
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,894
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1033
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,828
ARTHUR: Gene, we've got to talk
about power.

1034
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,597
Guys! Power is everything !

1035
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,832
ARTHUR: Power is everything.
GENE: What do you mean?

1036
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,066
Without it, they don't talk to us,
correct their trajectory. . .

1037
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:36,165
they don't turn the heat shield around.

1038
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,838
We gotta turn everything off. Now.
They're not gonna make it to re-entry.

1039
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:44,645
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- lf everything's on, the LEM draws 60 amps.

1040
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,483
At that rate, in 1 6 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1041
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,686
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 1 2 amps.

1042
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,315
ENGlNEER 1 : Twelve amps?
ENGlNEER 2: How many?

1043
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,690
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 1 2 amps, John.

1044
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:59,322
We gotta turn off the radars, cabin heater. . .

1045
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,867
instrument displays,
guidance computer, everything.

1046
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,563
Guidance computer?
What if they need to do another burn?

1047
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,571
They won't know which way they're pointed.

1048
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,869
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1049
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,671
l've looked at data for the past hour.

1050
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,269
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1051
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:22,549
Okay, John. The minute we finish the burn,
we'll power down the LEM.

1052
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,021
All right.

1053
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:29,059
Now, in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1054
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:32,755
Soon, we'll have to power it up
using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

1055
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,563
- That's never been tried before.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1056
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,866
Well, we're gonna have to figure it out.

1057
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,401
l want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1058
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:45,934
l want you to find every engineer
who designed every switch, circuit. . .

1059
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,535
transistor and light bulb up there.

1060
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,312
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly line
who actually built the thing.

1061
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:55,115
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1062
01:16:55,777 --> 01:17:00,487
l want this mark all the way back to Earth
with time to spare.

1063
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,018
We never lost an American in space.

1064
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,661
We're sure as hell not gonna lose one
on my watch.

1065
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,495
Failure is not an option.

1066
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,308
- What?
- Good, you're not dead.

1067
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:22,241
l've been trying to get in touch with you
for 45 minutes.

1068
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,838
Jesus, what're you doing here?

1069
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:26,544
l gotta get you in the simulator.
We got a ship to land.

1070
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,849
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1071
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:32,549
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells gone,
command module's shut down.

1072
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:35,255
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1073
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,489
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.

1074
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:40,498
We'll have to shut that down
pretty soon, too.

1075
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:43,600
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one.

1076
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,502
Nobody's too sure
how much power we'll have for re-entry.

1077
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:49,507
The command module
will be frozen up pretty good by then.

1078
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:54,103
lf you see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1079
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,875
lf it spikes, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1080
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,417
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1081
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,418
FRANK: How much power
do we have to play with?

1082
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,955
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1083
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,514
<i>ARTHUR: Go.
SIM TECH: Ken Mattingly just got here.</i>

1084
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,286

1085
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,985
YOUNG: They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1086
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:13,156
They'll start getting water condensation
on the control panels.

1087
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,166
Glad you're here.
You know what's going on?

1088
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,758
John's brought me up to speed.

1089
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,998
- What's left in the batteries?
- We don't know.

1090
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,506
We gotta get started
on some shortcuts for power-up.

1091
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:22,972
You know how short?

1092
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,944
lt's all in the sequencing. lf we can skip
whatever we don't absolutely need. . .

1093
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,607
- turn things on in the right order, maybe--
- l agree.

1094
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:33,209
- You started on a procedure?
- Engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

1095
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,811
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1096
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,548
Frank, l need the sim cold and dark.

1097
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,320
Give me the exact conditions
they've got in there now.

1098
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,022
- l need status of every instrument.
- You got it.

1099
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:47,122
l need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1100
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,430
KEN: Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1101
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,836

Put him in space, fellas.

1102
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:57,973
Okay, Houston, the quad-heater
circuit breakers are open.

1103
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,068
CAPCOM 2: Copy that.

1104
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,113
We'll use the forward omni
when the Earth's in the window. . .

1105
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,809
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1106
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,544
CAPCOM 2: Wo copy that, 1 3.

1107
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,452
<i>Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.</i>

1108
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,115
<i>The venting may push you off course.</i>

1109
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,788
FRED: Oh, Christ.
JACK: What's up?

1110
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:19,262
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1111
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,996
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1112
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:26,395
JlM: Okay, Houston,
that leaves us with just the computer. . .

1113
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,169
which l'm shutting down now.

1114
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,139
And that's it.

1115
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,481
We just put Sir lsaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1116
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,591
ls it a.m. or p.m.?

1117
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,191
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1118
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,824
Haise is running a temperature,
and no one has slept.

1119
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,871
l can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1120
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,872
FAO: lt's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1121
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:06,541
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1122
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,012
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1123
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,642
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for two guys for a day and a half.

1124
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,119
- l told the doc--
- We're up to eight on the gauges.

1125
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:18,522
Anything over 1 5
and you get impaired judgment, blackouts. . .

1126
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,057
the beginnings of brain asphyxia.

1127
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,059
What about scrubbers
in the command module?

1128
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,654
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1129
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,058
Tell me this isn't a government operation.

1130
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,968

01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:16,777
<i>When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi,
he may have looked ahead to a fine family...</i>

1143
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,282
<i>but he never dreamt of flying.</i>

1144
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,944
<i>l'd never flown
before l went into the service...</i>

1145
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,921
<i>and l only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission....</i>

1146
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,460
HENRY: Good morning.
MARlLYN: Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1147
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,659
l have a request from the news people.

1148
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,958
They're out front here and they want
to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1149
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,238
Transmitter?

1150
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,999
lt's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.

1151
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:51,683
l thought they didn't care about the mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1152
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,651
Well, it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are--

1153
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,783
lf landing on the moon wasn't dramatic
enough, why should not landing on it be?

1154
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:04,225
Look, l realize how hard this is, Marilyn. . .

1155
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,230
but the whole world is caught up in it.

1156
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,028
- lt's the biggest story since--
- No, Henry.

1157
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:13,837
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1158
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:17,699
lf they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1159
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,939
He'll be home on Friday.

1160
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,745
[Melancholy country song playing]

1161
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:05,658
Hey, Fred.

1162
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,450
lt's too cold in there.

1163
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,537
That's a nice one of Mary.

1164
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,446
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- l'll survive.

1165
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,850
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- l took some.

1166
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,718
Jim, l'm all right.

1167
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,657
lt was an accident, Mary getting pregnant.

1168
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,999
You should have seen the look on my face
when she told me.

1169
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:54,566
Well, that has a tendency to happen.

1170
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,409
l wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

1171
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,320
You're gonna find out soon enough.

1172
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,448
Sure.

1173
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,457
l never dreamed l'd ever get
to do something like this.

1174
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,294
Come up here on a real mission.

1175
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,901
Most of the guys l graduated
high school with. . .

1176
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,335
never even left home, and here l am.

1177
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:27,968
Oh, yeah.

1178
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,540
Here you are.

1179
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,983
lt hurts when l urinate.

1180
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,511
- Well, you're not getting enough water.
- l'm drinking my ration the same as you.

1181
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,487
l think old Swigert gave me the clap.

1182
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:53,329
He's been pissing in my relief tube.

1183
01:24:56,091 --> 01:25:00,095
Well, that will be a hot one
at the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1184
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:04,234
That's another first
for America's space program.

1185
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:11,346
Listen, l've been going over some stuff. . .

1186
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:16,983
and l'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1187
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:21,790
We quit heating the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1188
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,852
JlM: lt could cost us amp hours
on the back end?

1189
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,158
FRED: That's a possibility.

1190
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,324
JACK: l've been going over
the numbers again.

1191
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,925
Have they called up with a re-entry plan yet?

1192
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,494
- We're coming in too shallow--
- We're working on it.

1193
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:36,269
l can't remember the ratio to temperature.
We got no references on board.

1194
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,640
Let's see if Houston
can pull up the mil specs--

1195
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,511
Listen, they gave us too much Delta V.
They had us burn too long.

1196
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,142
At this rate we'll skip right out
of the atmosphere, and never get back.

1197
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,787
What are you talking about?
How'd you figure that?

1198
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,320
l can add.

1199
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,788
- Many PhDs are working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1200
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:59,854
What if they made a mistake
and there was no way to reverse it?

1201
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,228
You think they'd tell us?

1202
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:04,599
JACK: There's no reason to tell us!
FRED: What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1203
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:07,138
There's 1 ,000 things
that have to happen in order.

1204
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:12,109
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1205
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,442
ln the meantime, l'm trying to tell you
we're coming in too fast.

1206
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:18,882
l think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a re-entry plan.

1207
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,147
That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.

1208
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,455
God damn this piece of shit!

1209
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:27,552
This piece of shit's gonna get you home.

1210
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:31,255
That's because that's the only thing
we've got left, Jack!

1211
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,996
- What are you saying, Fred?
- l think you know what l'm saying.

1212
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,161
Now wait a minute.
All l did was stir those tanks.

1213
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,740
What was the gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1214
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:45,266
Don't tell me how to fly the CM!
They brought me in to do a job!

1215
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:48,575
They asked me to stir the damn tanks,
and l stirred the tanks!

1216
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,412
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1217
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,417
No one is saying it is.

1218
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:57,450
lf l'm in the left-hand seat
when the call comes up, l stir the tanks.

1219
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:58,581
Well, tell him that.

1220
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,888
l just asked you what the gauge
was reading, and you don't know!

1221
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,826
Look, we're not doing this, gentlemen.

1222
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,661
We're not bouncing off the walls
for ten minutes. . .

1223
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,667
because we'll just end up
with the same problems!

1224

1230
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:34,748
Our CO2 measurement
has jumped four notches in the last hour.

1231
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,953
That can't be right.
l went over those numbers three times.

We were expecting that.</i>

Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down.

1459
01:42:52,232 --> 01:42:53,972
- Okay, l got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1460
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,103
<i>JIM: Little farther. Ease your touch!</i>

1461
01:42:57,404 --> 01:43:00,282
Damn it, that's mine. That's me. Around.

1462
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:05,313
FRED: A little more. Come on, baby.
JlM: That's it. Hold it.

1463
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:08,416
JlM: Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
JACK: . . .eight, nine!

1464
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:09,857
Shutdown !

1465
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:22,729
Houston, we have shutdown.

1466
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:25,468
<i>CAPCOM 2: That's close enough, Jim.
Good work.</i>

1467
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,148
l knew it! How about that LEM!
How about it?

1468
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:34,452
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1469
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:38,456
<i>CAPCOM 2: 13 , stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.</i>

1470
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:42,657
Let's hope we don't have to do that again.

1471
01:43:56,563 --> 01:44:00,806
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive till re-entry.

1472
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:03,478
Well done.

1473
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:10,252
Now we gotta get them in,
so tell me about the power-up procedures.

1474
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,790
Here's the order of what l want to do.

1475
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:16,691
l want to power up guidance,
ECS, communications. . .

1476
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:21,624
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1477
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:24,597
The thrusters will put you
over budget on amps.

1478
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,762
They've been sitting at 200 below
for four days. They gotta be heated.

1479
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:30,831
Fine. Then trade off the parachutes.

1480
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:35,178
- lf the chutes don't open, what's the point?
- You're telling me what you need.

1481
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:39,046
l'm telling you what we have to work with.
l'm not making this stuff up.

1482
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:41,209
They're going to need all these systems.

1483
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:44,812
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1484
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:52,225
l'll reorganize the sequencing again
and find more power.

1485
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,699
Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.

1486
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:01,369
l don't know where the hell we'll find it.

1487
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:05,767
<i>Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space...</i>

1488
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:08,744
<i>almost 24 days already,
than any other man...</i>

1489
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:11,441
<i>and l asked him recently
if he ever was scared.</i>

1490
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:14,712
<i>JIM: [On TV] l've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...</i>

1491
01:45:14,775 --> 01:45:19,690
<i>and was curious as to whether it was going
to light up again, things of that nature...</i>

1492
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:21,850
<i>but they seem to work out.</i>

1493
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:23,755
<i>BERGMAN: ls there an instance...</i>

1494
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:27,059
<i>in an airplane emergency
when you can recall fear?</i>

1495
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:31,300
<i>JIM: Well, l remember this one time...</i>

1496
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:35,202
<i>in a Banshee at night in combat conditions,
so the carrier has no lights.</i>

1497
01:45:35,262 --> 01:45:37,901
<i>lt wes the Shangri-la.
We were in the Sea of Japan.</i>

1498
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:41,604
<i>My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...</i>

1499
01:45:41,702 --> 01:45:45,081
<i>because somebody in Japan
was using the same frequency...</i>

1500
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,714
<i>and so it was leading me away
from where l was supposed to be.</i>

1501
01:45:49,142 --> 01:45:54,057
<i>l'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so l flip on my map light.</i>

1502
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:58,156
<i>Then, suddenly, zap! Everything shorts out
right there in my cockpit.</i>

1503
01:45:58,251 --> 01:46:02,529
<i>All my instruments and lights are gone,
l can't even tell what my altitude is.</i>

1504
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:07,896
<i>l know l'm running out of fuel,
so l'm thinking about ditching in the ocean.</i>

1505
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:11,568
<i>l look down there,
and then in the darkness...</i>

1506
01:46:11,665 --> 01:46:14,304
<i>there's this green trail.</i>

1507
01:46:14,468 --> 01:46:18,882
<i>lt's like a long carpet that's just laid
out beneath me. lt was the algae!</i>

1508
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,079
<i>lt was that phosphorescent stuff that gets
churned up in the wake of a big ship.</i>

1509
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:26,418
<i>lt was just leading me home.</i>

1510
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:29,819
<i>And if my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out...</i>

1511
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,192
<i>there's no way
l'd have ever been able to see that.</i>

1512
01:46:32,252 --> 01:46:34,823
<i>So, you never know...</i>

1513
01:46:34,921 --> 01:46:38,368
<i>what events are going to transpire
to get you home.</i>

1514
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:47,076
<i>BERGMAN: Spacecraft commander
Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergency is he.</i>

1515
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:00,952
- How's it going, Fred?
- l'm okay.

1516
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:02,758
[Loud banging]

1517
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,090
What the hell was that?

1518
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:08,295
Let's hope it was just the burst disk.

1519
01:47:08,355 --> 01:47:12,428
JlM: Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
CAPCOM 1 : Wo confirm that.

1520
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:16,267
Houston, is that going to affect
our entry angle at all?

1521
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:20,106
<i>CAPCOM 1 : Negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.</i>

1522
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,210
JlM: Houston. . .

1523
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:28,311
we sure could use
the re-entry procedure up here.

1524
01:47:29,209 --> 01:47:31,279
<i>When can we expect that?</i>

1525
01:47:33,647 --> 01:47:35,990
That's coming real soon, Aquarius.

1526
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,653
Houston, we. . . .

1527
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:41,724
We just can't throw this together
at the last minute.

1528
01:47:41,855 --> 01:47:44,232
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1529
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:48,199
You're gonna get the procedure up to us,
whatever it is. . .

1530
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:52,536
and we're gonna go over it step by step,
so there's no foul-ups.

1531
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:56,477
l don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1532
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:59,346
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1533
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,051
- Jim, this is Deke.
- lt's Deke.

1534
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,751
They don't know how to do it.

1535
01:48:05,278 --> 01:48:06,882
Maybe Jack's right.

1536
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:10,325
Hello, Deke. What's the story?

1537
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:14,387
We're gonna get that procedure to you
as soon as we possibly can.

1538
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,865
<i>Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.</i>

1539
01:48:18,191 --> 01:48:20,034
Ken's working on it?

1540
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:27,335
Look, l know this sequence works, John.

1541
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:30,209
lt looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1542
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:32,646
KEN: By how much?
ARTHUR: Three or four amps.

1543
01:48:32,706 --> 01:48:34,845
God damn it, John ! ls it three or four?

1544
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:36,487
- Four.
- Four!

1545
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:39,714
Four more amps.

1546
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:53,200
They have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1547
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:54,497
ARTHUR: Yeah.

1548
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:59,834
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1549
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:03,472
- lt's backup for the LEM power supply.
- l'm listening.

1550
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:08,546
So reverse it. Reverse the flow
and see if we can draw these four amps. . .

1551
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:11,486
from the LEM before we cut it loose.
Why can't we do that?

1552
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:16,652
- We don't have a procedure for that?
- You'll lose a lot in the transfer.

1553
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:20,220
Yeah. But all we're talking about here
is four amps.

1554
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:24,094
l want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1555
01:49:24,157 --> 01:49:27,103
- Gene, they're already--
- Not all, just part.

1556
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:30,106
- We've got to give them something.
- They're working on it.

1557
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:32,267
- l'll get an estimate.
- God damn it!

1558
01:49:32,332 --> 01:49:36,575
l don't want another estimate!
l want the procedures now!

1559
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,425
lMU is up.

1560
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:54,324
<i>KEN: How am l reading?
ARTHUR: Fine, so far.</i>

1561
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:57,126
<i>KEN: Say again.
ARTHUR: You're under the limit. Keep going.</i>

1562
01:49:58,124 --> 01:50:00,263
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1563
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,699
<i>KEN: Okay, l'm bringing up the guidance.</i>

1564
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:08,810
Here we go.

1565
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:12,043
KEN: CMC Attitude lMU .

1566
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:14,650
<i>CMC source.</i>

1567
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:18,648
CMC mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1568
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:32,328
KEN: Go ahead.
ARTHUR: ls your computer on now?

1569
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:34,868
KEN: Up and running.

1570
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:37,174
How do we look?

1571
01:50:46,673 --> 01:50:48,743
l think we got it, buddy.

1572
01:50:58,885 --> 01:51:02,491
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1573
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:05,828
ARTHUR: Excuse me, gentlemen.
KEN: l was getting a little blurry there.

1574
01:51:09,095 --> 01:51:11,131
GENE: Here's Ken. Here's John.

1575
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:14,102
lt's good to see you, Ken.

1576
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:15,775
This is the sequence.

1577
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:19,077
GENE: Was it tried on the hardware yet?
ARTHUR: We didn't have time.

1578
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:22,449
Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

1579
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:25,445
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1580
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:30,119
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1581
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:33,994
That's a negative, Jim.
l don't have the measles.

1582
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:40,762
<i>Jim, is Jack in there with you?</i>

1583
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:44,039
Yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1584
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:47,042
JACKlE: Put those on the table.
JANE: Damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1585
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:49,476
l think it would really help if you could. . .

1586
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:53,950
just distract her
when the heavy predictions come in.

1587
01:51:54,974 --> 01:51:57,113
- We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1588
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:02,885
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch television with you.

1589
01:52:02,949 --> 01:52:06,624
- This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz.
- Nice to meet you.

1590
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,793
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program, too?

1591
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:16,131
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1592
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:17,964
Stand by, Ken.

1593
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:25,978
Ken, l'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1594
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:29,382
l guess l was
a little more tired than l thought.

1595
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:37,053
Don't worry, Jack. l'll talk you through it.

1596
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:42,629
Find the main bus breakers on panel 1 1 .

1597
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:47,001
Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.

1598
01:52:47,227 --> 01:52:48,728
<i>KEN: Close main bus B.</i>

1599
01:52:56,903 --> 01:53:00,680
Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation
on these panels.

1600
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:03,714
What's the word
on these things shorting out?

1601
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:10,925
We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

1602
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:17,026
lt's like trying to drive a toaster
through a car wash.

1603
01:53:24,597 --> 01:53:26,508
<i>JACK: Main bus B is closed.</i>

1604
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:29,171
<i>KEN: 13 , we're coming up on entry interface.</i>

1605
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:32,875
FlDO: Flight, we're still shallowing up a bit
in the re-entry corridor.

1606
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:35,112
lt's almost like they're underweight.

1607
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:38,551
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1608
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,225
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1609
01:53:43,216 --> 01:53:44,660
<i>KEN: One more thing, Jim.</i>

1610
01:53:44,717 --> 01:53:47,697
<i>While Jack's working on the power-up,
we want you and Freddo...</i>

1611
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:50,257
<i>to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.</i>

1612
01:53:50,356 --> 01:53:52,233
Say again, Houston. Ballast?

1613
01:53:52,859 --> 01:53:55,737
That's affirm. We got to get the weight right.

1614

01:59:08,808 --> 01:59:10,309
l'm freezing.

1703
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,451
Can you hold out just a little longer?

1704
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:18,123
- Long as l have to.
- Come on.

1705
01:59:19,051 --> 01:59:22,464
lt won't be long. Just a little while longer.

1723
02:00:57,016 --> 02:01:00,326
Yeah, Ken, l'm gonna check
those pyro batteries one more time here.

1724
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:06,133
The pyro batts look good. l don't think
we have to tie the other batteries.

1725
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:21,083
Sorry, Jack, this is an old habit.

1726
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:24,450

She's yours to fly.

What is that?

1730
02:01:41,193 --> 02:01:42,797
JACK: l was getting a little punchy. . .

1731
02:01:42,862 --> 02:01:46,605
and l didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1732
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:49,710
That's good thinking.

1733
02:01:51,771 --> 02:01:53,511
Stand by, Houston.

1734
02:01:56,175 --> 02:01:58,518
<i>We have lunar module jettison.</i>

1735
02:02:06,385 --> 02:02:08,455

Let me put it this way.

1740
02:02:53,566 --> 02:02:56,410
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1741
02:02:56,469 --> 02:02:58,642
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1742
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:00,478
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1743
02:03:00,573 --> 02:03:03,576
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1744
02:03:03,676 --> 02:03:05,712
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1745
02:03:05,811 --> 02:03:08,882
But now l'm asking you,
when will we know?

1746
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:14,659
Blackout lasts for three minutes.
lf they're not back in four, we'll know.

1747
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:19,700
Velocity now reading 34,802 feet per second.

1748
02:03:19,825 --> 02:03:23,033
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1749
02:03:23,763 --> 02:03:28,575
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for re-entry. Jim,
we need that computer re-entry program.

1750
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:31,545
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay.

1751
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:35,545
<i>FRED: Batt A looks good.
KEN: Re-entry interface in one minute...</i>

1752
02:03:35,608 --> 02:03:39,248
<i>- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
- ...and 30 seconds.</i>

1753
02:03:40,379 --> 02:03:41,721
FRED: Batt C . . . .

1754
02:03:42,748 --> 02:03:44,784
No volts, only two amps.

1755
02:03:46,018 --> 02:03:48,589
lt may die before the main chutes open.

1756
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:51,800
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1757
02:03:51,891 --> 02:03:55,429
They're still shallowing a bit up there.
Do you want to tell them?

1758
02:03:56,195 --> 02:03:58,971
<i>GENE: ls there anything we can do about it?
RETRO: Not now, Flight.</i>

1759
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:01,703
<i>- Then they don't need to know, do they?
- Copy that.</i>

1760
02:04:01,801 --> 02:04:05,373
HENRY: RETRO says the typhoon
is still a presence in the splashdown area?

1761
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:08,349
We got the parachute situation. . .

1762
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:10,944
heat shield, angle of trajectory,
and a typhoon.

1763
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:14,855
- There are so many variables, l'm at a loss--
- l know what the problems are.

1764
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:18,017
This could be the worst disaster
NASA has experienced.

1765
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:22,724
With all due respect, sir,
l believe this is going to be our finest hour.

1766
02:04:35,668 --> 02:04:38,307
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.

1767
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:41,344
And on my mark, your velocity. . .

1768
02:04:41,407 --> 02:04:44,649
<i>will be 35,245 feet per second.</i>

1771
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:58,663
it's been a privilege flying with you.

1772
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:44,146
- Flight, we have loss of radio contact.
- Roger that.

1773
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:46,706
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

1774
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,185
lt all depends on the heat shield.

1775
02:06:25,477 --> 02:06:28,116
<i>BERGMAN: Back fo the lwo Jima
and our live cameras there.</i>

1776
02:06:28,547 --> 02:06:31,926
<i>The Navy recovery and rescue helicopters
already airborne...</i>

1777
02:06:31,984 --> 02:06:34,828
<i>circling, waiting for first radar contact.</i>

1778
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,627
<i>ANCHORMAN: Three minutes until time
of drogue deployment.</i>

1779
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:42,136
<i>Standing by for any reports of acquisition.</i>

1780
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:50,272
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1781
02:06:55,574 --> 02:06:58,179
<i>CRONKITE: No re-entering ship
has ever taken longer...</i>

1782
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:01,189
<i>than three minutes to emerge from blackout.</i>

1783
02:07:01,246 --> 02:07:04,659
<i>This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?</i>

1784
02:07:05,084 --> 02:07:09,032
<i>Will the command module survive
the intense heat of re-entry?</i>

1785
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:12,028
<i>lf it doesn't, there'll only be silence.</i>

1786
02:07:12,157 --> 02:07:15,228
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Sorry, sweetie.

1787
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:16,864
lt's okay.

1788
02:07:33,212 --> 02:07:35,385
Okay, Flight, that's three minutes.

1789
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:38,723
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1790
02:07:40,386 --> 02:07:42,889
KEN: Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1791
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:48,065
<i>CRONKITE: Expected time of reacquisition...</i>

1792
02:07:48,127 --> 02:07:51,665
<i>the time when the astronauts
were expected to come out of blackout...</i>

1793
02:07:52,097 --> 02:07:54,770
<i>has come and gone.</i>

1794
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:59,406
<i>About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.</i>

1795
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:02,315
<i>We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield...</i>

1796
02:08:02,374 --> 02:08:05,650
<i>which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago...</i>

1797
02:08:05,878 --> 02:08:08,654
<i>has withstood the inferno of re-entry.</i>

1798
02:08:12,751 --> 02:08:15,697
KEN: Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1799
02:08:21,927 --> 02:08:24,532
lNCO: Three minutes, 30 seconds.
Standing by.

1800
02:08:25,164 --> 02:08:27,507
KEN: Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1801
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:38,252
KEN: Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1802
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:45,187
That's four minutes. Standing by.

1803
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:09,579
KEN: Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1804
02:09:18,016 --> 02:09:20,428
<i>JIM: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.</i>

1805
02:09:20,552 --> 02:09:22,395
<i>lt's good to see you again.</i>

1806
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:48,488
Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home.

1807
02:09:48,814 --> 02:09:50,759
We're glad to see you.

1808
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:53,487
- Good job, Ken.
- Thank you.

1809
02:10:38,163 --> 02:10:39,664
They made it!

1810
02:11:22,608 --> 02:11:25,782
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1811
02:11:26,578 --> 02:11:28,921
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1812
02:11:29,248 --> 02:11:30,590
Good job.

1813
02:12:09,988 --> 02:12:11,694
[Loud applause and cheering]

1814
02:12:22,434 --> 02:12:25,073
<i>JlM: [Voiceover] Our mission
was called a successful failure...</i>

1815
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:28,412
<i>in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.</i>

1816
02:12:28,907 --> 02:12:31,216
<i>ln the following months it was determined...</i>

1817
02:12:31,276 --> 02:12:34,347
<i>that a damaged coil
built inside the oxygen tank...</i>

1818
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:39,153
<i>sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.</i>

1819
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:41,894
<i>lt was a minor defect
that occurred two years...</i>

1820
02:12:41,987 --> 02:12:44,399
<i>before l was even named
the flight's commander.</i>

1821
02:12:44,957 --> 02:12:48,370
<i>Fred Haise was going back
fo the moon on Apollo 1 8. . .</i>

1822
02:12:48,427 --> 02:12:50,770
<i>but his mission was cancelled
due to budget cuts.</i>

1823
02:12:50,862 --> 02:12:52,864
<i>He never flew in space again.</i>

1824
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:55,974
<i>Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the Astronaut Corps...</i>

1825
02:12:56,068 --> 02:12:59,139
<i>and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.</i>

1826
02:12:59,304 --> 02:13:02,216
<i>But he died of cancer
before he was able to take office.</i>

1827
02:13:03,675 --> 02:13:07,554
<i>Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16 . . .</i>

1828
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:11,457
<i>and flew the Space Shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.</i>

1829
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:16,565
<i>Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.</i>

1830
02:13:16,855 --> 02:13:20,029
<i>Many members of Mission Control
have gone on to other things...</i>

1831
02:13:20,125 --> 02:13:22,195
<i>but some are still there.</i>

1832
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:24,507
<i>And as for me...</i>

1833
02:13:24,863 --> 02:13:29,004
<i>the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13
were my last in space.</i>

1834
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:34,006
<i>l watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely...</i>

1835
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:38,716
<i>all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.</i>

1836
02:13:39,845 --> 02:13:42,552
<i>l sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon...</i>

1837
02:13:42,647 --> 02:13:46,094
<i>remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage...</i>

1838
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:50,424
<i>thinking of the thousands of people
who worked to bring the three of us home.</i>

1839
02:13:51,623 --> 02:13:54,228
<i>l look up at the moon and wonder...</i>

1840
02:13:54,893 --> 02:13:56,599
<i>when will we be going back...</i>

1841
02:13:57,462 --> 02:13:58,565
<i>and who will that be?</i>
