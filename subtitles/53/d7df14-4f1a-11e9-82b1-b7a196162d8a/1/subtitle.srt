1
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:52,897
Guess what I hear...

2
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,061
most in my life?

3
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,530
Are you blind?

4
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,565
A blind man shouldn't go out!

5
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:00,562
Bingo! That's it

6
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:02,330
Just want to tell him...

7
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:03,940
I can

8
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:05,407
But I did not say it

9
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,075
Because I am mute, too

10
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:10,340
Good morning, Onion!

11
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:11,973
Living here so long,

12
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,549
I know everyone

13
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:15,850
like this who smells alcohol

14
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,045
He's Mr. Wong of the Security

15
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:18,747
Good morning, Onion!

16
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,788
A well-known stupid drunk

17
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,090
Hi, Onion!

18
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:26,693
You can tell I'm chow? So quick!

19
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:27,592
I smell...

20
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,626
your perfume from far away

21
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,638
They even give me a place to live

22
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:39,573
Why? I work here doing what?

23
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,444
Recording doctor's verbal diagnosis

24
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:43,975
Thanks...

25
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,742
the Equal Opportunity Law in HK

26
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,409
The salary is okay

27
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,685
There are many medical experiments here

28
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:52,716
I'm in...

29
00:01:52,857 --> 00:01:54,984
one blind-cure project

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,120
Though we often fail

31
00:01:58,663 --> 00:01:59,425
Dr. Woo and

32
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,565
Autumn treat me nice

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,790
Especially Autumn

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,635
I'm not born blind

35
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:08,934
At eight,

36
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:10,665
I moved from Taiwan to Hong Kong

37
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:14,437
I was the best in school,

38
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:15,744
A genius

39
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,609
Then problem came

40
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,047
My eyes were always watery

41
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:21,512
Everything I saw was tinted

42
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:25,880
One day, I went swimming with girls

43
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,725
Show time. I did the fancy dive

44
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,255
From way up

45
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:33,762
While diving in, my eyes hurt

46
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:35,126
and bred

47
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,997
Too late

48
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,437
The retina already fell off

49
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:44,138
I knew I was blind

50
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:47,374
That night, I had brain fever

51
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,170
and lost my speaking ability

52
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:54,509
My families left one after another...

53
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:56,817
The noisy is...

54
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,353
my buddy Jumboball

55
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,650
What the hell? You walk like ghost!

56
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:04,920
Salty Lemon Seven, your favorite!

57
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:14,204
So much salt again! Sucker!

58
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:18,999
Can't you share?

59
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,338
Gobbling

60
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:24,778
Alright, your turn

61
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,577
Stop flopping around, here you go

62
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:27,977
What's the matter?

63
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,013
It has problem breathing?

64
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:35,315
You have problem

65
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:36,586
Tell me!

66
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,219
I know you can hear bird's talk

67
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:42,665
Constipation?

68
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,996
With such appetite? No way!

69
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:46,026
What are you getting?

70
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,801
What are you doing?

71
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:53,967
Don't pass it to my bird

72
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,012
Leave it alone. Bug me

73
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:58,479
Come here... homework time

74
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:00,944
A couple of good ones

75
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:10,522
I dreamt of my ungrateful daughter again

76
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:15,831
Salivating. Dead. Still on drug

77
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:18,567
You are better

78
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:23,768
What?

79
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,540
Queuing for a massage

80
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,234
You've got nothing to do?

81
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:29,771
You pay me, or I pay you?

82
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:36,642
Onion!

83
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,616
And that's the news for today...

84
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:43,894
In...

85
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,655
our next program...

86
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:47,453
When I was little,

87
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,395
I wanted to phone-in the radio

88
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,192
Because ever since I was blind

89
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,167
Radio's my connection to the world

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,302
Hello

91
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,307
Hello, please talk

92
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,276
- Miss Autumn
- Thank you, fisherman

93
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:02,906
- Doc, your coffee
- Thanks

94
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,740
Is Onion throwing up badly?

95
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:05,778
Badly!

96
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,746
He's tough, more than others

97
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:12,419
Like last time, he didn't ask for help

98
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,751
And often jokes over it

99
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:18,691
I've notice. Usually you don't talk much

100
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,623
Except when you talk...

101
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:21,787
about the patients

102
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,795
Do you like music,

103
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,701
or jazz?

104
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,238
It's okay

105
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,004
Do you think...

106
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,169
listening to classical music or...

107
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:38,874
...playing sax is pretentious?

108
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:42,186
Not really. Sax's pretty good

109
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,316
As long as it's pleasant

110
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:44,945
Well, I know how to play it

111
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,557
Back in school, every time I played it,

112
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:51,589
My friends said I was pretentious

113
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,428
When foreigners' playing,

114
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:56,032
they said it's cool!

115
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,133
So, I often practice...

116
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,465
in the toilet

117
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:04,798
Even now, my sax comes with a taste

118
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:08,807
I think I've got too far

119
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,415
I have two concert tickets for tonight

120
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:14,684
Do you want to go?

121
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,883
No, the exam. I don't want to flunk it

122
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,188
That's true

123
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,850
Never mind, next time then

124
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:26,322
After all, failure is the mom of success

125
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,165
Sorry, I'm sorry, Onion...

126
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,375
So sorry, I'm late again

127
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,808
Have you been waiting long?

128
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,538
Sorry

129
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:47,312
It is the thirtieth time

130
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,543
she cuts my hair

131
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,484
I'm not too greedy

132
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,858
Just wish it happen...

133
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:57,790
863 times in my life

134
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:59,929
What are you thinking? Fallen asleep?

135
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:02,858
Did you have the apples I bought you?

136
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:12,305
You remember my birthday!

137
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,401
I just told you once

138
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:15,910
Thank you!

139
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,574
Someone said

140
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:22,981
I'm clumsy today

141
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:24,447
No? Really?

142
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:25,686
If people has...

143
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:27,222
one disadvantage

144
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:29,326
God shall give him one advantage

145
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,052
If you get a lousy body,

146
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,525
you'll get a good brain

147
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,962
If you are not pretty,

148
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:35,258
you'll get a nice voice

149
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,391
Why I have nothing,

150
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,492
and get fat?

151
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:41,872
It's all your fault!

152
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:45,333
Give ma all! Yummy!

153
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:48,403
What advantage do you have?

154
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,512
Two?

155
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:01,224
Right, you have more

156
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,587
You can't see...

157
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,418
how ugly I am

158
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:06,995
And you won't...

159
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,257
tell my secrets

160
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,134
So...

161
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:13,998
I feel very safe with you

162
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:18,208
You are the only one I can talk to

163
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:23,078
If you don't want to listen,

164
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,203
tell me

165
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:27,543
You really don't?

166
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,820
Don't like it?

167
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,784
Don't rub your nose!

168
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,822
I'm just kidding

169
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:44,727
Did you hear?

170
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,004
I heard it again last night

171
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:48,064
Don't know why

172
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:49,695
Every time I hear it

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,071
I feel relax

174
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,211
Dr. Woo said he could play it

175
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,447
But it's not him, I'm sure

176
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:59,575
He can't play that well

177
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:05,620
Sometimes I want to find out

178
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,547
But don't want to be nosy

179
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,519
If he stops playing, it'll be hell

180
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:12,794
Is it you?

181
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:15,729
It must be you!

182
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:25,308
I don't play... sax

183
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:30,608
Then who could it be?

184
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:34,479
It's a call...

185
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:35,949
from far away

186
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,288
Who talks about his love distress

187
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,823
I feel great for him now

188
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,320
Wish he could stay...

189
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,451
with his beloved one...

190
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,223
Forever and ever

191
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,191
If you want...

192
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,764
to share your problem with us

193
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,197
Give me a call

194
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,701
Let's chat in the air

195
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,868
Hoping that you can be relieved...

196
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:58,975
From any distress and problem

197
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,570
I can play sax since small

198
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,841
My father plays in the Taiwan Orchestra

199
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,680
I played sax with him together

200
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:17,086
I had performance in blind school too

201
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:20,016
Ever since Autumn says she likes sax,

202
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:22,925
I often play for her at night

203
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,559
Don't want her to know it's me

204
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,658
Even Dr. Woo can't attract her

205
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,730
Not to...

206
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,529
mention me

207
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,767
Better not screw up her dream

208
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,204
Or she might stop...

209
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:39,809
cutting my hair

210
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:49,746
Good morning, Onion!

211
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,912
Got to go, I'm late. Bye!

212
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:07,367
Is it good?

213
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,932
You are the first one to say that

214
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,476
Weird! Why they don't like it?

215
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,607
I know, you are always on my side

216
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,074
Did you hear it?

217
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:21,609
The sax

218
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:24,615
I just said I felt bad yesterday,

219
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,188
and it comes

220
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,789
It happens every time!

221
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:33,893
Meteor!

222
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,664
Did you see it? A meteor!

223
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:41,798
I forgot

224
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,871
How could you see it

225
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:45,207
But I've made two wishes

226
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:46,641
Is it too greedy?

227
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,037
Tell you?

228
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,311
Okay, it's about you anyway

229
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,312
The first one: Your eyes recover soon

230
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,721
And watch the meteor shower with us

231
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,790
What do you think?

232
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,957
The second one?

233
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,456
Okay, I'll tell you

234
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,034
The second one is...

235
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,298
I won't tell you

236
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,298
No pouting!

237
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:19,501
No rubbing nose!

238
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:22,238
Do you know how it's like?

239
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:26,706
No. I'll tell you

240
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:30,644
It's like fireworks in the sky

241
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:36,993
Did I see it?

242
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,019
No

243
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,298
I'm lying?

244
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:48,370
If you see a meteor gliding across

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,998
What wishes would you make?

246
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:53,968
You have two also?

247
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:02,649
I know,

248
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:05,380
all the blind people recover

249
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,456
How great!

250
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:09,159
And the second one?

251
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:15,891
Come on, say it

252
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,902
Come on. It tickles

253
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:22,233
What's the second one?

254
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,141
Wait!

255
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,039
I've got paged. Wait for me

256
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:41,081
Move, move... right...

257
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,896
Turn right, right...

258
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:49,522
Straight down, get move

259
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,668
No, no, back up, back up...

260
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,331
Move on, I'm late!

261
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:56,471
Oh, my god! It'll hit!

262
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,770
Straight down

263
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:01,438
Getting off ahead, thank you

264
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:05,338
Thanks, Onion

265
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:18,523
"Wait for me"

266
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,210
You look great, Onion

267
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,781
Got to go. Bye

268
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,695
What's up? You look happy

269
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:17,048
Oh, shit!

270
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:19,748
Call the cop!

271
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:43,042
I can see. Where is it?

272
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:47,209
Mr. Young, please queue here

273
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:58,118
This way

274
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,257
What? It's my friend. Bothers you?

275
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,608
Jackpot? You are the sixty billion human

276
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,118
travelling from the Earth...

277
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,653
to the Polaris

278
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,114
Jackpot? Am I dreaming?

279
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:29,859
You are not

280
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:33,754
This is the station to the Polaris

281
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,033
He knows what I'm thinking? Weird dream!

282
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,361
It's not a dream

283
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:40,697
You can see me, right?

284
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,636
You can speak. Speak

285
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:48,406
Really!

286
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:51,813
You don't remember?

287
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:54,951
You were dead. An accident

288
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,947
When one die, he leaves Planet Earth

289
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,048
to the Polaris

290
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:06,425
to continue his journey of life

291
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,526
One in a ten billion will...

292
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,055
hit the jackpot and get a wish

293
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,199
What's yours?

294
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,661
Go back. I don't want to die now!

295
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:17,838
I knew it

296
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:21,442
All five of the ten-billion did

297
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,879
But I can't make you alive

298
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:28,945
You can go back. You have five days

299
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:30,853
Better than none

300
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:32,380
Listen up

301
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:36,624
In five days, you are like you

302
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,785
But people won't...

303
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,430
know you

304
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,199
Because you borrow...

305
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,300
other's body

306
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,662
They won't recognize you

307
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:48,336
One more rule

308
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,131
You can't...

309
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:52,206
tell anyone

310
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,503
Nothing about your past identity

311
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:57,970
Even if you want to...

312
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,345
You can't

313
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,251
Can I...

314
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,781
see and speak?

315
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,056
Yes. Sure you want this?

316
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:11,517
The five before you

317
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,691
came back regretting

318
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:15,991
No, I won't

319
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,334
Just let me see her

320
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,136
I can't

321
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,737
just remember her voice and smell

322
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:24,768
I can see her every looks and movements

323
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,902
Then, no matter how,

324
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,444
I'll be fine

325
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:31,080
With her,

326
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,345
I know what is real happiness

327
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,649
When could I go?

328
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:36,983
Anytime

329
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:38,510
Thank you

330
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,485
Thank you, for talking to me

331
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:44,460
Even angels get bored here

332
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:56,296
Are you nut?

333
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,191
Told you not to talk...

334
00:20:58,368 --> 00:20:58,834
to strangers

335
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,663
Wait till someone abduct you

336
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:11,645
Are you alright?

337
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:12,977
I'm fine

338
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,913
People won't...

339
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,450
recognize you

340
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,311
Are you sure?

341
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:20,389
Yeah, I'm fine

342
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,819
Wong, you've been drinking again

343
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,922
Smells all alcohol

344
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:27,225
Is Ophthalmology Section on 1st floor?

345
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:46,905
Miss Chow?

346
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,350
You smell good. You must be Chow!

347
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,019
Who are you? Can I help you?

348
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:54,854
Where is...

349
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:57,225
Miss Autumn?

350
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,356
Down at the bus stop

351
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,021
She's going to her friend's funeral

352
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:04,625
Who?

353
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:05,733
What?

354
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:07,429
I mean...

355
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,369
I lived around. Maybe I know him

356
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,208
His name is Onion

357
00:22:13,743 --> 00:22:15,643
Onion? My...

358
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:17,905
What date is it?

359
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:19,372
14th November

360
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,742
I've been away for ten days!

361
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:23,716
Are you alright?

362
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:25,082
I'm fine, thanks

363
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,014
Miss Chow...

364
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,054
What now?

365
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:29,121
I just want to say...

366
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,584
You look good in uniform

367
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:33,494
I know

368
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,530
- Is it to the grave-yard?
- Yes

369
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,712
Thank you, Miss Lam

370
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,214
Miss Chow

371
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,613
Joe!

372
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,687
Joe Chan, Miss Chan!

373
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:15,703
Wait, Autumn's not in yet

374
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,737
She went early. Don't you know?

375
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,200
This must be her. She's beautiful!

376
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:56,107
Gone

377
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,338
This belongs to Dr. Woo

378
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,579
What?! Excuse me!

379
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:03,916
What's up?

380
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:08,750
You're so upset. Are you close to him?

381
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:12,257
It's your foot. Ouch!

382
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,598
Not a word?

383
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:18,899
Sorry, I am sorry

384
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:22,702
It's alright. What's your name?

385
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,472
My name? Whatever

386
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:27,371
Whatever, are you a close friend?

387
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:28,970
He and me...

388
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,712
That's Onion?

389
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,147
You don't know him?

390
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:42,883
I do! Haven't see him for a long time

391
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:47,360
Do you have a mirror?

392
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,827
Yes, hang on

393
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,299
Do we look alike?

394
00:24:58,608 --> 00:24:59,734
No

395
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:01,976
Is he better looking?

396
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:03,340
You are

397
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:09,615
Wow, good looking

398
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,748
Nobody ever said that to me. Thanks

399
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,454
You're welcome

400
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:40,505
Jumboball, I miss you!

401
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,515
What the hell? You walk like ghost!

402
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:45,815
Do I know you?!

403
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:48,784
You don't, but I do

404
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,486
I'm Onion's friend

405
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,362
Onion?

406
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:56,530
His friends are...

407
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,997
my friends

408
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,433
Why I never met you?

409
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:02,835
I'm his old friend,

410
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,162
from Taiwan

411
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:06,233
Taiwan?

412
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:07,541
Classmate?

413
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,411
Why didn't you attend his funeral?

414
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:15,415
Forget it

415
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,215
I can't help crying. Better not go

416
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,787
Fine. What else do you want?

417
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:25,751
Just to stay a little longer

418
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:27,426
Shut the door

419
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:28,788
when you go

420
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:36,197
Thanks

421
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:18,067
Insurance broker, Cheuk

422
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:35,815
May I have Mr. Cheuk?

423
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,860
He's out. I'm Siu

424
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:40,086
May I help you?

425
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:42,724
If I buy insurance...

426
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:43,999
And die,

427
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,662
will you indemnify the beneficiary?

428
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,598
Of course

429
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:49,534
How much is the indemnity?

430
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:51,606
Depends on how much you buy

431
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:52,730
Do you want to buy?

432
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:55,569
I have time. We can sit down...

433
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:56,440
Have a cup of tea, and talk

434
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:59,844
I just want the indemnity

435
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:02,747
Because I... My friend...

436
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,551
Who bought insurance...

437
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:06,246
from you died

438
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,751
Died? Mr. Cheuk's on leave

439
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:10,859
Call again some other days

440
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:11,858
Bye

441
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:18,624
You said you had time. Can we...?

442
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,428
Some other days...

443
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:24,566
I don't have much other days

444
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,536
Onion!

445
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:32,434
Are you here?

446
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,675
From now on, I'll take care of you

447
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:28,894
My name's Cheuk. My name card

448
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,422
Actually, I'm Onion

449
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,533
My name's Cheuk. My name card

450
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:41,106
My name's Cheuk. My name card...

451
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,510
You!

452
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,047
Who are you?

453
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:52,420
My name's Cheuk. My name card

454
00:31:58,294 --> 00:31:59,226
Sir?

455
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:00,423
Salty Lemon Seven, thanks

456
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,124
Salty Lemon Seven, boss

457
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:07,500
I'll add the salt myself

458
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:32,556
Mr. Cheuk

459
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:34,962
Not many people come for me

460
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:36,291
Most we know

461
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,733
That is nurses' dormitory

462
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:40,602
Water, Miss Autumn

463
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,896
- Thanks
- What do you have?

464
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:45,672
So much I wanted to tell her

465
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,403
Looking at her now,

466
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:49,477
I can't say a word

467
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,575
Mr. Cheuk

468
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,546
How can I help you?

469
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:58,183
Yes

470
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:02,280
Your friend Young, Onion...

471
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:04,124
...bought an insurance from us

472
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,023
And Autumn Yue is the beneficiary

473
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:07,762
Are you Autumn Yue?

474
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:10,890
Strange friend, huh?

475
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,964
Funny nickname...

476
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:16,238
You think it's funny?

477
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:20,665
Just a few questions for the indemnity

478
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,074
Your career is...

479
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:24,545
Nurse trainee

480
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,411
How long do you know each other?

481
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,609
One year and 26 days

482
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,279
Wow, you even remember the 26 days

483
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:34,985
What's your relationship?

484
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,189
I mean,

485
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:38,685
friendship?

486
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:41,922
Common, intimate, lovers?

487
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,198
Why should I tell you?

488
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:47,127
Because that's very important

489
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,797
If you are intimate

490
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:50,998
or lovers

491
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:52,374
He might kill himself

492
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:53,675
to leave you the best

493
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,067
He won't kill himself!

494
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:57,306
He won't!

495
00:33:58,047 --> 00:33:59,378
He's tough,

496
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,176
full of life and hope!

497
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,884
Go on, go on

498
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:10,253
What's your relationship with Dr. Woo?

499
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:11,615
Whom do you like more?

500
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,728
Are you really Insurance Actuary?

501
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,926
Does it matter which one like?

502
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:21,191
Because... because probably...

503
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,429
You two killed Onion...

504
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:26,098
My God! What did I say?

505
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,839
Am I a jealous nut?

506
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:30,479
Mr. Cheuk,

507
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:32,713
you are the worst man I know

508
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:34,679
The lowest, the most caddish pest!

509
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:37,312
Autumn!

510
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,680
I...

511
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:43,182
Fisherman, the towel!

512
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,728
Do you have epilepsy?

513
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,204
You better have a check-up

514
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,816
God!

515
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,817
You can't tell your real identity

516
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:15,656
Even if you want to, you can't

517
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:18,751
I felt...

518
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:20,088
like you're here

519
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,199
So I could really yell at him

520
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,376
Sorry about what happened

521
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:40,679
Don't know how to explain

522
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:45,050
I am Onion, and Cheuk

523
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:48,049
It's sounds ridiculous,

524
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:49,413
but it's true

525
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,150
We don't disappear when we die

526
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,853
We live in another place

527
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:55,962
Remember...

528
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:58,225
you cut my hair 13 times?

529
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,703
Even cut my ear once

530
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:03,802
You asked me if it hurt

531
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,772
To be safe,

532
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,906
I'll record again

533
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,245
I am Onion, and Cheuk

534
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:16,348
Believe me

535
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,919
I know it's ridiculous

536
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,979
Remember the night before I died...

537
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,226
You saw meteor and

538
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:27,192
made wishes...

539
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,129
For me? Thanks

540
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:35,870
I am off at ten. Let's have dinner

541
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:37,900
I can't...

542
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:39,866
How about midnight snacks?

543
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,373
No trouble?

544
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,442
No

545
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,375
Really, I'm fine now

546
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,107
Could you have the flowers back?

547
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,642
Cheapskate!

548
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:50,376
How could you take it back?

549
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,213
You gave it to me!

550
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:52,886
Did I say that?

551
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:01,289
See!

552
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:04,356
You want it? Take it!

553
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,179
Sorry

554
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:30,316
I know it's for Autumn

555
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:33,188
In graveyard, your look's obvious

556
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,324
She has a day off, though

557
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:40,157
It's broken. I think she won't mind

558
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,336
Take it

559
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:50,339
Pity me?

560
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,071
For you, really

561
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,782
I get it, thanks

562
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,954
I feel great. Hope you are the same

563
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,181
You will see her

564
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,424
She's in her sister's. The address...

565
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,754
I know, she told me before

566
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,524
Thanks

567
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:17,971
You alright?

568
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:21,099
Why learn swimming suddenly?

569
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:22,305
You used to yell

570
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,674
when I washed you hair...

571
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:26,612
...and pushed your head down

572
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,145
Scared of water and

573
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:31,719
never dare do anything

574
00:38:32,488 --> 00:38:33,887
Till it's too late

575
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:36,015
The more I scare,

576
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:37,816
the better I'll try now

577
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:41,696
Let me get a notebook

578
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,393
So deep,

579
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,034
got to jot it down

580
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:47,628
You're teasing me!

581
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:50,303
- Come on, take it
- Thanks, sis

582
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:52,135
You like someone

583
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,435
but dare not say it

584
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,811
And it's too late. Am I right?

585
00:38:58,981 --> 00:38:59,913
Think I won't splash you

586
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:00,913
cause you're pregnant?

587
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,945
Don't you need help?

588
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:07,884
Here we are

589
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:11,918
No parking ahead. Can't go in

590
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:14,891
Three hundreds!

591
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:18,227
How far ahead?

592
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:22,826
Not far. Take this way

593
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:32,878
What's up?

594
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,678
Can I ask you...

595
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,187
What happen to my little sister who...

596
00:39:42,324 --> 00:39:44,315
...used to be so strong?

597
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:48,555
Thanks for the compliments. I'm fine

598
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,162
Okay

599
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:56,004
Strong. Is it a compliment?

600
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,906
I thought it meant bad tempered

601
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:05,577
Come when you want to talk

602
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:13,111
Let me... stay still, Your Majesty

603
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:15,117
Just treat me as Queen later

604
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:17,917
Dr. Woo?

605
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,391
Good guess! You are here

606
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:22,561
I am just dropping by

607
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:23,995
and see if you're here

608
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,623
And you are

609
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,027
Drop by?

610
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:30,298
It takes at least two-hour to come here

611
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:31,804
Where were you?

612
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:36,106
Here, it's near... the airport!

613
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:38,637
I went to see somebody off...

614
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,510
So I drop by

615
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,345
Hungry?

616
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,850
You bought so much food to the airport?

617
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:49,090
Well, it's cheap there. So...

618
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,221
Never mind

619
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:52,816
My sister

620
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,927
Actually I come for you

621
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,267
I worry if you are alright,

622
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:00,402
so...

623
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,597
I bought all these nutriment...

624
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,331
for you

625
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:07,669
I'll go after I leave them here

626
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:11,141
You're so nice. Come on in

627
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,338
You're like...

628
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:14,176
door-keeping gods

629
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,112
This is Dr. Woo

630
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,342
- How are you?
- Fine, how are you?

631
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:17,474
How are you, baby?

632
00:41:18,454 --> 00:41:20,854
Doing butterfly stroke every day

633
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,924
Bang, bang, bang. Drive you nut

634
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:24,055
You are really nice

635
00:41:24,426 --> 00:41:26,326
We live so far away and you still come

636
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:27,525
Just drop by

637
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:29,790
Stay for dinner, then

638
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:30,897
Sure

639
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,194
My sis needs to talk to someone

640
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:38,297
Let me help. It's heavy

641
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:41,433
Are you sure?

642
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,276
Isn't it a bit impulsive?

643
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:50,144
You should have...

644
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:52,549
known before

645
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:54,644
Years ago

646
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,189
when my first patient died,

647
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:57,815
I thought the same way

648
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:00,456
Then I told myself:

649
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,093
Many things are out of my control

650
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,556
If you give up

651
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,362
Then you shouldn't ever start

652
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,270
Sis

653
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:16,637
Are you hot, or just doing facial?

654
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,172
Just getting to the point

655
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,182
She's quite funny

656
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:26,214
Yes. She's more simple

657
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:27,851
How about you?

658
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,017
I know what you mean

659
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:36,658
The seniors say

660
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:37,890
when you see patients die,

661
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,126
Go see the new-born and

662
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:41,735
you'll feel better

663
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,798
But he's not just any patients

664
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:49,409
He's Onion

665
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:53,045
You won't understand

666
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:55,273
I didn't believe it before

667
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:57,316
Until it happens...

668
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,818
to you

669
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:02,251
I can't go on

670
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,687
Let it out, you'll feel better

671
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:12,759
Don't worry

672
00:43:13,435 --> 00:43:14,663
I won't just go

673
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:16,299
I'll stay till the end of this month

674
00:43:17,372 --> 00:43:19,237
Help the new comer...

675
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:20,507
get used to things

676
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,578
I need time

677
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:27,074
Give me time

678
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:29,379
I can change your mind

679
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:32,016
Thank you

680
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,211
I feel much better now

681
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:38,648
Coming, coming

682
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,023
Who do you want?

683
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:46,501
My sister?

684
00:43:56,478 --> 00:43:57,843
What a crowd today

685
00:43:58,313 --> 00:43:59,905
So...

686
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:01,481
many people coming

687
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:04,241
Are you dropping by too?

688
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:06,887
No, I come for her

689
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:08,917
I have to talk to you

690
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:10,122
Really?

691
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:11,422
I called you

692
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,822
They said you were on leave

693
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:14,584
Sorry about last time

694
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:16,294
I want my indemnity

695
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,000
I won't reject anything from Onion

696
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:20,694
Fine, but...

697
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,099
You are insurance broker?

698
00:44:24,106 --> 00:44:24,902
My last name's Cheuk

699
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:26,471
Mr. Cheuk

700
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:29,635
It's getting more and more complex

701
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:32,442
You come so far to indemnify. Very nice

702
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:33,870
Stay for dinner

703
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:36,441
Sure, sure

704
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:44,220
What is that?

705
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,694
Watch it. You'll know

706
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:48,919
I'll watch it later

707
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:55,733
Mr. Cheuk

708
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:00,266
Mr. Cheuk, he's calling you

709
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:01,839
Mr. Cheuk

710
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:04,072
You are hard-working

711
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,779
Still working while on leave

712
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:10,110
I want to settle this quick for Onion

713
00:45:11,553 --> 00:45:13,544
Dr. Woo, you work hard too

714
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:15,121
Aren't you on leave?

715
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,152
Mr. Cheuk, I think we never met

716
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:22,929
How do you know my name?

717
00:45:25,234 --> 00:45:26,292
We never met...

718
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,126
Doing insurance

719
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:29,497
you had to know everything

720
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,265
Onion died too suddenly

721
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:32,930
We had to check people out

722
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:39,712
Occupational disease. Blind guess

723
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:44,318
Mr. Cheuk, you look not well

724
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,319
Your lips are dark

725
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:50,158
You better have a check

726
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:52,426
It's professional. Not blind guess

727
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,865
I queued and

728
00:46:01,003 --> 00:46:02,334
bought a cheese cake

729
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:04,600
For dessert

730
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,134
Try it. You'll feel better

731
00:46:07,876 --> 00:46:10,845
Autumn hates cheese

732
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:13,137
She only likes fruit candies

733
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,007
The octagon ones in colorful cans

734
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,177
I can't believe it

735
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:22,986
You know even that others like to eat?

736
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:27,323
I don't eat cheese

737
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,300
Why do you know?

738
00:46:33,435 --> 00:46:34,629
Are you checking on me?

739
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,398
You think I killed him?

740
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,663
No... How could I?

741
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:39,364
I don't mean it

742
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:42,175
In fact, I am...

743
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:44,637
Here it comes again

744
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,644
What's the matter with you?

745
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:47,013
How's it going?

746
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,643
Sis, do you have slippers?

747
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,349
For men or women?

748
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:54,750
Better check out...

749
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,448
the nearest hospital

750
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:57,683
Just in case...

751
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:00,493
Autumn?

752
00:47:01,663 --> 00:47:04,689
Back in her room. She's pissed off

753
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:07,060
I didn't mean it

754
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:09,266
I didn't check on her. Please tell her

755
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:10,663
Okay, okay...

756
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:12,734
You threw...

757
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:13,568
everything up

758
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:15,033
Have some cheese cake

759
00:47:15,177 --> 00:47:16,075
Sis

760
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:19,076
The doctors often suggest...

761
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,010
...not to eat too rich after vomiting

762
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:23,917
No cheese cake. You have something flat?

763
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:26,486
Apple

764
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:28,588
Have it

765
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:30,749
Can we talk,

766
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:31,688
Dr. Woo?

767
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:33,690
Sure

768
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:41,800
Can we donate Onion's money...

769
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:43,461
to the hospital...

770
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:45,497
...for ophthalmology studies?

771
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,698
He wished to help

772
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,942
Sure. I can suggest to the hospital...

773
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:53,377
...to launch a fund...

774
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:54,574
for the blind people

775
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,584
I thought you really were busy,

776
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:08,059
have no time to go to concerts

777
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,425
Now I know

778
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,567
I am quite jealous of him

779
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:16,628
Sorry,

780
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:19,206
it seems not respectful

781
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:21,933
I think...

782
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:23,908
he doesn't want to see you like that

783
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:33,020
Could we go to concert tomorrow night?

784
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:36,922
Can we talk tomorrow?

785
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:38,453
Hope to see you tomorrow

786
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,293
It's getting cold. Let's go in

787
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:51,634
It's late. Please go

788
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,673
Give Mr. Cheuk a ride, would you?

789
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:54,972
Where's Mr. Cheuk?

790
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,326
I don't know what you want

791
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:17,465
I won't...

792
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,657
let you hurt Autumn

793
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:26,905
I don't have time. Stop the car

794
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,110
You want to vomit?

795
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:39,584
Thanks for having taken care of Onion

796
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:40,820
Bye

797
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:45,123
Where are you going?

798
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:48,358
I won't let you go back and bug Autumn!

799
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,067
Would you please get in?

800
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,272
I won't leave

801
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,068
I didn't ask you to leave

802
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:04,877
I won't let you bother Autumn

803
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:06,275
Let me go back with you

804
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:07,642
Okay?

805
00:50:14,756 --> 00:50:15,688
Mr. Cheuk,

806
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:18,354
personally I don't like you

807
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:21,229
But...

808
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,693
you are a patient to me

809
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:25,526
You might get pneumonia,

810
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,667
triggering epilepsy

811
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:32,503
Get in, would you?

812
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,172
Thank you

813
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,615
I must keep an eye on you

814
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,315
You broke my car

815
00:50:47,656 --> 00:50:48,884
I have to take you to the police

816
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:54,291
You like her

817
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:55,661
You do too

818
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:58,065
Right

819
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:01,865
She told me she cared about me

820
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:08,373
You've been in our hospital?

821
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:11,275
Did she take care of you?

822
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:14,610
But the way I see it...

823
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,652
I think you've got it all wrong

824
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:23,923
What do you mean?

825
00:51:24,993 --> 00:51:28,690
Nurses always cares about patients

826
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:30,262
Especially someone like Autumn

827
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,131
But it's different from...

828
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,394
what you think

829
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,804
I am not saying this because I want her

830
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,264
I hope you get it

831
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:15,966
Didn't she read the letter?

832
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:18,373
Will she believe it?

833
00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:22,246
Maybe she never ever like me

834
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:23,783
She just pities me

835
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,988
I am just a common patient to her

836
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:33,160
I know you want me to regret, right?

837
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:36,823
How could angels be so unkind?

838
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:03,621
Good morning

839
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,290
- Good morning
- Staying late?

840
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:08,859
No, I have a date with you

841
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,998
Not sure if I can get up. So I stay

842
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,767
Where is he?

843
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:13,559
Who?

844
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,566
Mr. Cheuk! My car's locked

845
00:53:16,037 --> 00:53:16,833
He didn't leave?

846
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:19,667
Never mind. I'll make some coffee

847
00:53:21,176 --> 00:53:22,643
- Take a seat
- Okay

848
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:24,404
Could you give me a ride later?

849
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:25,404
Where to?

850
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:28,411
Anywhere, take a break, go to concert

851
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:30,875
Sure

852
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,333
Did you read it?

853
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:50,036
You wait a whole night here for that?

854
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:52,437
I read it

855
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:55,274
Good! You finally got it?

856
00:53:56,478 --> 00:53:57,945
I am sorry... Mr. Angel

857
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,307
I was irrational

858
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:00,505
You didn't hear a thing

859
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:01,580
Are you alright?

860
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:04,877
Did you really read it?

861
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:06,476
Didn't miss anything?

862
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:08,780
I don't know what's in your apology card

863
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:12,152
And this tape's blank

864
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:14,684
But I accept your apology

865
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:16,758
Please proceed with my indemnity

866
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:18,191
and stay away from me afterward

867
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:26,831
If Mr. Cheuk ever comes...

868
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:27,942
to the hospital again

869
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:28,701
Do pay us a visit

870
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:29,571
We are in charge of ophthalmology

871
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:32,344
I know, I specialize in the blind

872
00:54:33,348 --> 00:54:36,408
I'm always there. So I understand them

873
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:39,910
Sometimes I even touch their books

874
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:42,212
like onion's point diary

875
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,816
I know a lot from that

876
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,984
Diary?

877
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,785
I didn't know she'd react that way

878
00:54:49,297 --> 00:54:51,060
Even ask me out tonight

879
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,767
She wants...

880
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:55,336
to see Onion's diary

881
00:54:56,304 --> 00:54:57,828
But when did I write diary?

882
00:55:05,446 --> 00:55:08,313
Sorry, I really can't...

883
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,048
It's okay. The show is boring

884
00:55:12,053 --> 00:55:12,883
I'll take you back

885
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:16,416
No, it's fine. Thanks for the ticket

886
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:19,555
You have a date with someone?

887
00:55:22,297 --> 00:55:23,229
Him

888
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:31,030
I can take care of myself

889
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,373
Give me a call if you need me

890
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:39,207
Diary, diary...

891
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:41,076
The whole diary in one day?

892
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,315
What the hell. No time

893
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:01,357
Excuse me. I am late

894
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:02,594
It's alright. I am early

895
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,538
This is...

896
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,306
I think you better not see it

897
00:56:12,146 --> 00:56:15,741
You might feel upset

898
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,652
You know point alphabet?

899
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:22,183
Sure, more than ten years...

900
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:25,185
I specialize in the blind

901
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:28,661
Could you read it for me?

902
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,620
Okay

903
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,233
Where to start?

904
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:35,402
Where you met each other

905
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:40,005
Sunny...

906
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:42,169
Sunny...

907
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:46,373
Sunny...

908
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:47,878
That's it?

909
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:49,283
No, there's more...

910
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:55,655
October 16, 1997, Sunny, Vomit

911
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,957
Dr. Woo said it's medical reaction

912
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:02,254
A new nurse came taking care of me today

913
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,626
Her name is Autumn Yue

914
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:07,901
She is clumsy

915
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:09,467
She kept saying...

916
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:11,538
"Sorry"

917
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:13,897
She made a mess,

918
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,206
but I didn't pick on her

919
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:19,373
I even feel good about her

920
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:23,339
Why am I still talking fine?

921
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:26,645
She doesn't know that I am Onion

922
00:57:27,055 --> 00:57:29,546
I am just someone reading Onion's diary

923
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:30,921
Go on

924
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:35,691
November 2nd, 1997, Rainy night

925
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:38,432
Autumn said she'll come give me...

926
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:40,400
a hair cut after work

927
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:45,367
It's raining so hard. She might not come

928
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:48,507
She is already 49 minutes late

929
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:51,205
Feeling disappointed,

930
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,914
I heard footsteps hurrying up

931
00:57:54,515 --> 00:57:56,745
"Sorry..."

932
00:57:56,884 --> 00:57:58,681
Sorry. I'm late again

933
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:01,381
49-minute is nothing

934
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:04,949
I was thrilled she came

935
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:08,085
Finally, she finished

936
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,392
It looked like an onion

937
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,693
She starts calling me Onion ever since

938
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:22,404
December 7, 1997, Sunday, Good day

939
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:26,313
It's the second time Autumn cut my hair

940
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:30,411
I can smell her

941
00:58:31,686 --> 00:58:33,278
Just when I was enjoying

942
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:35,920
My left ear hurt so much suddenly

943
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:38,185
And I heard she keep saying...

944
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:39,851
I'm sorry

945
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:41,621
Oh, I cut you ear

946
00:58:41,796 --> 00:58:45,129
You're bleeding. Are you okay...

947
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:49,293
I shook my head, saying: Nothing!

948
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:53,364
She's all freaked out, almost crying

949
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:55,667
If only I could talk, I'll say

950
00:58:56,544 --> 00:59:00,002
I am so happy she comes

951
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:02,778
Just a little pain. No big deal

952
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,077
Enough!

953
00:59:04,919 --> 00:59:06,216
Stop it

954
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:12,219
I am sorry. Please burn it

955
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,328
Wait!

956
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:15,821
He pointed all that,

957
00:59:15,997 --> 00:59:17,225
and rub it on the street

958
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:18,962
Don't you want to know more?

959
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:21,025
What happen if I know it all?

960
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:23,693
You won't understand how I feel

961
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:27,570
Only Onion will

962
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:30,673
He's dead. What's the diary for?

963
00:59:32,013 --> 00:59:33,674
To save your memory?

964
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,982
No

965
00:59:57,238 --> 00:59:58,262
I say

966
00:59:59,707 --> 01:00:00,503
Just now...

967
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:02,541
I felt Onion's back

968
01:00:03,611 --> 01:00:05,169
I used to think I just pitied him

969
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:07,511
Then he died

970
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:09,543
And I realize

971
01:00:09,684 --> 01:00:11,083
it is so painful without him

972
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:17,223
I love him all the time

973
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:25,554
Why didn't I tell him?

974
01:00:29,303 --> 01:00:30,463
I wanted him to know

975
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,235
I wished he's the one playing sax

976
01:00:36,644 --> 01:00:39,135
Why didn't I ask?

977
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:45,819
My second wish is to be with him

978
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:50,183
Why didn't I say it?

979
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:54,892
Now I can't

980
01:00:55,863 --> 01:00:57,922
Can it start all over?

981
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:04,302
What's memory for?

982
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:10,503
Just one day...

983
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:13,203
Give me one more day, can I?

984
01:01:15,683 --> 01:01:17,742
Please!

985
01:01:48,015 --> 01:01:49,004
You!

986
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,215
Why did you crash him? Why?

987
01:01:51,352 --> 01:01:52,046
None of my business...

988
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:55,087
He rushed out...

989
01:01:57,091 --> 01:01:58,115
Come on! Hit me!

990
01:01:58,526 --> 01:01:59,652
I have nothing after all!

991
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:02,328
I shouldn't have come back!

992
01:02:05,032 --> 01:02:08,365
I shouldn't have. Let me go!

993
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:10,096
Hit me!

994
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,374
I miss you so much...

995
01:02:19,814 --> 01:02:21,782
You always miss me, huh?

996
01:02:24,685 --> 01:02:25,515
Sit

997
01:02:41,002 --> 01:02:41,832
What do you want to drink?

998
01:02:43,671 --> 01:02:44,569
Anything

999
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,042
Your daughter?

1000
01:02:52,513 --> 01:02:53,411
Salty Lemon Seven

1001
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:58,073
Thank you

1002
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,925
Not so much. You will drop dead

1003
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:14,466
You want to die?

1004
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,601
No, I don't

1005
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:26,313
My neck sores. Give me a message

1006
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,028
When are you leaving?

1007
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:54,608
Taiwan

1008
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:56,401
Two more days

1009
01:03:58,713 --> 01:03:59,941
Are you coming back?

1010
01:04:01,382 --> 01:04:02,474
No

1011
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:06,586
Sit

1012
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,057
You're leaving, why stir things up?

1013
01:04:16,964 --> 01:04:18,090
Can't take anything with you

1014
01:04:18,632 --> 01:04:19,724
I know now

1015
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:22,364
I just want to see her

1016
01:04:23,237 --> 01:04:25,205
If she's happy, I'll be happy

1017
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,567
Now and see

1018
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,704
Don't think too much

1019
01:04:31,245 --> 01:04:34,942
If she knew Onion's leaving again

1020
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:37,510
She's be upset once again

1021
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:41,683
What's that?

1022
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:44,820
You want a florist shop, don't you?

1023
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:47,017
My investment

1024
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:52,127
Can't take it with me. Not in Taiwan

1025
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:56,593
Okay

1026
01:04:58,606 --> 01:04:59,732
I'll sent you some later

1027
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,137
What do you want there?

1028
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:10,606
I'm going

1029
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:15,455
Take care

1030
01:05:18,526 --> 01:05:19,424
Right...

1031
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:26,192
If you see my daughter

1032
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:29,802
Take good care of her

1033
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:32,763
I will

1034
01:05:36,677 --> 01:05:39,703
Don't bug others anymore. Go

1035
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:51,786
Not fair occupying other's thing

1036
01:05:56,597 --> 01:05:59,031
Hello, it's you

1037
01:05:59,166 --> 01:05:59,689
Me

1038
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:02,802
Can't hear you. What's your name?

1039
01:06:03,337 --> 01:06:04,167
Cheuk

1040
01:06:04,505 --> 01:06:08,202
What do you want to talk about?

1041
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:09,531
I wanted...

1042
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,472
to phone-in long time ago

1043
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,972
But I can't

1044
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:15,441
In two days, I had to go

1045
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,440
I've done everything

1046
01:06:17,985 --> 01:06:19,452
So I try this

1047
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:21,578
Nothing special

1048
01:06:21,722 --> 01:06:23,280
You've done everything,

1049
01:06:23,424 --> 01:06:24,413
you feel good?

1050
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,086
Better than a few days ago

1051
01:06:29,263 --> 01:06:30,491
A few days ago?

1052
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:33,155
You felt bad a few days ago, why?

1053
01:06:33,634 --> 01:06:35,295
I saw the reality of the world

1054
01:06:35,436 --> 01:06:36,630
Ugly world,

1055
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:38,670
you mean?

1056
01:06:39,139 --> 01:06:42,438
No, not ugly

1057
01:06:42,877 --> 01:06:45,744
But seeing it through your eyes

1058
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:48,008
The world's different

1059
01:06:48,883 --> 01:06:52,375
Through eyes, you'll have greed

1060
01:06:52,987 --> 01:06:55,683
You want to possess her

1061
01:06:56,423 --> 01:06:57,822
The eyes fool

1062
01:06:58,425 --> 01:07:00,052
Interesting

1063
01:07:00,194 --> 01:07:02,059
Give us more details

1064
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:07,833
Try not to see with eyes

1065
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:10,703
Quietly close your eyes

1066
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:14,239
In this minute of silence

1067
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:18,538
Feel with your purest heart

1068
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:22,148
You may find everything different

1069
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,250
Feel the beauty and

1070
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:27,217
happiness with heart

1071
01:07:27,788 --> 01:07:29,312
You'll have rooms...

1072
01:07:29,456 --> 01:07:31,185
of imagination

1073
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:34,289
You seem to know yourself

1074
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:36,796
Could you hold?

1075
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:38,057
We'll talk more

1076
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:39,563
Now, let's go to music

1077
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,134
Okay, audience

1078
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:42,735
If you have experience...

1079
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:43,837
like Cheuk's

1080
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:46,098
You might want to try

1081
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,901
close your eyes,

1082
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:49,675
it may help

1083
01:08:57,478 --> 01:08:58,376
You scare me!

1084
01:08:58,512 --> 01:08:59,410
Sorry

1085
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:19,125
I shouldn't call you so late

1086
01:10:19,827 --> 01:10:22,022
Never mind. What's the matter?

1087
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:24,959
I know it is not scientific

1088
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:27,657
But I really feel it, he's back

1089
01:10:28,302 --> 01:10:30,532
Slow down. Who's back?

1090
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:32,866
Onion...

1091
01:10:34,308 --> 01:10:36,071
He's back with me

1092
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:38,105
Very close

1093
01:10:38,245 --> 01:10:41,510
I don't believe in paranormal

1094
01:10:41,782 --> 01:10:43,374
I know how your feel

1095
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:46,943
Just imagination. You miss him too much

1096
01:10:47,554 --> 01:10:49,579
It happens...

1097
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:51,213
when a friend died

1098
01:10:54,061 --> 01:10:56,325
Should I come over?

1099
01:10:56,497 --> 01:10:57,486
That's not necessary

1100
01:10:59,099 --> 01:11:00,123
I know what you mean

1101
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:03,362
I know you'd say that

1102
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,571
But it's not imagination

1103
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:09,268
Onion is back

1104
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:11,976
Okay now

1105
01:11:12,412 --> 01:11:13,743
Sorry, I bother you

1106
01:11:14,982 --> 01:11:16,279
Thanks. Good night

1107
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:32,697
Good night

1108
01:11:38,872 --> 01:11:39,736
Good night

1109
01:11:47,247 --> 01:11:49,112
this is the real Cheuk

1110
01:11:49,716 --> 01:11:51,741
The one we met is a crook

1111
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:54,814
I've checked

1112
01:11:54,955 --> 01:11:56,582
He's on vacation, in US

1113
01:11:57,724 --> 01:11:58,656
For your own safety,

1114
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:00,521
don't meet with him

1115
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,060
Let's report to the police, shall we?

1116
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,899
No. He didn't come again

1117
01:12:07,668 --> 01:12:08,726
Are you alright?

1118
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:16,704
Take care of yourself

1119
01:12:24,017 --> 01:12:26,713
This is my final night

1120
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:54,396
Why do you tail her all day?

1121
01:13:54,741 --> 01:13:57,471
Can you make her happy? I can help

1122
01:15:29,936 --> 01:15:31,267
That's not me

1123
01:15:33,073 --> 01:15:34,802
The one who played sax wasn't me

1124
01:15:35,409 --> 01:15:36,967
I don't want to lie to you

1125
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:39,303
You mean Onion played it?

1126
01:15:39,746 --> 01:15:40,872
It's Cheuk

1127
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:02,190
Cheuk!

1128
01:16:04,671 --> 01:16:06,070
Cheuk!

1129
01:16:18,785 --> 01:16:21,515
Cheuk! Cheuk...

1130
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:43,589
Come out! Onion!

1131
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:08,449
Cheuk! Onion, come out quick!

1132
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:11,754
I know you're here!

1133
01:19:17,297 --> 01:19:22,325
You're not coming out, are you?

1134
01:19:55,368 --> 01:19:56,392
Are you okay?

1135
01:19:57,037 --> 01:19:57,867
What's wrong with you?

1136
01:19:58,004 --> 01:20:00,199
You want to kill yourself?

1137
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:01,963
Stupid!

1138
01:20:04,878 --> 01:20:07,438
I should have known you're Onion

1139
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,207
And you're the one who played sax

1140
01:20:35,141 --> 01:20:35,835
Onion!

1141
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:42,944
Freeze, Onion!

1142
01:20:45,251 --> 01:20:46,377
I am not him

1143
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:50,682
Onion's blind and dumb, and dead

1144
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:53,892
Stop imagining things

1145
01:20:54,561 --> 01:20:57,724
There's other for you. Such a fool!

1146
01:20:59,299 --> 01:21:02,029
I am the Cheuk. You know it

1147
01:21:02,502 --> 01:21:03,298
No, you're not

1148
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:07,364
No, I'm not

1149
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:12,011
I am a liar. I'm fooling you

1150
01:21:12,645 --> 01:21:13,634
You satisfy?

1151
01:21:14,514 --> 01:21:15,913
You've disliked me, haven't you?

1152
01:21:16,983 --> 01:21:18,075
Is there something...

1153
01:21:19,185 --> 01:21:21,050
you can't say?

1154
01:21:22,155 --> 01:21:23,452
Is there a special reason?

1155
01:21:25,225 --> 01:21:26,817
Why do you reject me?

1156
01:21:28,995 --> 01:21:30,189
I didn't...

1157
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:33,866
I am not him

1158
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:36,199
Fine

1159
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,059
That night...

1160
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:39,729
you just touched one line of the diary

1161
01:21:39,873 --> 01:21:40,669
and you told me...

1162
01:21:40,807 --> 01:21:42,069
everything about us

1163
01:21:43,176 --> 01:21:44,143
How could you know?

1164
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:46,916
Unless you are Onion

1165
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,682
It's fine you don't admit

1166
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:56,754
You must have a reason

1167
01:21:57,463 --> 01:21:59,556
Just don't leave me alone

1168
01:22:02,435 --> 01:22:05,131
I am so careless

1169
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:06,802
I didn't realize

1170
01:22:06,939 --> 01:22:08,804
until I see all the proofs

1171
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,776
I am so dumb

1172
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,947
Are you going now?

1173
01:22:22,655 --> 01:22:25,920
Yes, I had to

1174
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,516
You'll never see me again

1175
01:22:29,462 --> 01:22:31,930
I am not anyone...

1176
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,858
Forget it, Onion is dead

1177
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,427
He never comes back

1178
01:22:39,505 --> 01:22:41,132
You must take care yourself

1179
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:44,401
Go! Go!

1180
01:22:44,544 --> 01:22:45,442
Okay!

1181
01:22:46,412 --> 01:22:48,471
Excuse me, please wait

1182
01:22:49,115 --> 01:22:51,583
I have one last question

1183
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,987
If you were him,

1184
01:22:57,023 --> 01:22:59,617
Seeing the one he loves so painful

1185
01:23:00,993 --> 01:23:02,358
What do you want her to do?

1186
01:23:08,134 --> 01:23:12,332
Forget me and love someone else

1187
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:16,898
Live happily again

1188
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,740
Let go of the painful memories

1189
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,048
Okay! I'll tell him now

1190
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,182
I've forgot his death

1191
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:27,646
I won't carry the pains with me!

1192
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:30,782
I will love someone again

1193
01:23:32,191 --> 01:23:34,125
And that's you!

1194
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:37,123
But he stays...

1195
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:39,493
in my heart

1196
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,399
It's fine if you don't admit it

1197
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:47,129
I don't care if you're Cheuk

1198
01:23:48,741 --> 01:23:53,337
But I know, I always love...

1199
01:23:53,646 --> 01:23:55,204
Who is the one I always love

1200
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,043
Onion, you listen up

1201
01:24:00,353 --> 01:24:02,412
I love this person in front of me!

1202
01:24:05,758 --> 01:24:07,191
Don't go away

1203
01:24:09,195 --> 01:24:11,356
Don't leave me alone...

1204
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:52,494
This is...

1205
01:24:52,638 --> 01:24:54,071
the meteor shower night

1206
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:56,705
China is the best place to see it

1207
01:24:57,209 --> 01:24:59,336
I'll be here with you tonight

1208
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,608
Onion told me

1209
01:25:02,448 --> 01:25:05,042
Your first wish was that he could watch

1210
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:07,982
the meteor shower with you

1211
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:12,155
It's the same you watch it with me

1212
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:16,525
There's no meteor shower yet

1213
01:25:17,997 --> 01:25:20,761
You're a good person. God will help you

1214
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,332
Then help me keep Onion!

1215
01:25:24,704 --> 01:25:26,672
Stay with me forever, would you?

1216
01:25:29,642 --> 01:25:31,769
That's my second wish

1217
01:25:36,182 --> 01:25:40,016
Onion had a second wish too

1218
01:25:41,987 --> 01:25:45,013
But it's already impossible...

1219
01:25:46,992 --> 01:25:48,391
It's 2:30 in the morning

1220
01:25:48,527 --> 01:25:49,687
Ten minutes to go...

1221
01:25:49,829 --> 01:25:52,093
for the peak hour

1222
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:54,163
I wonder if Cheuk...

1223
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,733
...will call again tonight

1224
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:05,834
Hello, I'm Cheuk

1225
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,472
I appreciate people caring about me

1226
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:11,546
I want...

1227
01:26:11,684 --> 01:26:14,710
to say something to my love

1228
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,385
Why not say it directly to her?

1229
01:26:17,857 --> 01:26:18,619
Because...

1230
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:22,293
of fate

1231
01:26:23,395 --> 01:26:25,420
When I didn't expect anything

1232
01:26:27,032 --> 01:26:28,795
I owned her love unexpectedly

1233
01:26:30,503 --> 01:26:32,903
When I wanted her...

1234
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:35,434
or made a choice

1235
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:39,036
she went away, disliked me

1236
01:26:40,312 --> 01:26:41,779
I am leaving soon

1237
01:26:42,915 --> 01:26:45,213
Keeping the most unforgettable moment

1238
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:49,780
Laughter or tears

1239
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,448
I hope every bits of memory

1240
01:26:53,659 --> 01:26:55,524
be with the one I love most

1241
01:26:56,061 --> 01:27:00,464
Carry on with her life. Be strong...

1242
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:07,564
Five days is very short

1243
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:11,034
I want to tell friends in the air

1244
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:14,939
Hold what you have

1245
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:20,274
Now, or in the future

1246
01:27:21,654 --> 01:27:23,451
Even if it slips away...

1247
01:27:25,391 --> 01:27:27,018
I have no regret of this life

1248
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,597
That's so touching

1249
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,824
If only you were my boyfriend

1250
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:38,629
May I offer any help?

1251
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,672
Could you play a song...

1252
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:48,604
for my love?

1253
01:27:55,988 --> 01:28:00,254
Sure. Let's go for the meteor shower

1254
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,822
Before I hang up

1255
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:07,226
I hope everyone close your eyes again

1256
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:09,392
Feel the one...

1257
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:10,399
by your side with your heart

1258
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:15,767
You'll have better feeling

1259
01:28:52,645 --> 01:28:53,976
Meteor shower!

1260
01:29:05,391 --> 01:29:08,087
I've fulfilled my first wish

1261
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:14,058
Make a wish, quick

1262
01:29:22,408 --> 01:29:23,466
No...

1263
01:29:25,344 --> 01:29:28,040
I did last time, you still have to go

1264
01:29:32,751 --> 01:29:33,342
Come back

1265
01:29:33,485 --> 01:29:36,454
when the meteor showers

1266
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:54,765
"Wait for you"

1267
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:58,495
Finally, I know what is meteor shower

1268
01:30:59,938 --> 01:31:02,805
The tears of the sky...
