00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,096
Damn it, man! That was our
ride! You just stunned our ride!

3
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,182
Oh, great.

4
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,476
Run!

5
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,275
What the hell did you take?

6
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,236
I have no idea,
but they were bowing to it.

7
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,238
Kirk to Shuttle One.

8
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,948
Locals are out of the kill zone.

9
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,282
You are clear. Repeat.

10
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,120
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,170
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain

12
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
the shuttle wasn't built
for this kind of heat.

13
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,800
Captain, did the indigenous
life forms see you?

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,719
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

15
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,053
The Prime Directive clearly states

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,346
there can be no interference

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,515
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

18
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,142
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running

19
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,601
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

20
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,356
Now drop off your
super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!

21
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,774
You're good.

22
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,484
If we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it now!

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
This ash is killing our coils.

24
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,822
You sure you don't want me
to go instead?

25
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,033
That would be highly illogical
as I am already outfitted...

26
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,743
Spock, I was kidding.

27
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,830
- You got this.
- Guys! We have to go! Now!

28
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,216
They're trying to kill us!

29
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,677
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

30
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,346
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

31
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,519
Do it, do it!

00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,245

34
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,376
I can't hold this position.

35
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,919
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

36
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,713
Negative. This is our only
chance to save this species.

37
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,548
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

38
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,387
Pull him back up. Now!

39
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,903
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

40
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,743
I am,

41
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,579
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

42
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,832
We have to get him back.
I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

43
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,083
We have to abandon the shuttle.

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,085
- We can't just leave him, Sulu!
- We don't have a choice!

45
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,586
Uhura, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,755
Spock, we're going back
to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

47
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,798
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

49
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,427
You've got to make it
to the <i>Enterprise</i> on your own.

50
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,845
<i>Wonderful!</i>

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,431
- Uhura! You ready to swim?
- I'm ready.

52
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,684
Jim!

53
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,521
Jim! The beach is that way!

54
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
I know! We're not going to the beach!

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,275
Oh, no, no, no!

56
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,197
I hate this!

57
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
I know you do!

58
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,327
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is

59
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,828
to hide a starship
on the bottom of the ocean?

60
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,330
We've been down here since last night!

61
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,706
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

62
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,667
Scotty! Where's Spock?

63
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
Still in the volcano, sir.

64
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,169
Captain on the bridge!

65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,922
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

66
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,258
The heat's frying his comms,
but we still have contact.

67
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,594
Spock?

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,888
I have activated the device, Captain.

69
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,973
When the countdown is complete,

70
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,558
the reaction should
render the volcano inert.

71
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,976
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

72
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,394
Do we have use of the transporters?

73
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,104
- Negative, sir.
- Not with these magnetic fields.

74
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,772
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

75
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,441
Give me one way to do it.

76
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,735
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

77
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,902
- If we got closer...
- Hold on, wee man!

78
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,571
You're talking about an active volcano!

79
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,239
Sir, if that thing erupts,

80
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,991
I cannae guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,243
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

82
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,786
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,246
but the <i>Enterprise</i> is too large.

84
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,331
If utilized in a rescue effort,

85
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>it would be revealed
to the indigenous species.</i>

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,002
Spock, nobody knows
the rules better than you,

87
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,920
but there has got to be an exception.

88
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,256
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,258
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

90
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,178
Doctor, the needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few.

91
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,388
Spock, we're talking about your life!

92
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,598
<i>The rule cannot be broken...</i>

93
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,142
Spock!

94
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,518
Try to get him back online.

95
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,646
Ninety seconds to detonations.

96
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,318
If Spock were here
and I were there, what would he do?

97
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,989
He'd let you die.

98
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,217
Spock!

99
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,219
You all right?

100
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,055
Captain, you let them see our ship.

101
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,765
He's fine.

102
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,892
<i>- Bridge to Captain Kirk.</i>
- Yes, Lieutenant.

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,061
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?

104
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,145
<i>Safely and soundly.</i>

105
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,897
Please notify him that his device

106
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,523
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

107
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,651
<i>You hear that? Congratulations, Spock.</i>

108
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,071
You just saved the world.

109
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,073
You violated the Prime Directive.

110
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,742
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.

What did you say?

116
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,284
Your daughter.

117
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,246
I can save her.

118
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,748
Who are you?

119
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,686
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

121
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,691

123
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,320
Spock, I'm telling you,
this is why he called. I can feel it.

124
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,656
Your feeling aside,
I consider it highly unlikely

125
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,950
that we will be selected
for the new program.

126
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,327
Why else would Pike want to see us?

127
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,787
Forget about seniority.

128
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,247
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

129
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,498
I mean, who else
are they gonna send out?

130
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,583
I can think of numerous possibilities.

131
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,877
A five-year mission, Spock!

132
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,338
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

133
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,464
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

134
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,050
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

135
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,178
- "Uneventful."
- Admiral?

136
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,972
It's the way you described the survey of
Nibiru in your captain's log.

137
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,183
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going over the details.

138
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,143
Tell me more about this volcano.

139
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,644
Data says it was highly volatile.

140
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,271
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

141
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,647
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

142
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,982
Something tells me it won't.

143
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,027
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

144
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,779
Maybe our data was off.

145
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,155
Or maybe it didn't erupt

146
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,824
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

147
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,160
inside it right after a civilization

148
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,454
that's barely invented the wheel

149
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,499
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

150
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,709
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

151
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,586
- Admiral...
- You filed a report?

152
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,754
Why didn't you tell me?

153
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,173
I incorrectly assumed that you would be
truthful in your captain's log.

154
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,842
Yeah, I would have been
if I didn't have to save your life.

155
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,094
A fact for which I am
immeasurably grateful

156
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
and the very reason I felt it necessary

157
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
to take responsibility for the actions...

158
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,556
Take responsibility, yeah.

159
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,641
That'd be so noble, pointy,

160
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,226
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

161
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,311
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

162
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,646
Gentlemen.

163
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,942
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and
observe, not to interfere.

164
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,944
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

165
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,195
the indigenous species would never

166
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,363
have been aware of our interference.

167
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,739
That's a technicality.

168
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,658
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

169
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,368
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

170
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,370
I'm expressing
multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

171
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,621
To which are you referring?

172
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,872
Out.

173
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,500
You're dismissed, Commander.

174
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,095
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

175
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,097
I think so, sir.

176
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,432
So tell me what you did wrong.

177
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,434
What's the lesson to be learned here?

178
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,019
Never trust a Vulcan.

179
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,646
Now, see, you can't
even answer the question. You lied.

180
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,648
On an official report, you lied.

181
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,150
You think the rules don't apply to you

182
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,401
'cause you disagree with them.

183
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,403
That's why you talked me
into signing up in the first place.

184
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,654
It's why you gave me your ship.

185
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,907
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

186
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,494
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

187
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,829
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

188
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,039
You're missing the point.

189
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,665
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

190
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,625
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

191
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,002
in the first place!

192
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,004
You were supposed to survey a planet,

193
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,922
not alter its destiny!

194
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,091
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

195
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,344
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

196
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,887
Except I didn't!

197
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,305
You know how many
crew members I've lost? Not one!

198
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,390
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

199
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,641
You think you can't make a mistake.

200
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,976
It's a pattern with you!

201
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,312
- The rules are for other people!
- Some should be.

202
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,105
And what's worse is you using blind luck

203
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,316
to justify your playing God!

204
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,737
Given the circumstances,

205
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,781
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

206
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,617
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

207
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,453
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

208
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,621
be done at this point.

209
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,710
They've taken the <i>Enterprise</i>
away from you.

210
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

211
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,095
Admiral, listen...

212
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,221
- No, I'm not going to listen.
- I can justify...

213
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,305
Why should I listen?
I'm not going to listen.

214
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,682
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

215
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,558
I understand regulation,
but every decision I've made...

216
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,643
No! I can't listen!

217
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,436
You don't comply with the rules,

218
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,647
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

219
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,774
and you don't respect the chair.

220
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,319
You know why?

221
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,322
Because you're not ready for it.

222
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,674
LONDON

223
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,298
KELVIN MEMORIAL ARCHIVE

224
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,037
I'm going to need three titanium...

225
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>Radiation protection
is required in this area.</i>

226
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,804
TRANSMISSION SENT

227
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,567
How did you find me?

228
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,819
I know you better than you think I do.

229
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,824
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

230
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,745
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

231
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,080
No, I didn't.

232
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,082
- You don't?
- No, that's not what happened.

233
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,584
- That was an epic beating.
- No, it wasn't.

234
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,670
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

235
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,838
Did you not?

236
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,842
Yeah, that was a good fight.

237
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,387
"A good fight."

238
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,600
I think that's your problem right there.

239
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,273
They gave her back to me.

240
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,442
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

241
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,205
Congratulations.

242
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,502
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

243
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,547
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

244
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,257
He's been transferred.

245
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,801
<i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

246
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,180
You're going to be my First Officer.

247
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,392
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

248
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,022
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

249
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,860
What did you tell him?

250
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,112
The truth.

251
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,156
That I believe in you.

252
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,244
That if anybody
deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

253
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,589
I don't know what to say.

254
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,133
That is a first.

255
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,803
It's going to be okay, son.

256
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,979
"Emergency session, Daystrom."

257
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,774
That's us.

258
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah.

259
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,694
Suit up.

260
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,167
<i>All Starfleet personnel,
please be advised,</i>

261
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,170
<i>- new security protocols are in effect.</i>
- Captain.

262
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,339
Not anymore, Spock. First Officer.

263
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,176
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

264
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,011
It is fortunate that the consequences

265
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,179
were not more severe.

266
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,597
You've got to be kidding me.

267
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,765
Captain, it was never my intention...

268
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,016
Not Captain.

269
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,434
I saved your life, Spock.

270
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,853
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

271
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,400
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

272
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,151
to the fact that I submitted the report.

273
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,070
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

274
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,864
to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.

275
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,575
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

276
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,868
you don't stab him in the back.

277
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,662
Vulcans cannot lie.

278
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,414
Then I'm talking
to the half-human part of you.

279
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,082
All right?

280
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,626
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

281
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,171
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, <i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

282
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,715
Guess you're with me.

283
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,884
Yes, Captain.

284
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,144
The truth is

285
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,564
I'm going to miss you.

286
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,199
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

287
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,370
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

288
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,663
Be seated.

289
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,585
By now, some of you
have heard what happened in London.

290
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,087
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

291
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,339
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

292
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,174
42 men and women are dead.

293
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,425
One hour ago,

294
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,260
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

295
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,262
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

296
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,057
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

297
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,060
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

298
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,229
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

299
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,940
For reasons unknown,
John Harrison has just declared

300
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,485
a one-man war against Starfleet.

301
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,405
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

302
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,032
to escape Federation space.

303
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,493
You here tonight represent
the senior command

304
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,286
of all the vessels in the region.

305
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,039
And in the name of those we lost,

306
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,375
you will run this bastard down.

307
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,712
This is a manhunt,
pure and simple, so let's get to work.

308
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,131
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

309
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,841
any warp signatures leaving the system,

310
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,218
so we know he can't be far.

311
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,596
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

312
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,140
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

313
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,976
to run down every lead.

314
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,853
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

315
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,523
so the rules of engagement are simple.

316
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,651
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

317
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,528
or the lives of those nearby,

318
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,656
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

319
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,408
- What's in the bag?
- James, not now.

320
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,702
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

321
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,286
It's like bombing a library.

322
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,038
Chris? Everything okay there?

323
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,083
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

324
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,918
to his new position as First Officer.

325
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,712
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

326
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,380
Tomorrow's too late.

327
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,550
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

328
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,553
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

329
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,848
Why the archive?

330
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,642
All that information is public record.

331
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,728
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

332
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,523
this could just be the beginning.

333
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,191
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

334
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,111
Sir, in the event
of an attack, protocol mandates

335
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,072
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

336
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,199
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

337
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,578
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison

338
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,705
would commandeer a jumpship
without warp capabilities...

339
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,004
Clear the room!

340
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,385
No!

341
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,140
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!

342
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,393
- Let's go!
- Cover me!

343
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,570
- Target acquired.
- Take him out!

344
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,654
Watch my flank!

345
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,533
- Go, go, go!
- Cover me!

346
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,453
Fire!

347
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,698
Yeah?

348
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,326
<i>Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something</i>

349
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,244
<i>in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.</i>

350
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,914
<i>He has asked to see us right away.</i>

351
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,752
Captain!
I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.

352
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,629
- This is how the bastard got away.
- What do you mean?

353
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,839
It's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

354
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,174
Well, can you figure out where he went?

355
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,177
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

356
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,138
He's gone to the one place we...

357
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,516
We just can't go.

358
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,978
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

359
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,400
He's on Kronos, sir.

360
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,068
I request my command be reinstated

361
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,028
and your permission to go after him.

362
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,698
Give us a minute.

363
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,283
- Kronos.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,869
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

365
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,621
- Is he defecting?
- We're not sure, sir.

366
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,123
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

367
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,207
a region uninhabited for decades.

368
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,792
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

369
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,585
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

370
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,670
it'd be all-out war.

371
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:21,047
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

372
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,299
Please, sir.

373
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,138
All-out war with
the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

374
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,556
If you ask me, it's already begun.

375
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,266
Since we first learned of their existence,

376
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,476
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

377
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,728
two planets that we know of

378
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,313
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

379
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,984
They are coming our way.

380
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,030
London was not an archive.

381
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,032
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

382
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,617
designated Section 31.

383
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,244
They were developing
defense technology

384
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,246
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

385
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,789
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

386
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,167
who means to do us harm.

387
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,710
Harrison was one of our top agents.

388
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,129
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

389
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,675
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

390
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,553
You should have heard him defend you.

391
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,681
He's the one who talked you
into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

392
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:13,975
Yes, sir.

393
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,770
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

394
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,984
His death is on me.

395
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,653
And yours can't be.

396
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,821
Sir, please. All I...

397
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,406
Mr. Spock, you said the province

398
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,949
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

399
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,618
Affirmative, sir.

400
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,539
As part of our defensive strategy,

401
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,875
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

402
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:42,962
Long-range and untraceable,

403
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,173
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

404
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:48,426
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

405
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,387
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

406
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,347
you lock onto Harrison's position,

407
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,848
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

408
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,687
Permission to
reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

409
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,356
Granted.

410
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,115
Jim!

411
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,034
- Where were you?
- For what?

412
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,744
Your medical exam.

413
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,788
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

414
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,124
- Now it's my duty as ship's...
- I'm fine, Bones.

415
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,792
The hell you are.

416
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,295
I'm fine.

417
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,053
Status report, Mr. Spock.

418
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,471
The <i>Enterprise</i> should be
ready for launch

419
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,973
by the time we arrive.

420
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,350
- Good. Good.
- Captain.

421
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,687
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

422
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,648
You're welcome.

423
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,651
As I am again
your First Officer, it is now my duty

424
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,361
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

425
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,863
Of course it is.

426
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,406
There is no Starfleet regulation

427
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,033
that condemns a man
to die without a trial,

428
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,869
something you
and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

429
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,204
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

430
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,831
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

431
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,666
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

432
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,751
There's only gonna be one casualty.

433
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,377
And in case you weren't listening,

434
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,504
our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

435
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,256
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

436
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:11,468
Regulations aside,
this action is morally wrong.

437
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,304
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

438
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,430
And I didn't win any points for that.

439
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,598
Whoa, Jim, calm down.

440
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,099
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

441
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,976
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

442
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,394
and therefore find my opinion valid.

443
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,604
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

444
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,939
Bones, get that thing off my face.

445
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,734
Captain, our mission
could start a war with the Klingons

446
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,903
and it is, by its very definition, immoral.

447
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,571
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

448
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,948
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

449
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,241
Captain Kirk.

450
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,036
Science Officer Wallace.

451
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,330
I've been assigned
to the <i>Enterprise</i> by Admiral Marcus.

452
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,374
These are my transfer orders.

453
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,251
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

454
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,419
I wish I had.

455
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,298
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

456
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,758
"Doctorate in applied physics

457
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,803
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

458
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:55,929
Impressive credentials.

459
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,347
Thank you.

460
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,932
But redundant now that
I am back aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

461
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,517
And yet, the more the merrier.

462
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,644
- Have a seat, Doctor.
- Thank you.

463
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,274
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

464
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,381
No! I'm not signing anything!

465
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,675
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

466
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,926
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?

467
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,970
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

468
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,514
that I cannae authorize any
weapons on board this ship

469
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:40,724
without knowing what's inside them.

470
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,600
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

471
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,810
Report to the bridge.

472
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,145
Captain.

473
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,188
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

474
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,149
but we need these torpedoes on board.

475
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,901
Due respect, sir,
but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

476
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,570
Now, I cannae detect the type of fuel

477
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,447
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

478
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,573
because it's shielded.

479
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,992
Now, I asked for
the specifications, but he said...

480
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,077
- It's classified.
- It's classified.

481
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,246
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

482
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,330
Captain.

483
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,666
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

484
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,668
- Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,838
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

486
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,590
Get down!

487
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,258
Jim, your vitals are way off.

488
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,677
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

489
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,346
I need you to approve those weapons.

490
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,430
Do you know what this is, Captain?

491
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,931
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

492
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,851
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a warp core.

493
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,937
It's a radioactive
catastrophe waiting to happen.

494
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,981
A subtle shift in magnetic output

495
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:32,942
from, say, firing
one or more of six dozen torpedoes

496
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,486
with an unknown payload

497
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,029
could set off a chain reaction
which would kill

498
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,781
every living thing on this ship.

499
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:40,367
Letting those torpedoes on board the<i>
Enterprise</i> is the last straw!

500
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,327
- What was the first straw?
- What was the...

501
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,245
There are plenty of straws.

502
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,956
How about Starfleet
confiscating my transwarp equation?

503
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,292
And now some madman's
using it to hop across the galaxy!

504
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,460
Where do you think he got it from?

505
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,878
We have our orders, Scotty!

506
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,755
That's what scares me.

507
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,549
This is clearly a military operation.

508
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,426
Is that what we are now?

509
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,594
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

510
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:03,014
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

511
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,975
Right, well, you leave me no choice

512
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,352
but to resign my duties.

513
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,937
Come on, Scotty.

514
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,689
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

515
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:11,898
You're not giving me much of a choice.

516
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,233
Will you just
make an exception and sign...

517
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,609
Do you accept my resignation or not?

518
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,027
I do!

519
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,618
I do.

520
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,872
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

521
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:43,304
Jim, for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

522
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,945
<i>Attention. Warp core
anti-matter containment check</i>

523
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,488
<i>in three minutes.</i>

524
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,870
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.</i>

525
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,580
We all are.

526
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,082
- Are you okay?
- Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

527
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,217
Actually, Scotty just quit.

528
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,264
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

529
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,019
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

530
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:34,773
It's just sometimes
I want to rip the bangs off his head.

531
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,109
- You know, maybe it's me. I...
- It's not you.

532
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:40,904
It's not?

533
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,700
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

534
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:46,785
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

535
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,953
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

536
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,835
Your ears burning?

537
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,003
Captain on the bridge!

538
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,838
Captain.

539
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:02,592
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

540
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,011
You are familiar with
the engineering systems of this ship?

541
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,096
Affirmative, sir.

542
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,222
Good.

543
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:11,017
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

544
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,106
Aye, Captain.

545
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,695
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

546
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,030
Yes, sir.

547
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,829
<i>Docking clamps one, two,
and three are released.</i>

548
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,871
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

549
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,384
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

550
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,468
Yes, sir.

551
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:47,846
<i>Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?</i>

552
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,390
- All systems nominal, Captain.<i>
- Copy that.</i>

553
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,975
Warp available at your command.

554
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,643
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

555
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,271
- All right. Let's ride.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,077
Channel open, sir.

557
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,414
Attention, crew of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

558
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,708
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

559
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,711
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

560
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:22,797
is dead.

561
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,508
The man who killed him
has fled our system

562
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,344
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

563
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,055
<i>somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.</i>

564
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:34,059
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

565
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:38,063
<i>Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential
that our presence go undetected.</i>

566
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,773
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

567
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,566
<i>and the Klingon Empire have been high.</i>

568
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,943
<i>Any provocation could lead
to an all-out war.</i>

569
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,709
I will personally lead a landing party

570
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,420
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

571
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:06,424
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

572
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,595
and return him to Earth
so he can face judgment for his actions.

573
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,810
All right. Let's go
get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

574
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,609
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

575
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:25,652
If I can be of assistance,

576
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,821
I would be happy to accompany
you on the away team.

577
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,533
You? Happy?

578
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,369
I was simply attempting to use your
vernacular to convey an idea.

579
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,289
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

580
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:51,011
<i>All personnel, prepare for the
closing of payload bay doors.</i>

581
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,937
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

582
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:03,440
What are you doing, Doctor?

583
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,442
- Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
- You misunderstand.

584
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,610
What are you doing aboard this ship?

585
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,530
There is no record
of you being assigned to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

586
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,032
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

587
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,409
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

588
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,996
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

589
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,582
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

590
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,876
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

591
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:27,589
Mr. Spock.

592
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:30,717
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

593
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,970
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

594
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,897
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

595
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,732
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

596
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:47,442
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

597
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,651
The core overheated.

598
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,403
I had to activate the emergency stop.

599
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,072
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

600
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,407
<i>- Sorry, Captain.</i>
- Damn it.

601
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,993
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

602
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,411
Twenty minutes, sir.

603
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,622
That's 20 minutes
in enemy space we weren't counting on.

604
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,374
All right. We better hop to it.

605
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,917
- Where's Spock?
- Here, Captain.

606
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,002
You're coming with me to Kronos.

607
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,087
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

608
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,339
- It's rusty, but it's good.
- Good, you're coming, too.

609
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,926
This isn't going to be a problem, is it,
you two working together?

610
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,678
Absolutely not.

611
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,390
Unclear.

612
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:20,600
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

613
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,978
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

614
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,691
You don't rob a bank
when the getaway car has a flat tire.

615
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,402
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

616
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:31,486
by the time we get back.

617
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,655
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?</i>

618
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:34,739
Yes, Captain.

619
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,241
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

620
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,619
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

621
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:42,372
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

622
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,708
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

623
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,335
You tell him you have a bunch
of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

624
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,171
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

625
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,132
- Is that a problem?
- No, sir.

626
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,050
I've just never sat in the chair before.

627
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,845
You're gonna do great.

628
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:00,015
Jim! Wait!

629
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,684
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

630
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,894
with no cards and told him to bluff.

631
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,355
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

632
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,690
For the next two hours, he is.

633
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,775
And enough with the metaphors, all
right? That's an order.

634
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:13,361
Mr. Sulu, make sure
that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

635
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,457
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

636
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:27,375
<i>Please have the trade ship
we confiscated</i>

637
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:30,003
<i>during the Mudd incident last month
fueled and flight ready.</i>

638
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:32,213
<i>Captain Kirk is en route to you now.</i>

639
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,302
Ready to deploy, Captain.

640
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,054
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

641
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,014
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.

642
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,058
- Sir?
- Look, if this thing goes south,

643
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,185
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

644
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,729
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

645
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:50,190
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

646
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,483
Good. Me, neither.

647
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,087
I am detecting
a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

648
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,255
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

649
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,590
this is most likely John Harrison.

650
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,384
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

651
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,718
You let him know you mean business.

652
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:19,969
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

653
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,848
Attention, John Harrison.

654
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:27,227
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

655
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:31,731
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on its way to your location.

656
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,901
<i>If you do not surrender
to them immediately,</i>

657
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:39,239
<i>I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes</i>

658
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,366
<i>currently locked onto your location.</i>

659
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,911
<i>You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.</i>

660
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,872
<i>Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.</i>

661
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:53,378
If you test me, you will fail.

662
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,217
Mr. Sulu,

663
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,886
remind me never to piss you off.

664
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:06,850
KRONOS

665
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:08,601
We will arrive at Harrison's location

666
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,020
in three minutes, Captain.

667
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,771
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.

668
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,650
I calculate the odds
of him attempting to kill us at 91.6 %.

669
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:16,901
Fantastic.

670
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,486
Good thing you don't care about dying.

671
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,407
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.

672
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,034
I didn't say anything.

673
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,953
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

674
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:27,996
- if you're willing to listen to me.
- Guys...

675
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,748
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

676
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:31,207
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

677
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:32,375
Our current circumstances...

678
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,835
Are you really gonna do this right now?

679
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,462
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

680
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:37,005
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

681
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:38,465
- Okay.
- ...is us.

682
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:40,800
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

683
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,386
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

684
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,431
You didn't feel anything.

685
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,725
You didn't care.

686
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:51,644
And I'm not the only one who's upset
with you. The Captain is, too.

687
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,356
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

688
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:57,150
She is right.

689
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,362
Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

690
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,113
A sentient being's optimal chance

691
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,324
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

692
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,367
Great.

693
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,118
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

694
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,286
You misunderstand.

695
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,831
It is true I chose not to feel anything

696
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:14,793
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

697
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,170
As Admiral Pike was dying,

698
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:19,130
I joined with his consciousness

699
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:23,051
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

700
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:26,304
Anger. Confusion.

701
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,806
Loneliness.

702
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,891
Fear.

703
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,311
I had experienced those feelings before,

704
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:35,397
multiplied exponentially

705
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,149
on the day my planet was destroyed.

706
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,611
Such a feeling is something I choose

707
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,822
never to experience again.

708
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,828
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

709
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,664
as a reflection of my not caring.

710
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:57,377
Well, I assure you,
the truth is precisely the opposite.

711
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:04,676
What the hell was that?

712
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,761
What happened? Where's their signal?

713
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,014
It cut out. I'm working to get them back.

714
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,395
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

715
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,563
I thought this sector was abandoned!

716
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:17,814
It must be a random patrol.

717
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:18,940
Hold on!

718
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,237
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

719
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,156
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

720
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,240
Aye, Captain.

721
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:42,672
Damn it!

722
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,676
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

723
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,847
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

724
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,225
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

725
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,393
between the approaching structures,

726
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,354
- this ship will not fit.
- We'll fit.

727
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,440
- Captain, we will not fit.
- We'll fit, we'll fit!

728
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,960
- I told you we'd fit.
- I am not sure that qualifies.

729
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,049
Any sign of them?

730
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,759
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!

731
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,052
Or they're jamming our scanners.

732
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,220
Or we lost them.

733
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,532
They're ordering us to land.

734
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:54,327
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

735
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,996
And they're gonna torture us.

736
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,748
Question us.

737
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:00,375
And they're gonna kill us.

738
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:04,295
So we come out shooting.

739
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,468
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

740
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,722
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

741
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,642
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

742
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,645
Then let me speak Klingon.

743
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,403
This isn't going to work.

744
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,489
It is our only logical option.

745
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,617
And if you interrupt her now, you will
not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

746
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,286
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

747
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,093
I AM HERE
TO HELP YOU.

748
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,070
- Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Captain.

749
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,955
WITH RESPECT.

750
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:07,377
THERE IS A CRIMINAL HIDING
IN THESE RUINS

751
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:10,755
HE HAS KILLED
MANY OF OUR PEOPLE.

752
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:27,230
WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT
A HUMAN KILLING HUMANS?

753
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,984
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT HONOR.

754
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,155
AND THIS MAN
HAS NONE.

755
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,450
YOU AND YOUR
PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER.

756
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,469
- Stand down.
- How many torpedoes?

757
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,511
Stand down!

758
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,057
The torpedoes, the weapons you
threatened me with in your message.

759
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:08,641
How many are there?

760
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,561
Seventy-two.

761
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:19,861
I surrender.

762
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,797
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

763
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,423
my friend,

764
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:42,676
I accept your surrender.

765
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,119
Captain!

766
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:18,753
Captain.

767
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,017
Cuff him.

768
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,164
- Bones, meet me in the brig.<i>
- Be right there.</i>

769
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,707
Lieutenant.

770
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,627
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

771
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,547
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

772
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,923
Yes, sir.

773
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,484
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.</i>

774
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,486
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

775
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:25,653
I want to know how.

776
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,114
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

777
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:29,532
You tell me.

778
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,959
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

779
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:57,268
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

780
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:01,648
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

781
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,734
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

782
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:07,070
- How the hell do you know that?
- Bones.

783
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,241
I think you'd find
my insight valuable, Captain.

784
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,495
- We good?
- Yeah.

785
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,163
Let me know what you find.

786
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:22,252
Ignore me and you
will get everyone on this ship killed.

787
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,344
Captain, I believe
he will only attempt to manipulate you.

788
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,722
I would not recommend
engaging the prisoner further.

789
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:35,306
Give me a minute.

790
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:50,030
Let me explain what's happening here.

791
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,157
You are a criminal.

792
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,826
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

793
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:57,495
I was authorized to end you!

794
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:01,166
And the only reason
why you are still alive

795
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:02,876
is because I am allowing it.

796
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,879
So shut your mouth.

797
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,798
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

798
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,801
over and over till your arm weakens?

799
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,220
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

800
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,724
why did you allow me to live?

801
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:19,142
We all make mistakes.

802
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,978
No. I surrendered to you because,

803
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,064
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

804
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:27,067
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

805
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,737
If you did not,
then it would be impossible for me

806
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,906
to convince you of the truth.

807
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:38,745
23-17-46-11.

808
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:42,123
Coordinates not far from Earth.

809
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:45,669
If you want to know why I did what I did,

810
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,087
go and take a look.

811
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:50,173
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

812
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,300
I can give you 72.

813
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,428
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

814
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:59,057
They have been all along.

815
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,227
I suggest you open one up.

816
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:19,786
Hi!

817
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,171
You know what really
bothers me, though?

818
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:32,924
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

819
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:36,011
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

820
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:38,263
Just for trying to do what's right!

821
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,432
And what did you do anyway?

822
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:41,599
You just stood there like an oyster,

823
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,018
looking at me!

824
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:44,144
What?

825
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,770
Scotty, it's Kirk.

826
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:47,355
Well now!

827
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:50,483
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

828
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:52,402
<i>Did you hear that?
I called him Perfect Hair.</i>

829
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:53,945
- Where are you?<i>
- Where are you?</i>

830
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,155
Are you drunk?

831
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,324
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

832
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,784
I need you to help me out
with something.

833
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:01,202
Will you take these coordinates down?

834
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,414
23-17-46-11.

835
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,041
<i>Are you writing?</i>

836
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,168
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

837
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:12,339
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?

838
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,507
<i>Forty-six.</i>

839
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,469
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

840
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,722
but I have a feeling you'll know it
when you see it.

841
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,600
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

842
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,729
I will consider that an apology.

843
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:29,606
And I will consider that apology.

844
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,192
You are the one who quit.

845
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,027
You made me quit!

846
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,945
Mr. Scott?

847
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:37,697
Scott.

848
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,742
The nerve of that guy!

849
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:45,246
I am not doing that man any favors!

850
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:46,581
No!

851
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,750
All right, then!

852
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,877
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

853
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,796
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

854
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,798
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

855
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:57,133
and now you think
it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

856
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,385
because he dared you to.

857
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,303
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

858
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,055
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

859
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:04,557
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.

860
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,560
Perhaps you, too, should learn
to govern your emotions, Doctor.

861
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,937
In this situation, logic dictates...

862
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,064
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

863
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:12,816
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

864
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:14,651
That's not it.
I don't know why he surrendered,

865
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,152
but that's not it.

866
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,571
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

867
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,240
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

868
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:21,741
who exactly is qualified

869
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:24,035
to just pop open
a four-ton stick of dynamite?

870
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,745
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

871
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,831
in the torpedoes
and she is a weapons specialist.

872
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,375
Perhaps she could be of some use.

873
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,210
What Admiral's daughter?

874
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,754
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

875
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:36,631
concealed her identity to board the ship.

876
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,217
When were you going to tell me that?

877
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:41,428
When it became relevant. As it just did.

878
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:43,138
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

879
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:44,764
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

880
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,349
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

881
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,726
onto your ship to find out why.

882
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:49,519
I do apologize for that.

883
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:52,397
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

884
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:53,898
I'm Carol Marcus.

885
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:56,067
- James Kirk.
- Torpedoes.

886
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:59,112
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

887
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:01,865
then I heard he was
developing these prototype torpedoes.

888
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:05,535
When I went to confront him about it,
he wouldn't even see me.

889
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:07,746
That's when I discovered
the torpedoes had disappeared

890
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,956
from all official records.

891
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,958
And then he gave them to me.

892
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,045
You're much cleverer than
your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

893
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,796
I have a reputation?

894
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:19,049
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

895
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:21,051
Christine, yes. How is she?

896
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,136
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

897
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:24,304
She's much happier now.

898
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:25,388
That's good.

899
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,891
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

900
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:29,809
What are we doing in here?

901
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:30,894
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?

902
01:03:30,977 --> 01:03:32,312
Of course it is.

903
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,022
- Would you please turn around?
- Why?

904
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,483
Just turn around.

905
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,569
It's too dangerous to try and open

906
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:41,571
one of these torpedoes
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

907
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,407
But there is a nearby planetoid.

908
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,034
I can open one up there.

909
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,119
But I will need some help.

910
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,996
Turn around.

911
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,332
Now!

912
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,335
Captain on the bridge!

913
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:57,003
Mr. Sulu,

914
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,589
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

915
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,342
Yes, sir. They're moving the
torpedo into position now.

916
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,678
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

917
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:06,012
Not yet.

918
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,098
But if we're stuck
here much longer, they will find us.

919
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,809
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

920
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,435
we have Harrison in custody?

921
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,521
Yes, sir. No response yet.

922
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,273
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

923
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,567
<i>Hello. Captain, can you hear me?</i>

924
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,444
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

925
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:25,031
We found the leak, sir,
but the damage is substantial.

926
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,116
We're working on it.

927
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:27,951
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

928
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:32,205
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

929
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:37,544
Something tells me
it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

930
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,713
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

931
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,173
Bones, thanks for helping out.

932
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:44,426
Dr. Marcus asked
for the steadiest hands on the ship.

933
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:46,052
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

934
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,179
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

935
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:49,639
there was no torpedo!

936
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,392
<i>Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.</i>

937
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,020
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

938
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,187
<i>Bones!</i>

939
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:58,148
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

940
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:59,315
we need to open the warhead.

941
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,026
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

942
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,110
Unfortunately for us,

943
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:04,738
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

944
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:05,905
Sweetheart, I once performed

945
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:08,366
an emergency C-section
on a pregnant Gorn.

946
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:09,409
Octuplets.

947
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:11,703
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

948
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,497
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

949
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,459
Dr. McCoy,
there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

950
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,960
against the inner casing.

951
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,004
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

952
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:22,756
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

953
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:23,882
Do you understand?

954
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,884
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

955
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:27,177
Dr. McCoy,

956
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:29,262
<i>wait for my word.</i>

957
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,264
<i>I'm rerouting the detonation processor.</i>

958
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:33,433
- Are you ready?
- And raring.

959
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:34,559
Good luck.

960
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,395
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

961
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,980
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

962
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,399
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

963
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,068
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.

964
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:46,946
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

965
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,782
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

966
01:05:48,865 --> 01:05:50,492
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

967
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:52,786
I'm trying. I'm trying.

968
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:54,371
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

969
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,122
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

970
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:57,665
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

971
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,751
Ten. Nine.

972
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:00,919
Eight.

973
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,588
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

974
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:05,465
Four. Three.

975
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:06,716
Shit!

976
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,808
Deactivation successful, Captain.

977
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:17,644
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

978
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:24,234
<i>Bones!</i>

979
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:26,486
Jim?

980
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,572
You're going to want to see this.

981
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:42,627
COORDINATES 23.17.46.11
JUPITER

982
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:38,475
Delta team, deliver your<i>
thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

983
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:41,144
U.S.S. Vengeance, <i>bridge crew</i>

984
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:43,563
<i>requesting entry to construction hangar.</i>

985
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,233
<i>You are cleared to enter the hangar.</i>

986
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:59,746
<i>I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.</i>

987
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,584
Holy...

988
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:07,587
What have we got?

989
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:08,713
It's quite clever actually.

990
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,924
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

991
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:13,677
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

992
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,097
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.

993
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,391
But if we try to revive him

994
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,893
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

995
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,770
This technology's beyond me.

996
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,397
How advanced, Doctor?

997
01:08:25,605 --> 01:08:28,024
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

998
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:31,611
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

999
01:08:31,695 --> 01:08:35,031
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

1000
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:37,367
He's 300 years old.

1001
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,044
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

1002
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,422
There are men and women

1003
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,298
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

1004
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:54,092
I put them there.

1005
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,346
Who the hell are you?

1006
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:05,103
A remnant of a time long past.

1007
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,231
Genetically engineered to be superior

1008
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:11,276
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

1009
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:17,449
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

1010
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:20,493
For centuries we slept,

1011
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:25,290
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

1012
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:27,834
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

1013
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,295
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

1014
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:31,629
distant quadrants of space.

1015
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:34,466
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

1016
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:36,301
I looked up "John Harrison."

1017
01:09:36,509 --> 01:09:37,844
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

1018
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:41,473
John Harrison was a fiction
created the moment I was awoken

1019
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:44,768
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1020
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:48,438
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1021
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:51,691
My name is

1022
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,193
Khan.

1023
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:00,784
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1024
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:04,746
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1025
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,540
Because I am better.

1026
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,126
- At what?
- Everything.

1027
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,630
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1028
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,799
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1029
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:18,301
and for that he needed a warrior's mind.

1030
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:19,552
My mind.

1031
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,971
To design weapons and warships.

1032
01:10:22,138 --> 01:10:24,057
You are suggesting the Admiral

1033
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:26,101
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1034
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:28,228
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1035
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:30,772
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1036
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:33,566
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1037
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,443
You... You can't even break a rule.

1038
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:38,321
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1039
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:41,783
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1040
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:44,744
To help him realize
his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1041
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:47,580
He sent you to use those weapons.

1042
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:52,043
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1043
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,422
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1044
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:59,426
in enemy space,
leading to one inevitable outcome.

1045
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,094
The Klingons would come searching

1046
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:03,054
for whomever was responsible,

1047
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:05,265
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1048
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,811
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1049
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,938
The war he always wanted.

1050
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:13,732
No. No.

1051
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:15,859
I watched you open fire

1052
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,570
in a room full of
unarmed Starfleet officers.

1053
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,572
You killed them in cold blood!

1054
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:23,116
Marcus took my crew from me.

1055
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,368
You are a murderer!

1056
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:29,039
He used my friends to control me.

1057
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,086
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1058
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,880
by concealing them in the very weapons

1059
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:38,631
I had designed,

1060
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,427
but I was discovered.

1061
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:47,432
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1062
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:53,104
And when I did,
I had every reason to suspect

1063
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:57,484
that Marcus had killed every single one

1064
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:00,987
of the people I hold most dear.

1065
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,827
So I responded in kind.

1066
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:12,957
My crew

1067
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,960
is my family, Kirk.

1068
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:20,173
Is there anything
you would not do for your family?

1069
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:23,468
<i>Proximity alert, sir!</i>

1070
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,303
<i>There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.</i>

1071
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:27,347
- Klingons?
- At warp?

1072
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:28,807
No, Kirk.

1073
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:31,017
- We both know who it is.<i>
- I don't think so.</i>

1074
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,186
<i>It's not coming at us from Kronos.</i>

1075
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:39,526
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1076
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:40,860
Post six security officers on him.

1077
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,028
Yes, Captain.

1078
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,697
Captain on the bridge!

1079
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,032
ETA of the incoming ship.

1080
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,450
Three seconds, sir.

1081
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,371
- Shields.
- Aye, Captain.

1082
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:16,813
They're hailing us, sir.

1083
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,566
On screen.

1084
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,819
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1085
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:28,241
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1086
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:32,328
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1087
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:35,040
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1088
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:36,416
<i>And I wasn't expecting to get word</i>

1089
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,084
<i>that you'd taken Harrison into custody</i>

1090
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,878
<i>in violation of your orders.</i>

1091
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,380
Well, we...

1092
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,424
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1093
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,468
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1094
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,511
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1095
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:50,055
<i>I don't take your meaning.</i>

1096
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,723
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1097
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,892
To assist with our repairs?

1098
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:56,227
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1099
01:13:56,269 --> 01:13:58,229
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1100
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,232
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1101
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,485
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1102
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:06,071
<i>Where is your prisoner, Kirk?</i>

1103
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:07,322
Per Starfleet regulation,

1104
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,618
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1105
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,412
Well, shit.

1106
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:16,915
You talked to him.

1107
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:20,627
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1108
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:23,588
<i>I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard up,</i>

1109
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,049
<i>believing that his superior intelligence</i>

1110
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:29,052
could help us protect ourselves
from whatever came at us next.

1111
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,222
But I made a mistake.

1112
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:36,393
<i>And now the blood
of everybody he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1113
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:38,978
So I'm asking you,

1114
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,855
give him to me

1115
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,025
so that I can end what I started.

1116
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,780
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1117
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:50,740
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1118
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:55,829
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1119
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,497
Start a war in the process?

1120
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:00,417
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1121
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,127
<i>And I simply didn't want to burden you</i>

1122
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:04,337
<i>with knowing what was inside of them.</i>

1123
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:06,339
<i>You saw what this man
can do all by himself.</i>

1124
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:10,260
<i>Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up the rest of his crew?</i>

1125
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,346
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1126
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:16,349
<i>He's playing you, son,
don't you see that?</i>

1127
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:20,061
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.</i>

1128
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,605
<i>And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence</i>

1129
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:25,066
<i>before anybody else
dies because of him.</i>

1130
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,030
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1131
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:33,116
One last time, son.

1132
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,578
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1133
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,788
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1134
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,626
He's in engineering, sir.

1135
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:46,713
But I'll have him moved

1136
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:48,798
to the transporter room right away.

1137
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:50,800
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1138
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,552
Do not drop those shields,

1139
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,636
- Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

1140
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,721
Captain, given your awareness

1141
01:15:54,804 --> 01:15:56,306
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1142
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:58,058
may I know the details of your plan?

1143
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:01,061
I told Marcus we were
bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1144
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:02,812
That's what we're going to do.

1145
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:04,522
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1146
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,232
Sir, if we go to warp,

1147
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:09,486
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1148
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:10,945
<i>Can we do it?</i>

1149
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:15,450
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1150
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:16,951
Noted.

1151
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,913
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1152
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,039
Yes, sir.

1153
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,583
Punch it.

1154
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:33,426
Well, at least we're moving again.

1155
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,890
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1156
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,396
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1157
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:45,939
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1158
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,691
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1159
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:48,817
Comms are down, sir.

1160
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:52,445
Permission to come on the bridge.

1161
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:53,571
Dr. Marcus.

1162
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,615
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1163
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:57,075
the only thing
that's gonna stop him destroying

1164
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:58,576
this ship is me,
so you have to let me talk to him.

1165
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,453
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1166
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:01,788
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1167
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,206
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1168
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:05,875
Captain! I'm getting
a reading I don't understand.

1169
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:36,823
Where are we?

1170
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:38,116
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1171
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,159
- Damage report!
- Weapons are way down.

1172
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,660
- Shields are dropping.
- We're defenseless, sir.

1173
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:41,995
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1174
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,080
- Where's the damage?
- Major hull damage, Captain.

1175
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:52,005
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now!

1176
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,383
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die

1177
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:56,676
if you don't let me speak to him.

1178
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,972
Uhura, hail him.

1179
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,975
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1180
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,237
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1181
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:18,114
I heard what you said.

1182
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:20,950
That you made a mistake

1183
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,453
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1184
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,955
But, Dad,

1185
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:33,046
I don't believe that
the man who raised me

1186
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:37,759
is capable of destroying a ship
full of innocent people.

1187
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:40,720
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1188
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:43,223
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1189
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,977
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1190
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:54,401
- Jim...
- Can we intercept the transport signal?

1191
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:55,568
No, sir.

1192
01:18:57,862 --> 01:18:58,863
Carol!

1193
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,366
<i>Captain Kirk, without authorization</i>

1194
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:03,576
<i>and in league with
the fugitive John Harrison,</i>

1195
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,537
<i>you went rogue in enemy territory,</i>

1196
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,663
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1197
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:08,665
<i>but to hunt you down and destroy you.</i>

1198
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:11,251
<i>- Lock phasers.</i>
- Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1199
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,419
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1200
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:14,796
<i>Target all aft torpedoes
on the</i> Enterprise <i>bridge.</i>

1201
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,340
Sir, my crew
was just following my orders.

1202
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:19,968
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1203
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:22,095
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1204
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:25,098
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1205
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,600
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1206
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,276
Please, sir.

1207
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:40,280
I'll do anything you want.

1208
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:43,533
Just let them live.

1209
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:47,454
That's a hell of an apology.

1210
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,789
But if it's any consolation,

1211
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,875
I was never going to spare your crew.

1212
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,295
<i>Fire when...</i>

1213
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:16,941
I'm sorry.

1214
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,408
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1215
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:26,743
Our shields are down!
We're losing power!

1216
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:29,079
Someone in engineering
just manually reset our systems!

1217
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,623
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1218
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,334
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1219
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:36,711
Enterprise! <i>Can you hear me?</i>

1220
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:37,879
Scotty!

1221
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:42,008
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1222
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,010
- You're on that ship!<i>
- I snuck on.</i>

1223
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:45,512
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1224
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:47,180
against a Starfleet Admiral, I'd really like

1225
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:49,432
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1226
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:50,684
You're a miracle worker.

1227
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,602
We're a little low on power right now.

1228
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:53,770
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1229
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:55,063
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1230
01:20:55,146 --> 01:20:56,356
What happened to the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1231
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:58,358
Call you back.

1232
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,277
Scotty!

1233
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:04,948
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1234
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:06,825
Our options are limited, Captain.

1235
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:08,868
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1236
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:13,206
There is one option.

1237
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,166
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1238
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,043
- patch him through.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:18,420
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1240
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:24,509
Captain, I strongly object.

1241
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,386
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1242
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:28,054
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1243
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:29,639
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1244
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:31,349
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1245
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:32,475
it is optimal for you to take

1246
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,310
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1247
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,896
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1248
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,064
with advanced combat abilities

1249
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:39,983
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1250
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,277
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1251
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,237
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

1252
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:46,114
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1253
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:48,158
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1254
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:50,285
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1255
01:21:50,368 --> 01:21:52,078
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1256
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,330
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1257
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:56,666
- I will go with you, Captain.
- No, I need you on the bridge.

1258
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,543
I cannot allow you to do this.

1259
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,378
It is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1260
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,880
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1261
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:03,048
something I firmly believe

1262
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,591
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1263
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,092
You're right!

1264
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,220
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1265
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,890
it's not logical. It is a gut feeling.

1266
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:17,854
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1267
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,274
I only know what I can do.

1268
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,485
The <i>Enterprise</i> and her crew
need someone

1269
01:22:23,568 --> 01:22:26,321
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1270
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:31,284
And it's not me.

1271
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,538
It's you, Spock.

1272
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,063
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1273
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,232
Dreadnought class.

1274
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:03,983
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1275
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,945
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1276
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:09,906
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it's built solely for combat.

1277
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:13,326
I will do everything I can

1278
01:23:13,993 --> 01:23:16,287
to make you answer for what you did.

1279
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:24,129
But right now I need your help.

1280
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:26,172
In exchange for what?

1281
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:29,843
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1282
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:34,180
- I can guarantee their safety.
- Captain.

1283
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:38,685
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1284
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:46,443
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1285
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:48,611
The tribble's dead.

1286
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:52,157
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into
the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1287
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,660
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1288
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:57,495
and I want to know why.

1289
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,878
You coming with me or not?

1290
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:09,132
You want to do what?

1291
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:10,675
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1292
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,552
the <i>Enterprise</i>
into position as we speak.

1293
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:14,095
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1294
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:16,723
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1295
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:18,892
You need to find
the manual override to open that airlock.

1296
01:24:18,975 --> 01:24:21,895
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1297
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,855
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1298
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:25,398
It is not gonna be all right.

1299
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,275
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1300
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,236
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1301
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:31,946
Lieutenant,
from our current position, is it possible

1302
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,990
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1303
01:24:34,657 --> 01:24:37,160
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

1304
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,247
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1305
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,916
Their systems are still offline.

1306
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,834
I'm aligning our ship now.

1307
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:20,453
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1308
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,956
<i>Captain, I wish I had better news.</i>

1309
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,709
<i>They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.</i>

1310
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,377
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1311
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:28,962
three minutes.

1312
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:30,630
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them

1313
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:32,549
destroying the <i>Enterprise.</i> Stand by.

1314
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,301
Commander, our trash exhaust
is aimed at

1315
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,637
access port 101A of the other ship.

1316
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:39,472
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1317
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:40,598
Copy that.

1318
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,768
- Scotty!
- I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1319
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:50,400
I'm running. Stand by.

1320
01:26:00,243 --> 01:26:01,745
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.

1321
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:04,748
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1322
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:06,958
It's four square meters, tops.

1323
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,044
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1324
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:11,046
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1325
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:13,006
It's okay. I've done it before.

1326
01:26:14,924 --> 01:26:16,009
Yeah, it was vertical.

1327
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:19,012
We jumped onto a... It was a...

1328
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:20,305
It doesn't matter. Scotty...

1329
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,556
Did you find the manual override?

1330
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:22,932
The manual override, Scotty.

1331
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,851
Not yet, not yet.

1332
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:33,109
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1333
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,986
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1334
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:37,781
- Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
- It's not easy!

1335
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:40,617
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1336
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:51,127
Tell me this is gonna work.

1337
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,380
I have neither
the information

1338
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:55,298
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1339
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,800
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1340
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:58,551
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1341
01:26:59,969 --> 01:27:01,971
Come on, come on, come on.

1342
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:03,139
Yes!

1343
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:04,849
<i>Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door.</i>

1344
01:27:04,891 --> 01:27:06,059
You ready?

1345
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,560
Are you?

1346
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:12,148
Spock, pull the trigger.

1347
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,401
Yes, Captain.

1348
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:21,825
Launching activation sequence on

1349
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,410
<i>three,</i>

1350
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:24,703
<i>two,</i>

1351
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:26,413
<i>one.</i>

1352
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:39,259
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!

1353
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:41,344
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1354
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:42,429
Copy that.

1355
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,851
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!

1356
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:49,102
I know, I know! I can see that.

1357
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:01,239
Don't move.

1358
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:05,035
Use your display compass, Captain.

1359
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,161
You must correct precisely

1360
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:08,329
- 37.243 degrees.<i>
- Got it.</i>

1361
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:09,622
I'm working my way back.

1362
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,336
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1363
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:17,005
What are you doing in here?

1364
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:21,134
Wee bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1365
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:22,594
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1366
01:28:22,635 --> 01:28:24,012
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1367
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,014
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1368
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,560
- Damn it.<i>
- Captain, what is it?</i>

1369
01:28:30,643 --> 01:28:31,644
My helmet was hit.

1370
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:33,313
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1371
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:34,898
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1372
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,524
<i>His communicator is working.</i>

1373
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:38,693
<i>- I don't know why he isn't responding.</i>
- What is that?

1374
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,320
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1375
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,404
Show me your other hand.

1376
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:42,572
Because you look like private security.

1377
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:44,115
Imminent collision detected!

1378
01:28:44,282 --> 01:28:45,325
Khan, use evasive action!

1379
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,452
- There is debris directly ahead.
- I see it.

1380
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:55,710
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1381
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:58,213
I don't know, Commander. I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1382
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:00,340
Was Khan hit?

1383
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:01,675
We are trying to find him now.

1384
01:29:02,008 --> 01:29:03,635
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1385
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:06,012
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1386
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,442
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1387
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:21,695
Captain, without your display compass,

1388
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:23,613
hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1389
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:25,156
Spock, if I get back,

1390
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:26,950
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1391
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,202
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1392
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,376
My display is still functioning.

1393
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:38,128
I see you, Kirk,
you're 200 meters ahead of me

1394
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,421
at my one o'clock.

1395
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:41,548
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1396
01:29:54,185 --> 01:29:55,562
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1397
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,189
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1398
01:29:58,231 --> 01:29:59,566
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1399
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:01,443
- open the door in ten, nine...
- Scotty!

1400
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:02,569
That person counting down,

1401
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,611
- what is that?<i>
- ...eight...</i>

1402
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:04,779
I think you're hearing things, mate.

1403
01:30:04,904 --> 01:30:06,740
- ...seven...
- Mr. Scott, where are you?

1404
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,868
- ...six, five...
- 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1405
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:11,327
- Scotty, where are you?
- ...three...

1406
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,246
- Do you copy, Scotty? Please!<i>
- ...two...</i>

1407
01:30:13,371 --> 01:30:14,497
- Sorry about this.
- About what?

1408
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:15,832
- Mr. Scott, open the door!
- Open the door!

1409
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:17,542
<i>Mr. Scott, now!</i>

1410
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,398
Welcome aboard.

1411
01:30:42,108 --> 01:30:44,319
- It's good to see you, Scotty.
- Who is that?

1412
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,448
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1413
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:49,866
Hello.

1414
01:30:50,617 --> 01:30:51,993
They'll know we're here.

1415
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,037
I know the best way to the bridge.

1416
01:30:57,874 --> 01:30:59,542
It's locked to stun.

1417
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,127
Theirs won't be.

1418
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:03,046
Try not to get shot.

1419
01:31:06,132 --> 01:31:08,968
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1420
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:10,970
On screen, please.

1421
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:12,472
Stand by.

1422
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:19,979
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1423
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:22,816
Mr. Spock.

1424
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,571
Admiral.

1425
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,659
I'll deal with you in a...

1426
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,664
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1427
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:44,254
Sir, we just had
a hangar door open on deck 13.

1428
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:46,840
Khan.

1429
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:49,342
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1430
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:50,593
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1431
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:52,095
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1432
01:31:52,178 --> 01:31:54,431
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1433
01:31:54,514 --> 01:31:56,182
They know they
won't be able to use their weapons here

1434
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:57,517
without destabilizing the warp core,

1435
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,019
which gives us the advantage.

1436
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:01,855
- Where'd you find this guy?
- It's a long story.

1437
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:03,189
<i>I will be brief.</i>

1438
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:07,527
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1439
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:13,199
<i>As you know,</i>

1440
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,618
<i>I have made a vow
never to give you information</i>

1441
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:18,621
<i>that could potentially alter your destiny.</i>

1442
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:24,210
<i>Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.</i>

1443
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:29,883
<i>That being said,</i>

1444
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:35,221
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary</i>

1445
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:37,557
<i>the</i> Enterprise <i>ever faced.</i>

1446
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:41,102
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1447
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:43,855
<i>and he will not hesitate to kill</i>

1448
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,857
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1449
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:51,404
Did you defeat him?

1450
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:55,575
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1451
01:32:57,577 --> 01:32:58,578
How?

1452
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:00,747
I don't mean to tempt fate here,
but where is everybody?

1453
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,540
The ship is designed
to be flown by minimal crew,

1454
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:03,667
one, if necessary.

1455
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,001
One? I...

1456
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:28,608
- You all right?
- Yeah. Where's Khan?

1457
01:33:34,114 --> 01:33:36,449
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1458
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:38,076
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1459
01:33:38,868 --> 01:33:40,036
All right.

1460
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:44,708
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1461
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:46,042
Could you replicate the process?

1462
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:47,544
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1463
01:33:47,627 --> 01:33:49,045
Can you or can you not?

1464
01:33:49,129 --> 01:33:51,965
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1465
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:53,299
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1466
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:54,968
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1467
01:33:56,469 --> 01:33:57,804
Where is he?

1468
01:34:03,309 --> 01:34:04,644
Shit!

1469
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:06,938
This way.

1470
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,735
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1471
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:15,280
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1472
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:17,198
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1473
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:27,751
Power coming online, sir!

1474
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:30,003
- Retarget the <i>Enterprise</i> now.
- Aye, sir.

1475
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:45,685
Make sure he stays down.

1476
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,104
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1477
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:54,277
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1478
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:56,112
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1479
01:34:57,781 --> 01:35:00,033
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1480
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,702
You better stop
and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1481
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,871
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1482
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,582
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1483
01:35:07,957 --> 01:35:09,876
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1484
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,213
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1485
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:16,800
And who is going to lead us? You?

1486
01:35:17,133 --> 01:35:18,677
If I'm not in charge,

1487
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,471
our entire way of life is decimated!

1488
01:35:22,138 --> 01:35:24,641
So you want me off this ship,

1489
01:35:24,974 --> 01:35:27,310
you better kill me.

1490
01:35:27,477 --> 01:35:29,229
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1491
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:34,067
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of that chair.

1492
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:36,986
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1493
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,742
- You all right?
- Yes, Captain.

1494
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:46,329
Jim!

1495
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:01,344
Listen! Wait!

1496
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,107
You...

1497
01:36:14,607 --> 01:36:17,986
You should have let me sleep.

1498
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:24,284
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1499
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:26,953
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1500
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:30,749
<i>I'm going to make this
very simple for you.</i>

1501
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:33,460
- Captain.<i>
- Your crew for my crew.</i>

1502
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:34,794
You betrayed us.

1503
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:37,088
<i>You are smart, Mr. Spock.</i>

1504
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,548
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1505
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:44,137
<i>Mr. Spock, give me my crew.</i>

1506
01:36:44,971 --> 01:36:46,556
And what will you do
when you get them?

1507
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:49,142
<i>Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.</i>

1508
01:36:49,267 --> 01:36:51,061
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1509
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:54,147
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1510
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:56,316
<i>Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?</i>

1511
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:59,319
<i>Or will you give me what I want?</i>

1512
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:03,740
We have no transporter capabilities.

1513
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:05,784
<i>Fortunately mine are
perfectly functional.</i>

1514
01:37:05,909 --> 01:37:08,078
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1515
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:10,121
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1516
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:11,915
that you will not destroy the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1517
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:14,501
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1518
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:16,294
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1519
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:18,004
to demonstrate my resolve.

1520
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:20,965
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1521
01:37:21,007 --> 01:37:23,551
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1522
01:37:23,718 --> 01:37:25,387
If you destroy our ship,

1523
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,472
you will also destroy your own people.

1524
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:30,475
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1525
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:32,185
I will target your life support systems

1526
01:37:32,268 --> 01:37:34,437
located behind the aft nacelle.

1527
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:37,857
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1528
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:42,487
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1529
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:46,449
Now,

1530
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,202
shall we begin?

1531
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:54,541
Lower shields.

1532
01:37:58,461 --> 01:38:00,422
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1533
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:11,141
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1534
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,893
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1535
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,312
Vulcans do not lie.

1536
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:19,399
The torpedoes are yours.

1537
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:31,870
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1538
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:34,372
I have fulfilled your terms.

1539
01:38:34,873 --> 01:38:36,249
Now fulfill mine.

1540
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:39,252
Well, Kirk,

1541
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:41,629
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1542
01:38:42,422 --> 01:38:44,049
After all,

1543
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:50,180
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1544
01:38:52,807 --> 01:38:54,267
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1545
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:01,608
Let us out of here now!

1546
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:12,452
Shields at 6 %!

1547
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,621
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1548
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:15,747
Twelve seconds, sir!

1549
01:39:15,872 --> 01:39:16,956
Crew of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

1550
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:18,458
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1551
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:20,752
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1552
01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:22,921
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!

1553
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:34,140
No!

1554
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:42,649
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1555
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:46,194
- Not bad, Commander.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

1556
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:48,488
- Bones!
- Bones!

1557
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,657
- Nurse!
- I got you. I got you.

1558
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,867
Dr. Marcus.

1559
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:55,537
Good to see you, Jim.

1560
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,205
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1561
01:39:57,288 --> 01:39:58,331
Damn right I did.

1562
01:39:58,373 --> 01:39:59,874
He killed Khan's crew!

1563
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:01,543
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1564
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,004
I've got Khan's crew.

1565
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,297
Seventy-two human popsicles

1566
01:40:06,506 --> 01:40:09,009
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1567
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:10,927
Son of a bitch!

1568
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:18,518
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1569
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:21,855
- Switch to auxiliary power.
- Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1570
01:40:29,487 --> 01:40:31,364
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1571
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,825
- Can we stop?
- I can't do anything.

1572
01:40:43,084 --> 01:40:44,836
Sorry! Oh, no.

1573
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:46,212
Clear the area!

1574
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:49,883
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1575
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:51,885
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1576
01:40:52,093 --> 01:40:53,636
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1577
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:54,721
Aye, sir.

1578
01:40:55,889 --> 01:40:59,559
As acting Captain,
I order you to abandon this ship.

1579
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:02,771
I will remain behind and divert all power

1580
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:04,314
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1581
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:06,066
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1582
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,693
I order you to abandon the ship!

1583
01:41:08,818 --> 01:41:11,905
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1584
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:19,079
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1585
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:25,335
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1586
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:30,674
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1587
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,258
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1588
01:41:33,426 --> 01:41:36,179
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1589
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:37,639
There won't be time for evacuation

1590
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:40,934
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1591
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:43,603
- Can we restore it?
- Only from engineering.

1592
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,272
We have to get back to the warp core.

1593
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:50,443
Jim?

1594
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:53,780
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1595
01:42:11,589 --> 01:42:12,924
- Scotty, we got to jump!
- What?

1596
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:14,426
Jump! Jump!

1597
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:16,219
Oh, God.

1598
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:19,431
Emergency power at 15 % and dropping.

1599
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:20,932
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1600
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:23,476
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1601
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,063
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1602
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:41,119
- Jim?
- Hold on!

1603
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:42,662
I can't.

1604
01:43:01,222 --> 01:43:02,724
I've got you, Captain!

1605
01:43:02,891 --> 01:43:04,559
- Chekov.
- Don't let go!

1606
01:43:15,695 --> 01:43:18,406
Even if we get the warp core online,
we've still got to redirect the power!

1607
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:20,116
- He's right, Captain!
- What are you talking about?

1608
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,285
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1609
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:23,578
Laddie, there's a switch...

1610
01:43:23,661 --> 01:43:25,955
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1611
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:27,415
Let's go!

1612
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:31,378
Oh, no.

1613
01:43:42,722 --> 01:43:45,517
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1614
01:43:45,558 --> 01:43:48,269
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1615
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:52,065
Mr. Sulu, divert
any remaining power to stabilizers.

1616
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:53,942
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1617
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:13,336
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1618
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,088
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- What?

1619
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,423
The housings are misaligned!

1620
01:44:16,506 --> 01:44:18,425
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1621
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:21,511
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1622
01:44:22,929 --> 01:44:24,848
- No, she's not.
- Wait, Jim!

1623
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,475
If we go in there, we'll die!

1624
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,602
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1625
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:32,105
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1626
01:44:32,188 --> 01:44:33,356
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1627
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,650
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1628
01:44:35,734 --> 01:44:38,028
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1629
01:44:40,447 --> 01:44:41,740
You're not making the climb.

1630
01:44:42,949 --> 01:44:45,660
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1631
01:44:45,744 --> 01:44:48,538
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1632
01:45:47,681 --> 01:45:49,641
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1633
01:45:49,724 --> 01:45:52,352
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1634
01:46:59,085 --> 01:47:00,170
Warp core is back online!

1635
01:47:00,378 --> 01:47:01,880
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1636
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,429
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1637
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:38,917
- Shields restored!
- Commander, power online.

1638
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:41,211
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1639
01:47:41,544 --> 01:47:43,380
It's a miracle.

1640
01:47:45,131 --> 01:47:47,133
There are no such things.

1641
01:47:49,552 --> 01:47:50,970
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1642
01:47:51,054 --> 01:47:52,305
<i>- Mr. Spock!</i>
- Mr. Scott.

1643
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:55,308
<i>Sir, you'd better get down here.</i>

1644
01:47:55,392 --> 01:47:56,726
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1645
01:48:19,416 --> 01:48:20,500
Open it.

1646
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,377
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1647
01:48:22,502 --> 01:48:23,628
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1648
01:48:23,753 --> 01:48:25,797
The door's locked, sir.

1649
01:48:55,285 --> 01:48:56,369
How's our ship?

1650
01:48:58,121 --> 01:48:59,622
Out of danger.

1651
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:04,377
You saved the crew.

1652
01:49:05,795 --> 01:49:08,631
You used what he wanted against him.

1653
01:49:12,635 --> 01:49:14,429
That's a nice move.

1654
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:18,141
It is what you would have done.

1655
01:49:19,893 --> 01:49:21,144
And this,

1656
01:49:22,812 --> 01:49:24,814
this is what you would have done.

1657
01:49:25,148 --> 01:49:27,317
It was only logical.

1658
01:49:33,656 --> 01:49:35,367
I'm scared, Spock.

1659
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:40,830
Help me not be.

1660
01:49:45,251 --> 01:49:47,587
How do you choose not to feel?

1661
01:49:54,344 --> 01:49:56,012
I do not know.

1662
01:49:58,682 --> 01:50:00,767
Right now I am failing.

1663
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,527
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1664
01:50:14,698 --> 01:50:16,449
Why I went back for you.

1665
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,787
Because you are my friend.

1666
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:47,207
Khan!

1667
01:51:49,793 --> 01:51:51,127
God, that was close!

1668
01:51:54,464 --> 01:51:58,677
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1669
01:51:58,843 --> 01:52:00,095
<i>Engines compromised.</i>

1670
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:02,222
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1671
01:52:02,305 --> 01:52:03,723
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1672
01:52:04,057 --> 01:52:05,308
Confirm.

1673
01:53:09,706 --> 01:53:11,958
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1674
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:14,127
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1675
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:16,546
He could.

1676
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:18,381
Yes, sir.

1677
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,748
Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters!

1678
01:53:51,915 --> 01:53:53,083
Can we beam him up?

1679
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:54,167
There's too much damage.

1680
01:53:54,292 --> 01:53:55,669
I have no incoming signal.

1681
01:53:55,835 --> 01:53:58,672
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1682
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,382
Go get him.

1683
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:08,098
- Stand by for coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1684
01:54:08,431 --> 01:54:10,934
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1685
01:54:11,059 --> 01:54:12,852
Coordinates confirmed.

1686
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:52,786
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1687
01:56:48,591 --> 01:56:50,176
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1688
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,594
Keep him in an induced coma.

1689
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:53,138
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1690
01:56:53,179 --> 01:56:54,931
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1691
01:56:55,015 --> 01:56:56,850
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1692
01:56:56,933 --> 01:56:57,934
None.

1693
01:56:58,852 --> 01:57:01,855
<i>Enterprise</i> to Spock. Spock!

1694
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:04,918
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1695
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,421
McCoy to bridge.

1696
01:58:09,047 --> 01:58:11,466
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1697
01:58:11,549 --> 01:58:14,719
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1698
01:58:15,595 --> 01:58:17,180
I think he can save Kirk.

1699
01:58:17,305 --> 01:58:18,556
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1700
01:58:18,598 --> 01:58:21,059
They keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1701
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:22,435
Can you beam someone down?

1702
01:58:57,387 --> 01:58:58,430
Spock!

1703
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:06,980
Spock!

1704
01:59:07,272 --> 01:59:09,107
Spock, stop! Stop!

1705
01:59:09,691 --> 01:59:11,901
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1706
01:59:21,661 --> 01:59:23,997
<i>- What is it?
- It's a boy.</i>

1707
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,331
<i>Let's call him Jim.</i>

1708
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:27,751
<i>Your father was
captain of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1709
01:59:27,834 --> 01:59:31,713
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

1710
01:59:40,889 --> 01:59:43,892
Don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1711
01:59:44,017 --> 01:59:46,561
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1712
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:47,771
You were out cold for two weeks.

1713
01:59:47,854 --> 01:59:48,855
Transfusion?

1714
01:59:48,938 --> 01:59:51,691
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1715
01:59:52,442 --> 01:59:53,693
Khan?

1716
01:59:53,777 --> 01:59:54,944
Once we caught him,

1717
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:57,697
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1718
01:59:57,781 --> 02:00:00,367
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1719
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:01,993
Power mad? Despotic?

1720
02:00:02,202 --> 02:00:03,870
No more than usual.

1721
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:05,455
How'd you catch him?

1722
02:00:05,872 --> 02:00:07,207
I didn't.

1723
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:17,634
You saved my life.

1724
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:20,345
Uhura and I had
something to do with it, too, you know.

1725
02:00:21,888 --> 02:00:24,182
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1726
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:25,975
Spock, just...

1727
02:00:27,686 --> 02:00:29,020
Thank you.

1728
02:00:30,355 --> 02:00:32,524
You are welcome, Jim.

1729
02:00:43,326 --> 02:00:46,746
<i>There will always be
those who mean to do us harm.</i>

1730
02:00:48,665 --> 02:00:50,083
<i>To stop them,</i>

1731
02:00:50,667 --> 02:00:54,587
<i>we risk awakening
the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1732
02:01:00,593 --> 02:01:03,179
<i>Our first instinct is to seek revenge</i>

1733
02:01:03,263 --> 02:01:05,598
<i>when those we love are taken from us.</i>

1734
02:01:08,643 --> 02:01:10,437
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1735
02:01:11,938 --> 02:01:13,606
<i>We are here today</i>

1736
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:16,609
<i>to rechristen the</i> U.S.S. Enterprise,

1737
02:01:16,735 --> 02:01:19,571
<i>and to honor those who lost their lives</i>

1738
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:22,198
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1739
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:24,868
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1740
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:27,370
<i>he had me recite the Captain's Oath,</i>

1741
02:01:28,288 --> 02:01:31,124
<i>words I didn't appreciate at the time.</i>

1742
02:01:31,791 --> 02:01:34,794
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1743
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:37,464
<i>who we once were,</i>

1744
02:01:39,382 --> 02:01:41,801
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1745
02:01:43,053 --> 02:01:44,554
<i>And those words?</i>

1746
02:01:45,221 --> 02:01:48,308
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1747
02:01:48,725 --> 02:01:52,479
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship</i> Enterprise.

1748
02:01:53,313 --> 02:01:55,148
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1749
02:01:55,231 --> 02:01:57,150
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1750
02:01:57,817 --> 02:02:01,321
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1751
02:02:01,988 --> 02:02:05,742
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1752
02:02:08,745 --> 02:02:10,663
Captain on the bridge.

1753
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:16,127
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1754
02:02:16,169 --> 02:02:17,671
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1755
02:02:17,754 --> 02:02:20,090
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.

1756
02:02:20,173 --> 02:02:21,591
Chair's all yours, sir.

1757
02:02:23,426 --> 02:02:24,928
Mr. Scott.

1758
02:02:25,095 --> 02:02:26,096
<i>How's our core?</i>

1759
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:27,806
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1760
02:02:27,847 --> 02:02:30,183
She's ready for a long journey.

1761
02:02:30,225 --> 02:02:31,393
<i>Excellent.</i>

1762
02:02:31,518 --> 02:02:34,020
Come on, Bones! It's gonna be fun.

1763
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:38,525
Five years in space. God help me.

1764
02:02:38,817 --> 02:02:40,193
Dr. Marcus.

1765
02:02:41,611 --> 02:02:43,446
I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1766
02:02:43,905 --> 02:02:45,699
It's nice to have a family.

1767
02:02:48,034 --> 02:02:49,202
Spock.

1768
02:02:49,369 --> 02:02:50,537
Captain.

1769
02:02:53,456 --> 02:02:54,958
Where shall we go?

1770
02:02:56,292 --> 02:02:59,462
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1771
02:03:01,464 --> 02:03:03,967
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.

1772
02:03:12,976 --> 02:03:15,562
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1773
