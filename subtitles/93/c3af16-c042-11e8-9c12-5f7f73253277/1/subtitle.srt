1
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,336
I promise you I'll never see her again.

2
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,234
Don't go.

3
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,302
Trust me.

4
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,434
Say no more, let's get a divorce.

5
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,547
Mom.

6
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,685
Did I do anything wrong?

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,100
I have never seen dad again ever since.

8
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,439
I then asked mom
why she parted with father.

9
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,613
Mom says I might love someone
at the beginning...

10
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,716
but then I would soon
get tired of that person.

11
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,514
She says I will understand this
when I grow up.

12
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,455
Mom, will you get tired of me in future?

13
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,821
Of course not,
I'll give you the best care.

14
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,396
No matter how tired mom is...

15
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,300
...she teaches me how to play
Bach and Beethoven every night.

16
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,734
But what I want to sing the songs
by Danny Chan and Leslie Cheung.

17
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,047
Mom won't get married again
just for my good sake.

18
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,052
I know she really loves
and pampers me as well.

19
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,312
Therefore I can never stand against her,
though I sometimes disagree with her.

20
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,826
I always ask myself.

21
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,828
If I fall in love with someone,

22
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,757
...I wonder if I can treat him
like the way my mom treats me.

23
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,094
...Will I love him
no matter what happens.

24
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,235
Hong, Mimi speaking!

25
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,219
Please cut your hair short.

26
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,590
Please leave your hair long.

27
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,353
It's not easy to keep hair long.

28
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,521
Sir, what would you like?

29
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,792
One order spaghetti...

30
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,500
Come back...

31
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,430
Angie, I haven't seen you all day.

32
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,873
Haven't you?

33
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,944
I've reserved seats for you.

34
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:54,945
I have already turned down many people
who asked for this table.

35
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,494
Didn't you say
you loved that Bossini watch very much?

36
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,323
Bossini?

37
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,456
It's a Bulgari!

38
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,932
More or less the same, man.

39
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,660
Yeah, more or less,
just a difference of $18,600.

40
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,672
What if I send it to you as a present
when I have enough money?

41
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,946
You can surely make it,
I have confidence.

42
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,279
Get some food for us.
Thanks...

43
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,314
Stupid!

44
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,687
Don't be this way, you'll hurt him.

45
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,889
Hey, tell me about yours first.

46
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,824
What is he like?

47
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:41,761
He is tall, slim, big eyes, high nose...

48
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,400
Then he looks like you.

49
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,868
Yeah, as good-looking like you.

50
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,637
Not as good-looking as you,
but a fatty loves you very much.

51
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,344
Not necessarily,
I've read a psychological book.

52
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,539
People will find themselves
better-looking as time goes by,

53
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:02,118
and soon they'll find a lover that
resembles themselves, this is called...

54
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,616
Narcissism.

55
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,681
No, just the perfect couple.

56
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,623
Watch out!

57
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:13,422
Hot... Kid... Mini... Sundae.

58
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,028
What do you mean?

59
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,725
We're "Kid Mini Sundae",
she's also "Kid Mini Sundae",

60
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,531
why are you so biased?

61
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,937
About the same no difference, man.

62
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,801
What? Man, get me another one.

63
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,936
Hey, you want to stir up trouble here?

64
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,135
What if I do?

65
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,805
Stop fooling or I'll kick you out!

66
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,125
Shit!

67
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,353
Sorry...

68
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,057
Go pick up the ball!

69
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,605
Dad, are you OK?

70
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,844
We'd better call for an ambulance,
Uncle Wing.

71
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,177
What's wrong? Serve now!

72
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,189
This way, come on.

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,417
Go, go...

74
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,733
Yes! Yeah!

75
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,187
Why is it under-cooked?

76
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,664
Not even any vegetable?

77
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,132
They're in the refrigerator,
not yet washed.

78
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,858
Why don't you wash them now?

79
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,164
What? I'm your guest anyway.

80
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,515
Brother, I must tell you something,
don't tell father.

81
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,012
You're pregnant?

82
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,246
Of course not, I never will be.

83
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,885
Why?

84
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,820
I am Les.

85
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,918
What Les?

86
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,995
I am Lesbian,
I'm interested in girls only.

87
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,462
Why?

88
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,799
When I visit the bathroom,
I have the urge to peep at other girls.

89
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,029
Do you find me abnormal?

90
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,002
There's nothing wrong to be homosexual,

91
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,873
but it's bad to be a horny lesbian.

92
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,708
Am I abnormal then?

93
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,875
You're normal.

94
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,508
Anyway, you're not in love with cats,
dogs or this vegetable.

95
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,247
Even if you fall in love with them, that
doesn't mean you're abnormal, right?

96
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,080
Many people are like this too.

97
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,850
Let me tell you, your brother and I...

98
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,953
Nuts!

99
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,688
What shall I do if others laugh at me?

100
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,560
Hit them!

101
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,134
Even if others laugh at you,
you can tell them sincerely...

102
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,201
- I'm homosexual.
- I'm homosexual.

103
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,499
What can they do to you?

104
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,871
They can't do nothing to you, right?

105
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,238
What's "gay"?
Are both talking about homosexual?

106
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,876
Eat!

107
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,606
Have you seen any meteors?

108
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,910
I did borrow two porn
video cassettes from you...

109
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,243
I was going to take them back,
but I dropped it into the ditch.

110
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,319
Can you get me something
so that I can pick them up?

111
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,223
Don't tell me you're trying hard...

112
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,554
...to get a degree or a master degree.

113
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,963
Anyone can tell
you've given up studying.

114
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,865
What do you mean? You're nuts!

115
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,037
Don't you have lust?

116
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,772
Nuts!

117
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,345
I mean seduce girls.

118
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,945
Dad, it's not that simple
to seduce girls.

119
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,978
I remember being a kid of 19 years old,

120
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,144
I had seven girlfriends
at the same time, I'd court even a sow.

121
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,915
What? You had seven snows
at the same time? Blind sows?

122
00:10:59,025 --> 00:10:59,923
You're strong!

123
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,081
You bastard!

124
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,557
OK... I'll seduce one tomorrow.

125
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,790
Let's cross fingers.

126
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,865
Nuts! I can't just go seducing,
not before I find someone I love.

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,164
I'll ask Fatty Lan
to play mahjong tomorrow.

128
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,568
You can get to know each other then...

129
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,768
Nuts.
We've serious work tomorrow, to earn money.

130
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,637
OK?

131
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,176
Where can you make money?
Being a gigolo?

132
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,313
Being a slave,
a school is holding a show.

133
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,678
He and I will help with
moving and transporting.

134
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,213
How much can you make?

135
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,143
$70 an hour.

136
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,989
Why do you go to school then?

137
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,873
I can't hold on anymore.

138
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,879
Can't hold on... anymore...

139
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,922
This must be hurried...
help me massage a bit.

140
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,688
Start work now, don't play on.

141
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,418
Start work.

142
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,792
Watch the cart carefully.

143
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,026
Shrimp Dumpling, Pork Dumpling.

144
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,665
Rice Rolls.

145
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,128
What?

146
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,430
Man, sorry... excuse me...

147
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,732
Excuse me...

148
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,843
Watch out where are you going next time?

149
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,137
What is you say? What is you come from?

150
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,371
Don't you watch where you're going?

151
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,211
How to say "challenge" in English?

152
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,217
"Heat"

153
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,910
Heat!

154
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,213
Stop that "heat", come on.

155
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,393
Excuse me.

156
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,221
BBQ Pork Buns.

157
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,432
Rice Rolls.

158
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,396
Shrimp Dumpling, Pork Dumpling.

159
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,430
Which one?

160
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,665
I say this one.

161
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,233
You say this one, and that one,
which one exactly?

162
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,843
I say this one.
We can make close-up with this one.

163
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,848
Excuse me.

164
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,453
What are you talking about?
Disguise as foreign singers?

165
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,259
You move the things to back stairs now.

166
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
Why point with your fingers?

167
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,031
- What do you mean?
- What?

168
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,431
What...

169
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,438
- What?
- What are you doing?

170
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,066
- What?
- What are you looking at?

171
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:32,975
- Looking at me?
- What?

172
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,375
- What?
- What?... What?

173
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,809
What?

174
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,180
- What?
- What?

175
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,409
- What?
- What?

176
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,280
- What?
- What?

177
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,721
Nothing, those bastards threaten me
as they fail in the reasoning.

178
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,823
What do you want then?

179
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,981
- What?
- What?

180
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,526
- What
- You What?

181
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,123
What?

182
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,858
What do you want now?

183
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,058
How come I know?

184
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,324
- What?
- What?

185
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,525
Forget it... OK? We're sorry, OK?
Let's go.

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,898
Go?

187
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,406
Why shout on? Do you know who they are?

188
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,272
What did you say?

189
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,737
What?

190
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,301
- What did you say?
- What?

191
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,069
What?

192
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,874
Have you finished shouting?
Why don't you work up there?

193
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,881
Go working now.

194
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,984
Mind your steps, I tell you.

195
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,489
Do you see me now?

196
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,219
Mind your steps.

197
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,158
Man, excuse me.

198
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,961
Just never mind me...

199
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,082
Have you eaten yet?

200
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,285
Can't you answer me?

201
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,393
Yeah!

202
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,554
- Hey, you're smart.
- Yeah!

203
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,322
I'll donate $500,000.

204
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,594
How much will you?

205
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,368
$1,000.

206
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,094
Hong, come up here, set one more
microphone next to the piano.

207
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,257
Coming.

208
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,255
OK.

209
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,426
Thanks.

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,894
Thanks.

211
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,452
Hey, you want someone?

212
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:20,429
Is the guy who set up the microphone
the David you met in MTR?

213
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,063
None of your business.

214
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,433
But I saw him being scolded furiously.

215
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,297
He's as poor as a dog, didn't you see?

216
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,239
You won't fall in love
with such a green-horn, will you?

217
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,373
You guess.

218
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,349
Excuse me, have you got facial paper?

219
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,518
Oh... no.

220
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,295
Thanks.

221
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,300
You're welcome.

222
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,292
I... I've seen you.

223
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,728
Have you?

224
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,171
You were wearing school uniform.

225
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,808
Go away...

226
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,207
Why are you so ugly?

227
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,680
Wooing girls? I'm leaving.

228
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,450
Bye.

229
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,560
What is it?

230
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,729
Will you come to the show tonight?

231
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,327
I don't have a ticket.

232
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,526
Hey, I have an extra ticket with me.

233
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,069
Take it if you want to see.

234
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,670
Don't waste it.

235
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,806
Bye-bye.

236
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,374
Don't forget me if you make a fortune.

237
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,646
What do you mean by this?

238
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,153
I mean if you become rich.

239
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,318
Nuts! How come I become rich?

240
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,619
About the tall girl with big eyes
whom you just met.

241
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,856
I saw her wallet
with many gold credit cards inside.

242
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,531
What credit card have you got?

243
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,226
You don't even have a single card.

244
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,426
Do I?

245
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,096
I think you can become a pimp.

246
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,708
What are you saying about?

247
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,737
You're aged, behave yourself.

248
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,708
No handicap.

249
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,181
You mean you want me to suffer?

250
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,855
Sorry, I said it wrong.

251
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,959
Go seduce her again,
take more with you...

252
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,958
I'll pay... let me pay...

253
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,926
I'll pay!

254
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,696
You're chicken-hearted?

255
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,630
You're chicken.

256
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,632
It's good you've got guts.

257
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,900
We're two of a kind indeed.

258
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,704
What? Just like a prince and princess?

259
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,276
One of the prettiest princess.

260
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,578
One of the poorest prince.

261
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,844
The two are the perfect couple.

262
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,222
Shit! Take your hands off me.

263
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,819
Cut your dirty finger nails first.

264
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,896
Then you can seduce girls, come on.

265
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,497
What?

266
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,660
Come on, let's play games.

267
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,375
Good-bye everyone, I'm leaving.

268
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,081
You're leaving, Tap?

269
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,947
It's late, you're not leaving?

270
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,125
No, I've booked a table, come with me?

271
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,788
Sorry, Chris, mother is waiting for me.

272
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,057
I've taken some photos for you,
keep them.

273
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,359
Thank you.

274
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,668
I'll leave now, good-bye.

275
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,969
Quick, catch up with her,
don't wait for me.

276
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,342
Girl... go chase your girl!

277
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,627
You have no luck at all.

278
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,142
Brother, your call.

279
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:44,843
Who is it?

280
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,541
A girl.

281
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,378
A girl?

282
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,382
Hello?

283
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,121
This is IRG surveying company.

284
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,386
How much time do you spend daily
in the bathroom?

285
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,432
How do I know?
Do you keep track of the time yourself?

286
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,501
I've an incoming call, got to hang up.

287
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,768
Hello?

288
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,656

00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,219
I've found that guy.

290
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,624
Which guy?

291
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,831
The one who set up the microphone.

292
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,933
Yes!

293
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,003
But, what did you just say? Which topic?

294
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,902
Nothing, heard his voice,
felt scared and just hung up.

295
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,732
Did you?

296
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,243
OK, let me call him up for you.

297
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,037
I'll ask him to call you up,
then you can talk on.

298
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,113
Really? Thanks.

299
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,808
What's his number?

300
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,718
Hello?

301
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,222

303
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,857
I met you at school last time...

304
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,531
I'm the friend of the girl who made your
saliva water and your eyes pop open.

305
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,125
Do you want to call up that girl?

306
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,834
Yes, I do...

307
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,838

311
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,018

313
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,299
I am...
the one who asked you for the tissue...

314
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,105
Do you remember me?

315
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,274
Yes, I do.

316
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,276
Your friend gave me your phone number.

317
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,780
How did you get my phone number?

318
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:04,085
I've a friend
who works at the audio company.

319
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,018
Tap...

320
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,586
Will, why are you called Tap?

321
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:17,763
My name is Stephenie,
my classmates nicknamed me Tap.

322
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,201
So now everyone calls me Tap.

323
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,340
Which school did you attend?

324
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,271
And you?

325
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,046
I'm a F.7 student in St. Marynold.

326
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,248
A famous school.

327
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,678
What about you?

328
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,619
I'm also a F.7 student.

329
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,948
Which school?

330
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,350
La Salle.

331
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:44,153
OK... why don't we exchange
our school prospectus?

332
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,159
Sure, how?

333
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,096
You decide.

334
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,661
Let's meet this Sunday afternoon.

335
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,363
OK, it's a deal, bye.

336
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,642
- Hello?

337
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,151
Where shall we meet then?

338
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,051
Your choice?

339
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,654
Someone going to commit suicide!

340
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,129
Who? Where?...

341
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,061
Isn't it suicide to have affairs
when you're broke?

342
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,197
Let me rescue you...

343
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,809

Damn it! What is it?

346
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,000
The more you can eat,
then more you'll win, start.

347
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,172
Hey, did you cheat?

348
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,279
You're disqualified, come with me!

349
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,481
What's going on?

350
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,056

359

00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,374
Someone has won!

361
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,883

362
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,022
Yeah!

363
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,729
Congratulations,

364
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,163
What? Say it again?

365
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,960
Are you alright? It's $7,000, not $700...

366
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,229
Are you alright?

367
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,370
Quick... take photos for him...
take photos...

368
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,030
What?
What?

369
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,903
- What?
- Quick...

370
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,304
What are you taking?
$20 for a snapshot.

371
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,944
Sir, may I help you?

372
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,247
I'll have...

373
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,746
This... "Never Loved Like This Before"

374
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,048
OK.

375
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,085
Add in some chocolate.

376
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,448
Sure.

377
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,549
No thanks, I'll just watch awhile.

378
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,094
Hi

379
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,769
Hi!

380
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,137
Hi

381
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,370
This is my friend Angie, this is Bell.

382
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,272
Hi

383
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,107
Much neater this time.

384
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,846
You look alike.

385
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,977
You're so tall.

386
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,552
Don't be like this.

387
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,551
Am I?

388
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,017
Why you're so shy?

389
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,955
You needn't be shy, we'll leave now.

390
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:41,121
Yeah, we just here to see
if you suit her.

391
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,423
I say... as a couple, it's a good match.

392
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,966
We know... what to do...

393
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,163
Let's go

394
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,401
They're always like this.

395
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,542
It's OK...

396
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,211
You're really very tall.

397
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,429
Miss, please.

398
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,965
Thanks.

399
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,970
I want this one, please.

400
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,134
"Never Loved Like This Before"

401
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,272
Sir.

402
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,243
I've brought my school
prospectus for you.

403
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,149
My school prospectus...
I've forgotten to bring mine.

404
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,058
I'll bring it the next time.

405
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,288
It's alright.

406
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,226
Composition champion, javelin champion.

407
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,263
Vice-Chairman of Music Group...

408
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,435
You're competent.

409
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:03,344
Not really, my classmates
played a joke and elect me.

410
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,307
What are you? Joining any activities?

411
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,281
Football Club.

412
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,355
Football Club? Football Team?

413
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,147
Yeah.

414
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,983
La Salle Football team?

415
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,155
Do you know Johnny and Stephen?

416
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,424
I... played football with them
only yesterday?

417
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,570
Didn't Johnny emigrate to the US?

418
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,907
Johnny?

419
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,244
Johnny Koo.

420
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,314
Not him, I mean Johnny Chan.

421
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,476
Right, Johnny Chan has gone to the US.

422
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,712
We keep in touch with each other.

423
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,101
Do you have time, later on?

424
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,231
...why don't we meet another day.

425
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,967
How about going to eat something.

426
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,205
Time's up... OK...

427
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,134
Can we go inside now?

428
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,764
The 7:00 p.m. show is full house,

429
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,966
but I've got tickets for 9:30 p.m. show.

430
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,703
What is it?

431
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,348
I promised mom
I'll be home before 9:00 p.m.

432
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,077
It's OK, let's see it next time.

433
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,747
Let's not waste the tickets,
wait for me.

434
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,750
Hello, is it Angie?

435
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,288
You've turned bad.

436
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,228
But luckily you've got me as friend.

437
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,165
OK, just count on me.

438
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,098
Hello? Aunt, Angie speaking.

439
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,432
Tap will be at my house tonight
for a project,

440
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,200
so she won't get home until 11:30 p.m.,

441
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,277
Ask her answer the phone.

442
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,775
Tap.

443
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,184
Kid, please show me your tickets.

444
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,161
You showed us to these seat.

445
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,359
Are we sitting in the wrong place?

446
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,798
No, but you've come too early.

447
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,133
Your tickets are tomorrow evening show,
not today.

448
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,871
Come again tomorrow.

449
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,846
Shouldn't we leave?

450
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,433
Hello?

451
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,670
Can't stand it anymore, lied about toilet
three times, bought snack four times.

452
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,677
I even lied that you had three baths.

453
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:02,310
If you don't go home, I afraid your mom
will call up the police.

454
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,753
Hello...

455
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,757
You're rushing home?

456
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,789
Let me see you home by taxi.

457
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,331
Let's take a bus.

458
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,266
Then we can spend more time together.

459
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,367
Bye-bye.

460
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,714
OK, let's count three, and then...

461
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,182
Let's part after saying good-bye.

462
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,920
One, two...

463
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,724
I must go home.

464
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:28,670
One.

465
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,631
Two.

466
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,441
Three.

467
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,005
Bye-bye.

468
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,795
You're back so quickly?

469
00:38:58,936 --> 00:38:59,766
Mom.

470
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,738
5 minutes ago Angie said you're taking
a bath, but you're back so soon?

471
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,041
Did she really say so?

472
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,407
Yeah.

473
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,814
It's like this... mom,
we have a lot of pressure at school.

474
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,347
And Angie must finish
an important project.

475
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,287
So she's recently...

476
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,455
What kind of is so important project?

477
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,952
It's vital, not finished yet,
it's about my happiness.

478
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:26,989
Good-bye mom.

479
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,497
What is she up to?

480
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,581
Why don't you sleep?

481
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,014
Mom.

482
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,588
In fact, I wasn't at Angie's place
for the project.

483
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,849
Where did you go then?

484
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,921
I went out with a friend.

485
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,526
A boy?

486
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:07,832
My daughter has grown up, she's in love.

487
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,109
Bring him home for dinner on Saturday.

488
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,555
What are you doing?

489
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,661
Got sand in my shoes.

490
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,002
Want to take your shoes off?

491
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,671
No, thanks.

492
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,410
Hello, come and sit here.

493
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,815
Mom.

494
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:58,880
Hong.

495
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,852
What are you doing?

496
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,089
I want to photo as souvenir.

497
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,626
I want to take photo for Aunt.

498
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,892
Help yourself, come on.

499
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,068
Come on...

500
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,761
Good appetite, Aunt.

501
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,000
Let's eat.

502
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,166
What's her name?

503
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,866
Eat now.

504
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,837
Have you got an English name?

505
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,139
Shum Chi Hong

506
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,650
S-H-U-M C-H-I H-O-N-G, Auntie?

507
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,649
Which school do you go to?

508
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,713
La Salle, F.7.

509
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,825
You're attending university this Autumn,
any faculty in mind?

510
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,585
Any Faculty is fine with me,
I haven't decided yet.

511
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,689
But... I prefer studying football.

512
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,794
Studying football?

513
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,202
Can you give an opinion?

514
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,441
No "connon"

515
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,849
What?

516
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,550
No "common"

517
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,615
How can a La Salle student
be so ignorant?

518
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,191
I'll get some drink, you want one?

519
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,698
Mom.

520
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,231
What do you think of him?

521
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,864
No "common", lily no "common"

522
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,109
- Let me do it.
- OK.

523
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,250
I'm sorry... Let me do it...

524
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,750
It is OK.

525
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,482
No... let me do it... please take a rest...

526
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,787
You go... you take it easy.

527
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,224
What are you two doing here?

528
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:50,199
Nothing. I'm washing this glass,
and will wash the rest too.

529
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,962
Well, come next time
when our maid is on leave.

530
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,828
OK...

531
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,131
Thank you, go take a rest.

532
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,237
What a big sitting room?
Is it the Governor's House?

533
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,980
You're ignorant.

534
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,146
Is she pretty?

535
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,254
Your girlfriend? Very pretty.

536
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,481
That "Old Bag" is her mother?

537
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,051
She's called Tina.

538
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,286
Tina, the "Old Bag"?

539
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,793
I warn you,
don't mention this remark if she's here.

540
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,231
Don't worry,
I won't call her that if she's around.

541
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,901
You're mean...

542
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,837
Where shall we go?

543
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,941
Le Se Wa Sai Si Si

544
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:41,245
What are you saying?
Can't hear a damn thing.

545
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,978
- Let me teach you this S-language.
- Sure.

546
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,812
It's for exchanging secret message.

547
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,720
Whenever you speak...

548
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:53,889
...add an "S" between two syllables.

549
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,591
Raise the tone
if it's a unstressed sound.

550
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,135
For example: Put your legs on the floor.

551
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:06,138
Then it becomes:
Fong So Fan Sa Le Sa Ja...

552
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,903
It's hard to learn or hear.

553
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,311
How to say: I love you?

554
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,812
Caw Saw Chun Shun Yee See Lai Sai

555
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,316
Oh... I see.

556
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,649
What are you saying?

557
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:24,921
What are you saying?

558
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,225
I'm speaking a Dialect-language.

559
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:32,759
Stupid, can't you learn S-language?

560
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,665
S-language is too hard to learn.

561
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:35,965
Is it very hard?

562
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,632
Oh... say I'm stupid in S-language?
Do you really mean I'm stupid?

563
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,368
I'll tickle you if you say I'm stupid.

564
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,704
No... help...

565
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,613
I'm bored, I'm leaving now.

566
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,814
The weather is nice today,
I must seduce you.

567
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,189
I'm going to seduce you,
so what are you afraid of?

568
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:04,090
Come on, I'm mighty,
you haven't never tried this before...

569
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,041
Stop that.

570
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,010
You don't look like a La Salle boy.

571
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,205
What? You don't believe me?

572
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,611
No...

573
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,209
Then let me kiss you again, come on...

574
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,851
Open your eyes...

575
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,921
You're Angie!

576
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,850
You again?

577
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,627
Stephen?

578
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,696
Having a wild game?

579
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,198
If I break up with you,
why should you be depressed?

580
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:39,866
Kid, what are you talking about?

581
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:40,800
None of your business.

582
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,337
You're both from La Salle,
don't quarrel!

583
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:43,664
You're La Salle?

584
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,731
You're La Salle?

585
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:45,805
You're La Salle?

586
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,706
You're La Salle?

587
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,640
I'm from La Salle.

588
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:48,743
I'm really from La Salle.

589
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:49,968
You're from La Salle?

590
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:50,977
You mean you're from La Salle?

591
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,104
I'm from La Salle.

592
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,011
You're from La Salle?

593
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,107
I'm really from La Salle.

594
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:05,454
Where's Stephen?

595
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,458
Let's talk over there, come on...

596
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,162
Where has he gone?

597
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,305
Stephen

598
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,004
What happened to you?

599
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,110
Nothing, someone just beat me up.

600
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,076
You got robbed?

601
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,807
Not a robbery, they just beat me,
still have my money.

602
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,408
Who is he?

603
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,984
Stephen, it's your classmate.

604
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,680
You are from La Salle too?

605
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,227
No, got beaten up twice? Oh, God!

606
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,828
Stephen

607
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,262
You live here?

608
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,994
Dad says the fengshui is good here,
he won't move.

609
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,233
We called this "Gold House", you know?

610
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,931
"Gold House"? Keeping a concubine?

611
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,001
Keeping a concubine?
I'll take you as my concubine.

612
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,169
Open the door.

613
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,214
My sister is really cute,
I love to pamper her.

614
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,815
Hello

615
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:05,816
Meet the sister.

616
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,014
Very cute!

617
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,828
Where did you sleep?

618
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,067
I must fire the maid tomorrow.

619
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,235
Don't be like this.

620
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,311
What shall we do now?

621
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,778
Revising lessons.

622
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:32,839
Really?

623
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,414
Revising lessons!

624
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,927
You sleep when I'm asking you to study?
Get up.

625
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,758
In fact, we're doing nothing
but studying all day.

626
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,231
So we should relax from time to time.

627
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,558
Want to relax?

628
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,454
What! Messing around here.

629
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:45,254
Dad... welcome, don't bullshit...

630
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,852
Dad, Stephenie, daddy.

631
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,026
Hello

632
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,251
How are you, Uncle?

633
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,388
Just call me Wing.

634
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,125
How are you, Uncle Wing?
How are you?

635
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,601
It's fate we meet.
I've been so busy recently.

636
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,568
I've just arrive from L.A. ... and Africa,
just got off from the plane

637
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,842
Did you?

638
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,845
I'm an easy going person.

639
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,908
In deed, a rich man doesn't need
to showoff he has money.

640
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,986
Have you ever told others
we have properties worth of $40 million?

641
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,487
Quietly...

642
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,921
Yeah...

643
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,984
- Dad.
- Yeah.

644
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,355
Please eat, I cook one more

645
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,123
OK, you eat yourself, thank you.

646
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:35,362
Give me a massage, I'm aching all over.

647
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,869
Quick.

648
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,004
Massage harder.
Are you weak from starvation?

649
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,915
How's this?

650
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:53,216
OK, no, thanks.

651
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,379
It's all right.

652
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,551
- I find you very naive.
- Do you?

653
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:03,132
You must be ignorant if not naive,
you believe all that I say?

654
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,133
Believe what?

655
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,159
I don't want to cheat you anymore.

656
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,304
I'm a taxi driver indeed.

657
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,408
Hong is not from La Salle,
he only studies in the college nearby.

658
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,474
We've been living here.

659
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,572
We're poor people,
I mustn't blame Hong for this.

660
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,981
He boasts just cheer you up.

661
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,712
I know he loves you very much.

662
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,052
I don't know
what you rich girls have in mind.

663
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,592
But if you only want to play with him,

664
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:36,661
I beg you to spare him, he can't
take this kind of disappointment.

665
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,366
What are you talking about?

666
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:43,332
Nothing, the Arab Prince Wasabie says
he wants to sell oil-wells.

667
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,399
Right, Wasabie?
He always cheats in business deals.

668
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,101
- Don't do business with him in future.
- OK.

669
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,511
I remember that Mr. Misubishi
mentioned about the car...

670
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,546
...that he won't sell it
for less than $3 million.

671
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,412
I remember now, my classmates
wanted to borrow our yacht, can they?

672
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,382
OK, don't lend it, just give it to him.

673
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,684
Why?

674
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,994
- Have you ever cheated me?
- Cheat what?

675
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,361
I mean it.

676
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:29,251
I'm indeed not a rich guy,
I don't study in La Salle either.

677
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,219
Why must you lie to me?

678
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,090
I was going to tell you earlier.

679
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,787
I was afraid that you'll leave me
if I told you the truth.

680
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,421
I will.

681
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,137
If I didn't do this,
I'm afraid I can't get you.

682
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,609
Don't leave me.

683
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,677
You mustn't cheat me anymore.

684
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:06,513
Never will I cheat you again.

685
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,457
I know many La Salle students,
none have heard of a Hong.

686
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,497
Did he really studying in La Salle?

687
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,299
I can tell you,
but you mustn't tell my mother.

688
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,804
No, I must tell her.

689
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:57,801
Don't tell her.

690
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,301
No, I must tell...

691
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,567
Then I'm not going to tell you.

692
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,644
It means he's not from La Salle.

693
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,677
Chris

694
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:08,714
How are you, Aunt?

695
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,252
You want to invite me to tea?

696
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,882
Aunt, I've something to tell you.

697
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,888
But I don't know how to start.

698
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,686
Just go ahead, why hesitate?

699
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,497
- Aunt, you know I pamper Stephenie a lot
- Yes.

700
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,595
I treat her like my sister,
I don't want her to be cheated.

701
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,282
Go ahead.

702
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,377
Have you had enough?

703
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,386
It's aerated, pour slowly.

704
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,455
Angie, Stephenie's mother
is boss of the cosmetic company.

705
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,722
She's here for tea
with a guy called Chris.

706
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,231
That Chris kept saying bad remarks
about Stephenie's boyfriend...

707
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,566
...saying he lies that
he's from La Salle and is a rich guy...

708
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,170
...and also he tries to cheat Stephenie
for money and sex, aren't you worried?

709
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,404
Shit, Angie told me that bastard Chris...

710
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,337
...called up Tap's mother,

711
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,504
and said Hong is not from La Salle.

712
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,183
Say something, OK?

713
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,420
Do you know Tap told me
all of this two hours ago?

714
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,251
Don't you remember we're both in love?

715
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,350
I think I'm bit loss!

716
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:28,359
No, don't worry, we have a solution.

717
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,224
What solution?

718
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:30,459
Dad.

719
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:38,273
I've joined an opera group
at the community centre,

720
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,538
I've learned how to play act.

721
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,235
It's time for me to perform.

722
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,707
Will you really help me out?

723
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,782
I haven't any sentiment for this school.

724
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,283
I've been your buddy for decades.

725
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,842
It's my last day here as I'm emigrating
to New Zealand day after tomorrow.

726
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,384
So I must help you out this time.

727
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,523
Still taking my $5,000
and you're my buddy? Mind your greed.

728
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

729
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,199
Excuse me,
are you Stephenie Wong's mother?

730
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,571
Yes, I am, who are you?

731
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,402
I'm Father Ng of La Salle College.

732
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:21,348
I discovered your daughter is in love
with our student Shum Chi Hong.

733
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:22,381
You know this...

734
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:27,420
Our school rules
forbid students to have love affairs.

735
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,754
As this will affect their studies.

736
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,517
I agree with you.

737
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,822
I'll ask my daughter
to concentrate in school.

738
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,429
I'll discourage her from love affairs.

739
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,762
No, I don't think this is a solution.

740
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,958
Sometimes if the two
can help each other...

741
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,730
...a little love affair
will do them good.

742
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,672
Mrs. Wong, if we have spare time...

743
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,606
...why don't we meet
and talk more about it?

744
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,473
When will you be free?

745
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,571
OK, I'll see you at the college
at 3:00 p.m. today.

746
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,773
OK today, this afternoon.

747
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,474
Let's meet at 3:00 p.m.

748
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,385
Our first plan is a success.

749
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,046
- Good!
- Yeah!

750
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,785
Hey, what's the name of that "Old Bag"?

751
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,020
Don't ever call her "Old Bag".

752
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,888
But she is an "Old Bag".

753
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,325
She's Tina.

754
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,393
Tina? God!

755
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,737
How are you? Are you Stephenie's mother?

756
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,708
Yes.

757
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,839
Shum Chi Hong
is a very hard-working student.

758
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:30,008
He has been awarded "Competent Youth",

759
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,813
but he's humble,
he never tells others about this.

760
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,289
He doesn't give me a good impression.

761
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,293
Are we talking about the same guy?

762
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,020
Yes, but you misunderstood him.

763
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:42,956
Did I?

764
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,292
You don't believe me? Let me show you.

765
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,802
OK.

766
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,894
God bless you.

767
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,540
God bless you.

768
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,674
Watch out,
there's a curb in front, brake now.

769
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,317
Quiet.

770
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:04,843
Sir.

771
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,681
Quiet, don't shout.

772
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,564
Good morning, father.

773
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,966
Good morning, father.

774
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,001
Good morning, class!

775
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,769
All are God's children.

776
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,000
Father.

777
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,768
Oh my son.

778
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,936
My father.

779
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:30,874
Come, come.

780
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:31,945
Yes.

781
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,981
Go on with the lesson.

782
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,813
Let's not affect their lesson.

783
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,925
There's a stall nearby, let's have tea.

784
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,722
Right, we can eat pork bun.

785
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:46,659
Sure...

786
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,889
How long do you both plan to cheat me?

787
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,465
What... Cheat?...

788
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,832
What is your relation with him?

789
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,434
I'm his father.

790
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,537
Did you really study here?

791
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,973
Right...

792
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,607
- Hi! Tina Wong.
- Hi!

793
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,103
You're father here?

794
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,176
Yes...

795
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,771
What's the name of this sister

796
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:11,519
She's... called Sister.

797
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,812
She is Sister Mary

798
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,792
She's Sister Ivy indeed.

799
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:26,826
Aunt, sorry,
we didn't mean to play a joke on you.

800
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,463
We act this way because we're afraid
you'll know we're not from La Salle.

801
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,431
I didn't mean to reveal your secret.

802
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:35,705
But now I know my daughter's boyfriend
is not honest.

803
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:39,904
What? My son is not honest?

804
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:44,786
Wait, madam, do you mean your daughter
is pregnant and can't face others?

805
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,013
Like father like son, you're both sly.

806
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,623
I never expected
Stephenie's judgement to be so poor.

807
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:50,715
How can she get along with these guys?

808
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,758
I must teach her a lesson.

809
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,453
Aunt, I'm not from La Salle,
I'm not from a rich family.

810
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,830
You can look down on me,
but you mustn't say this to my father.

811
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:58,591
Good boy.

812
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,726
You think you're special
because you're rich?

813
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:04,633
What did you say?
Apologize to my mother at once.

814
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,472
Sorry. Now I've said it, so now
you must apologize to my father too.

815
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,708
I didn't do anything wrong,
why must I apologize?

816
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,784
Madam, you must be fair.

817
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,549
Just a "sorry"
and we can all forget about it.

818
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,556
It doesn't make sense, let's go.

819
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,702
My ball, please.

820
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,939
It's bad.

821
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,046
Mom, are you alright?

822
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,943
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

823
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,277
Are you alright, Old Bag?

824
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,580
What?

825
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,929
Hong, take the shortcut, come on.

826
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,867
You know I love my mother the most,
it's wrong for you to insult her.

827
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,742
I've been doing all this for your sake.

828
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,681
What are you laughing?

829
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:26,651
Sorry, I recall the name "Old Bag",
sorry again.

830
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:30,554
You're always like this,
you never study hard when I ask you.

831
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,628
When I speak seriously to you,
you just laugh.

832
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,555
You're not serious at all.

833
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,027
When I'm laughing...
how do you know that I'm not serious?

834
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,537
I can sense that you're not serious.

835
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,031
I'm always like this.

836
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,110
I just don't like your behaviour.

837
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,711
I can't change.

838
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,611
Don't change then.

839
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,599
Start driving.

840
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:31,945
They've reported to the police,
let's go.

841
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,369
You're useless, no one can see you here.

842
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,110
Look, you stink,
even flies are coming to smell you.

843
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,711
Get up at once.

844
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,044
Take a bath and I'll take you to dinner.

845
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:36,082
Go take a bath, now.

846
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:39,211
Dad, don't touch brother.

847
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,084
Take a bath, why are you pretending?

848
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,989
You got dumped?

849
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,320
Your whole body stinks.

850
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,985
What a tragedy!

851
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,686
The Tang family is quarrelling again.

852
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,426
Come back, I'll give you a house.

853
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,960
What do you mean by this?

854
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,764
You're so love-sick, I'll shave your
head then you can be a love-sick monk.

855
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,199
Asshole! Men can always
get a wife anytime.

856
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,742
Look at how ridiculous you are now!

857
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,249
Teach him a lesson,
no need to use force.

858
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:11,884
You're not human,
I'd better castrate you.

859
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,387
Quick someone report to the police.

860
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,458
Look, if I had known,
I wouldn't have helped you seduce girls.

861
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,322
You'd better become a gay,
like your sister.

862
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,996
Brother, you told Dad? What's
the big deal that you're love sick?

863
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,035
I haven't told Dad anything.

864
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,798
If you hadn't, Dad's stupid,
how did he guess it?

865
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:35,272
I know everything, Mimi told me that.

866
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,344
Why did you betray me?

867
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,108
You promised you'd keep it a secret.

868
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:44,448
And you told others? Do you've manners,
how can you teach your children?

869
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:47,821
Why not?

870
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,790
If I've no manners, then I would have
chop your head off, and throw it out.

871
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,052
I'd lock your door and burn your place.

872
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,494
Pay back $300 before you burn my place,
pay me back now.

873
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,395
You mean you're breaking off with me?
Wait.

874
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:09,935
I'll pay back the $45 I owe you,
Hong, let's go.

875
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,214
Why are you shouting?

876
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,881
You're all nuts.

877
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,348
I don't know what I have done wrong.

878
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,752
My son is girlish,
and my daughter a lesbian.

879
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,520
You gave birth to a lesbian.

880
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,891
I'm going to play mahjong,
don't care whether you come back or not.

881
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,076
Hello

882
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,246
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

883
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,049
Sorry, I didn't realise
I'd stir up so much trouble.

884
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,951
Forget it, it's not your fault.

885
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:00,355
Let's skip school
since we're so depressed.

886
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,555
Ask your mother to give you money
for a world tour.

887
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,334
No, mom will die if I ask her.

888
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,161
Right, don't think about it anymore.

889
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,800
You'd better study hard,
and take the exams.

890
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,476
I'm not thinking about it anymore.

891
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,541
Stop crying, please.

892
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,445
I can comfort you if you need help.

893
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:44,470
I don't know why Hong loves you,
you're such a mess.

894
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:47,207
Concentrate and study,
or I'll bully you.

895
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,211
Come and play, we need one more player.

896
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,954
I'll play mahjong with Mrs. Tang.

897
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:43,051
Brother, have a cup of coffee
to refresh yourself.

898
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,375
I'll have a coffee and a cake.

899
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,419
No... I don't want anything.

900
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,088
What do you want?

901
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:23,121
I know I'm poor,
but we're honest people.

902
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:27,063
I'm stupid, and naive,
but I'm a good guy.

903
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,760
What do you mean
by telling me all of this?

904
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,404
Like father like son.

905
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,304
Hong is a good son,
he's obedient, a real good guy.

906
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:43,646
I do hope you'll let Tap and Hong
keep their friendship.

907
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,377
I've never stopped Stephenie
from seeing your son.

908
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,787
But Stephenie
doesn't want to see him anymore.

909
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:53,522
Stephenie is studying for A Level exams,
she must concentrate.

910
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:57,588
If you son really loves Stephenie...

911
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,063
...he'd better leave her alone.

912
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,636
I can't help.

913
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:15,773
I find you more and more elegant.

914
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,315
You're so different,
even when drinking coffee.

915
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:21,354
Then... we can become friends?

916
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,823
We can go out for a movie or a dinner...

917
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,457
I don't think so.

918
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,628
You don't need tell me so honestly.

919
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,562
Sir, your cake.

920
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,398
What? Didn't I cancel the order?

921
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,766
I cancelled your order of coffee

922
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,111
- Smart!
- Good.

923
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:01,361
Stephenie, I want to see.
Where is her?

924
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,228
Stephenie is at her mother's
birthday party.

925
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,766
Thank you.

926
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:31,759
Why you're so quiet,
not smiled all night.

927
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,512
Laugh out loud,
I've practised a long time.

928
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,511
Why has my cigarette disappeared?

929
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,520
I can't tell it. It's a secret.

930
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,923
Why... you're hiding it here?

931
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,191
You come to disturb Tap again?

932
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:14,864
Where is she?

933
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,594
Why are you here again?

934
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,833
She'll cry when she sees you.

935
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:36,347
I want you to show your maturity today.

936
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:40,327
It's my birthday,
please don't stir up trouble here.

937
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,630
Tap.

938
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,900
You'd better go outside.

939
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,439
If Stephenie wants to see you,
she'll come out.

940
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,466
There are some things you can't help it.

941
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,449
What did you tell him?

942
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,348
I know how you feel now.

943
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:46,685
First love is never easy... to anyone.

944
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,855
It's hard to take a balance
between judgement and sentiment.

945
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,261
Think about yourself
whether you'll see him or not.

946
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:38,844
Tap.

947
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,645
Why did you come so late to see me?

948
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:45,951
I promise myself I must study well.

949
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,550
I've achieved flying colours
in my exam this time.

950
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,821
Congratulations.

951
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,065
What about you?

952
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,433
I didn't study well because of you.

953
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,365
I'm going to England tomorrow.

954
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,033
You're going to England tomorrow?

955
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,541
Can't you stay here?

956
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,748
I've promised mother, I must go.

957
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,913
Which flight?

958
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,889
At 9:30 a.m.

959
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,859
Only 12 hours from now on.

960
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,934
Stephenie!

961
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,141
Come and cut the cake with me.

962
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,119
Happy Birthday Aunt, Happy Birthday.

963
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:54,946
Thank you...

964
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,621
You're so pretty tonight.

965
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,388
Let me kiss you again.

966
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,986
Aunt, your glasses looks very sexy,
long, square and thin.

967
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,162
What are you doing?

968
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,662
Aunt, never mind them.

969
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,810
Where are we going now?

970
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,211
You haven't eaten, let's go and eat.

971
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,150
What are you laughing at?

972
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,762
What are you laughing at?

973
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,108
Mom.

974
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:54,113
I... I promise I'll come back
for the flight tomorrow.

975
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,441
Sorry...

976
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,109
Happy Birthday.

977
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,168
Do you remember how we met?

978
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:22,038
Why, I don't remember.

979
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:36,920
Wow, you father has blisters...

980
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:37,957
Isn't this the song?

981
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,117
You're not singing a song.

982
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,989
I recall now.

983
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,556
Since you left...

984
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:16,593
Will you forget me soon...
after being far away?

985
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,757
No, will you?

986
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,604
Tell me, who will you miss the most?

987
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,741
My mother.

988
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,982
I know my mother is lonely.

989
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:42,184
And now... I'm leaving her.

990
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,155
You're the culprit.

991
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,853
If you hadn't disturb my studies,
I wouldn't be going to England.

992
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,963
Promise me...

993
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:54,568
If I marry, its with my mother,
you must accept her.

994
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:59,639
OK, I'll start my "savings" tonight.

995
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:03,677
I'll support one wife
and a mother-in-law.

996
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,583
I mean it.

997
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:18,755
I'm most happy... when my parents
took me to amusement park.

998
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:26,261
I remember... my dress was wet
after riding the roller coaster.

999
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:27,932
You pee?

1000
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,366
No, my father did.

1001
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:31,904
You mean it?

1002
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:33,165
Horrible, isn't it?

1003
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:35,638
He pee? He's a grown up.

1004
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,046
When did you last go to amusement park?

1005
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:47,248
I don't remember.

1006
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,249
Let's go there now.

1007
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:55,424
It's closed at this hour.

1008
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,900
Come on... I'll ask them open it.

1009
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,804
Can you?

1010
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:07,402
You two are nuts.

1011
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:11,134
You should be making love madly
in motels on this last night together.

1012
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,846
What did you come to amusement park for?

1013
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:18,809
Bastard, why are calling me up so late?

1014
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,913
Come and help me.

1015
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,290
My boss will fire me
if he learns about this.

1016
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,860
I'll cancel your debts.

1017
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,160
You're nuts.

1018
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:35,135
You should be making love madly
in motels on this last night together.

1019
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,898
What did you come to amusement park for?

1020
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,107
Sorry to bother you, please help me.

1021
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,472
Uncle, please.

1022
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,144
I'll treat you to tea.

1023
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:48,473
No thanks, tea will mean
I'll have to pee all day.

1024
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,275
- Just a few rides and leave.
- Sure...

1025
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:08,264
Sit still, ready...

1026
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,700
One, two, three!

1027
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:13,730
What's going on?

1028
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,902
Shit... I'm going to lose my job.

1029
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,704
You've been working here for so long,
can't you do something?

1030
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:44,463
Dad... sorry.

1031
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:57,784
Stupid boy, you haven't accompany
your Dad for a long time.

1032
01:20:57,886 --> 01:20:59,547
Haven't I?

1033
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,486
Very warm.

1034
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,297
I don't long for daylight.

1035
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,999
You're back.

1036
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:15,740
Mom...

1037
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:18,409
Sorry.

1038
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:24,117
Time for boarding, say your last words.

1039
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:42,075
Let's count to three and say "goodbye".

1040
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:47,743
If we say good-bye here
it means we'll meet here again.

1041
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,443
One.

1042
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,180
Two.

1043
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:54,719
Three!

1044
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:04,263
How to say it and mean "good-bye"?

1045
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,561
This way.

1046
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,135
Let's count to three.

1047
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,564
We then turn around and go.

1048
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,141
If not, we'll become lizards.

1049
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,407
One.

1050
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,280
Two.

1051
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,148
Three.

1052
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,450
Lizard.

1053
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,388
Mrs. Lizard.

1054
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:38,456
Bye-bye.

1055
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,158
Move.

1056
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,623
They got married one year later.

1057
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,425
My mom made the right decision.

1058
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:24,265
My step-father is great too.

1059
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,902
I have four days off and came back to HK
for my mom's wedding.

1060
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,413
Stand close... let's take photo...

1061
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:38,475
Relatives and friends of the groom
stand that way.

1062
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,917
Relatives and friends of the bride,
say "cheese".

1063
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,491
Employees of the groom's company
go that way.

1064
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,752
One, two, three, OK...

1065
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:02,408
It's done, who hasn't taken a photo yet?

1066
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:03,872
Yes, not yet.

1067
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,336
My daughter.

1068
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,553
Mom, you're very pretty.

1069
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,817
You must be good to my mother.

1070
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,517
I will...

1071
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,392
You must be treat my daughter well.

1072
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,397
Sure... I will...

1073
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,201
Two.

1074
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:32,766
Three.

1075
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,537
Who are you?

1076
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:40,679
Her boyfriend.

1077
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:41,543
Her boyfriend?

1078
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,605
Her boyfriend.

1079
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,216
I'm her boyfriend indeed.

1080
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,650
I'm her boyfriend.

1081
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:47,916
Her boyfriend?

1082
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,314
Where're you going?
You're her boyfriend?

1083
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,825
Where're you going?
That fatty is from La Salle too?

1084
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:54,652
Oh no...

1085
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:08,574
I'm happy to see my mom
believing in love again.

1086
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:14,438
But if he was here...
I think I'd be happier.

1087
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,244
Sorry, I'm late.

1088
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:21,879
What time is it now? You're late again?

1089
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,683
My father's car broke down on the way.

1090
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:26,488
I don't care, don't touch me.

1091
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,692
Let's take a photo with the bride.

1092
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,891
I don't know what you're talking about.

1093
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,863
Don't you want to take photo with Aunt?

1094
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,400
What is it?

1095
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:37,461
Kid.

1096
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,008
I don't care about you,
go away, don't follow me.

1097
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:44,506
Sorry.

1098
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,910
Damn you.

1099
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,670
- Don't run, please.
- No way.

1100
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:48,943
Go away.

1101
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:56,353
Unless you buy me a super teddy-bear,
it's a deal.
