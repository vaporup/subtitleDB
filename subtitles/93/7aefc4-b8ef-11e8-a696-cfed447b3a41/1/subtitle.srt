pretty dress that you're wearing right now.

It's goddamn stunning, that dress.

- That dress. Wow!
- Thank you.

- Is he drunk or something?
- Probably.

83
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,817
Well, let's just say if drunk equals A,

84
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,452
and then somethin' else equals B,

85
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,854
the answer is definitely not B.

00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,990
- Sutter.
- Look, man, I know this is awkward, okay?

87

- No, it's really not awkward at all.

- What an honor!

00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,920
and I don't know
where my car is,

172
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,256
so, I think that
we can help each other out.

173
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,893
What do you say?

174
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,594
Try aiming ahead
of the driveway.

175
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:22,968
Okay.

176
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,105
I didn't realize newspaper
throwing was such big business.

177
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,808
- You must make a lot of money.
- Yeah. I mean, my mom does.

178
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,943
- And you get nothing?
- No, I get a little.

179
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,713
Um, most of it goes towards
paying the bills, though, so...

180
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,082
That doesn't sound fair. You
do all the work, don't you?

181
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,117
Some of it. Most of it.

182
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,152
Aimee, she's your mom! She
should be paying all your bills.

183
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,022
- (LAUGHING)
- I'm serious. That doesn't sound fair to me.

184
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,892
I think you're getting the raw end
of this newspaper throwing deal.

185
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,560
It's fine.

186
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,028
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,997
You should have seen me
back in the day.

188
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,199
- When I was in Little League I had a pretty good arm.
- Yeah?

189
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,268
Yeah. My dad said...

190
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,270
He said I could have
went pro if I stuck with it.

191
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,207
Yeah, dude, you're a natural.
Good job.

192
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,710
Whoo!

193
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,549
- Ah, shit, I hit a dog!

(AIMEE LAUGHING)

195
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,085
- I'm serious!
- Sutter!

196
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,220
It's still walkin'.

197
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,926
- Whoa! Went way downtown!
- (LAUGHING)

198
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,095
You know, Aimee Finicky?

199
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,232
I was having a really rotten night
last night until you came along.

200
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,234
I think that we should
get lunch sometime.

201
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,902
Okay.

202
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,972
- How about Monday?
- Okay. Monday it is.

203
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,780
You're up early.

204
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,847
Yep.

205
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,149
Hmm...

206
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,184
They have me
on a double shift. Again.

207
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,689
Oh, damn it, Sutter.

208
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,860
Didn't I ask you
to hang this for me?

209
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,096
Look!
Look how wrinkled this is.

210
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,734
It would have taken you two
seconds to hang this up for me.

211
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,002
Is that too much to ask?

212
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,805
I forgot. I'm sorry.

213
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,673
You know, it's not like
you do so much around here.

214
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,976
- Hey! I do a lot around here.
- Hey!

215
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:15,814
Oh, I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt
your, uh, cheerio eating.

216
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,948
I'm sorry, Mom.

217

(SIGHING)

218
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,623
Sometimes you remind me
so much of your dad.

219
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,829
All right, there's
leftovers in the fridge.

220
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,132
I won't be home for dinner,
or, you can call your sister.

- And Sutter...
- Mmm-hmm?

223
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,308
Next time I ask you
to do something...

(CLICKING TONGUE)

00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,713
I love you so much it hurts.

226
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,115
It hurts me
how much I love you.

227
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,983
You know what's
gonna really hurt?

228
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,986
Who knew dinner and a movie
would cost 30 bucks?

229
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,855
Pretty much anybody
who's ever been on a date.

230
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,957
Oh, but the best part
is, dude, she didn't care.

231
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,226
She paid for the popcorn
and everything.

232
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,662
She's just...

233
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,998
- What?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

- Did you kiss her?
- Check.

236
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,936
- Yeah? Did you get a little tongue action?
- Double check.

237
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,673
- Nice. Nice. Yeah.
- (CHUCKLING)

238
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,408
Thanks, man.

239
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,276
So, what you wanna eat for lunch, man?
I'm starving.

240
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,358
Uh, aren't you eating
with what's her name?

241
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,015
Oh, shit. Yeah. I forgot.

242
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,152
You know, I gotta tell you, Sutter.
Aimee Finicky?

243
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,854
It's just a strange choice
for a rebound.

244
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,189
Dude, she's not a rebound.

245
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,825
Dude, she's not! Look.

246
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,895
Do I look like I have any
interest in dating Aimee Finicky?

247
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,930
I think she's a nice girl, man.

248
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,733
Whose mom makes her deliver newspapers
at 5 o'clock in the morning

249
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,735
six days a week,
pays half the bills...

250
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,204
- Aimee doesn't say shit about it.
- That sucks.

251
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,306
It's bullshit is what it is.

252
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,775
All right, so where
do you come in?

253
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,778
Um, I mean, I think
I can help her out.

254
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,147
So, if two planes intersect,

255
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,316
they intersect in exactly,
give it to me,

256
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,404
A one plane, B one
point, C one line...

Oh, that's lunch.
You lucky sons of guns.

259
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,493
Don't forget to do the homework.
Sutter, a word?

260
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,096
- Huh?
- Please, Mr. Keely, sit down, I have to have a word.

261
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,431
- I have somewhere to go.
- Good bye. Good bye, Hannah.

262
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't be late tomorrow please.
Thank you.

00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,469
You button up.

- What's up?
- What's up?

265
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,473
I noticed you didn't turn in
the homework.

266
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,841
Which is... That's fine man.

267
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,942
Cause I...

268
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,077
I did it last night and I...

269
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,446
Yeah. Stop talking.
Do me a favor. Stop talking.

270
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,815
All right. What's up?

271
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,517
You tell me, Sutter. I only
want to see you succeed.

272
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,053
- You know that, right?
- I know. I know.

273
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,021
If you fail,
that means I failed.

274
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,190
I like my job, I like you.
I don't wanna fail.

275
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,092
I know. I don't want you to... I
don't want you to fail either.

276
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,894
That's why
I'm not gonna let us fail.

277
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,896
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm gonna get it together.

278
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,364
- And I'm turning that corner, I can feel myself...
- Make me believe you.

279
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,299
Make me... I wanna believe you.

280
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,350
- I'm feelin' smarter already.
- All right.

281
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,301
Let me see you answer this.
All right.

282
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,306
If one acute angle is two
times larger than the other,

283
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,323
what's the measure
of the two angles?

284
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,543
That's what I thought.

285
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,913
- That was not in the homework.
- That was the homework.

286
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,081
- No, it wasn't man!
- Stay right there, I'm gonna show you.

287
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,415
- We gonna do it together.
- (SIGHING)

288
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,138
We gonna do your homework together.
I love it.

289
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,874
That's crazy!
How fast were you going?

290
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,110
Like 20, 25 miles
an hour or something.

291
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,179
- And you just jumped out of the car?
- Yeah.

292
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,480
(LAUGHING) What?

293
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,416
It was snowing so
I didn't think it would hurt.

294
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,484
But it did.

295
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,252
That's amazing.

296
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,021
That's awesome.

297
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,489
You're such a good listener.

298
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,092
- No...
- Um, all right, you go.

299
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,965
Um, I remember, um,
I think it was sophomore year.

300
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,033
You came to gym class

301
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,435
and you were wearing
the mascot head

302
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,569
and you refused to take it off.

303
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,504
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah. (LAUGHING)

304
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,408
- Yeah, that was funny.
- Yeah, it was really funny.

305
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,450
Yeah. No, I mean, like
what's a story about you.

306
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,180
- About me?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,415
Um...

308
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,051
I don't really
have any stories.

309
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,973
What do you mean?
Everyone's got a story.

310
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,924
(CHUCKLING) Not me, I guess.

311
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,595
Um, all right, so, like, what's,
I don't know, what's your thing?

312
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,632
- My thing?
- Yeah, you know, everybody's got a thing.

313
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,467
Larry Rourke, stoner.

314
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,402
Uh, Greg Jacoby
is the rich kid.

315
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,405
What's, what's your thing?

316
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,075
I don't know,
I'd like to think that there's

317
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,198
more to a person than just one thing.
You know?

318
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,948
- Yeah.
- GIRL: Hello, Aimee.

319
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,118
- So, he, uh, finally got here, did he?
- Hey. This is Krystal.

320
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,922
- Hey, Krystal. Sutter Keely. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. I know who you are.

321
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,625
Uh, Aimee, come on,
French Club.

322
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,927
They're waiting for us.
Chop-chop!

323
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,328
I'm so sorry.

324
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh, my God, I totally forgot
about French Club.

325
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,466
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's all good.

326
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,003
Um, hey, did you have, uh,
Mr. Aster for geometry class?

327
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,971
Yeah. Freshman year.

328
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,853
Probably thought
it was pretty easy?

329
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,010
Kind of. I don't know.

330
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,311
Yeah. I bet you did.

331
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,281
Uh, would you mind
like tutoring me?

332
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,515
'Cause he's talking
all the time,

333
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,550
I have no idea
what he's saying.

334
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,153
Yeah. Sure, totally. Um...

335
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,656
Yeah. Just, uh...

336
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,591
You can just like,
call me and...

337
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,559
Yeah.

338
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,329
Just call me.

339
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,266
Awesome.

340
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,938
Nice meeting you too. Pleasure.

341
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,340
- See you later.
- All right. Bye.

342
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,146
- You have great taste in bow ties.
- Thank you.

343
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,389
That was my favorite. I would
have bought it if you didn't.

344
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,325
MAN: See you at home.

345
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,969
Hmm...

346
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,104
- What do you think of that?
- You're getting better.

347
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,573
- That's really good. That's the best I've seen yet.
- All right.

348
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,108
When you gonna adopt me?

349
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,143
(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry, uh,

350
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,579
- two's my limit on mouths to feed.
- Okay.

351
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,147
Offer's still there.

352
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,416
- What were we talking about?
- Um, Cassidy.

353
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,684
Ah!

354
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,486
- Yeah.
- (EXHALING) Pfft...

355
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,050
I liked her.

356
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,455
Yeah. Me too. (SCOFFING)

357
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:35,259
Kinda thought she'd be the one
to yank you out of neutral.

358
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,462
Neutral? What are you talking about, Dan?
I'm in overdrive.

359
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,330
- (CHUCKLING)
- What?

360
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,681
- Aimee!
- Shane, shut up!

361
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,521
- Hey!
- Hey.

362
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,223
- How are you?
- Good.

363
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,591
- Good.
- All right.

364
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,159
Come on in.

365
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,596
Hey.

366
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,332
- This is my brother Shane.
- Hey, Shane.

367
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,772
- He just learned that. Yeah.
- Charming.

368
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,808
- We can study in my room.
- Lead the way.

369
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,584
Wow! This is...

370
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,087
It's really nice.

371
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,456
Thank you.
I try to keep it clean.

372
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,525
There's a lot of stuff everywhere.
(LAUGHING)

373
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,260
SUTTER: You read a lot?
You like books?

374
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,462
AIMEE: I do, actually,
I love books.

375
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,464
They're mostly
just science fiction.

376
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,166
A few mysteries

377
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,468
and other things.

378
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,804
- That one is really weird.
- This is the weird one?

379
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,106
- You picked a really weird one.
- Weird is good.

380
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,175
Let's embrace the weird.

381
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,410
It's really weird.

382
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,713
- Is this backwards? Why...
- Yeah. It's just the way that you read them.

383
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,715
Let me see. You start...

384
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,386
Back here. It's the beginning.

385
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,321

00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:19,497
- Is this... Is that you flying through space?
- No.

389
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,133
No. She's just a character
from those books.

390
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,835
It's, like, really stupid.

391
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,837
No, it's not stupid. If you
like it, it's not stupid.

392
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,505
Yeah. Well...

393
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,674
What makes her so special?

394
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:34,312
Um, she's in charge of this
thing called the Neexo Ark.

395
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,582
And it's up to her to
escape the Dark Galaxy,

396
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,518
and save the Gleaming
Planet's star system.

397
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,291
Yeah. I don't know, like, I
know it's odd and stuff, but...

398
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,596
She's actually really awesome.
She's kind of my hero.

399
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:57,468
Well, you will be my hero if you can
help me out with this geometry business.

400
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,139
I have no idea what I'm doing.

401
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,509
- Is this the right book?
- Yes.

402
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,478
How much of
it have you studied?

403
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,348
- Studied's a strong word.
- (LAUGHING)

404

- Complimentary. Got it. Got it.

406
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,225
Man, you're a wonderful
teacher, Miss Finicky.

407
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,362
- So, you understand it?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,731
Well, what I don't understand is
why I need to know this stuff.

409
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,300
Because, I mean seriously,
like, who, like,

410
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,236
cal... Coplanar lines
and angles and stuff,

411
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,373
like, who calculates slopes at their job?
Who needs this shit?

412
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,644
MRS. FINICKY: Aimee! Come on
out here right now, will you!

413
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,313
I thought you were going
to get us some milk.

414
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,449
- I will!
- Do it now, for crissakes!

415
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,654
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

416
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,455
- I should probably...
- Yeah...

417
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,593
Um, hey, there is
a party on Saturday

418
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,862
and I think that
you should go with me.

419
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,630
- Me?
- Yeah.

420
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,599
- What?
- Yeah. I'll come by and pick you up.

421
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,435
- How's that sound?
- Um...

422
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,405
Okay?

423
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,807
- Is that an answer or a question?
- No, no, it's an answer.

424
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,910
- If you don't wanna go...
- No, I do, I do.

425
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,279
I would like that. Thank you.

It's disgusting. I mean
people poop in there. Here.

I'm good. I don't really drink.

Hey, Cody, you're a reader,
aren't you?

You ever read those

441
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,667
- One or two.
- One or two?

442
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,103
I forgot to tell you. I started
reading one last night.

443
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,072
- You did?
- Yeah, it's really cool.

444

- Yeah. The one where Shirei Migoto uh...

just starts fucking him up.

- Please. Thank you.

- (LAUGHING) Don't smile at me like that.
- I can't help myself.

- Sutter! Please.

Yeah? Okay. Done?

- Ooh, can I try that?
- What, this?

477
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,095
- Yeah.
- I don't know. This is some pretty serious stuff.

478
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,931
- Just a taste.
- You sure?

479
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,934
- Yes.
- All right. Here you go. Go for it.

480
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,003
It's pretty strong.

481

- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

482
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,208
- Eww!
- Yeah. Yeah. I know.

483
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,609
- Whoa! - I know. - I told you.
- How do you drink that?

484
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:44,615
I don't know, I guess I've just been
doin' it for a while. I don't know.

485
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,750
- (LAUGHING)
- You know who gave me my first beer?

486
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,952
- Who?
- My dad.

487
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,489
- Really?
- Yeah. I was probably six years old.

488
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,559
He used to take me to baseball games every
Saturday and then let me have little sips of it.

489
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:58,929
- Did you get drunk?
- No, I didn't get drunk, but I mean,

490
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,966
it tasted really nice
and felt warm.

491
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,034
Where is he now, your dad?

492
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,103
- He's an airline pilot.
- Really?

493
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,572
- Yeah, he flies all across the country.
- Sutter, that's awesome!

494
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:13,577
Dude, he is awesome. I don't know what
he was doing with my mom for that long.

495
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,882
- Are they, like, divorced?
- Yeah. She made him leave us a long time ago.

496
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,720
- Want some more? Try it. Yeah? Why not?
- Um, sure.

497
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:26,957
- Kind of sounds like we have the same mom.
- Yeah? How so?

498
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,126
Um... Well, for example,

499
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,930
I got into college today, but there's no
way that my mom will let me go, so...

500
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,565
- You got into college today?
- Mmm-hmm.

501
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,301
- That's awesome!
- Yeah. Thank you.

502
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,270
- Congratulations.
- In Philadelphia.

503
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,239
Which is really cool, 'cause that's
where my sister lives, but...

504
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,075
Aimee, I don't know what to say. That's...
Dude, that's awesome.

505
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,877
- Congratulations! Very cool.
- Thanks.

506
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,146
Doesn't matter, I mean, It's
not that big of a deal.

507
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,149
- There's no way that I'll go, so it's not.
- What are you talking about?

508
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,151
Well, I mean my mom, I have
to help her with the route.

509
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,020
What does your mom have to do with this?
The route?

510
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,922
- She has the route, she's alone.
- The paper route?

511
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,024
- Yeah, she's alone, she needs...
- Aimee, your mom

512
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:03,561
is a grown woman. She can take
care of the paper route herself.

513
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,163
You are definitely
going to Philly.

514
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,677
Yeah, 100% you're
going to Philly.

515
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:09,233
- Yeah, no, but...
- Yeah, you are.

516
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:13,337
No, dude, there's no buts about it.
Aimee, don't you understand?

517
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,774
You are this, like, incredibly
gifted genius person,

518
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,643
and you've got all these people around
you telling you that you can't do shit.

519
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,980
And that's gotta stop. You need to
start standing up for yourself.

520
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,949
- How?
- How? I'll teach you.

521
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,818
Take another swig
of that stuff.

522
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,921
Get that, get that down there.
Down the hatch!

523
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,058
Okay. Now repeat after me.

524
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,827
"Mom, get off
my motherfucking back!"

525
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,330
- What!
- Yes!

526
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,698
- No!
- Yeah.

527
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,266
- I can't!
- Say it.

528
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,370
- Mom... Get off of my back.
- No.

529
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,072
- You gotta do the motherfucking.
- I can't.

530
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,274
Yes, you can. Do it. Say it.

531
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,844
- Mom, get off of my fucking back.
- Motherfucking!

532
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:54,551
Fuck! Motherfuck! - Go!

533
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:55,746
Motherfucking!
- Motherfuck, yes!

534
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:59,717
- Get off my motherfucking back, Mom!
- Yes!

535
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,127
God! Yeah!
- God! Motherfucking!

536
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,620
That's good. - That's awesome!

537
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:06,023
Good. Who else?
Who else? I like this.

538
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,959
I don't know. Stay out of my
motherfucking business, Krystal.

539
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,329
- Fuck you, Krystal.
- Yeah, fuck you Krys...

540
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,065
What about...
What about like ex-boyfriends?

541
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,134
- Um...
- We need an ex-boyfriend in there.

542
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,771
- No, I don't have any.
- Who's like an ex-boyfriend that really pissed you off.

543
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:26,110
- That you just, like, hate him and they're just, like...
- I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

544
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,212
- What?
- Yeah.

545
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,247
You don't have a single, you're 17 years
old and you don't have an ex-boyfriend?

546
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,556
No! - Really?
- Guys don't look at me like that.

547
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:31,689
That's shocking.

548
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:32,116
- I mean, guys...
- Yeah, absolutely guys look at you like that.

549
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:37,354
- No, no, no...
- I just saw two guys look at you like that.

550
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,090
Uh, Erik Wolff and Cody Dennis
were 100% hitting on you.

551
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,992
- No, we were just talking.
- A hundred percent.

552
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,994
- No, no, there was absolutely no way...
- Yes, they were.

553
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,964
- Why don't you think they were hitting on you?
- Because I'm just...

554
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,699
- They weren't.
- Because you're what?

555
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,669
- Aimee, you're absolutely beautiful.
- Oh, my God! No.

556
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,087
(GROANING)

557
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,826
(GRUNTING)

558
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,424
SUTTER: <i>Of course</i>
<i>you're going to the prom!</i>

559
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,318
<i>I'll take you.</i>

560
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,387
Please go to
the prom with me, Aimee!

561
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,858
Yes.

562
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,364
- So, you're taking her to prom?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

563
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,267
It's you making plans, Sutter.
It's kind of a big deal.

564
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,772
Relax! I'm just trying
to help this girl out.

565
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,854
- Right, I forgot. Sutter to the rescue.
- Exactly.

566
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,945
(SUTTER HUMMING A TUNE)

567
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,948
And if she falls for you?
What happens then?

568
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,252
Shut up.

569
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,955
Are you kidding me?

570
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,195
VOICEMAIL: <i>Hey, Sutter, it's Aime.
Um...</i>

571
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,331
<i>I didn't know if we were
gonna study today or not,</i>

572
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,501
<i>but I hadn't heard</i>
<i>from you, so...</i>

573
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:35,038
<i>Yeah, yesterday was...</i>
<i>I had a really great time.</i>

574
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,877
<i>Thank you. (GIGGLING)</i>

575
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,312
<i>Okay, I'll talk to</i>
<i>you later. Bye.</i>

576
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,977
- Or the lightning storm.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

577
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,946
On the roof.

578
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,149
That was amazing.

579
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,519
I've never felt like
that with anyone.

580
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,289
- It's not very often.
- Except with you.

581
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,451
Actually, I think I'm feeling it right now.
I'm feeling a moment.

582
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,361
- Stop it. - What?

583
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:37,501
Cass, look, seriously, when we're together
it's like we're invincible or somethin'.

584
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,305
All the shit of the world, like the
responsibilities, all the problems, that stuff,

585
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,308
man, that just disappears
when I'm with you.

586
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,245
Well, you can't just have fun all the time.
You have to be serious.

587
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,215
- Hey, I'm 100% serious.
- Yeah? About what?

588
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,250
About not being serious.

589
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,022
Did you even
apply to college yet?

590
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,591
I don't need college.
Who needs that shit?

591
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,861
Look, I got everything
I need right here.

592
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:08,031
I've got a job, I've got a car, I've got
a beautiful girl sittin' next to me.

593
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,101
You think beauty's in some classroom or
some text book or something and it's not.

594
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:15,172
That's not what it's about. This,
right here, this is beautiful.

595
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,273
All of this...

596
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,376
That's all you need.

597
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,081
You're drunk.

598
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:28,252
I'm drunk. You, whatever, you're drunk.
It doesn't matter.

599
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,188
Okay, whatever,
I'm right, you're right.

600
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,223
I'm just saying
you gotta live in the moment.

601
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,158
The moment? I want...

602
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,363
I want...

603
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,431
I want more than a moment.

604
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,067
- I want...
- What?

605
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,905
I want a future.

606
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,550
And you can't do that.

607
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,922
Wow.

608
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,593
Wow.

609
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,196
(SIGHING) Uh...

610
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,265
Okay.

611
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,262
- (SOBBING) Please just go, Sutter.
- Don't...

612
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,005
Please just go.

613
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,541
All right.

614
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,596
What's up with you and Cassidy?

615
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,367
- Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
- Tell me the truth.

616
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,737
Nothing's up, man. She's moved on.
I've moved on...

617
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,440
- You've moved on?
- We just hang out and we have...

618
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,241
Oh! Okay, wow.
Come on, come on.

619
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,645
We have fun but there's nothing going on.
I promise you.

620
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,059
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

621
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:19,062
Why can't it be me
she has fun with?

622
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,232
- What?
- Why can't it be me that she has fun with?

623
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,002
I'm not like you, Sutter. I don't
know how to make her laugh and stuff.

624
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,070
Dude! You are Marcus West, man.

625
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,539
You are the star athlete,
you're the class president.

626
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:34,478
Like, you are awesome. What's the name
of that charity that you started?

627
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,215
- The Hope Squadron.
- The fucking Hope Squadron, man! That is awesome!

628
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:41,752
- Seriously, you do not need my help. You're the man!
- No, no. It's not the same,

629
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:44,554
okay? Look, the way
she talks about you, man.

630
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,656
I want her to like
me like that. And she doesn't.

631
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,260
Dude, Marcus, trust me.
You don't wanna be like me.

632
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:54,431
I make jokes, yeah. But, I
mean, you get shit done.

633
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,602
You're gonna change the world, man. You
and Cass are perfect together. Trust me.

634
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:02,372
You're just too tense, man. A little tense.
You gotta loosen up, you know?

635
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,241
Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

636
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,476
- Hey, not everything has to be so serious.
- Yeah.

637
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,346
Man, I'm just saying like,
you can relax, you know?

638
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:13,250
You're awesome, man. Enjoy being who you are.
Live in the now.

639
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,485
- Embrace that shit.
- Yeah.

640
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,223
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh,

641
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,259
thanks for talking to me like this, Sutter.
I appreciate it.

642
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,828
- Hey, absolutely, man. Pleasure.
- I appreciate it, I really do.

643
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,797
- Any time.
- Sorry about the...

644
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,066
It's cool. Good.

645
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,474
- Hey, Sutter?
- Hmm?

646
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,243
They're wrong about you.

647
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,145
What's that?

648
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,381
You're not the joke
everyone thinks, man.

649
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,732
GIRL: <i>Just who do</i>
<i>you think you are?</i>

650
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,301
The King of Mexico.

651
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,269
You're not gonna joke
your way out of this, Sutter.

652
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,172
Aimee told me about
your little party by the lake.

653
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,540
And?

654
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,642
- And now you're avoiding her.
- I'm not avoiding her.

655
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,612
Really? Have you seen her since the party?
Have you even called?

656
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,282
Okay, look, why don't you get off my
back a little bit? Give me some space?

657
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,286
- I knew she got that from you. She said the exact same thing.
- Good. Good for her.

658
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,856
No, it's not good for her.
Aimee isn't like you, Sutter.

659
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,692
She's a sweet girl. She doesn't need
you causing problems in her life.

660
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:33,597
Okay, what Aimee doesn't need is you bossing
her around like she's your personal assistant.

661
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
- You shouldn't treat her this way.
- Thank you. Good talk.

- Hi.
- What's up?

(LAUGHING) Nothing. What are
you, what are you doing?

666
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,763
I didn't know you were
coming over today.

667
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,833
Yeah, I wasn't planning on coming
over, but I was driving around

668
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,370
and I thought, "I don't care how busy I am.
I should see what Aimee is doing"

669
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,406
- so, what... How are you doing, Aimee?
- (GIGGLING)

670
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,294
I'm good. I'm really good.
How are you, Sutter?

671
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,276
- I'm, I'm good. - Good.

672
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:25,482
Yeah, listen, my sister, she's having
this, fancy dinner party for her friends

673
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,571
and she's making me go. I

674
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:27,918
didn't know you had a sister?

675
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,288
Yeah, well,
we're not really that close.

676
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,424
Yeah. But, would
you wanna go with me?

677
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,259
- To your... To dinner?
- Yeah.

678
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,495
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Okay. Cool.

679
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,666
- Yeah. What time?
- 10 minutes?

680
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,934
- Oh, 10 minutes from now.
- Yeah.

681
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,202
Okay.

(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

683
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,415
So, then I go back up
to the table and I say,

684
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,951
you know, "Can I get you
boys anything else?"

685
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,137
And then he says...
Okay, I'm gonna let

686
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:03,320
you say it, what did,
what did you say?

687
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:08,291
Well, I leaned back in my chair,
puffed my chest out and I said,

688
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,260
"You can give me
your number, gorgeous."

- That's right.

(CHUCKLING) And I didn't even know
that he was a big fancy lawyer.

691
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,333
You know,
I just gave it to him anyway.

692
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,569
And I am so glad that I did.

693
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,638
And she hasn't worked
a day in her life since.

a breath of fresh air.

Oh, thank you, Sutter.

It's rare to see such
a happy couple nowadays.

699
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,572
I feel like everyone's
getting divorced.

Well, that's not true.

parents, most of my friend's parents...

- Kid's got a point.
- SUTTER: Thank you, Joe.

- Mine didn't.
- I thought you said your parents were divorced.

- No.
- There you go, Sutter. See?

Not everything is doomed.

Well, I mean, he was
a really great guy.

712

He just kind of had like a slight
problem with painkillers, mostly.

Yeah.

714
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,495
It was really crazy. I mean, he
tried to stop a bunch of times,

715
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,430
but my sister came home one day

716
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,632
and he was just lying there
on the kitchen floor.

717
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,035
And she had to, like,
close his eyes and everything.

- It was pretty, yeah, intense.

Sorry. That was really dark.

My husband and I will both
live on a horse ranch and

725
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,958
I will work for NASA

726
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,428
and he'll do something
completely different.

727
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,716
Just so that we offset
each other, you know.

728
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:53,830
Like, we'll have some
things in common

729
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,668
but then we'll also bring all these
different dimensions to the table.

730
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,671
So that, you know,
life doesn't get boring.

I know it's gonna work.

732

what you said at the party?

- You know.
- No, I don't.

Yes. Like the kidding about,
like the prom, or whatever.

742
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,586
Yeah, of course I remember that.
Are you kidding me?

How could I forget
something like that?

No, I just mean like, if
you changed your mind

745
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:58,461
or you didn't wanna go,
or anything, I totally get it.

746
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,097
- What are you talking about?
- No, I just...

747
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,134
I wouldn't have asked you to go
if I didn't wanna go with you.

748
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:08,071
- Look, I know...
- I wouldn't. I wouldn't have.

- Okay.

people change their minds,

- and it's not that big of a deal.
- Not me.

752
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,748
And I'm totally okay
with it if you want to not go.

Listen to me.

754
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,085
I would not have
asked you to go to the prom

755
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,489
if I didn't wanna go
to the prom with you.

756

- Really?
- Really.

00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,496

Look, man, it's under control.

Did it ever cross your mind

763
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:59,556
- that maybe I'm attracted to that girl?
- No! No, not at all.

764
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,192
Yeah. It's because you haven't
really looked at her.

765
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:05,495
I'm telling you, like once you actually,
like, talk to her you see who she is.

know, boyfriend experience.

No way, no!

You and I both know

775
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:28,785
a month tops she'll be done with
me and then she'll move on.

'cause he's been gone
for half my life and...

And no one knows where he is?

831
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:08,798
Um, my mom knows where he is,
but she won't tell me.

832

- What?
- Yeah.

833
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,102
She can't keep him from you.
He's your dad!

I know, but she does. She has.

that's not like...

Mmm-hmm.

of making up to you.

have to get me anything.

I know. I wanted to.

846
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,025
- I wrapped it.
- Should I open it?

847
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:10,226
- Yep.
- Wait, you wrapped this?

848

- It was pretty ugly at first.

She said all these things and
tried to guilt me into staying.

970

But, I just said,

971
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,870
"Look, like if I can afford it
then I'm leaving,"

972
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,840
"and there's really nothing
that you can do about it."

this conversation later, okay?

995
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,338
No wonder he left you.

996
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,656
How do you like the
landscaping we did back here?

997
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,559
Joe and I planted some day lilies back
there, I don't know if you saw them.

998
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,628
- Yeah, it looks really good. It looks really good.
- Really pretty.

999
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,100
So, like I was talking on the phone,
I wanted to ask you about Dad.

1000
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,435
You want to
dredge that up, huh?

1001
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,505
Dredge? What are you talking about?
Dad's not somebody that you dredge.

1002
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,674
He's awesome.

1003
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:21,877
Hey, do you remember he used to tell
stories in the tent in the backyard?

1004
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,146
- Remember that?
- I think that was mostly you.

1005
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,516
Well, do you remember when we
made that trip down to Mexico?

1006
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:30,119
And he had us going up to people asking
where the belt buckle museum was?

1007
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:33,922
And, "Why is there
no artichoke ice cream?"

1008
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,991
That was hilarious!

1009
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,861
- Don't, look... It was funny!
- It was embarrassing.

1010
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:42,164
No, it wasn't. It was funny.
People loved us.

1011
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,534
They loved you because
you were little and cute.

1012
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,104
The guys liked you.
They loved you.

1013
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:52,741
Thought you were a hot little <i>muchacha.
Mmm-hmm, you liked it.</i>

1014
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:53,976
(SIGHING) Well...

1015
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:55,611
Yeah, uh-huh.

1016
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:58,080
He did know how
to make friends, at least.

1017
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,882
Damn right he did.

1018
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,586
So...

1019
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,688
Do you know what happened
between him and mom?

1020
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,524
He cheated on her.

1021
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,627
Yeah. Well,
that's her version of it.

1022
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,629
And you think it's a lie.

1023
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:16,598
I don't think she's lying, but I think
there's two sides to every story.

1024
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,767
- Think about it.
- Sutter...

1025
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,869
Okay look, she won't let us see him. She
won't even let us know where he is.

1026
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:24,006
Let's talk about something else.
How is your friend Aimee?

1027
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:26,041
Okay, no, you gotta admit,
it's a little suspicious.

1028
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,177
I mean, I don't even... She won't
even give me his phone number.

1029
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,212
I can't talk to the guy.

1030
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:36,685
Every time that I ask her for his
number, she refuses to give it to me.

1031
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:40,087
Can you please ask her
for his number for me?

1032
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:43,959
Please?

1033
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,229
I don't have to ask her.

1034
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,102
I know where he is.

1035
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,471
What?

1036
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,884
(DOOR SHUTTING)

1037
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,970
Thank you. Thanks.

1038
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,642
Thanks.

1039
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,515
- Hey, Sutter?
- Hmm?

1040
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,519
Come by for lunch sometime.
Okay?

1041
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,755
Okay. I will. Promise!

1043
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,116

00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:17,019
- Dad?
- <i>No, you got the wrong number.</i>

1045
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,223
- No, it's, it's me, Sutter.
- <i>Sutter?</i>

1046
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,965
- <i>Sutter, how, how you do?</i>
- <i>Uh, yeah, I'm all right.</i>

1047
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:34,303

1051
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,816
<i>You were a hell of a pitch.</i>
<i>You still playing ball?</i>

1052
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:52,321
Wow. Yeah. I'm surprised
that you remember that, Dad.

1053
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:56,191
<i>What are you talkin' about "do I remember that"?
Of course I remember that.</i>

1054
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,961
<i>- Are you still throw?</i>
<i>- Naw, not really.</i>

1055
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:03,699
- Haven't thrown much lately.
- <i>Well, it's a shame. You were a hell of a pitcher.</i>

Yeah. Real good.

That's good. That's good.</i>

1060
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,050
Listen, Dad...

1061
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,416
I was thinking, could I come

1062
01:00:25,442 --> 01:00:27,089
see you sometime? <i>Come see me.</i>

1063
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:32,227
<i>Well, yeah, of course. What do
you mean "can you come see me?"</i>

1064
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:35,897
<i>- You can come see me any damn
time you wanna see. - Really?</i>

Yeah, uh, wow, really?

Dad, that would be so great.
I'd really like that.

AIMEE: <i>How much further is it?</i>

1071
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:55,784
Uh, it's about three hours.

01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,257
- Hey, Aim, thank you.
- For what?

1073
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,027
I wouldn't have done
this without you.

1074
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,070
All right. Here we are.

It's Sutter.

Oh, shit, of course! You, uh...

Oh, man, I...

Look at you. Of course, you...

This is my...
Aimee, this is my dad.

- Aimee, how you doin'?
- Nice to meet you.

1093
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,167
It's very nice to meet you.

1094
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:23,472
It's very nice to see that Sutter's
got immaculate taste in the ladies.

1095
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:27,008
He, uh... He gets that from
his old man, you know.

1096
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,212
He gets that from his old man.
Look at you, man!

1097
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:33,381
Uh, you caught me
at just a bad time right now.

1098
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,351
I was gonna head out to catch
up with some friends of mine,

1099
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,009
but since you're here now, if you wanna
come along, that would be great.

1100
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:40,355
- Yeah.
- Would you like to do that?

1101
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:42,878
Yeah. I'd love to, right?
We'd love to come with you.

1102
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:45,026
Yeah, absolutely.
- Is that right? - Yeah.

1103
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:48,897
Well, listen, take your car and
you can follow me up there.

1104
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,367
It's just up the street and we'll
go get a drink. Sound good?

1105
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,237
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, let's do it.

Sutter, this is the guys.

woman in the entire state.

1108

- This is Roberta.
- Hey. How you doin'?

1109
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,517
Last week you said the country.

1110
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:10,252
And I meant the entire country.

1111
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:13,255
And this, again,
is the amazing Sutter Keely.

1112

amazing uh, lady friend um...

Listen... Hey, let's sit down
over there.

1118
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:36,411
Sit down, I'll get us
some drinks, all right?

- Go on.

01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,420
Hey, Sal. Give me two pitchers.

1121
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,563
You've never been to Key West?

1122
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,032
- No.
- Key West is the place to be.

1123
01:03:57,034 --> 01:04:00,168
Key West has got sunsets...

1124
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,104
That are like
butterscotch sundaes

1125
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:07,576
with strawberry swirl mixed in and
it just melts right into the ocean.

1126
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:10,312
And everybody has got
a drink in their hand

1127
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:13,515
and a smile on their face.
That's Key West.

1128
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,085
- Wow. That sounds perfect.
- Yeah.

1129
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:20,388
It was perfect. And I wish you
could have been there with me.

1130
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,291
So how come you left?

1131
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,327
What do you mean,
how come I left?

1132
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:28,463
Uh, Key West.
How come you left Key West?

1133
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:31,600
'Cause I ran out of money,
that's why I left Key West.

1134
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,270
If I could have stayed down
there I would have, believe me.

1135
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,115
Hey, I'm gonna play
a song on the jukebox.

1136
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:50,185
- Good. You do that, I'll get us a refill.
- Sound good?

1137
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:51,553
All right, yeah.

1138
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,625
Good.

1139
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,100
- Yes. That's it. That's the song.
- Um...

Here we go.

01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:39,000
- Here you go, buddy.
- Thanks, Dad.

1144
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:42,938
- What do you say, Aimee?
- Thank you.

1145
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:46,074
- It's pretty good, huh?
- Thank you. What's that?

1146
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,043
The song. You like the song?

1147
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,011
This?

1148
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,648
Yeah, it's all right.

1149
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,017
This was always
your mother's kinda thing.

1150
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,653
Mom? What?

1151
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:03,224
This is fun. I can't imagine mom
listening to fun music like this.

1152
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,994
What the hell you talkin' about?
When I married your mother,

1153
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,296
your mother was more fun than anyone I knew.
Your mother was

the definition of fun.

1155
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,067
There was nobody more
fun than that.

1156
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:15,170
You know what, don't say anything
bad about your mother either, huh?

1157
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,110
So, uh, what happened?

1158
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,981
What do you mean what happened?

1159
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:30,719
Between you and Mom.
What happened?

1160
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:33,388
Things didn't work out.
That's what happened.

1161
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:39,361
Yeah. Well, you know
she blames you for everything.

1162
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:42,163
- I defend you. I always defend you.
- Well, I appreciate that

1163
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,300
'cause, you know what?
It wasn't all my fault.

1164
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,069
- Yeah, exactly. There's two sides to every story.
- That's right.

1165
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,371
Yeah.

1166
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,306
And no matter what happened
between you guys,

1167
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:55,276
I mean she shouldn't have kicked
you out of the house like that.

1168
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,647
Your mother didn't kick
me out of the house.

1169
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,486
What do you mean?

1170
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:08,289
I mean your mother didn't kick
me out of the house. I left.

1171
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,558
What?

1172
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,095
Let me tell you somethin'.

1173
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:19,267
I had to leave. I wanted to be
there for you. I really did.

1174
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,070
More than anything in the world, I wanted.
You guys meant more to me than anything.

1175
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:25,440
But the fact of the matter is that
things between your mother and I,

1176
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,475
they were very uncool.

1177
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,213
I guess you could say I wasn't
cut out to be a family man,

1178
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:36,584
not in the traditional sense. I did
some things that I'm not proud of.

1179
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,120
But I'll tell you something. I don't
live in the past, I live in the now

1180
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:42,190
because that's what it's all about.
Do you understand that?

1181
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,461
Yeah. Yeah.

1182
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,705
- Hey. Uh...
- Yeah?

1183
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:01,107
Do me a favor, will you? Pick up this tab
real quick, all right? I'll be right back.

1184
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,414
Dad.

1185
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,149
Calm down. The boy found me.

1186
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:11,086
Well, I didn't know that you had a son.
Thanks for that info.

1187
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,488
What? I didn't give him
the damned address!

1188
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,463
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:24,766
Well, I gotta pay the tab
and he doesn't have any money.

1190
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,840
- Do you have some money?
- Yeah.

1191
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,641
This isn't enough.

1192
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,748
- That's all you got?
- Listen, um...

1193
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,519
Roberta's had too much to drink so
I'm gonna give her a ride home,

1194
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:46,454
if you know what I mean.
All right?

1195
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,190
- Do you want us to follow you?
- No, no, no. There's no need for that.

1196
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,559
I won't be more than an hour.

1197
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,661
Yeah, dad, we're not doing anything.
We can totally come...

1198
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,797
- Yeah...
- No, that's not necessary.

1199
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:00,335
You know what'd be best? Why don't you
guys just meet me back at my place, good?

1200
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:04,339
- Yeah, Dad, we came all this way to see you.
- I know you did.

1201
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,542
And I'm glad you did, but I'll meet you
back at my place in about an hour.

1202
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,277
Is that good?

1203
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,480
- Uh, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.
- Yeah, that's fine.

1204
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,418
- All right. I'll see you then.
- Yep.

1205
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:40,875
- We should head back.
- Let's keep waiting. It's only been... Sutter!

1206
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,718
- I'm sure that he wanted to come back.
- Aimee...

1207
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,222
No, if it wasn't for her, I'm sure
he would have come right back.

1208
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,624
Yeah. And if he didn't cheat on my
mom then we'd still be a family

1209
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,760
and I'd be president of
my Sunday school class.

1210
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,497
Sutter.

1211
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:38,800
What?

1212
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,472
I love you.

1213
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,976
It's just...

1214
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,944
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

1215
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:53,448
- Sutter, I love you.
- No, you don't.

1216
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,317
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't, you're wrong.

1217
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,020
Sutter, I'm not wrong.

1218
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,922
- You don't love me.
- Yes, I do!

1219
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,790
You're wrong.
You don't love me,

1220
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:04,592
okay, you're just drunk and
you're grateful that somebody

1221
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,328
- came along and showed interest in you.
- Okay, stop.

1222
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,464
Stop. Do not try
and mess this up!

1223
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,332
Mess what up? What do you
think that this is, Aimee?

1224
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:12,400
What are you talk... Sutter!

1225
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,468
(YELLING)

1226
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,778
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

1227
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,447
- What?
- Are you all right?

1228
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:27,915
- No...
- Are you hurt? Is there anything that...

1229
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:31,352
Aimee, stop. No, I'm not.
I'm far from okay.

1230
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,321
- Jesus!
- Are you hurt?

1231
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,490
Aimee, what is the matter with you?
I almost just killed you

1232
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,891
and you wanna know if I'm okay?

1233
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,026
Yeah, I wanna make sure
that you're okay.

1234
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:40,361
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1235
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,998
Do you not see that I am bad for you?
You need to get away from me!

1236
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,467
- What are you talking about?
- You need to get the fuck away from me!

1237
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,970
Aimee, just...
Get out of my car.

1238
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,805
No, I'm not gonna
get out of your car!

1239
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,309
Get out of my car! Get the
fuck out of my car! Get out!

1240
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,512
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh, my God, Sutter!

1241
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,714
Jesus Christ!

1242
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,749
I'm sorry, Sutter. (SCREAMING)

1243
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:04,319
What are you...
Holy fuck! Aimee!

1244
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:28,609
DOCTOR: I'll give you a choice, kid.
The cops or your parents.

1245
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,705
(MUFFLED VOICES)

1246
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,711
Sutter!

1247
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,447
Now.

1248
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:45,920
It's not an F.

1249
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,092
- I thought you were getting help.
- I am.

1250
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,162
I am.

1251
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:58,099
All right. Well, you need a C on
the final or you fail my class.

1252
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,002
I'll try harder.

1253
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,871
No, you won't.

1254
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:08,843
I don't get you, Sutter. I mean
you're a smart kid. Thoughtful.

1255
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:13,514
- I mean, do you even want to graduate?
- I don't know.

1256
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:17,185
- Excuse me?
- I'm just being honest with you. I... I don't know.

1257
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:19,720
Everyone's telling me I gotta move
on, I don't see what's so great

1258
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,656
about being an adult.

1259
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,126
Are you happy?

1260
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,049
Hi.

1261
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,889
Hey. How you feelin'?

1262
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,591
I'm good. How are you?

1263
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,728
It's good to see you.

1264
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,166
Should we talk about it?

1265
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,504
I agree.

1266
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,573
I'm so sorry, Aimee.

1267
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,675
- Sutter, stop.
- Okay.

1268
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,612
It's okay. I know. It's okay.

1269
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,122
We can just pretend that it,
like, never happened.

1270
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:31,526
We don't ever have to talk
about it again, okay?

1271
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,995
I don't want anything
to get in the way of Philly.

1272
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,068
(SIGHING)

1273
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,205
You're all that matters to me.

1274
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,095
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

1275
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,831
- Hey!
- Hey.

1276
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,513
- Hold this.
- Mmm-hmm.

1277
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,660
- You want some?
- No, I'm good.

1278
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:41,182
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm good.

1279
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,164
Okay.

1280
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,067
Is your family here?

1281
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,969
Naw, I told them
it was next week.

1282
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,640
- Yep. Yeah.
- Really. Okay.

1283
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,780
- Oh, hey, I should probably go say hi to her.
- Okay.

1284
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,286
(CHUCKLING) Well, we made it.

1285
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:40,721
Yeah, I guess we did.

1286
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,671
- I'm really glad.
- Yeah.

1287
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,783
I'm really proud of you, Sutter.
Congratulations.

1288
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,439
Uh, so, when are you
going to Texas?

1289
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,904
I thought that you heard.
I'm not going to Texas.

1290
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,808
I'm going with Marcus.

1291
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,710
California?

1292
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:07,281
- That's right.
- (CHUCKLING) What? Cass...

1293
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,918
- Sutter?
- Come on, man. Are you serious?

1294
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,454
I mean, I don't know, don't you
think that's like a little...

1295
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:16,090
- What?
- I don't know, it seems a little...

1296
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,093
You're really going?

1297
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,162
Yes, I'm really going.

1298
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,768
Well, maybe I'll, you know...

1299
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,171
I could come visit you guys or something.
Never been to California.

1300
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,173
It'd be cool.

1301
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:34,215
I don't think that's
a very good idea, Sutter.

1302
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,944
Yeah.

1303
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:40,748
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
it's not, probably not cool.

1304
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,193
Sorry, it's just I'm, I'm...

1305
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:43,017
Hey. I get it.

1306
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:45,820
- I'm trying to do things...
- It's fine. It's cool.

1307
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,289
...right now that
aren't bad for me.

1308
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,858
I get it.

1309
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,128
Good.

1310
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,496
It's cool. It's cool.

1311
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,333
Sutter.

1312
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,270
(SIGHING)

1313
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,176
I'm not mad at you.

1314
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,311
I know.

1315
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,985
You'll always be
my favorite ex-boyfriend.

1316
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,004
- DAN: Sutter!
- Yeah?

1317
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,239
Pop upstairs, would ya?

1318
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,546
You've probably noticed, uh,

1319
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,448
we haven't been
too busy these days,

1320
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,185
and, uh, because of that,
I can only keep one clerk.

1321
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:55,055
Now, I like you, Sutter,

1322
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,791
but, more importantly,

1323
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:58,559
the customers like you.

1324
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:01,896
(CLEARING THROAT) So I think
you should be the one I keep.

1325
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:05,332
- That's excellent.
- Oh, no, one second. I...

1326
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,567
I've given this
some hard thought,

1327
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:10,004
and, uh, the only way
I can let you stay,

1328
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:12,840
is if you promise me, 100%,

1329
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:16,477
that you will never
come in here loaded again.

1330
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,247
And I'm serious.
Not even a light buzz.

1331
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,283
Because if you do,

1332
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:24,218
then I have to let you go.

1333
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,352
You understand?

1334
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,088
I do.

1335
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,991
So, can you promise?

1336
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,830
You've got me there, Dan.

1337
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,035
You know
I can't promise you that.

1338
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,409
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

1339
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,311
(CLEARING THROAT)

1340
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,213
I've always been
up front with you.

1341
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,588
Thanks for the opportunity.

1342
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,189
- (CLEARING THROAT) Yeah.
- Thank you.

1343
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,592
I suppose if
I was your father, I...

1344
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,194
This is where I might give you
a lecture or something.

1345
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,965
You know, about what
you're doing to yourself.

1346
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:14,007
Well, you know, Dan, if you were
my dad, you wouldn't have to.

1347
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:38,158
MAN OVER INTERCOM: <i>...now boarding for
Washington DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia.</i>

1348
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,603
WOMAN: Miss.
I need to keep going.

1349
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,005
Just two more minutes, please.
I promise.

1350
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:27,374
WOMAN: I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go.

1351
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,642
Okay. Thanks.

1352
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,739
So, yeah, do you think
I did the right thing?

1353
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:01,642
For you or for her?

1354
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,745
You had to let her go.

1355
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,981
You had to save that girl.

1356
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:09,823
That's what I'm saying. I saved her.
I saved her.

1357
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,753
You're not wrong.

1358
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,224
You're a hero. You're a king!

1359
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,593
I'm a king!

1360
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,464
I'm a king!

1361
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:28,602
Look at you, Sutter.
What are you 22, 23?

1362
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:31,739
- Yeah.
- Beautiful!

1363
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:34,742
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

1364
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:37,511
- Hey, so do you, man.
- You think so?

1365
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,680
Absolutely.

1366
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,649
Look at you,
hey, you're a young man.

1367
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,719
- You're, you're a kid.
- I'm a kid?

1368
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,555
You got... You got plenty
of life left in you.

1369
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,524
Hey,

1370
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:55,195
how 'bout we get
a round of shots for us kids?

1371
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,434
(CRASHING)

1372
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,673
Ah, shit! Ah, shit!

1373
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,343
Ah, shit! Shit!

1374
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:48,215
What the hell? Sutter?

1375
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:51,852
Jesus Christ! We just went through this.
What the hell is wrong with you?

1376
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:54,088
- What do you care?
- Excuse me?

1377
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:57,324
- You don't care about me. You've never cared about me!
- Sutter?

1378
01:24:57,326 --> 01:25:00,394
Is it 'cause I remind you of him?
Is that why you hate me, Mom?

1379
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,563
That's why you can't even
stand to look at me? Can you?

1380
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:04,631
What are you talking about?
You're my son!

1381
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,505
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm his son too.

1382
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:08,769
I'm exactly like him.

1383
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,838
You are nothing like him.

1384
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,708
Sutter?

1385
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:17,511
I'll give you your dad's number
and you can go to him and see.

1386
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:20,647
- See how different you are.
- I thought that you didn't want me to see him.

1387
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:24,418
I was... I was trying
to protect you from...

1388
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,522
- I was wrong, okay, so, I want you to go now and...
- I already went.

1389
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:37,231
Holly gave me his number, I drove
up there last week and I saw him.

1390
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:40,400
- You were right, Mom.
- Sutter...

1391
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:43,904
- You were right the whole time.
- You are not your father.

1392
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,576
Sutter, listen to me.

1393
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:53,680
Listen to me. That man... That
man has never loved anyone

1394
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:56,283
but himself.
His heart is this big.

1395
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,420
But you, you love everybody.

1396
01:26:00,422 --> 01:26:04,158
You have the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

1397
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,180
When you were in 3rd grade
and Ricky was on crutches,

1398
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:09,696
do you remember that?
You carried his books.

1399
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:12,666
Carried that back pack
every day.

1400
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:16,203
Or when you were nine and
Rosemary Clark lost her mother,

1401
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:18,639
you invited her
to come live with us.

1402
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:21,575
You told her that
I would be her new mom.

1403
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:27,381
You've always been
so special, Sutter.

1404
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,950
That's why everyone
loves you so much.

1405
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,686
Nobody loves me.

1406
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:40,394
Sutter, you are so wrong. Do you hear me?
You are so wrong.

1407
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,466

had that many hardships.</i>

1410
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,482
<i>Not really.</i>
<i>You know. Shit's happened.</i>

1414

<i>As long as I can remember,</i>
<i>I've never not been afraid.</i>

1416
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,501
<i>Afraid of failure.</i>

1417
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,738
<i>Of letting people down.</i>

1418
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,341
<i>Hurting people.</i>

1419
01:28:01,343 --> 01:28:04,811
<i>Getting hurt.</i>

1420
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:08,482

<i>If I couldn't even feel, well,
then no harm would come to me.</i>

1422
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:17,024
<i>I screwed up. Not only
did I shut out the pain,</i>

1423
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:20,394
<i>I shut out everything.</i>
<i>The good and the bad.</i>

1424
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,364
<i>Until there was nothing.</i>

1425
01:28:25,325 --> 01:28:28,936
<i>It's fine to just</i>
<i>"live in the now".</i>

1426
01:28:28,937 --> 01:28:35,509

there's another one tomorrow.</i>

1430
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:59,666
