1
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,016
- Hi, Cary.
- Hello, Sara.

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,024
As usual, Cary,
you're way ahead of me.

3
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,527
I haven't even had time to think
of my trees, much less get them pruned.

4
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,927
Oh! I can't take
credit for that.

5
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,625
Martin always made the arrangements
with the nursery.

6
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:19,467
After his death, the service
just automatically continued.

7
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,064
Not that i haven't the time. With
the children away except for weekends,

8
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,576
- I've got nothing but time.
- Yes, i know.

9
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,238
That's enough about that.
Let's have our lunch. It's all ready.

10
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,943
- Darling, I can't have lunch.
- Oh?

11
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,282
I would have phoned, but i wanted
to bring back the dishes i borrowed.

12
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,585
Sometimes i think you're smart
not to be a club woman.

13
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,387
Sometimes i wonder,
but it's just not for me.

14
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,395
- I hope you didn't go to trouble.
- I didn't.

15
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,058
It's George. He just phoned.
He's bringing out a weekend guest.

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,432
Last-minute notice, as usual.

17
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,802
What with a hundred other things to do,
i've got to dig up a date tonight...

18
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,138
- For this Mr. Allenby.
- A date?

19
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:01,680
Look, he's 40, which means he'll
consider any female over 18 too old.

20
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,682
We might as well face it.
I've got to be off.

21
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:09,346
Oh, how about joining us tonight
at the club for dinner?

22
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,356
Well, no, Sara,
I don't think I'd better.

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,292
Don't be silly. I'll phone Harvey.
Pick you up around 7:30.

24
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,059
- Harvey?
- Oh, well, at least he's available.

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,396
- Bye, darling.
- Good-bye.

26
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:30,239
- Could i help you, Mrs. Scott?
- Well, yes, thank you.

27
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,013
- Just put it right there.
- All right.

28
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,451
- Would you like some hot coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

29
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,657
Perhaps you'd like
to share my lunch with me.

30
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,695
My friend couldn't stay. I have plenty
of food. Chicken, salad and rolls.

31
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,063
- Just a roll and some coffee will do.
- All right.

32
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,898
- Won't you sit down?
- Mm-hmm.

33
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,680
I was just wondering
if there's much to be done.

34
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,846
- Everything looks so wonderful.
- Not much.

35
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:33,037
Do you think you'll finish today
or will you have to come back?

36
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,733
Well, probably will.

37
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,241
I often wish I knew more
about gardening.

38
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,646
Do you think
I ought to take it up?

39
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,710
Only if you think
you'd like it.

40
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:54,384
- I'm Mrs. Scott.
- Yes, I know.

41
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,863
- I'm Ron Kirby.
- Oh, you're Mr. Kirby's son.

42
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,664
Mm-hmm. I took over the nursery
three years ago when my father died.

43
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,967
Have you been coming here
ever since?

44
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,338
Mm-hmm. Every spring and every autumn.

45
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,674
This may be my last year.

46
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,808
At agricultural school, I got interested
in trees. So I started growing them.

47
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,284
- What kind of trees?
- All kinds.

48
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,020
White fir, Douglas fir,
silver tip spruce.

49
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,256
- Do I have any?
- [Chuckles] No.

50
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,802
But you have some
just as interesting.

51
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,168
Like this Koelreuteria.

52
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:44,733
In china where it comes from,
they call it the Golden Rain tree.

53
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,374
Beautiful, isn't it?

54
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,144
They say it can only thrive
near a home where there's love.

55
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,947
- It's a beautiful legend.
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,286
Well, I'd better
get back to work.

57
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,190
Thank you for the coffee.

58
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,965
- [Girl] Mother?
- [Boy] Hey, Mother!

59
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,636
Here I am!

60
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,045
Hello, darling!
- Hi!

61
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,050
- Ned
- Hi, mom.

62
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,211
I didn't expect you home
until tomorrow.

63
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,346
I didn't have a class today
so I phoned Kay from Princeton...

64
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,415
I was catching up on some case
histories... bane of the social worker...

65
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,927
- So I brought them along.
- When's dinner?

66
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,054
I've been invited out
for dinner.

67
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,463
- Where are you going?
- Sarah's giving a party at the club.

68
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,933
I'll have to get dressed. Harvey's
going to pick me up in a little while.

69
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,335
Harvey?

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,898
Oh, that's all right.
I'll go fix the cocktails.

71
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,413
- Harvey likes my martinis.
- Ned, the martini wizard.

72
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,645
- Have you been seeing much of Harvey?
- No, dear, he's been out of town.

73
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,947
- Florida, I think.
- I like Harvey.

74
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,148
He's pleasant, amusing,
and he acts his age.

75
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,352
If there's anything I can't stand,
it's an old goat.

76
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:13,956
As Freud says, when we reach
a certain age, sex becomes incongruous.

77
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,728
I think Harvey understands that.

78
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,272
- All in all, he's remarkably civilized.
- ????[Orchestra]

79
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,035
And the only bachelor
around here.

80
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,406
I'll admit,
he does have his drawbacks.

81
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,672
He talks too much
about his health,

82
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,442
but when you get to be his age,
it's understandable.

83
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,745
Of course, it's normal to
fall apart as one grows older.

84
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,286
But I can see
it might be hard to accept.

85
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,552
Although naturally it doesn't matter
as much with men as it does with women.

86
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,924
But, I guess Harvey's
intelligent enough anyway to...

87
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,997
Are you reading this?

88
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,492
- What, dear?
- [Wolf Whistle]

89
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,163
It's about time you wore something
besides that old black velvet.

90
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,900
- Is it?
- Of course.

91
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,535
Personally, I never subscribed
to that old Egyptian custom.

92
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,806
- At least I think it was Egypt.
- What egyptian custom?

93
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,816
Of walling up the widow alive in the
funeral chamber of her dead husband...

94
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,886
along with
his other possessions.

95
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,683
The theory being that
she was a possession too.

96
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,750
She was supposed to journey into death
with him. The community saw to it.

97
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,491
- Of course, that doesn't happen anymore.
- Doesn't it?

98
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,999
Well, perhaps not in Egypt.

99
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,501
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing. Let's go downstairs.

100
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,377
Holy cats, Mother.

101
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,181
I've had it for quite a while.
I just haven't worn it.

102
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,481
- Do you like it?
- I guess it's all right.

103
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,919
- But isn't it cut kind of low?
- [Doorbell Ringing]

104
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,923
Hope it doesn't
scare Harvey off.

105
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,825
- A typical Oedipus reaction.
- A what?

106
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,194
A son subconsciously resents his
mother being attractive to other men.

107
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,392
We call it an Oedipus complex.

108
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,130
- Happens all the time.

109
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,571
- Good evening, Harvey.
- Cary, my dear! Well!

110
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,540
- And Kay!
- Hi, Harvey.

111
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,169
- You'll have a cocktail before you go?
- We have time.

112
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,274
- He's mixed it especially for you.
- Thank you.

113
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,444
- We've missed you.
- I'm glad.

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,990
- Did you enjoy Florida?
- Perfect, Kay, perfect. Cary!

115
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,684
I discovered one of the most
wonderful doctors down there.

116
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,694
Cured one of my eternal colds,
like that!

117
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,391
- Mom, Harvey, the Scott special.
- Thank you, Ned.

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,028
- Thank you.
- Mmm!

119
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,129
Excellent, my boy! Excellent!

120
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,936
I'm not sure the gin is as good
as the brand i usually use,

121
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,943
but the vermouth is fair.

122
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,206
[Kay] You mean
those two little drops you put in?

123
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,943
Kay, I hope for the sake
of my liver you've miscounted.

124
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,521
Cary, you're looking
lovely tonight.

125
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,080
- That color becomes you.
Well, thank you, Harvey.

126
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,628
Ned was afraid the dress
might frighten you.

127
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,825
It would take more...
perhaps I should say, less to scare me.

128
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,562
No, thank you, Ned.
One cocktail is my limit.

129
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,003
You know,
my reform started...

130
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,508
the night your father
won this trophy.

131
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,069
He filled it with champagne
and made us drink it.

132
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,308
[Sighing]
I can still remember it.

133
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,853
- How many of you were there?
- Not enough.

134
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,890
- I think we better start, don't you?
- Yes, Harvey.

135
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,499
- Cary! Hi, Harvey.
- Hello, Bill.

136
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,731
- We never see you anymore.
- Cary, dear, it's been ages.

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,571
Ann and I were laughing
the other night about the time Martin...

138
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,773
Here you are. You can have her later.
Come on, darling.

139
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,874
[Man] Cary!
My favorite woman. What'll it be?

140
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,510
- We had a martini at the house...
- Never switch the pitch.

141
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,919
- Same for you?
- Nothing for me. I've had my quota.

142
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,084
You'll need more than one to see you
through this party, all my fault too.

143
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,423
- And i've got him for the whole weekend.
- George! Hush.

144
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,930
Tom, Cary. I want you to meet
Miss Frisbee, Mr. Allenby, Mrs. Scott.

145
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,933
- Mrs. Scott.
- How do you do?

146
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,936
Hello. I've been telling
your Mr. Allenby...

147
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,700
He's awfully hard to resist.

148
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,707
Seems to be mutual.

149
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,800
- Sara!
- Hello, Sara, Cary.

150
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,879
Did you see? The Nortons
are here together. After all the talk...

151
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,847
- What talk?
- You know what everyone said.

152
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,247
- No, but i'm sure you do.
- [Clearing Throat]

153
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,584
Cary, oh, darling! How wonderful
to see you. I hardly recognized her.

154
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,557
It's indecent to have two grown
children and look as young as you do.

155
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,288
There's nothing like red for
attracting attention, is there?

156
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,059
I suppose that's why so few widows wear
it. They'd have to be so careful.

157
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,067
- Hello, Howard.
- Hi!

158
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,195
- How about a dance?
- [Sara] Go ahead, Cary.

159
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,103
All right. I'd like to.

160
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,836
That was a horrid thing to say, Mona.

161
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,844
What do you mean?

162
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,574
I was only trying to cheer her up
by telling her how lovely she looked.

163
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,174
- But she didn't seem to need it.
- Shall we have a drink?

164
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,016
- How are mary and the children?
- Everybody's down with the flu.

165
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,717
- I'm sorry.
- House is like a hospital.

166
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,693
Now i'm glad i did.
[Chuckles]

167
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:16,234
You're beautiful, Cary.
Too beautiful to be lonely.

168
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,107
I can never decide whether Howard's
wife is a saint or just not very bright.

169
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,473
She stays at home alone
night after night.

170
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,775
- Yes, but she has the children.
- Even if she hasn't got Howard?

171
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:34,012
- What does that mean?
- Don't bristle. Did i mention cary?

172
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,749
I'm beginning to think
you have an evil mind.

173
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,825
Now, really.

174
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:48,363
- It's much nicer out here, isn't it?
- Yes.

175
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,368
That's where they're going
to build a new swimming pool.

176
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,370
- Oh?

177
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,072
That's a wonderful place for it.

178
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,702
When do you think they'll...

179
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,640
Why don't we meet in new york?
I know a place.

180
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,778
Howard, let's forget
you said that.

181
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,254
I'm sorry, Cary.
I don't know what got into me.

182
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,628
I know you're not like that.
I apologize for what I said.

183
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,566
That's all right, Howard.

184
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,070
- But I don't apologize for wanting you.
- [Sighs]

185
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,339
Why didn't Ned tell me
about you before?

186
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,212
Think of all the time
we've wasted.

187
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,845
You're off on a tangent.
Your values are confused.

188
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,855
I don't get it.

189
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:50,554
The basic values of the sex attraction
between man and woman are...

190
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,393
Oh, Mother and Harvey.

191
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,332
Well, i'll try to explain,
but not here.

192
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,568
Here you are.

193
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,043
- Would you like a nightcap?
- No, thank you, Cary.

194
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,445
It's way past my bedtime.
It's been a wild night for me.

195
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,541
I've enjoyed every minute of it.
I always enjoy being with you.

196
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,586
Thank you.
I feel the same.

197
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,588
- Have your key?
- Yes.

198
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,286
Now do you understand that much?

199
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,729
Frankly, no. But...

200
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,529
All right, I'll...
I'll try again.

201
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,238
Cary...

202
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,679
I don't know whether you're ready
to think about marrying again.

203
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,548
Well, no, l...
I don't think I'm ready.

204
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,248
Of course I realize I'm not
very romantic or impetuous...

205
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,088
But then, you'd hardly
want that sort of thing.

206
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,027
I'm sure you feel as I do.

207
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,033
That companionship and affection
are the important things.

208
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,538
I could give you those, Cary.

209
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,947
Well, I won't press you
for a decision now.

210
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,515
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Harvey.

211
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:34,128
You really didn't want to be
a football captain. You wanted love.

212
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,031
- Yes.
- No, not the romantic nonsense.

213
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,537
I mean, basic love,
the desire to be liked.

214
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,870
Football was merely
a means to the end.

215
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,410
Of course,
you do have the build for it.

216
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,174
How can anyone so little
be so smart?

217
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,306
And yet so pretty?

218
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,525
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- Well, how long does this go on?

219
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,531
Oh, you mean the pruning.

220
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,101
He was supposed to come back
a couple of weeks ago and finish up.

221
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,263
- I almost gave him up for lost.
- The independent type, huh?

222
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,603
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Sara.

223
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,843
Hello there.

224
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,506
Hello.

225
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,674
I thought you deserted us.

226
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,878
- I've had a busy week.
- Busy two weeks.

227
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,547
- Have you been buying more trees?
- How did you guess?

228
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,285
Well, l... I was just going to make
some fresh coffee.

229
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,454
- Would you like some?
- No, thank you. I'm all finished.

230
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,556
That means we're not going
to see you again until next spring.

231
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,501
I won't be coming back
next spring.

232
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,664
I'm giving up
my maintenance work.

233
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,867
Growing trees
is a full-time job.

234
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,137
At least the way
I want to do it.

235
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,543
Don't worry.
I'll find you someone.

236
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,616
Thank you.

237
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:36,416
Well, I guess this is good-bye.
I wish you luck with your trees.

238
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,652
- Remember the silver tip spruce?
- Yes?

239
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,523
I was wondering,
if you're not too busy,

240
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,530
you might like to come over
to my place and see them.

241
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,094
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't today.

242
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,570
Oh, well, of course,
if you can't.

243
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,405
- Oh, Mr. Kirby.
- Yes, Mrs. Scott?

244
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,717
Well, I was just thinking
that maybe if...

245
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,515
You've changed your mind?

246
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,988
All right! Let's go!

247
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,906
It certainly is
out in the woods.

248
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,884
- Not what you expected?
- I thought you lived here.

249
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,887
I do.

250
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,963
I can see that a woman might not
like it, but it does very well for me.

251
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,538
If one likes to live
in a glass house.

252
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,574
At night when I'm in bed
I can see the stars in the sky.

253
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,769
- And you have your plants.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,342
- What a lovely color.
- That's a coleus.

255
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,013
The one on the other side
is a dracaena.

256
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,215
Grows into sort of a tree.

257
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,885
- Oh, where are the trees?
- Right outside.

258
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,362
After you.

259
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,662
Of course, they're only
five year olds, but...

260
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,569
Five years to grow that?
Don't you ever get impatient?

261
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,608
If you're impatient,
you have no business growing trees.

262
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,941
Someday I'm gonna tear down the old mill
and put in more silver tip spruce there.

263
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,039
- What's in the old mill?
- Oh, nothing.

264
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,846
Could we go in?
I love to poke around old buildings.

265
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,088
[Door Creaking]

266
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,238
That's the old millstone.
Grandpa used to grind his flour here.

267
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,543
Watch the cobwebs.

268
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,892
That's the loft where
he used to store his grain.

269
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,056
Oh!

270
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,536
Oh, look.

271
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,742
Oh! Wedgwood.
If we could only find the pieces.

272
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:49,837
- What would you do with it?
- I'd steal it. I love wedgwood.

273
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,180
It was probably thrown there
because the pieces were missing.

274
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,380
Better leave it.

275
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,816
Seen enough?

276
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,329
No, I haven't even started.

277
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,423
I suppose these old beams
are rotted.

278
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,402
No, they're oak.
They're good for another hundred years.

279
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,173
And the stairs?
What's up there?

280
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,477
I don't know.
I haven't been there since I was a kid.

281
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,144
- It's pretty dirty... full of cobwebs.
- Oh, I don't mind.

282
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,215
Did the bird
frighten you, Mrs. Scott?

283
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,286
Well, it...
it would frighten anyone.

284
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,466
A fireplace.
Why, that makes it perfect.

285
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,472
Perfect? For what?

286
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,338
Why, a perfect place
for you to live.

287
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,345
It would take a lot of work,
but it'd be worth it.

288
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,473
- I've got a place to live.
- Oh.

289
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,051
You don't intend to live
in that room all your life.

290
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,145
- I hadn't thought about it.
- You'll have to one of these days.

291
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,748
- You'll meet a nice girl...
- I've met plenty of girls.

292
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,158
Nice and otherwise.

293
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,395
Well, not the right one.

294
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,095
And when you do...
Or do you think you're not susceptible?

295
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,196
No. I don't think that.

296
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,972
Well, it's getting
a little late.

297
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,210
I'm sorry. I wasn't
trying to arrange your life.

298
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,348
After all, it's
none of my business.

[Door Creaking, Closing]

301
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,002
I'm going upstate to buy some trees
for some friends of mine.

302
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll be gone a couple of weeks.
I'll see you when I get back.

- Hello, Sara.

I dropped by to invite you for dinner
tonight. Mona and Mark are coming.

- Mona?
- I know, but I owe them a dinner.

307

Besides, Mona can be amusing
unless you happen to be her target.

I suppose I should say yes. I haven't
been out since harvey left town.

But mona...
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

You can't sit around here
with nothing to do.

311
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,441
You should at least
get a television set.

- Oh, no!
- Why?

Because it's supposed
to be the last refuge for lonely women?

314

That's very sweet of you,
but I don't want a television.

315
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,326
All right, but I've already spoken
to the local television man about you.

00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,031
- Cary?
- Yes, Sara?

326
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,659
- Mrs. Warren, this is Mr...
- Kirby.

327
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,534
How do you do? I can't stay.
I'll see you tonight.

328
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,044
Would you be terribly disappointed
if I didn't come tonight?

329
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:51,138
Of course not! I understand if you're
not in the mood for Mona's gossip.

330
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,582
- We'll make it next week. Bye.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Warren.

331
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,456
You are coming.

332
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,363
Well... Yes.

333
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:12,527
It'll be cold by the time we get back.
Better take a warm coat.

334
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,514
Hey, Mick!

335
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,921
I'll be right back.
Hey, Mick!

336
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,529
- Hi, Ron.
- Hi.

337
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,473
- Hi!
- [Ron] Hi!

338
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,513
- I'd like you to meet Mick and Alida.
- How do you do?

339
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,515
- Hello.
- Hello, Cary.

340
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,517
What a nice surprise.
Come on upstairs.

341
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,610
- You're just in time for the clambake.
- Good!

342
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,212
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

343
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,723
- It's a little chilly in here.
- I'll have a fire in a moment.

344
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,726
I'll take your coat.

345
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,058
- Say, Ron, why don't you start it?
- Okay.

346
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:15,223
I'll make an anderson special, a talent
I developed on the ulcer circuit.

347
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,563
Freely translated,
the advertising business.

348
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,298
You wouldn't believe it,
but he was once a v.i.p. In New York.

349
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,900
No, you're the one that taught him
to be a very independent person.

350
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,502
The only thing he ever taught me was
how to open a wine bottle with my teeth.

351
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,241
To hear them tell it,
you'd think they spent the war...

352
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,510
crawling from
wine cellar to wine cellar.

353
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:37,384
- [Ron] We did!
- Make cary comfortable, will you, Ron?

354
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,947
All right.
Sit down, Cary.

355
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,960
- What did you say about me outside?
- When?

356
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,395
When he looked at me
and laughed.

357
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,662
I told him you had the prettiest legs
I'd ever seen.

358
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,738
- Here is the Anderson special.
- Oh, it's heavy!

359
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,965
Put the cauldron on the fire,
will you, old man?

360
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,304
- You're in for a shore dinner.
- Hope you like it.

361
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,344
- I do.
- Good!

362
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,505
- Here you are, Cary. Alida.
- Thank you.

363
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,518
Here's to those who wish us well, and
those that don't can go to hackensack.

364
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,145
Salud.

365
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,554
- How do you like it?
- Marvelous. What's in them?

366
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,924
First you get some ice, two jiggers
of clements, a little twist of...

367
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,327
Mick, stop it!

368
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,801
- You can help me bring up some wine.
- We'll be right back.

369
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,395
- How many are coming tonight?
- You never can tell.

370
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,998
That's so true.
You never know with that boy.

371
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,010
Which means I better get busy.

372
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,673
- Can I help you?
- Oh, no, make yourself comfortable.

373
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:55,662
''The mass of men lead lives
of quiet desperation.

374
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,203
''Why should we be in such
desperate haste to succeed?

375
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,645
''Lf a man does not keep pace
with his companions,

376
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,544
''perhaps it is because
he hears a different drummer.

377
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,482
'' Let him step to the music
which he hears, however measured...

378
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,214
or far away.''

379
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,086
- Why, that's beautiful.
- That's mick's bible.

380
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,659
He quotes from it
constantly.

381
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,288
- Please let me help.
- All right. Come on.

382
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,025
Kind of heavy.

383
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,126
- Is it Ron's bible too?
- Hmm?

384
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,797
I don't think Ron's ever read it.
He just lives it.

385
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:39,400
- Put it in the middle.
- All right.

386
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,445
Thank you.

387
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,878
- Alida?
- Hmm?

388
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:48,851
What did you mean when
you said that ron taught Mick?

389
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:53,822
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain.

390
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:58,294
I guess all of us
are looking for security these days.

391
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:02,765
You see, Mick thought...
Well, like a lot of other people...

392
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,860
that if he had money and an important
position it would make him secure.

393
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,771
Then when he met Ron who didn't have
either one and didn't seem to need them,

394
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,002
He was completely baffled.

395
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,810
The answer was so simple it took
Mick a long time to figure it out.

396
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,009
What was the answer?

397
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,316
To thine own self be true.
That's Ron.

398
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,290
You see, Ron's security
comes from inside himself.

399
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,293
Nothing can ever
take it away.

400
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:35,059
Ron absolutely refuses to let
unimportant things become important.

401
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,432
That's what Mick
and I were doing. We were.

402
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,439
In fact, things got so bad
between us that...

403
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,704
right before he went to Korea
we were thinking of a separation.

404
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,679
Oh, no.
You seem so happy.

405
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,685
Not then.
We weren't happy then.

406
00:30:55,787 --> 00:31:00,053
Our whole life was devoted
to keeping up with theJoneses.

407
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,855
But when Mick was wounded
and had a lot of time to think,

408
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,056
He decided to get off
that merry-go-round.

409
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,100
When he came back,
he put it right up to me.

410
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,032
- [Woman] Alida!
- Yeah?

411
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,832
My room's a mess,
but don't bother. I'm off!

412
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,306
- Wait!
- I can't, I'm late. See you tomorrow.

413
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:23,039
- Mary Ann! What time?
- I don't know. In the afternoon.

414
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,741
- [Mary Ann] Ron!
- [Ron Chuckling] Mary Ann!

415
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,148
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Why, sure.

416
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,153
- [Mary Ann] Now I'm disappointed.
- Why?

417
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,918
I thought it was just another
of Mick and Alida's get-togethers.

418
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:38,052
- If i'd known... I want a rain check.
- Name it.

419
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,892
- To go swimming with you again.
- It's too cold.

420
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,593
- How about sailing then?
- Fine.

421
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,898
- Before it gets too cold for that too.
- I have a windbreaker.

422
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,667
- What about me?
- You'll be warm enough.

423
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,174
You never take me seriously.

424
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,177
[Alida]
Drive carefully, Mary Ann!

425
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,941
My young cousin.
She's spending the winter with us.

426
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,883
She thought our party sounded dull, so
she arranged to stay with a girlfriend.

427
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,887
- Think this will be enough?
- Yes.

428
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,048
Mick, would you give me a hand,
darling?

429
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,456
What have you been doing? I thought
you'd have the heavy work done.

430
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,120
- Put the bottles down.
- Think 16 will be enough?

431
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,963
- With this crowd? Thanks.
- You betcha.

432
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:21,835
Oh, no, thanks, honey, but there's some
tablecloths in the right-hand drawer.

433
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,000
- Lobsters have arrived!
- Look, I got 'em!

434
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,043
Hey, Manuel! Thank you!

435
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,136
I caught myself
this morning!

436
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,080
- This is Manuel, the lobster king.
- Hello!

437
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,981
My pleasure.
She's beautiful! My wife Rozanne.

438
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,350
! Que bonita!
! Tanto gusto!

439
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,480
- Mi hija, Marguerita.
- How do you do?

440
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,286
Marguerita is a very good cook.
She makes this corn bread...

441
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,954
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your paws off!

442
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,057
- [Rozanne] Alida!
- It's so good seeing you.

443
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,626
You will love the lobsters.
Mick, let me help you.

444
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,933
Well, Grandpa! How are ya?
Let me take your coat.

445
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,635
Cary, this is Grandpa Adams.
He's a beekeeper and artist.

446
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,212
- You must see his one-man show.
- Why, I hope to.

447
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,306
Of course, Miss Cary, I'm not
an abstractionist. Strictly primitive.

448
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,749
- You know everybody here.
- [Alida] Come on in, Grandpa!

449
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,014
Edna, what a beautiful cake!

450
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:15,616
Meet Miss Pidway, head of the Audubon
Society and an outstanding bird-watcher.

451
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,820
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

452
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,023
- Glass of wine, Manuel?
- Two glasses of wine for Manuel!

453
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:25,501
- A dollar says you can't.
- Why, put it on your bill.

454
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,003
I've never seen this
done before.

455
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,367
- I wouldn't try that with my new teeth!
- Oh, no.

456
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,448
? My, my, my
I have rovey eye ?

457
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,254
? How he fly
all around the town ?

458
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,886
? Eye, eye, eye
every passerby ?

459
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:56,524
? He look-a her up
he look-a her down
ooh-hoo ?

460
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,966
?? Ooh-hoo ??

461
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,538
- ??Lady, what a pleasant view ??
- Thank you.

462
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,443
? I make the flirty eye
at you ?

463
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,003
??My, my, my, no more rovey eye
No more fly ??

464
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,208
? All around the town ?

465
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,717
? Not since I find
a passerby ?

466
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,516
? She look-a me up
Me look-a her down ?

467
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,523
? She and me we go to town ?

468
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,150
Hey, Mick, take over.

469
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:39,209
- Hey! [Muttering]
- [Laughing]

470
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,183
- Faster, mick!

471
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,439
Hey, everybody!
The lobsters!

472
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,450
[Alida]
Get 'em out of the way. There!

473
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,234
- Mrs. Scott?
- Yes?

474
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm Mr. Week. Mrs. Warren told me
you might be interested in television.

475
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,510
Most of my ladies tell me
tv gives them something to do.

476
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,516
Mrs. Warren has made a mistake.
I'm not interested in television.

477
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,609
I'm in a terrible hurry.
Will you excuse me?

478
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,212
May I call again, Mrs. Scott...

479
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,087
When you called me
to hurry, I hurried.

480
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,092
Did you have anything better to do
of a Saturday afternoon?

481
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,958
No, as a matter of fact, the children
aren't coming up this weekend.

482
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,928
After you.

483
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,966
Oooh!

484
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,672
What you've done to it!

485
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:56,813
And the fireplace!
Oh, it's so friendly.

486
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,251
And you put in
this big window.

487
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,948
What a beautiful view
of the pond.

488
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,082
- Why, you can see for miles!
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,889
- The sun comes up right over that hill.
- Oh!

490
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,397
- Do you like it?
- Why, it's unbelievable.

491
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,491
Let's take your boots off, huh?

492
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,502
Of course, there's a lot of work to
be done yet, but it'll be worth it.

493
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:30,673
- Your feet are cold.
- I know. They're frozen.

494
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,615
- The teapot. You found all the pieces.
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,917
It took days and days.
[Chuckles]

496
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,328
These stairs are
moving to the loft.

497
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,992
I'll add the bedroom up there.

498
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,594
The old millstone
I'm trying to make into a table.

499
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,513
You know why i've started
to fix the place?

500
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,175
I didn't want to say anything until
I knew I could make it livable...

501
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,617
for us.

502
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,224
Do you understand
What I'm saying, Cary?

503
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,657
Yes.

504
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,491
I'm asking you to marry me.

505
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,224
I love you, Cary.

506
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:39,148
L... I just hadn't
thought about marriage.

507
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,151
Why do you think
i've been seeing you?

508
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,619
I didn't think.

509
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,419
- Can't you see it's impossible?
- No.

510
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,120
This is the only thing
that matters.

511
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,098
No. There are
other things that matter.

512
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:01,137
The children... How could I ask them
to give up their home?

513
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,298
Home is where you are, Cary.

514
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,809
But the kind of life you lead,
l... I don't know that life.

515
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,812
How could I make sure
it would work out?

516
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,906
You can't, Cary.
You can't!

517
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,976
Don't you see I'd be turning my back
on everything I've ever known?

518
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:21,582
- Isn't it enough we love each other?
- No, cary.

519
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:26,561
It isn't.
It isn't enough for either of us.

520
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:31,567
You're running away from something
important because you're afraid.

521
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,637
- Afraid?
- Mm-hmm.

522
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:37,697
- Of what?
- Many things.

523
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,474
Perhaps you're right.

524
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,745
It's absurd
to think of marriage.

525
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,821
- It's out of the question.
- Cary!

526
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,653
The hours
you've spent mending it.

527
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,694
Doesn't matter.

528
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,576
Cary.

529
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,716
Don't forget your boots.

530
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,581
I'll help you.
You mustn't catch cold.

531
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,196
Darling, don't cry.

532
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:18,136
Oh, Ron,
I love you so much.

533
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,729
What are you
thinking about?

534
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,260
That I love you.

535
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,941
It won't be easy.

536
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,039
There will be
a lot of things that...

537
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,486
You'll have to help me.

538
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,558
I'll help all I can.

539
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,041
- It's getting late.
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,742
Does it matter?

541
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,012
I'll take you home.

542
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,067
[Man] I sent the boy up
with the roast twice on saturday.

543
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,071
I kept phoning
up till 9:00 in the evening.

544
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,266
I'm sorry,
but I completely forget.

545
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,175
- Hello, Mrs. Plash.
- Hello. I was just thinking about you.

546
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,474
- Pleasantly, I hope.
- Of course.

547
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,779
I was telling Mrs. Scott
I couldn't figure out where she was.

548
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,479
- I even phoned the club.
- Oh?

549
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,684
The children weren't coming up so
I decided to go away for the weekend.

550
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,761
- I'll take my roast now.
- Glad you had a chance to get away.

551
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,830
- Where did you go, darling?
- Upstate.

552
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,593
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mona.

553
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,448
It's comforting to know
she's not lonely, Mr. Gow.

554
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:48,352
Mona Plash is such a gossip.

555
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,292
It'll be all over town
by tomorrow, I'm afraid.

556
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:55,764
I hate to have the children learn
about us before I tell them.

557
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,494
Then you'd better tell them.

558
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,196
It should be so simple.

559
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,105
Two people who are in love
with each other, want to be married.

560
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,143
Why is it so difficult
all of a sudden?

561
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,873
It isn't,
if you're not afraid.

562
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,439
That's what Mick
learned from you, isn't it?

563
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,612
No. You can't learn that
from anybody.

564
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:25,623
Mick discovered for himself that
he had to make his own decisions,

565
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,062
that he had to be a man.

566
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,101
And you want me to be a man.

567
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,966
Only in that one way.

568
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,303
Mona certainly didn't
waste any time, did she?

569
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,779
I suppose the whole town's
talking about it.

570
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:48,010
Well, she phoned me.
That's why I rushed over.

571
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,178
Of course,
I didn't believe a word.

572
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,950
You should.

573
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:58,586
You can't be serious.
Your gardener?

574
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,062
He isn't my gardener.

575
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:04,066
He did work on the trees.
You met him.

576
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,467
And even if he was,
I'm in love with him.

577
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,597
And I'm going to marry him.

578
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,174
Well, all right,
maybe I'm a snob.

579
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,217
But it isn't just a question
of whether he's a gardener.

580
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,252
The talk won't stop at that.

581
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,789
They'll say he's
younger than you are.

582
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,688
- And the fact that you're a widow.
- What does that got to do with it?

583
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:33,160
- With money.
- Ron isn't interested in my money.

584
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,562
And that he worked at your place
while Martin was still alive.

585
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:40,933
People will say that all this started
before your husband died.

586
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,974
- But that's not true. You...
- I don't!

587
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,670
But Mona? Ha!
Mona will have a field day.

588
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,772
Before she gets through,
the whole town will believe it.

589
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,852
You know, Cary, as well as I do
that situations like this...

590
00:45:55,953 --> 00:46:00,322
bring out the hateful side
of human nature.

591
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,757
Remember you have
Ned and Kay to think about.

592
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,887
At their age,
what people say matters terribly.

593
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,626
Have you stopped to think
what all these rumors will do to them?

594
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:15,068
You're asking me to give up Ron because
of something in people that's mean?

595
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,834
- I didn't say that.
- Do you think it would be good...

596
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:22,742
if I were to let myself be
beaten by such hatefulness?

597
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,475
Well, I'm not gonna do it.

598
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,814
Let them say what they want to.

599
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,287
And that goes for you too, Sara.

600
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:39,885
I must say, Cary,
you've got stubbornness.

601
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,864
And courage.

602
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,736
If you want to throw me out,
I won't blame you.

603
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,808
I apologize.
At least I can do that much.

604
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:55,470
You don't have
to apologize, Sara, just...

605
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,638
just go on being my friend.

606
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,239
I'd be a fool not to do that.

607
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,979
I've got to give a cocktail party
this weekend for that moron Jo-Ann.

608
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,612
She bagged Tom Allenby.

609
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:11,387
You bring Ron.
Maybe if people see him,

610
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,625
maybe if they get to know him,
they'll accept him.

611
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:22,004
Well, I'll call him.

612
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,382
Good evening, Mrs. Plash.

613
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,010
- Hello, ned. You home for the weekend?
- Yes, I am.

614
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,113
Just wait until you see your mother.
She's never looked so radiant.

615
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:44,285
- I wish I knew her secret.
- Thank you, Mrs. Plash.

616
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,362
- Lf you'll excuse me, I've got to hurry.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,988
Yoo-hoo, Mildred!
How was New York?

618
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,903
Mother?

619
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,038
I'm home!
Where are ya?

620
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,605
I'm in the basement, dear.
I'll be up in a minute.

621
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,982
- Ned?
- Yeah.

622
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,961
- How are you, dear?
- What were you doing in the cellar?

623
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,224
I was putting some things
away in the storage closet.

624
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,391
Everything was getting
so cluttered.

625
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,402
Where's Kay? She and Freddie
were supposed to drive up together.

626
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,836
She's upstairs.
We've been waiting for you.

627
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,408
Why all the mystery when
you phoned? Who's coming?

628
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,981
Oh, mother, I hope you don't mind
my borrowing your manicure set.

629
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,849
Which is better?
Crimson snow or traffic light?

630
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:48,049
[Ned] Oh, dig you. Since
when have you joined the female ranks?

631
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,183
- All right!
- Now, Kay, Ned.

632
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:55,231
I want to discuss something with you
that concerns you as much as me.

633
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,857
You're going to get married.

634
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,795
Why, yes.
How did you know?

635
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,307
Oh, it had to happen.

636
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,344
Anyone as attractive as you.

637
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,812
Besides, you know what I think
of widows being walled up alive.

638
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,406
Egyptian fashion.

639
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,679
I knew you felt that way in theory.

640
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,880
Theory and action should be one.

641
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,321
Don't worry, Mother.
We're all for it.

642
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,393
Oh, darlings.

643
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,518
Hey, save that for Harvey.

644
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,098
Harvey?

645
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:34,364
Well, it isn't Harvey.
It... It's Ron Kirby.

646
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,201
You know him.
At least you've met him.

647
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,833
The only Kirby I know
is old Kirby the gardener.

648
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:46,075
- Last I heard, he was dead.
- Ron is his son.

649
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,583
Mother, is this a joke or something?

650
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,313
- No, it isn't a joke, Ned.
- But, Mother, you can't...

651
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,788
There's no point in approaching this
emotionally. Let's try to be objective.

652
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,791
This isn't one of your
case histories. This is us!

653
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:01,830
Just the same. Now, Mother, have you
introduced him to any of your friends?

654
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,866
[Ned]
Yeah, what does Sara think?

655
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:07,459
Well, Sara's invited us
to a cocktail party tonight.

656
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:11,564
I wanted you to know him first,
so I asked Ron to come early...

657
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,609
for a drink,
one of your special martinis.

658
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,940
This is no time for martinis.

659
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,879
Mother, why did you keep
this whole affair such a secret?

660
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,644
Because subconsciously
you were afraid he wouldn't fit in?

661
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:25,244
Why, Ron has no intentions
of fitting in, Kay.

662
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,550
He's quite content
with his life the way it is.

663
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,252
- Mother, the whole thing is impossible.
- You don't know him.

664
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,795
- We know the type.
- And we know you, Mother.

665
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:38,391
- [Doorbell Ringing]
- Suppose that's him now.

666
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,835
You must realize how
important this is to me.

667
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:46,841
I'm relying on both of you
to be fair and... give Ron a chance.

668
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:51,209
All right.
I'll make the martinis.

669
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,024
Won't you come in, Ron?

670
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:08,030
- You know Ned and Kay?
- Yes, of course. Hello.

671
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,100
- It's nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

672
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,863
Shall we go into the living room?

673
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,733
Kay, as I told you, Ron,
is doing social work in New York.

674
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:25,440
- You like it, I understand.
- You learn to deal with all sorts.

675
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,110
- NNed, you make a very good martini.
- Not too strong for you?

676
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,687
- You still have the nursery, Mr. Kirby?
- Oh, yes.

677
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,450
He's going in more
for tree farming now.

678
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,959
- Is there any money in growing trees?
- There can be.

679
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,962
The only thing I know about trees
is they make good logs.

680
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,999
- Now's your chance to learn.
- Mother?

681
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,765
- What happened to dad's trophy?
- Why, nothing happened to it.

682
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,342
Is the trophy part of the clutter
you were putting away?

683
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,343
Ned.

684
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:03,150
I suppose from now on,
there'll be lots of changes around here.

685
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:08,555
Ned, if you mean because of my marriage
to your mother, you needn't worry.

686
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:13,027
I have no intention of living here.
We'll be leading quite a different life.

687
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,894
But this has been the family house
for I don't know how long.

688
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,899
This is the place
we were born!

689
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,903
Ned, I wish you'd treat this matter
in a more detached fashion.

690
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,702
You don't know Mother as we know her.
She's really much more conventional...

691
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,709
than you seem to think she is.

692
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,474
She has the innate desire for group
approval, which most women have.

693
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,573
Never mind the $10 words.

694
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:37,983
And where, if I may ask,
do you expect our mother...

695
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,886
and, I suppose, us too to live?

696
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,084
- My place.
- In a greenhouse?

697
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:47,289
Oh, no, no.
He's going to remodel the old mill.

698
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:51,299
Mother, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to a lecture. I'd better get ready.

699
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,369
Good-bye, Mr. Kirby.

700
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,735
Mother, I've got some
studying to catch up on.

701
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,735
What happened? I've never
seen them act like that before.

702
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,146
It's natural, Cary.
I'm not like their father.

703
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,184
What does that
got to do with it?

704
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:13,382
It would be different if you were
marrying the same kind of man.

705
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,290
Successful businessman,
pillar of the community.

706
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,294
I can understand it.

707
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,365
Perhaps you're right.

708
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:27,601
But once I make them see that...
Shall we get started?

709
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,298
Cary, do we really have to go?

710
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:36,874
Well, Sara said that...
And anyway, I want to show you off.

711
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,719
- We can take my car.
- Mine's right here.

712
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,896
- Does it matter that much?
- It shouldn't.

713
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,672
Jim, get me another one, will you?
I don't want to miss the arrival.

714
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:09,006
- How about you, Mrs. Taylor?
- Well, I really shouldn't, but...

715
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,314
Excuse me.

716
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,406
If you see cary before I do,
let me know.

717
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,542
It'll be easier for her
if I took them around.

718
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,520
- Count on it, Sara. Got a light?
- I may need to.

719
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,818
Hold my drink, dear.
A gardener?

720
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,189
Why doesn't he find himself
a decent money-making vocation?

721
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,990
You think material success is the only
end worthy of pursuit of man?

722
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,998
- What's wrong with money?
- You have to have it to have contempt.

723
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,125
Excuse me.

724
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:36,672
Thank you. Do you really think
she'll have the nerve to come?

725
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,241
- Oh, there they are now!
- They're here!

726
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,353
- Just look at that car.
- Just look at that man.

727
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,356
Daughter!

728
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,449
It's always the quiet ones,
isn't it?

729
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,528
But she's certainly the last person
you'd expect to...

730
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,928
Always pretending
to be so prim and proper.

731
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,433
Why, Howard,
did she turn you down?

732
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,333
I'm so glad you could come.
I'm Cary's best friend.

733
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,463
- I'd like to be your friend too.
- Thank you.

734
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,201
Come on, darling. George.

735
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,837
- Cary, my favorite woman.
- George, I want you to know Ron Kirby.

736
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,972
- Used to know your father. Fine man.
- Thank you.

737
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:24,019
Shall we say hello to Romeo
and his Juliet? Come on, darling.

738
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,554
So that's Cary's nature boy.

739
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,216
- You know the doctor, Dan.
- Hello, Cary.

740
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,954
You know Miss Frisbee,
Mr. Allenby. Mr. Kirby.

741
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,223
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

742
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,299
This was kind of
supposed to be my party,

743
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,129
but looks like Mrs. Scott's
getting the attention.

744
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:43,194
I guess it is more unusual
when someone your age gets married.

745
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,275
But I think your friend's
awfully lucky.

746
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,868
You see, no one in my family's
had a dime since the civil war.

747
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:54,507
So, Tom won't get anything
but poor little me.

748
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:58,883
- Don't bother, Cary...
- My dear. What's this i hear about...

749
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:02,719
Oh. Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

750
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,624
Well, Mrs. Humphrey,
probably in your garden.

751
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,926
I've been pruning your trees
for the last three years.

752
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,160
Oh, yes, of course.

753
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,204
- Ah, sara, I really must be going.
- I'll be right back.

754
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,571
Come into the bar. You've earned
yourself a good strong drink.

755
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,270
- Go ahead, Ron.
- I'll be right back.

756
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,506
All right.

757
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,582
- Howard.
- Hi.

758
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,742
How are you?

759
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,614
- Mona, Mark.
- Oh, my dear, he's fascinating.

760
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,954
And that tan!
I suppose from working outdoors.

761
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,858
Of course, i'm sure
he's handy indoors too.

762
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,530
Mona's sure got your number, Cary.

763
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,036
So have I.

764
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,631
Well, excuse me, Howard.

765
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,452
Guess you played me for a prize sucker
that night at the club, huh?

766
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:08,513
Goin' into that perfect lady routine.
Makin' me apologize.

767
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,559
If I'd known then
what I know now,

768
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,288
- would have had a different ending.
- Oh, Howard.

769
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,991
Never too late, huh, Cary?
Line forms to the right.

770
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,694
- Howard, you're drunk!
- Why, Cary!

771
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,737
Isn't one man
enough for you?

772
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,807
Maybe you'd better stay
right where you are.

773
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,569
[Sara]
What is it, Cary?

774
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,577
- I never would have believed it.
[Sara] Believed what?

775
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,614
[Mona] That Howard was the earthy
type. You seem to attract that, Cary.

776
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,615
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

777
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,178
- Excuse us.
- Oh, george!

778
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,119
Why, that man was
positively murderous.

779
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,453
- Did you see that, Fred?
- What's the commotion?

780
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,652
He might have
killed poor Howard.

781
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,956
- And in Sara's lovely house too!
- Well!

782
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,870
Nothing's important except us.

783
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,415
Will you remember that?

784
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,508
Yes.

785
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,281
- I'll take you to the door.
- No, Ron.

786
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,846
Thank you, but... good night.

787
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,950
Good night.

788
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,603
Ned, you're still up?

789
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:39,481
Don't forget to put the screen around
the fireplace before you come up.

790
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,846
Mom...

791
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,853
I've got a few things
to say to you, Mother.

792
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,855
All right, Ned.

793
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:52,656
I just want to tell you, meeting him
hasn't changed my mind one darn bit.

794
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,821
We did what you asked.

795
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:58,958
I asked you to give Ron a fair chance.
I don't think you did.

796
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,832
Just because we didn't agree
with your choice?

797
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:06,136
Listen, Mother, somebody in this
family's gotta think straight.

798
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,267
And you don't think I can?

799
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,779
I think all you see is
a good-looking set of muscles.

800
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,872
Why, Ned!

801
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:18,010
That's the way it looks,
doesn't it?

802
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:22,581
You're planning to give up a home that's
been in the family for I don't know...

803
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,559
There's a certain tradition.

804
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,495
Aand for what?

805
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,795
Don't you realize
what people are gonna say?

806
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,962
Haven't you any sense
of obligation to father's memory?

807
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,404
What does that
got to do with it?

808
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:42,877
How can you think of marrying Kirby
when you've been Father's wife?

809
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,437
- It's against everything.
- Nonsense, Ned.

810
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:53,655
Mother... are you really
intending to go through with this?

811
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,387
Yes, I am.

812
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,055
Well, don't expect me
to come visit ya.

813
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:08,069
How could I bring my friends?
I'd be ashamed.

814
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,541
Ned!

815
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,240
Ned, we mustn't let this
come between us.

816
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:27,153
If you mean Kirby,
he already has!

817
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,191
[Door Slamming]

818
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,700
And then Ned
on top of everything else.

819
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,003
No, I haven't heard a word.
I've got a call in for him.

820
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,977
Well, Kay stayed over.

821
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,215
- I didn't sleep a wink either.
- [Door Closing]

822
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,785
Do you really think
the talk will die down?

823
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,354
Kay?

824
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,652
Sara, I'll have to call you back later.
All right.

825
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,063
- Kay, darling, what is it?

826
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,603
What's the matter?
Well, tell me.

827
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,968
Nothing. It...

828
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,600
It's about me, isn't it?

829
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:27,474
Freddie and I
were at the library.

830
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,017
One of the kids
made a crack about you.

831
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,610
What did they say?

832
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:36,351
That you and Mr. Kirby were...
even before Daddy...

833
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,427
Now, you stop that, Kay.
You know that's a lie.

834
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,429
Of course I do,
and I told them so!

835
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,728
They went on and on
and I got mad and...

836
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,100
We were asked to leave.

837
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,606
Oh, darling.

838
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,873
And on the way home
Freddie and I had a fight.

839
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,676
I told him that i didn't care
what people said.

840
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:05,550
But, Mama, I do care!
I care terribly!

841
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:12,020
Oh, Kay, l... I don't know what to do.

842
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,359
I can't bear to see
you and ned so unhappy.

843
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:19,663
But, you see, Kay, I love Ron.

844
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,000
You love him so much
you're willing to ruin all our lives?

845
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:27,543
- You can't really think that.
- What else can I think?

846
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:32,269
But, Kay, you've talked
so much about people...

847
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,406
and why they do
the things they do.

848
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,543
- You say you understand.
- But I don't!

849
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,520
I don't! I thought I did.

850
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,786
I don't understand anything.

851
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,769
Cary?

852
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,806
- Oh, Ron, l...
- What's the matter?

853
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:39,211
Well, Ned's left home and l...

854
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:43,149
I left Kay in tears. Some of her
friends have been dreadful to her.

855
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,186
Because of me?

856
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:52,151
Ron, we're gonna have
to wait to get married.

857
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,162
- Why?
- Well...

858
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,290
To give the children
a chance to get used to the idea.

859
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,097
They'll feel differently
when they know you better.

860
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,105
- You don't want to marry me?
- I'm not saying that.

861
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:08,109
I'm asking you to be patient.
It's only a question of time.

862
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:11,374
Only of time?

863
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,678
Right now everybody's talking about us.
We're a local sensation.

864
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:19,915
Like Sara said, if the people get used
to seeing us together,

865
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:23,253
then maybe
they'll accept us.

866
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,126
You mean, we'll be invited
to all the cocktail parties.

867
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:32,600
And, of course, Sara will see to it
I get into the country club.

868
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,229
Dear Howard and I will
shake hands and forget.

869
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,035
- And Mona won't be malicious.
- That isn't what I mean.

870
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,041
And ned and kay
won't mind so much...

871
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,270
because we'll be living
just as you always have.

872
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,941
- Probably in your house.
- What's wrong with that?

873
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,451
It's only for a little while.
It would make things so much easier.

874
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,715
It wouldn't change you.
You couldn't be changed.

875
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,348
Yes, I could.

876
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,623
I'm learning right now how easy
it would be to let myself be changed.

877
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,528
- By whom?
- By you.

878
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,797
I'm sorry, Cary.
But it wouldn't work.

879
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,203
I can't live that way.
You knew that from the beginning.

880
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:15,107
But I can't ruin
my children's lives.

881
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,304
I have a responsibility to them.

882
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,041
Are you sure it's just that?

883
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,318
Well, what do you mean?

884
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,982
- You don't think I care what people say.
- Yes, I do.

885
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,924
You're not even trying
to understand.

886
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:35,862
- How can you say you love me...
- God knows I love you.

887
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:39,901
But I won't let Ned nor Kay
nor anyone else run our lives.

888
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,971
Don't you see we could never
be happy if we did?

889
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:46,132
I can see that you don't want to listen
to anybody's ideas but your own.

890
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,177
I can see that you're trying to make
me choose between you and the children!

891
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:53,374
No, Cary, you're the one
that made it a question of choosing.

892
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,416
So you're the one
that'll have to choose.

893
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,885
All right.

894
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,819
It's all over.

895
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,504
Cary?

896
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:51,131
I admit, after meeting him,
he's a darn nice guy, but l...

897
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,642
But I still say
you did the right thing.

898
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:03,574
Oh... I suppose so.

899
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:08,589
Everyone will welcome you back
to the fold. I'll see to that.

900
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,524
I don't know what i'd do
without you, Sara.

901
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,562
I know what you've been
going through.

902
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:19,225
I know it hasn't been easy.
But at least you have the children.

903
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:23,567
You don't have to fiill your life
with club work and parties.

904
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,732
- Oh, Sara.

905
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,606
That must be Ned.
I have a call in for him.

906
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,681
- You've told Kay?
- Yes, she's very happy.

907
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,682
- Hello?
- Mrs. Scott?

908
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,684
- Yes.
- I have your party now.

909
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,981
- [Ned] Mother, you called me?
- Yes, Ned, I did.

910
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:44,151
I wanted to talk to you.
I, um... I've decided that...

911
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,592
Well, I'm not going
to be married.

912
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,493
- Oh, great.
- You will be up this weekend?

913
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,863
You bet, Mom.
I got a class now, so good-bye, huh?

914
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:56,529
- Well, Ned... Ned?

915
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,536
Was he pleased?

916
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:11,247
Yes, he...
He seemed to be.

917
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,488
- Hello, dear!
- Bill! I thought you'd never get here.

918
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,433
- What's for dinner?
- Good night. Say hello to the children.

919
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,630
- Hello, Cary. Nice to see you.
- Hello, Doctor. Nice to see you.

920
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,469
I've been meaning to call you
about a checkup.

921
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:37,273
I don't think it's serious, but
I've been having miserable headaches.

922
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,473
- Any time. Can I give you a lift?
- I'm waiting for the children.

923
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,279
- Let me hear from you now.
- All right.

924
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,460
Oh, Mrs. Scott.

925
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,996
Seems the kids couldn't make it.

926
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:00,057
Guess they're pretty busy
with the holidays coming on.

927
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,921
Something in a christmas tree,
ma'am? Oh, hiya, Mrs. Scott.

928
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,089
- Merry christmas!
- Merry christmas, Tom.

929
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,225
- Like this one?
- I need one bigger than this.

930
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:37,294
- How about this?
- That's not very pretty.

931
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,670
I'll show ya another one.

932
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,612
Hello, Cary.

933
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:50,412
Well, hello.

934
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:55,081
I, uh... I have to get a tree
for the children, and I saw these.

935
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,226
How are you?

936
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:03,856
- How about this pine, Mrs. Scott?
- Oh, I'm fine.

937
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,127
No, not that one. L...

938
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,072
I didn't know
they were your trees.

939
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,110
No, they're Mick's.

940
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,476
I'm helping him unload.

941
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,348
- How are Mick and Alida?
- Fine.

942
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,479
Will you say hello
to them for me?

943
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,754
They'll be right back.
They're doing some christmas shopping.

944
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,885
Here's a medium-sized fir,
Mrs. Scott.

945
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,796
Or maybe you'd rather have a spruce?

946
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:44,038
- A silver tip spruce?
- Oh, i've got a beauty!

947
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,802
You remembered.
Oh, Cary...

948
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,744
Ron! Ron?

949
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,781
Mick and Alida sent me
to get you.

950
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,985
Oh, I didn't know
you had a customer.

951
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,080
How about this one,
Mrs. Scott?

952
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,660
No. Send this one to me.

953
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,228
Ron? Shall we go?

954
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,165
Yeah.

955
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,220
??Let heaven and nature sing ??

956
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,121
??Let heaven and heaven ??

957
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,626
? And nature sing ?

958
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,219
- ?Joy to the world ?

959
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,629
? The Lord is come ?

960
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:49,761
? Let earth receive her king ?

961
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:55,037
??Let every heart
prepare Him room ??

962
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,443
? And heaven
and nature sing ?

963
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,811
??And heaven
and nature sing ??

964
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,907
??And heaven
and heaven ??

965
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,851
??And nature sing ??

966
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:10,857
??Joy to the world
the Lord is come ??

967
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,451
??Let earth
receive her king ????

968
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,856
- Hello, Mama! Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

969
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:22,027
- Thought we'd never get here.
- I'm so happy to see you.

970
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,004
- Oh, it looks gorgeous!
- Hey, look at all that loot!

971
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,167
- Is that for me?
- Where's our present for you?

972
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,370
Nothing's come.
But don't worry about it.

973
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,380
- Just having the two of you is enough.
- I better phone.

974
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:36,383
- Not here. It's a secret!

975
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,783
- Don't open anything until I get back.
- All right.

976
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,822
Mama!

977
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,824
Look!

978
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:50,632
Why, that's lovely, Kay.

979
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,701
Freddie and I
are going to be married.

980
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,328
In february,
after he graduates.

981
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,497
Well, aren't you a little young?

982
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:02,008
You were 17 when you got married.

983
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:08,515
But... it's so soon.

984
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,881
Soon?
Oh, it seems like forever.

985
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,546
Oh, Mama!

986
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:18,490
Remember the afternoon
that Freddie and I had the big fight?

987
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:23,691
That's when we found out we loved
each other. Mama, he's so wonderful.

988
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:27,064
Yes, I remember.

989
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:31,936
That was the day you told me your life
would be ruined if I married Ron.

990
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:38,237
I was being childish. You shouldn't
have let me get away with it.

991
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:41,407
Of course, that was different.

992
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:45,613
You didn't really love him,
did you?

993
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,053
Mother!

994
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,148
Your present's on the way.

995
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,092
Hey, this is Christmas.
Let's enjoy it.

996
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,392
After all, it'll probably
be the last one we spend in this house.

997
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,398
What do you mean?

998
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,766
Kay's getting married.
And if I'm not called up right away,

999
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,465
I'm in line for the Walker Scholarship
which means a year in Paris.

1000
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,737
After that, onto Iran
with the Dayton Company.

1001
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:12,211
I didn't want to tell you till
I had it pretty well cinched.

1002
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,214
Hey, Mother.

1003
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,216
Thank you.

1004
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,212
Yes, with Kay and I away,
I think we should sell the house.

1005
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,917
The house?

1006
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,187
It's too big for one person.
What with taxes...

1007
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,593
There's your present now.

1008
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,372
- [Door Opening]
- Mama?

1009
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,972
- Mama!

1010
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:48,710
Don't you see, Kay?
The whole thing's been so pointless.

1011
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,453
Oh, mama, I'm...
I'm terribly sorry.

1012
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,456
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1013
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:04,231
Mama, it still isn't too late,
if he loves you.

1014
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,800
- Please, Kay, it...
- Mother?

1015
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,033
Merry Christmas!

1016
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:17,237
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Scott,
and Happy New Year.

1017
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,644
Kay and I couldn't afford
anything but a table model.

1018
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,012
It's got a nice-sized screen
and it's easy to operate.

1019
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:26,417
All you have to do is turn that dial and
you have all the company you want...

1020
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,456
right there on the screen.

1021
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:33,620
Drama, comedy, life's parade
at your fiingertips.

1022
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,004
Fetch, go on!
Fetch, old boy!

1023
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,640
Ha, ha!
Boy, are you slippin'.

1024
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:58,049
Why don't you try
using shells in that gun?

1025
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,178
- Doesn't seem to help.
- Ha, ha!

1026
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,190
Can't shoot straight anymore,
I guess.

1027
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,852
I don't seem to be good
for anything lately.

1028
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,953
You haven't been good for anything
since you and Cary broke up.

1029
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,363
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything, and you know it.

1030
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,731
You're not the same anymore.

1031
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:16,736
You're no good to me,
yourself or anyone.

1032
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,136
All right,
so what do I do about it?

1033
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,869
- Call her up. Go see her. Apologize.
- Apologize for what?

1034
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,810
I don't know for what.
For anything. Make up something.

1035
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,813
- But do something.

1036
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:31,352
That's a boy. Good boy.
Hey, nice, huh?

1037
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:34,945
Look, Mick,
I told her that I love her.

1038
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,686
I asked her to marry me. I can't force
her. She has to make up her own mind.

1039
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:41,490
She doesn't want to make up her
own mind. No girl does.

1040
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,088
She wants you
to make it up for her.

1041
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:47,430
- Come on, let's go.
- No, I'll be along later.

1042
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,800
Gotta catch one pheasant
at least.

1043
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:53,102
Hey, uh...
Well, uh... You know.

1044
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,981
Well, Dan,
what's the verdict?

1045
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,985
I was just going over
the findings.

1046
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,022
There's nothing organically
wrong with you, Cary.

1047
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,182
Why do I have
these headaches?

1048
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,353
It's not my imagination.
And they're getting worse all the time.

1049
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,432
- You're punishing yourself.
- For what?

1050
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:22,333
For running away from life. Headaches
are nature's way of making a protest.

1051
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:25,736
Will you give me
something for them?

1052
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,742
Do you expect me to give you
a prescription to cure life?

1053
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,438
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

1054
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,571
Forget for a moment
that I'm your doctor.

1055
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:37,174
Let me give you some advice
as a friend. Marry him.

1056
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,554
Well, there's no point
in discussing that.

1057
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,527
- It's all over.
- Apparently it isn't.

1058
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:52,692
- You still have the headaches.
- But that's silly.

1059
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,292
And anyway,
how could I marry him?

1060
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:59,135
The whole thing was impossible
from the beginning.

1061
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:03,610
You know, Dan, in a place like
Stoningham, you can't ignore convention.

1062
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:07,808
So you gave up a man you were
in love with because of others?

1063
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,282
And you had the great satisfaction
of being taken back into the fold.

1064
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,512
I was thinking of my children.

1065
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,954
You're just as lonely as you
were before. Lonelier, in fact,

1066
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,458
with kay married
and ned abroad.

1067
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,927
Sso what good
was your noble sacrifice?

1068
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,021
Cary, marry him.

1069
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:29,331
Oh, it... it's too late.

1070
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,136
And maybe he's
found someone else.

1071
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:38,144
Anyway, if he'd really loved me,
he would have come to me.

1072
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:41,682
No! If you'd loved him,
you'd have gone to him!

1073
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,684
In spite of the town,
the children, everything.

1074
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:49,086
Let's face it. You were ready
for a love affair, but not for love.

1075
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,663
Good-bye, Dan.

1076
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,112
- Cary!
- Hello, Alida!

1077
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,276
- It's so good to see you!
- It's so good to see you!

1078
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,547
What were you doing in the doctor's
office? Nothing wrong, is there?

1079
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,920
Oh, no. Just a checkup.
He couldn't find a thing wrong with me.

1080
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,493
- Would you have a cup of tea?
- I'd love to, but I'm late.

1081
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,655
- I have to pick up Mary Ann.
- Mary ann?

1082
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:33,098
- She's getting married, you know.
- Married?

1083
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:36,364
Very nice boy from new jersey. They've
been going together for a year now.

1084
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:40,373
- I thought...
- I don't think you've met this one.

1085
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:44,571
I have to dash. Come by and see us,
We miss you!

1086
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,308
- I appreciate that. Good-bye, Alida.
- Bye!

1087
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,906
Cary!

1088
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,834
- Alida?
- Hello, Cary.

1089
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:34,848
- Come on in.
- I thought i should come over.

1090
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,249
- There's been an accident, Cary.
- It's ron.

1091
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,446
- You better come with me.
- How bad is he?

1092
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:42,819
Don't know yet.
Dr. Hennessy and Mick are with him now.

1093
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:45,017
- Oh, alida.
- Get your coat first.

1094
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:49,256
- I'll tell you on the way.
- [Footsteps Running]

1095
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:12,918
Mrs. Scott.
Please, Mrs. Scott.

1096
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,581
- How is he?
- We don't know anything yet.

1097
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,557
- Where's Mr. Anderson?
- He took the doctor back to town.

1098
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,561
- Well, didn't he...
- Nothing that he could have done.

1099
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:24,598
He'll be back
in the morning.

1100
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:30,596
I'm sorry, Mrs. Scott.
I have strict orders.

1101
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:35,608
He can't be disturbed.
He must be kept quiet.

1102
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,974
Let me take your coat.

1103
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,516
Why don't you sit down?
I'll get some coffee.

1104
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,387
Wish Mick had waited.

1105
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,761
But I'm sure the doctor wouldn't have
gone if he thought there were...

1106
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,357
Alida.

1107
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,670
This room.

1108
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,010
The beauty that
Ron's put into it.

1109
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,015
And the love.

1110
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:20,952
He never gave up hope
that you'd come back, Cary.

1111
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:33,933
You told me once that
Ron was so secure within himself.

1112
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:39,029
Because he refused to give importance
to unimportant things.

1113
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,132
Why did it take me so long
to understand it?

1114
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,703
Remember I told you it took us
a long time to find the right answer?

1115
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,511
It doesn't happen overnight.

1116
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,519
I feel like such a coward.

1117
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:03,029
I was so frightened.
I let others make my decisions.

1118
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:08,395
Alida, I've let so many people
come between us.

1119
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,961
Friends, neighbors, children.

1120
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:15,702
And the strangest one of all, myself.

1121
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,335
Don't worry about things
in the past.

1122
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,280
Isn't that
unimportant too, hmm?

1123
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,092
If only I haven't
waited too long.

1124
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:35,253
Mrs. Scott?
Your coffee.

1125
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,457
Thank you, but I really
don't care for any.

1126
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:41,797
Why don't you go upstairs
and rest a while? Try to sleep.

1127
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:47,136
I couldn't sleep.
I want to stay here in case he wakes up.

1128
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,836
May I sit over there?

1129
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,913
Well, all right.

1130
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:39,016
- Well, Dan?
- He's got a concussion.

1131
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:42,290
- Of course not.
- Otherwise, I'd get him to the hospital.

1132
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:45,525
It's gonna take time
for him to recover.

1133
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,625
Dan, what can I do?

1134
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,068
You plan to stay?
