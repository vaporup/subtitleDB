1
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:15,672
- Ola.
- Ola.

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,592
Wait. I want to talk to you.

3
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,568
Come with me!

4
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:26,808
What are you doing? What do you want?

5
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,152
Can you listen to me?

6
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,744
I'm not after you for my wallet.

7
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:33,048
I just wanted to
take you to see someone.

8
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,704
I think this meeting
will be beneficial to you.

9
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,048
Will you come?

10
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:39,352
Help!

11
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,808
Why do you cry for help?
I mean you no harm.

12
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,344
I'm actually a private investigator.

13
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,840
My job will be done if you'd only
go see this man with me.

14
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,664
Can you do me just this one small favor?

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,216
Please trust me and don't cry for help.

16
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,656
Then I'll let you go. Okay?

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,256
I practically grew up on the streets.

18
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,792
You think I'm that easily conned?

19
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,328
Don't waste your time.

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,504
- Where?
- Over there.

21
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:34,520
Miss.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,056
Don't come near me! I mean it!

23
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,744
Thank you.

24
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:44,760
Don't say I didn't warn you!

25
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:47,256
Sylvia is delivering an order
to a very dangerous place.

26
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:49,560
You'll live to regret it
if you don't believe me.

27
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,344
Let me borrow your bench.

28
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:53,496
- Where?
- Over there.

29
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:54,360
What do we do now?

30
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:55,896
Just pack up and go rescue her.

31
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:00,888
Don't run!

32
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,144
- Let me go!
- Let her go!

33
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:26,488
Don't come any closer!

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,336
Come on.

35
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:52,760
Get in, quick!

36
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:01,784
Use the cars!

37
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,448
That's my car! That's my car!

38
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,480
Faster! They're right behind us!

39
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,240
I can't take this anymore.

40
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:22,680
- Then sit on my lap.
- You wish!

41
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,888
Go sit in the back! Go!

42
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,872
Back up! Back up!

43
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,416
Driving like a maniac!

44
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:02,488
Good thing mine is a race car.
Otherwise I'd be in big trouble.

45
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,888
Drive more carefully next time!

46
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:18,232
It's a dead end!
Let's do it!

47
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:19,768
Sit tight!

48
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,720
You were great!
They're not following us anymore!

49
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:43,448
I know that! But they're in front of us!

50
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,784
We'll see if you have the guts
to hit me head on!

51
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,920
Excuse me.
Let's try out my newest weapon.

52
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,472
Ready, aim, shoot!

53
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,160
I'll give it a shot too!

54
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:55,672
Ready for some olive oil?

55
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,064
Try this on for size!

56
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,936
Let's make it a little more interesting.

57
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:43,704
How's it going out there?

58
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,432
The enemy has been defeated!

59
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,520
So many of you and the girl
still managed to get away.

60
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,784
The only explanation is that
you are incompetent!

61
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,656
Morons, what use are you to me?

62
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:22,072
You've wasted six days.
Now I only have eight days left.

63
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:25,144
God made the world in six days.

64
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,256
Eight days is more than enough

65
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,504
to get a girl...

66
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:35,128
Then whether I can become the Count's

67
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,472
successor is all up to you.

68
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,272
Who do you think...

69
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:47,480
You first.

70
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,648
Who do you think those people were?

71
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,472
Now its your turn.

72
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:53,912
You've already said it!

73
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,544
This was not the first time
they tried to kidnap me.

74
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,504
That's right.

75
00:08:59,192 --> 00:08:59,960
Moby?

76
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,936
Why didn't you say something? If I had
a gun, you would have been dead!

77
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:04,280
You don't think I would duck?

78
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,352
Those people will
keep coming after Sylvia

79
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:10,232
until they have her.

80
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,440
- Who are those people?
- Bad guys.

81
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,784
How do you know?

82
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:15,512
Because I'm a good guy.

83
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,400
Please tell me what this is all about.

84
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,568
Actually, it was quite simple.
Although it is now getting complicated.

85
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:23,160
There are 2 groups of people. The first
group consists of those we've just met.

86
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,560
The second group consists of
only one person me.

87
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm officially looking for Sylvia.

88
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:31,320
Those guys want to kidnap her
by any illegal means.

89
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,912
My reason for wanting Sylvia is
I need to deliver her to my client.

90
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:37,176
About those other guys? I don't know.

91
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,384
I'm even more confused than before.

92
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:41,112
It's like you've said nothing.

93
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:45,048
You should know why your client
is looking for me.

94
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:46,872
You're right. I should.

95
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,216
However, my client did not wish

96
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:49,912
to tell me his reasons.

97
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:52,408
As such, what I should know...
I don't know.

98
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:54,520
So Moby, Private Eye.

99
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,728
Can you tell us one thing
that you do know?

100
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:58,168
I can tell you two things.

101
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,472
First, it's very dangerous here.

102
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,488
Why? Do you smell gas?

103
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,984
You don't believe me.
There's nothing I can do.

104
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,016
Second, if Sylvia wants to find out
what this is about,

105
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,648
then she should come with me
to see my client.

106
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:13,240
- I know one thing too.
- What?

107
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,488
I have a dimwitted

108
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,464
private investigator in my apartment.

109
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:20,440
You don't have to believe me,
but you can't insult me.

110
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,264
It's not that
we don't want to believe you.

111
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,440
Please tell us. How long have you been
a private investigator?

112
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:26,456
Six days.

113
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,240
That's not even a full week yet.

114
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,176
We'd be insulting our
IQ if we believe you.

115
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:36,152
Just forget it.

116
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:39,512
You've not only insulted me,
you've hurt my feelings.

117
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,528
Moby, you hold down the fort.
We'll take off!

118
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,832
Let's go from the balcony.
Moby, we're going!

119
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,240
Moby, hang in there!

120
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,488
Four Eyes, you go down first.

121
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:05,400
Come on!

122
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,648
Moby, come on!

123
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,848
Hurry!

124
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,472
Go!

125
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,080
Why are we running?

126
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:26,424
They want to kidnap Sylvia!

127
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
So they do!
And there's nothing we can do?

128
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:29,848
Can't we fight back?

129
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:30,904
They have five or six guys.

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,304
David and I are used to fighting
more than 10 guys.

131
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,168
Including spectators?

132
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,160
Let Four Eyes and I demonstrate for you.

133
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,312
You stay with Sylvia.

134
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,824
- They're tough!
- They're more than tough!

135
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:25,880
Then what are we waiting for?

136
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,664
Come on.

137
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
Where the heck is this?

138
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:41,880
This is the headquarters of filth.

139
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,992
This is a dead end. Turn back!

140
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:50,424
What do we do now?

141
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,152
Find a place to hide first.

142
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,456
- Who has a flashlight?
- I do.

143
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,440
Turn it off and save your batteries.

144
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,664
Look at each one carefully.

145
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,616
This place stinks.

146
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,016
I know. Be patient.

147
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:06,392
Hey, I don't see them over here.

148
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,480
I know I saw them coming in here.
Let's look again.

149
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,208
Oh... What a relief!

150
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:32,856
I can't stand it anymore.

151
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:35,352
We have to or we'll be in big trouble.

152
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,056
I can't take this anymore!!

153
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,456
That Fatso!

154
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,568
Leave it up to him to give us away!

155
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,104
Run! What are you waiting for?

156
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,872
Free money here! Come and get it!

157
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,448
Move aside! Move aside!

158
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:08,920
They can't be far away! Go!

159
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:57,144
What do you want?
I love to help people.

160
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,680
I'm glad to hear that.

161
00:15:58,776 --> 00:15:59,928
How can I help you?

162
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,808
Someone has paid us to push you off.
Why don't you jump off yourself?

163
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:05,784
Hey... You have the wrong guy!

164
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't think so.

165
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:08,664
- Who hired you then?
- I did.

166
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,256
You?

167
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,888
You hired someone to kidnap me.

168
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,960
Now I've also hired them to make
Superman out of you. Push him off!

169
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:21,624
No... Help!

170
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,408
Help! Please listen to me.

171
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,736
- I'm your father...
- He's you father?

172
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,288
You're my father?

173
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:36,280
No, no. I'm your father's butler.

174
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:38,872
You better tell me the whole story.

175
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,520
Your father is Count Lobas.

176
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:45,688
20 years ago, Gloria worked for him.

177
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,376
One night while the Countess was away...

178
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:49,624
The Count raped her.

179
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,600
Gloria got pregnant. The Count was afraid
his wife might find out.

180
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,864
So he quietly sent Gloria away.

181
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,880
Son of a bitch!

182
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,768
But he's your father!

183
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:02,744
I hate him. I never want to see him.

184
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:06,296
He already passed away.

185
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,888
Before he died,

186
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,384
he begged the Countess
to find you and your mother,

187
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,936
so his evil brother Mondale would not
inherit his fortunes.

188
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:17,528
For your own safety,
I did not want to tell

189
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:18,968
my reasons for looking for you.

190
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,848
For that same reason,
I even hired the worst P.I.

191
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:26,360
- Fortunately, Moby's not here.
- Who says I'm not here?

192
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,992
I'm not that fortunate.

193
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:31,064
What I wanted to find out,
no one would tell me.

194
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,008
What I don't want to hear... Well.

195
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,120
But it turned out
I'd come to the right guy.

196
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,808
According to the Lobas family tradition,

197
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,824
Sylvia and her mother
have to appear within 14 days.

198
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:43,128
Otherwise, his evil brother Mondale

199
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,720
will inherit his entire fortune.

200
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:48,696
Those men after Sylvia must
have something to do with Mondale.

201
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,712
There are still three days left.

202
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,824
Hey, where are you two going?

203
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,936
We wanted to help Sylvia because

204
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,568
we thought she was helpless.

205
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,296
But now it turns out
she is the Count's daughter.

206
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,024
She has no use for us anymore.

207
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:05,304
You're saying...

208
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,920
that you'll only hang out with Sylvia
if she's poor and helpless?

209
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,128
Now that you've found out that she's
the Count's daughter,

210
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,256
you don't want to be friends
with her anymore?

211
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:16,696
We really did want to help her.

212
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,000
Do you know then that this is

213
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,016
when she needs help the most.

214
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,512
Don't you want her and her mother
to have a better life?

215
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,720
Of course.
But you can take care of that!

216
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,352
But I'm just one man.

217
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:29,464
You've seen Mondale's men.

218
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,768
There are still a few days left.
He won't give up now.

219
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,688
If you still consider
yourselves Sylvia's friends,

220
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,800
you wouldn't abandon her now.

221
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,296
Enough already.

222
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,280
We almost feel bad
enough to jump off from here.

223
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:43,544
Let's devise a plan to get
Sylvia's mother out.

224
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:49,880
What? What are you looking at?
Want me to try this knife on you?

225
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:59,960
Don't come any closer or I'll kill you!

226
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,048
Don't run, friend!

227
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,504
Let me go! What?

228
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,040
Let me go...

229
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:11,384
Relax, Calm down.

230
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,328
Untie me, let me go

231
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:17,592
All done.

232
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,008
Untie me.

233
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:25,656
That's too risky.
We don't want to be found out. Lie down.

234
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,752
Turn off the siren.

235
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,760
I saw my mother and Mr. Chan
dancing over there.

236
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,152
What's going on?

237
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,072
Your father and her mother are dancing
over there.

238
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,328
There's a nut case.

239
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,792
His mouth is moving.
Is he talking or eating?

240
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:18,776
I hate to guess.

241
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,768
I'm not crazy, pal. I'm sane.

242
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:25,304
Please untie me.

243
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,744
Are you really as sane as us?

244
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:27,992
Yes.

245
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,624
Why don't you test his intelligence?

246
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,056
Now listen closely. 3 worms line up
in one straight line, moving forward.

247
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,800
The first worm says,
"there are two worms behind me."

248
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:43,256
The last worm says,
"there are two worms ahead of me."

249
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:44,888
But the worm in the middle says,

250
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:47,576
"there are no worms
ahead of or behind me."

251
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:49,304
Why is that?

252
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,672
- The middle worm is blind.
- No.

253
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:55,032
Then I don't know.

254
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,240
You shouldn't have given him
such a difficult question.

255
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,944
- Was the question too difficult?
- Way too difficult.

256
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,728
Why did the middle worm say

257
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:06,936
"there were no worms
ahead of or behind him?"

258
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,720
Because the middle worm was lying.

259
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,560
Worms don't know how to lie!

260
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,056
Never mind him.
Why were you tied up here?

261
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,664
This is a secret.
I can't tell just anyone.

262
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,872
Come closer and I'll whisper it to you.

263
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:27,928
Don't tell anyone else. That's it.

264
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:31,384
So you see, I had to fake
being crazy to get in here.

265
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:33,592
What did he tell you?

266
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,416
He said, "Don't tell anyone else."

267
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:38,872
Am I anyone else? What did he say?

268
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,176
He said, "Don't tell anyone else."

269
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,096
You're not going to tell me?

270
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,112
You bully me all day long.
I'm going to let you have it!

271
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,616
Hey... Now I am really stuck.

272
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,784
Friend, what did you tell him?

273
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,032
Why should I tell you?

274
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,624
I'll untie you if you do.

275
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:07,832
You? I don't trust you.

276
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:12,440
Wait. You were going to tell me.

277
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,048
I said, "Don't tell anyone else." Okay?

278
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,728
Hm... What was it that I was not to
tell anyone else?

279
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:29,720
Why would they ask us to leave?
It's so nice in here.

280
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,040
What are you all waiting for? Let's go.

281
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,192
We can't.

282
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:42,360
My mother doesn't want to go without
Mr. Chan and Mr. Chan doesn't want to go.

283
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,440
Just tell your father you and Sylvia
are getting married.

284
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,264
And you need him
out to attend the wedding.

285
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:56,856
You can't lie to your parents like that!

286
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,024
Not if we can show him some proof.

287
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,544
Just get them out first.

288
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,712
I'll go tell him.

289
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,856
Mr. Chan, you're so in love with Gloria.

290
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,584
Why don't you take her out
and marry her?

291
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,480
Good idea! Why didn't I think of that?

292
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:21,400
Why did you say that?

293
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:22,360
What? Do you object to the idea?

294
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,760
No.

295
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:26,776
So no one objects.

296
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,424
Gloria, will you marry me?

297
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,648
What took you so long?

298
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,224
Congratulations, Mr. Chan.

299
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,448
That makes you two brother and sister.
Are you happy?

300
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:47,384
Why don't you say something?
Are you unhappy?

301
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:48,920
You should call him brother now.

302
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:51,224
That's right, Brother.

303
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,368
No need to be so frustrated.
I have an idea.

304
00:23:57,464 --> 00:24:01,592
Just cut off your ties with your father
as soon as we get out!

305
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:02,552
Is this a good idea?

306
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:06,872
Finally...

307
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,424
What is that big thing doing there?

308
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:16,152
Yeah, what is it doing there?

309
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:19,800
So do you want me to let up the gas,
step on the brake,

310
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:21,624
turn off the car, take out the key,

311
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,024
get out of the car to find out
and then report to you?

312
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:27,672
You could have just asked me nicely!

313
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:39,000
What is it?

314
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:43,384
You Fatso. Can't even do
one little thing without any hassle.

315
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:51,448
Moby.

316
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,568
How are you doing?

317
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:13,816
Not very well.

318
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,520
Why are you hitting my son?

319
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,848
Let go of me!

320
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:55,320
Get that bulldozer out of the way!

321
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,576
What are you waiting for??

322
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,264
I don't have the keys!
Then get down and push!

323
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:11,448
Why don't you show me how to push?

324
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:26,968
The butler was right. It's not that
difficult to get inside this castle.

325
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,272
But to get inside unnoticed is.

326
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,232
Come on.

327
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,648
I have at least seven ways
to get inside.

328
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Seven? Why not six or eight ways?

329
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,352
Seven is my lucky number.

330
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:44,056
If it works, one way is enough.

331
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,688
Unfortunately,

332
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,376
that is not one of my seven ways.

333
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:50,776
Let's get in from the back.

334
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,656
There're many guards in the front.
But even tigers snooze sometimes.

335
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm going to get in from the front.

336
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,792
The front is too dangerous.

337
00:26:57,272 --> 00:26:58,520
Who are you going to go with?

338
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,016
I don't like either one of your ideas.

339
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:02,264
Three people, three ideas.

340
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,896
We're no better than
a pail of loose sand.

341
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:07,352
There is a difference.
We are only three pails of loose sand.

342
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:04,120
You're terrible!

343
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:22,008
Get down now if you have guts, pal!

344
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,152
You guessed it. I don't have guts.

345
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:43,480
How do you plan to get in?

346
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:44,728
Through the front door.

347
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,840
It's guarded.

348
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:48,568
I'll wait for an opportunity.

349
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,776
Wait? It'll be morning then.

350
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,480
Let's climb up the trees.

351
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,704
Have you ever seen an elephant
climb trees?

352
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,528
Then have fun waiting.

353
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,264
Stop playing. Be on your toes.
Come in for dinner.

354
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,392
Don't argue.

355
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:28,696
Last ball I threw is a top spin,

356
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,424
even if you hit it would've been
gone out of bound.

357
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:42,328
Hide the bodies first.

358
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,664
I have good news for you.

359
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,352
Someone has come to rescue you.

360
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:59,000
But I also have bad news for you.

361
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:01,880
We have already captured him.

362
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:08,792
How are you?

363
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,096
Don't be rude to my guest.

364
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:12,920
Give him your seat.

365
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:15,704
Thank you.

366
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,136
Cheers.

367
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,848
- What do we do now?
- Go home and go to bed.

368
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,440
Bed? Have you lost your mind?
We must find a way to save them!

369
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,072
If you knew, why did you ask?

370
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,416
Come on up.

371
00:32:59,992 --> 00:33:01,720
Are you crazy?
You think I'm you?

372
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,832
Then think of a way yourself.

373
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:37,976
It's me!

374
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:39,416
I know.

375
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:41,432
Then why did you kick me?

376
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,352
I only knew it was you
after I kicked you

377
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:44,408
and you didn't scream.

378
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,072
For my own safety, we better split up.

379
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:16,824
What are you doing up there?

380
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:28,536
Are you guests of the party?

381
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:30,552
Yes.

382
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:34,584
I told you not to follow me!
You almost ruined everything.

383
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:36,120
Take care of the guy first!

384
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:39,736
Let's go to the party.

385
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:54,808
The dress and your movements
are a perfect match.

386
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:56,632
Do you mean I look very classical?

387
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,264
Mother, just sit down.

388
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,376
That's right. I'm a bit hungry.

389
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:09,112
Set an extra plate.
We have one more guest.

390
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:16,184
Since you're here,
why not show yourself and join us?

391
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,888
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

392
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:25,592
What's the main course for tonight?

393
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,744
Roast lamb.

394
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,448
Wouldn't you know!
I was born in the Year of the Lamb.

395
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:34,712
It's an omen! That explains why I've
made a complete fool of myself tonight.

396
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,072
I am very much honored to have

397
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:41,816
the pleasure of
so many guests here tonight.

398
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:44,184
This is a very important night to me.

399
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:45,912
To the Lobas family,

400
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,024
this is a night of disgrace.

401
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,192
It is you and your mother

402
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:52,728
who brought disgrace to this family.

403
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:54,936
Don't upset yourself.

404
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:56,760
Count Mondale.

405
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,312
If people ever find out
that you kidnapped the two of them,

406
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:02,424
your reputation will be ruined.

407
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:06,552
Thank you for reminding me.
Now I know what to do.

408
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:09,624
I don't see a problem because...

409
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,248
Cardi, take care of my guests for me.

410
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,112
Yes!

411
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,744
Put the ladies in the dungeon.

412
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,896
Yes!

413
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:28,600
I haven't finished my soup yet.
Where are you taking me?

414
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:32,344
What are you looking at?

415
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,192
Reinforcements are here!

416
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:24,216
You hang in there.
He's really not that tough.

417
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,712
You take care of him
and I'll go help over there.

418
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,368
Come...

419
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,344
Come...

420
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,888
I stay with him.
You go rescue the ladies.

421
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,808
- Are you sure?
- No.

422
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,152
You better do it. Go!

423
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,136
I block... block... block...

424
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:57,880
You can't poke me on the back!

425
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:10,488
This guy is something else.

426
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,808
No need to panic. Just relax.

427
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:18,136
Treat this as a training session.

428
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:29,272
Round 2!

429
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:03,128
Wait!

430
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:11,000
1-2-3-4, 2-2-3-4, 3-2-3-4.

431
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,664
You're good!

432
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:52,824
Come on...

433
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,144
This is getting to be no fun.

434
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:36,920
Wow, that was a good one!

435
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:26,808
If you have guts,
pull me up and we'll go another round!

436
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,552
Pal, don't let go. Please pull me up.

437
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,048
What's taking you so long?

438
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,296
I was waiting for the two of you.

439
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:19,288
The Three Musketeers.
All for one and one for all.

440
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,016
Attack the top.

441
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:23,704
Attack the bottom.

442
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:28,504
Divide and conquer.

443
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:35,800
We're invincible.

444
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:45,016
Ola. How are you?

445
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:46,712
What can I get for you, Miss?

446
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:48,440
A hamburger and a Coke.

447
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,072
Please have a seat while you wait.

448
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:56,216
Pal, smile a little.
I know you miss her.

449
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,192
Just do the order.

450
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,800
David. Come out.

451
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:06,296
- What's going on?
- Look.

452
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:34,296
How nice of you to visit us.

453
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,792
I'm looking for work.
Are you hiring for the summer?

454
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:37,944
Definitely.

455
00:47:38,328 --> 00:47:40,728
You must wish this summer never ends.

456
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,320
Hello, everyone!

457
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:45,720
What's up, our phony private eye?

458
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:46,968
Hey, don't give me a bad name!

459
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:50,520
Just got my membership card from Intl.
Association of Private Investigators.

460
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:51,832
I'm now perfectly legitimate.

461
00:47:52,696 --> 00:47:54,136
Congratulations!

462
00:47:54,232 --> 00:47:56,152
Do you guys want to expand
your business?

463
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:57,976
If you come on an assignment
with me one more time,

464
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:00,184
you could easily
add 20 more catering vans.

465
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:02,200
Another castle?

466
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:04,120
No. It's a hut this time.

467
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,232
That easy? Who are you rescuing?

468
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,248
It's a Black president.

469
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,128
He's been kidnapped
by an African cannibal tribe.

470
00:48:13,912 --> 00:48:15,736
Cannibals!

471
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:17,368
Hey, someone is looking for you.
