1
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,948
Wake up!

2
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,516
Let's go!

3
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,572
Who's that?

4
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,260
You bastard!
Don't you ever come out again!

5
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,180
Fighting with your wife again?

6
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,292
I didn't come home last night!

7
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:15,828
Then you asked for it!

8
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,268
Do you think I want this?

9
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,012
My girlfriend threatened to kill herself
if I didn't stay!

10
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,412
It was a matter of life and death!
What was I supposed to do?

11
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,972
What's a married man like you
doing with a girlfriend?

12
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,660
We Italians are a people of love.

13
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,156
We can't live without it.

14
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:35,668
All Chinese want to do is work.
You wouldn't understand.

15
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,452
We do understand.
We're just a bit more selective.

16
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,756
We have to go to work.
What are you going to do?

17
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,252
I can't go out! My wife will kill me!

18
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,596
Then move aside and let us go.

19
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,188
She'll kill you both too!

20
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:50,068
We'll leave from the balcony.
You have fun hiding here!

21
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,276
What about the Spaniard downstairs?

22
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,716
Don't worry. Watch me!

23
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,540
Hey, I'll go first!

24
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:10,100
Hello...

25
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,316
Are you all right?

26
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,620
Don't you Chinese know how to
use the stairs?

27
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,116
The Italian couple
is fighting on the stairway!

28
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,364
Come on.

29
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,092
Why did you signal me to jump?

30
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,340
I signaled you NOT to jump!

31
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,164
You should've said so!
I was about to...

32
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,028
What did you say?

33
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,012
but you already jumped!

34
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,542
To go to Via Laietana
What road must I take?

35
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,879
Via Laietana?

36
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,056
- Where is Via Laietana?
- What's Wrong?

37
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,155
As you go straight,
at the first intersection, turn right

38
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,497
After you arrive at Mallorca...

39
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,434
- After that?
- You will be lost

40
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,699
You've just passed Bilbao

41
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,070
Then what must I do?

42
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,234
If you turn left from Bilbao,
you'll see a fountain

43
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,142
Make sure the fountain works

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,412
If the fountain works?

45
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,277
Then Via Laietana will be in the
front of the left side

46
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,009
If the fountain doesn't work

47
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,746
If the city hall is closed, that
means there is road construction

48
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,822
Then you must take
a different road

49
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,753
I understand what you are saying,
Thank You

50
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,841
Hello

51
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,256
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

52
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,759
I didn't mean to do that on
purpose, officer

53
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,023
Let me help you out, officer

54
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,388
- I'm really sorry
- I'm sorry, officer

55
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,298
Don't make me see you
washing a car here again!

56
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,165
Get Lost! Do you not hear
what I'm saying?

57
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,033
- We won't do it again
- Yes

58
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,300
We won't do it again

59
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,543
Hello?

60
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,549
- Did you wash chimneys?
- No sir

61
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,983
Then why is your face so dirty?

62
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,684
Damn Chinese!

63
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,712
Private Investigator Matt?

64
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,208
Freeze!

65
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,608
Boss!

66
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,048
What on earth are you doing?

67
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,256
Nothing... I was just exercising...

68
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,664
Why didn't you get the light fixed?

69
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,968
The light is fine.
It's the power that's been cut.

70
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,904
When the electric company owes you,
they take forever to pay you back.

71
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:54,728
But they sure are efficient,
when you owe them!

72
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,280
What about me... no pay for three months
and I still come to work everyday!

73
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,912
What are you trying to say?

74
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,352
If it weren't for me,

75
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,752
you wouldn't have a job at all!

76
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,768
Without a job,
what right do you have to stay in Spain?

77
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:07,016
That's true.

78
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,096
But if I had some money, I could
have paid the electric bill for you.

79
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,112
Now you're talking!

80
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,376
Anybody come for me?

81
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,008
Just some guys from the phone company.

82
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,696
What business do they have with me?

83
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,480
None.
They just came to take the phone away.

84
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,456
That explains why it's so quiet here.

85
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,816
Oh, a bald guy named Alfonso
also came looking for you.

86
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:28,872
Did he come alone?

87
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,600
No, he was with two huge muscle men.

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,040
What did he want?

89
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,384
He said you promised to settle

90
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,728
a gambling debt of 100,000
pesetas yesterday.

91
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:38,280
Right... That was our secret code.

92
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,320
That means he has a new lead on a case.

93
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,144
He asked when you'd be back.

94
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,928
The next time he comes,
tell him I'm out of town on business.

95
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,824
That's another coded message meaning...

96
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:52,744
You better tell him the coded
message yourself.

97
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:53,704
Why?

98
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
He said he'd be back at noon.

99
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,584
Which is about now.

100
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,368
What? Why didn't you tell me earlier!

101
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,672
What's the big deal?
Is that another coded message?

102
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,976
Exactly. It's practically
a matter of life and death!

103
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,280
Meaning I have to
find a place to hide now!

104
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:09,736
As of this minute,

105
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,520
you are the Acting Chairman
of this agency.

106
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:15,176
You are in charge when I'm not around.

107
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,440
That is a promotion, isn't it?

108
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,264
Then what about a raise...?

109
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,240
It's hopeless!

110
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,000
Acting Chairman... is still a Chairman.

111
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,592
Better put on a tie.

112
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,560
Please have a seat.
Before you ask me to take your case,

113
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,576
please listen to
my principles of business.

114
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:48,072
Murder and arson, I do not do.
Burglary and theft, I do not do,

115
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,800
because I don't have the guts to do.

116
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:52,008
Now you may tell me
what I can do for you.

117
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
I'd like for you to find someone for me.

118
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,080
Finding a missing person? I've never...

119
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,096
You have not done that before?

120
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:02,184
I've never failed in
locating a person before!

121
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,448
I didn't know you were...

122
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:08,424
Chinese?
That's right, descendant of the Dragon!

123
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:10,440
I won't take up too much of your time.

124
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,264
I want you to help me find a woman.

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Named Gloria and her children.

126
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:16,488
A boy and a girl?

127
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,928
No. There's actually only one child.

128
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,488
Then is it a boy or a girl?

129
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,928
That you'll have to
find out for yourself.

130
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,944
Here's some information on Gloria.

131
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,704
The information is incomplete,

132
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,336
and the picture was taken 22 years ago.

133
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,448
That's a tough assignment.

134
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,176
I'd do it myself if it were easy.

135
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,096
Should you decide to take my case.

136
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,824
You must abide by two conditions.

137
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,088
I have a condition too.
But let's hear yours first.

138
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,296
First,
this case must be kept confidential.

139
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:46,216
Second, you must find this child
for me within 14 days.

140
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:49,096
Here is some money for your expenses.

141
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,592
You'll get US$20,000 more if you deliver.

142
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,288
Now you can tell me your condition.

143
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,296
My condition is
I accept all your conditions.

144
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:05,096
That's perfect.
You may reach me at this number.

145
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:10,568
Trying to test me?

146
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:27,816
What are you doing?

147
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,216
My liquid preserver is better than
any lamination.

148
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,232
Then I'll wait for your good news.

149
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,720
Let's get to work.

150
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,760
Here, go get us some business!

151
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,800
- Hey, Chinese boy, a Coke please.
- Okay.

152
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:03,080
- What would you like?
- Coffee with cream.

153
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:05,000
Coffee with cream, coming right up.

154
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,752
- Something to eat?
- No.

155
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,992
Something to eat, Boss?

156
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,240
A cup of 22, and a box of 16.

157
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,488
Right away.

158
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,040
Would you like something to drink, Picasso?

159
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,344
- Coca Cola.
- Coca Cola.

160
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:26,760
Here are the orders.

161
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,008
Okay.

162
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,792
Beautiful day... Beautiful business.

163
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,840
Beautiful rice!
That's a bit too much.

164
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,920
Nunchukas!
Here's yours.

165
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,480
And yours.

166
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:53,896
Delivery.

167
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,176
- Lady Boss, this is yours.
- Thank you.

168
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,216
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,624
Look at all the dust and fumes!
We can't eat here! Let's go.

170
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey! Hey!
How am I going to do business like this?

171
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:48,936
We were incredible!

172
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:50,856
Hey, can you guys go elsewhere?

173
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:53,640
What's it to you?

174
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,464
You're ruining my business!

175
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,248
Why don't you go elsewhere yourself, kiddo!

176
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:03,720
What? What are you going to do about it?

177
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,832
Let's have a race right in this square.

178
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:07,272
The loser picks up the tab for tonight.

179
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:08,232
Sure!

180
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,304
Good! I'll be the referee.
Ready. Go!

181
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,360
Move if you know what's good for you!

182
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,856
Faster... Faster!

183
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:35,080
Hey, where are all our customers?

184
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:38,632
All scared away by the Hell's Angels.

185
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:40,744
I'll ask them to leave.

186
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,816
Save your breath. I've already tried.

187
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,768
Pack up and move the car.

188
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:50,984
Why?

189
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,192
We're going to play Robin Hood!

190
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,960
Faster...

191
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:45,384
My mother told me not to fight.

192
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,208
Did your mother tell you not to
mess around here?

193
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:50,184
Yes, but it slipped my mind.
I'm going home right now.

194
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,080
I won't fight you two. I'm leaving.

195
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:58,792
Let's get back to work.

196
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,440
- Morning.
- Morning.

197
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:04,072
May I see your pass?

198
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,984
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

199
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,320
When will your father
be out of the hospital?

200
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,048
You think he has hemorrhoids?

201
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:21,448
He's mentally ill.
God knows when he'll be out.

202
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,864
Oh no! A flat tire!

203
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,688
Don't worry. We have a spare.

204
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,320
Who said I was worried?
I just said "Oh no!"

205
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,208
Then you shouldn't have said that!

206
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,128
What should I say then?

207
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,528
You should say, "Ha! Ha! A flat tire!"

208
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:38,120
What normal person would say that?

209
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,328
Ha! Ha! A flat tire!

210
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,400
You're right!
Normal person would not say that!

211
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,032
Let's change the tire.

212
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,464
Do you have a magnet?

213
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,000
No. What do you need a magnet for?

214
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:54,536
Then I can tie a string around it.

215
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:56,648
Why would you want to tie a string
around a magnet?

216
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,760
So I can lower
the magnet into the gutter.

217
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,488
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

218
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,624
Then why would you want to lower
a magnet into the gutter?

219
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,448
To get the nuts back.

220
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,080
What do you need the nuts for?

221
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:10,824
You mean the nuts for that?

222
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,976
You are smart.

223
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:16,008
How do we get the nuts out?
Unless we have a magnet.

224
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,024
There you go.

225
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,368
Then we're stuck.

226
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,920
I didn't know people with no brains

227
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:25,032
can survive in this world!

228
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:25,992
And you have brains?

229
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:30,216
Yes, a little rusty maybe,
but better than yours.

230
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:31,368
So what!

231
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:36,520
You can take one nut out of each
Of the three remaining tires.

232
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,536
Then you'll have a total of three nuts.

233
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:43,528
Use the three nuts on the loose tire
and drive slowly back to town.

234
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,024
That's a great idea!

235
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,424
Hey, you're so smart, why are you here?

236
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,264
I'm here because I'm crazy!

237
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,376
Not because I'm dumb!

238
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,544
Dumb and crazy are two completely
different things!

239
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,368
Do you understand, dumb pigs?

240
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:04,744
I better not waste
my time with you anymore.

241
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,760
I'm going to play on another beach.

242
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,336
Come on, let's take care of this.

243
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,400
- What's he doing?
- Who knows!

244
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,320
- Ask him.
- I don't want to.

245
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,664
Don't worry, then I'll ask him.

246
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,216
What are you doing, pal?

247
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:30,824
I'm a clock. I'm ticking.

248
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,800
- Oh... What time is it then?
- 2:30

249
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,064
No. It's 2:45.

250
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,408
Oh no, I'm running slow!

251
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,816
Hey, what's your father doing?

252
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,352
He's fishing.

253
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,072
Dad, I've brought Thomas to visit you.

254
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,488
Sh... You're scaring my fish away!

255
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,344
How are you, Mr. Chan? Are you bored?

256
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,648
The whole world is boring.

257
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:14,952
Have you found
a girlfriend for David yet?

258
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,320
There are not too many Chinese girls in Spain.

259
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,352
Spanish girls are just the same.
Love transcends nationality.

260
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,712
Hey, your father has a complete
change of heart.

261
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,344
I'm a little worried about him.

262
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,224
Oh, isn't that funny?

263
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,160
Mr. Chan, what is he doing?

264
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,176
He's telling himself a joke.

265
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,496
And that's how it ended.
Isn't that funny?

266
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,184
Why he's not laughing now?

267
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,392
He's heard that joke many times.

268
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,504
- He thinks he's Columbus!
- Really?

269
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,544
Well? How are you?

270
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Fishing? Catch one for me too!

271
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,784
I know I'm crazy. But you too?

272
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,472
How can I catch a fish from a bucket?

273
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,736
You father is definitely getting better.

274
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:08,936
The alarm!

275
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:18,536
It's time for my date.
I don't mind if you guys tag along.

276
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,184
Your father is in such a rush.
Who's he meeting?

277
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,432
I don't know.

278
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:43,272
That's why love transcends nationality.

279
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:45,768
No wonder the doctor said
he was getting better.

280
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,496
- Where's your mother?
- She's making herself up.

281
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:48,360
She doesn't want you to wait long.

282
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:49,704
So she sent me to let you know.

283
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,008
I don't mind waiting at all.

284
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,568
Tell her to take her time.

285
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:02,152
I know what you're thinking.

286
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:03,688
I know what you think I'm thinking.

287
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:05,224
But I'm definitely
not thinking that at all.

288
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,048
I'm not thinking you're thinking that.

289
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:10,120
I know you're thinking that because
I'm thinking that myself.

290
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,944
Since we're both thinking about that,

291
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,384
that means we agree.

292
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,496
That's right. That means we both
should not be doing that.

293
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:17,800
She's gorgeous!

294
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,008
She belongs to my father.
Stop thinking...

295
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:21,640
I've stopped thinking.

296
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
Mr. Chan, we'll be on our way.

297
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,056
I'll come visit again next week, Dad.

298
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:29,192
Not yet.
You haven't met my girlfriend yet.

299
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,440
That's all right.

300
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,168
Here she comes.

301
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:38,312
Gloria. You look exquisite today!

302
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,712
I've missed you so.

303
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:42,248
I know what you're thinking.

304
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:43,496
I know what you're thinking too.

305
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,512
- We're thinking about the same thing.
- What are we waiting for then?

306
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,488
I've got to run. Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye, Mr. Chan.

307
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,000
- Tell your father we're leaving too.
- Okay.

308
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,016
- Dad, we're leaving.
- That's right, Mr. Chan.

309
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:59,144
Wait, I want you to meet Gloria.

310
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,896
This is my son, David,
and this is his good friend.

311
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,528
- Hello!
- Hello!

312
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,024
Now run along and leave us alone.

313
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:07,368
Come on.

314
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,264
She's waiting for a taxi.

315
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,416
That's our chance.

316
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:16,488
You go over there and tell her
we'll give her a ride.

317
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:17,736
She can save on taxi fare.

318
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:19,272
What if she insists on taking a taxi?

319
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,808
She won't say that!

320
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:22,152
You're so confident,
why don't you talk to her.

321
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:23,496
I'll go get the car.

322
00:23:23,592 --> 00:23:25,032
I'm giving you a chance to try it out.

323
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:27,624
You go and I'll get the car. Go!

324
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,848
- Hello
- Hello

325
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,712
Miss... the taxi is here.

326
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,224
Goodbye.

327
00:23:58,984 --> 00:23:59,944
She turned you down?

328
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,480
No. I didn't ask.

329
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:03,208
You are so useless.

330
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:05,032
The result might have been the same.

331
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:06,728
Of course not!

332
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,936
Without asking, you had a zero chance.

333
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,296
Had you asked,
you would have had a 50% chance.

334
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:17,960
Elegant yet warm, she may be a princess.

335
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,976
A princess with a crazy mother?

336
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:21,224
Anything's possible.

337
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:23,912
That's true. Come on.

338
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,264
Two thousand pesetas?
Even your mother is worth more than that!

339
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,336
Don't be nasty.
I'm sure we can work this out.

340
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:37,064
How about four thousand pesetas?

341
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:39,080
Okay.

342
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,064
Thomas, two coffees please.

343
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,024
Isn't it a little early?

344
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,176
It won't take him that long.

345
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,784
While you're there, remember to get them
to settle their account.

346
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:49,512
Thomas, how much do I owe you?

347
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:53,736
Jennifer. 1,250 pesetas.

348
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:57,384
Here's 1,300.
Keep the 50 pesetas for your tips.

349
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,536
Thank you.

350
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:01,992
Can I take a spring roll? Thank you.

351
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:05,448
Thought she was so generous.
That spring roll costs 70 pesetas!

352
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:13,768
Are you new?

353
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:21,352
Miss, what's your price?

354
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:22,792
15,000 pesetas.

355
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,040
Wow, how about 3,000?

356
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,248
Save the money for your retirement.

357
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,128
3,000.

358
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:31,432
- 2,000.
- Get lost.

359
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:34,120
- Hello
- Hello

360
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:44,296
Hey, I saw the princess.

361
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:47,240
Are you kidding?
She wouldn't come to a place like this.

362
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:48,968
I thought I might be mistaken.

363
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,696
Why don't you go see for yourself?

364
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,096
15,000.

365
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:57,224
15,000 pesetas? That's $100 U.S. dollars.
That's fair. Let's go.

366
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:00,680
She's really going with him!

367
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,888
Let her be. It's her business.

368
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:04,424
Don't get so worked up!

369
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:08,744
Oh, you two are interested?
You've treated me to many spring rolls.

370
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:13,448
Now it's my turn to repay you.

371
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:17,672
Thanks, but no thanks!

372
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,112
She was so elegant.
Turned out she's just the same...

373
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:25,032
Not the same. She's more expensive.

374
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:28,296
She's probably just short on cash.
Hey, how much do you have?

375
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,544
- Why?
- Hand it over.

376
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:34,056
I've about 20,000. Even spending
the night doesn't cost this much!

377
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:35,112
What are you talking about?

378
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,224
I was just going to give her the money
and tell her to go home.

379
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,240
So she's got a night off.
Then what about tomorrow?

380
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,408
Pal, there are so many hookers
on this street.

381
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:45,096
They each have their sad stories.
How can we help them all?

382
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:48,936
We can't even afford to give them each
a free spring roll!

383
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,664
Get to work!

384
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,440
You took my wallet?

385
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,808
Hey, stop! Stop...

386
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,448
A thief...

387
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,272
Did you see a girl running pass here?

388
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,136
What kind of girl?

389
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,824
She's tall with long hair and
is wearing a red dress.

390
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:48,104
You should always watch your wallet
in places like this.

391
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:50,696
What's wrong with you?

392
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,904
I have a headache. I think it was
from the heat this afternoon.

393
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,344
So what do you want to do?

394
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:56,072
I want to pack up and go home.

395
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,440
Let's take care of this last order
and we'll go.

396
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,992
Thomas, have you seen
a girl this tall and skinny?

397
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,008
- This tall and this skinny?
- That's right.

398
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,368
There are many over there.

399
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:08,712
Be serious.

400
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:09,960
No.

401
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,648
- Now what?
- We'll keep looking.

402
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,008
So Princess is not only a hooker.

403
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:17,544
She's also a pickpocket.

404
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,824
Maybe the guy just left his wallet
elsewhere and blamed it on her.

405
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:25,224
Don't accuse anybody unless you see it
with your own two eyes.

406
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,376
We're home now.

407
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:27,624
You think I don't know that?

408
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:29,160
I wasn't talking to you.

409
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:31,336
- Miss.
- Hello.

410
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:37,192
You sneaky rat.
No wonder you weren't feeling well.

411
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,304
I was afraid you would be upset with me.
Glad you're not.

412
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,512
I'm sorry it was so uncomfortable.
Let's get out.

413
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,480
Miss, I'm afraid we can't give you
a ride home.

414
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,016
Did I say I want to go home?

415
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,128
Then why don't you come up
for a little while?

416
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:58,216
Are you trying to signal me
not to invite her up?

417
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:02,344
No. I grabbed the wrong hand.
Our apartment is right upstairs.

418
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,616
It is our pleasure. Welcome!

419
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:06,152
Thanks.

420
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,048
Looks like Valentino is home tonight.

421
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,689
Hey, have you seen Fatso lately?

422
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,047
Haven't seen it in awhile

423
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,187
- Did someone die?
- No, why?

424
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,160
You look like you just came
back from a funeral

425
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,623
Hey, Grasshopper. Long time no see!

426
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,735
It's you, Moby! Have a drink.

427
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:42,783
I can't get drunk today.

428
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,127
Have you seen Fatso?

429
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,527
I just got here myself.
Is it something important?

430
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:48,831
You're very clever.
It is something important.

431
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:52,159
I'm now the Acting Chairman
of Matt's Detective Agency.

432
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:53,983
But keep this to yourself.

433
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,135
Of course! Who do you take me for?

434
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:56,959
Your punishment is
to have another drink!

435
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,327
I really can't get drunk today. So long.

436
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,679
Hello, Moby, it's been a long while.
Have a drink.

437
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,943
- Just one.
- Okay.

438
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,359
I'll have another.

439
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,151
Have you seen Fatso?

440
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:27,455
No. What do you want him for?

441
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,335
Can I trust you guys?

442
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:32,735
This is not the first day we met.

443
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:33,791
Just keep your secret to yourself.

444
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:37,247
We're keeping enough secrets already.

445
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:40,031
All right. Listen closely.

446
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,143
Promise you
won't tell anyone about this.

447
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,487
I'm now the Acting Chairman

448
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,519
of Matt's Detective Agency.

449
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,111
I need Fatso for some very
important information.

450
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:52,127
That calls for celebration. Drink!

451
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:54,431
Thank you.
Cheers.

452
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,335
Moby's been promoted.

453
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,711
I really can't get drunk today.
I have to go find Fatso.

454
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,879
Congratulations, Moby!

455
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:12,831
Cheers... Cheers... Cheers!

456
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,679
Keep my little secret to yourselves.

457
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:25,023
Don't tell anyone!

458
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,175
Goodbye.

459
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:31,615
Goodbye.

460
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,103
Darling? This is Moby.

461
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:41,695
A kiss? Sure.

462
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,671
No. How could I forget you?

463
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,703
I've been very busy.

464
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:52,351
I swear that's the truth.

465
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,559
All right. All right.

466
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,383
Stop faking it.
She probably has a face of a pig.

467
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:59,839
Tonight? I really can't make it tonight.

468
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,607
All right. Another kiss?

469
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,239
Okay, a kiss. Listen up.

470
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,175
Was that loud enough for you?
Just hold on.

471
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:12,671
It's your wife.

472
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:19,967
Come in.

473
00:32:20,543 --> 00:32:23,999
I'll kill you for fooling around.

474
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,415
Come out right now! Let me shoot you.

475
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,583
Susanna, let's talk about this.

476
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,983
I've nothing to say. The bastard
even has lipstick on his underwear!

477
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:35,135
Honey, I'm innocent.

478
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,463
Those were ladies panties, not mine!

479
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,095
Then what are you doing in them?

480
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:42,111
It was an honest mistake.

481
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,223
I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to kill him!

482
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,775
- That's our door!
- Get out of my way!

483
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,983
We will if you point
that rifle the other way.

484
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,327
Let go!

485
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:53,823
Why are you grabbing me?

486
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:56,799
Wow, bouncy! You're upset because
you're afraid of losing him.

487
00:32:56,895 --> 00:32:58,335
If you kill him,
then there's really nothing left.

488
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:01,407
That was probably just a one-nighter.
He's still yours.

489
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,479
If you kill him,
you won't be able to find another man.

490
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:07,071
I know I still love him very much.

491
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,319
Then go talk him out of our apartment.

492
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,495
Dino... Dino...

493
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,583
Why don't you answer me?

494
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:19,231
Do you know how much I love you?

495
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:20,575
Me too.

496
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,359
Do you still remember when we first met?

497
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:26,335
- Yes. It was love at first sight.
- Really?

498
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:27,967
You're my whole life.

499
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,191
I'll have nothing if I don't have you!
Dino...

500
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,783
You bastard!

501
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:39,007
I'm going to kill you...
think you can run away? You pig!

502
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,943
Sorry to have imposed on you.

503
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,119
That's all right.

504
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,135
I have no plans to leave tonight.

505
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,151
What?

506
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:50,399
You don't like that?

507
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:53,087
Sure I do, if she's not afraid of us.

508
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:56,159
- What's there to be afraid of?
- That's right...

509
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:00,959
What's there to be afraid of?

510
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,047
Of your sleepwalking!

511
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:13,151
Fatso?

512
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,575
Fatso, what happened?

513
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:20,127
Have you been robbed?
Good thing I was late.

514
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,775
You're too heavy to move.

515
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,847
Hey, what really happened?

516
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:30,303
That's all right.
It's none of my business anyway.

517
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:32,895
Now I have some questions for you
that you must answer.

518
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:35,103
When you were the major pimp
on Sunset Boulevard 18 years ago,

519
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,311
did you know a Gloria?

520
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:40,863
She might have been pregnant
or just had a baby at the time.

521
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:44,319
What?

522
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,487
The guys who beat you up just now
came for Gloria too?

523
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,471
- Did you tell them?
- I didn't...

524
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,103
That's good.

525
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,695
I didn't want to,
but they beat me up real bad.

526
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,999
So you do know Gloria's whereabouts.

527
00:34:55,999 --> 00:35:00,031
Not now... before.

528
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:03,391
Man, can you speak a little clearer?

529
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:05,311
Where did Gloria use to live?

530
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,303
62 Thanksgiving Street.

531
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:15,583
You're not worried about her itchy fingers?

532
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:18,559
Oh, we can just hide our money.

533
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:22,399
What if she really tries to steal
and can't find any money?

534
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:25,727
Then she'll know we've taken precautions,
and her feelings will be hurt.

535
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,975
That's true.

536
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:32,063
Then let's just keep a few bills
in our wallets.

537
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,847
If she did steal,
it would be a bargain price

538
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,287
to pay to get to know her.

539
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,311
That's a great idea, Four Eyes!

540
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:05,343
- Did you give her the shirt?
- Yes.

541
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,071
She looks better in it than you.

542
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,471
- Are you two talking about me?
- Pretty.

543
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,351
I heard more than just one word.

544
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,847
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

545
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,823
Have you decided
where I'm going to sleep?

546
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,743
- In...
- The living room.

547
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,431
Thanks. My name is Sylvia.

548
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,391
My name is David.

549
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,831
And I'm Thomas.

550
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,807
Good night.

551
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,111
I'm not sleepy yet. You guys go ahead.

552
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,263
I want to watch a little TV.

553
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:37,183
- I'll turn the TV on for you!
- Thank you.

554
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:52,447
I'm going to bed.

555
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,935
You'll sleep much better with this pillow.

556
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:17,951
Thanks.

557
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,839
Can I get you a glass of water?

558
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,183
Sure. Thanks.

559
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,847
It gets cold here in the mornings.
Here's a blanket for you.

560
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,783
- Thank you so much.
- It's my pleasure.

561
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:48,063
Water?
Let me pour you a glass of milk instead.

562
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:49,503
That sounds good too.

563
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:06,111
Thank you.

564
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,567
Let's not waste time.

565
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:29,023
Which one of you
wants to go first tonight?

566
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:30,559
It's all the same to me.

567
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,143
We'll sleep in our own beds!

568
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,735
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

569
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:46,559
Was everything all right last night?

570
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:48,095
It was fine.

571
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,343
That's good.

572
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:56,063
Hey, have you seen my car?

573
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,023
No.

574
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,591
Susanna, my car has been stolen.

575
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:06,335
My car's been stolen.

576
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:07,871
I'm going to the cops now.

577
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:13,535
Princess left so early?

578
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,799
See? My money is still
lying safely in my wallet.

579
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:27,039
I was just being prudent.

580
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,959
You must have faith in this world.

581
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:35,295
My money's all gone!

582
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:38,751
I told you so.
Listen to the voice of experience.

583
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:41,439
I knew she had her eye on our money.

584
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:42,687
Your money in the drawer was like

585
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,511
a 24-hour ATM machine to her.

586
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:48,511
Shoes, on the other hand,
are a much smarter idea.

587
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:55,135
Damn! She took all my money too!

588
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,479
That's at least fair.

589
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,071
I told you not to
let her spend the night!

590
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:00,895
This is the first time
I've heard that from you.

591
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:03,871
She has guts! That's the end
of all our hard earned money.

592
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,271
Now that's an incorrect accusation.
She didn't take everything.

593
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,863
If only I could see her again!

594
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,495
I feel the same way.

595
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:11,647
What would you do?

596
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,087
I'd ask if she needed more money.

597
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,455
What's the matter with you?
Don't you know how to drive?

598
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,087
Do you have a license?

599
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,775
I'm sorry, Sir. It's my fault.
I'll pay for the damages.

600
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,983
That goes without saying!

601
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:37,919
Look at the dent!
It won't be the same again!

602
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:40,607
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me just this once.

603
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:42,911
You're lucky you ran
into a nice guy like me.

604
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:44,735
But it's very dangerous
to drive like that.

605
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,039
My brother always told me
to give up driving.

606
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,591
And now, another accident!

607
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:55,167
My brother's name is Dino Martini.
This is his car.

608
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:57,567
You give him a call
and he'll have your car fixed.

609
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,103
But...

610
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:01,119
I'm running late.
I've got to go to work.

611
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,751
Call me some time. We'll have lunch.

612
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,959
- All right. All right.
- Thanks.

613
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,607
Back up...

614
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:12,543
Go.

615
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,999
Bye!

616
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:39,967
Who's there?

617
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:44,383
What do you want?

618
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:46,207
We want you to come with us.

619
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,335
To the police station?

620
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,903
You're not cops and
I don't even know you.

621
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,151
Where do you want to take me?

622
00:41:57,343 --> 00:41:58,783
Some place fun. Now cooperate.

623
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,575
And what if I don't?

624
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:04,415
If you don't cooperate,
we'll force you to cooperate.

625
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,311
Let me go! Let me go!!

626
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:29,279
Let me...

627
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:53,151
Come on! Go after the girl!

628
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,423
Let's split up and search.

629
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:03,944
Split up and look!

630
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,414
It's those guys

631
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:13,248
When will you deliver the items?

632
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,360
You don't trust me or what?

633
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,021
Why did you give someone else the job?

634
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,221
Who?

635
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,467
That's what I'm supposed to ask!

636
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,229
They were some dangerous guys

637
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,602
I never paid someone else to do the work

638
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,641
- Then why...
- Get your hands off that problem

639
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,412
Just make sure they don't kidnap Sylvia

640
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,773
First tell me who they are

641
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,581
I have to know who I'm dealing with

642
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,345
- If you don't tell me, forget it
- Hold it right there

643
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,283
Sorry for giving you a hard time

644
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,417
But I have no choice

645
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,826
The only thing I could do is
raise the price I'm giving you

646
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,859
I'm assuming you need more
time to think

647
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,936
Yes, three seconds

648
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,372
One, two, three.
I'll do it

649
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,441
- All right, may God be with you
- Thank you

650
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,688
- Hello
- Hello

651
00:44:30,744 --> 00:44:32,664
I wonder why Moby wants to meet us
at the disco.

652
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,392
I'm sure he's up to no good again.

653
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,080
When we see him,
just say no to everything he asks.

654
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:46,776
Have a seat.

655
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,984
- Can't say no to that!
- That's true.

656
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:52,920
What would you gentlemen like to drink?

657
00:44:53,496 --> 00:44:55,192
Three beers and a bottle of XO.

658
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,840
How's the meals on wheels business?

659
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,432
No good, worse than our waitering days.

660
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:04,600
How's the catering van working out
after the conversion?

661
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:06,520
No good. It's even worse
than before it was converted.

662
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,496
Is Mr. Chan feeling better now?

663
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,416
No good. It's worse than before
he went into the hospital.

664
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:14,008
Really? He was already going after
people with knives!

665
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,888
Don't listen to him.
He's doing much better now.

666
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:19,096
That's good. Our drinks are here.

667
00:45:21,016 --> 00:45:23,032
Come on.
Let's drink to Mr. Chan's health.

668
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:24,856
No. We don't want to.

669
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:27,352
Can't say no to that! Cheers!

670
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,104
This "just say no"
business isn't working.

671
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:32,024
Let's try another trick.

672
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:38,552
I need you guys to help me out.

673
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,760
A girl ran into me this morning.

674
00:45:40,856 --> 00:45:42,008
Oh, the dog of the store

675
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,600
around the corner just had four puppies!

676
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,480
What do the puppies have to do

677
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:49,016
with my car accident?

678
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,224
Then what does your car accident
have to do with us?

679
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,888
Please hear me out.

680
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:59,960
After the accident,
the girl gave me a card.

681
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,464
Said the car belonged to her brother.

682
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,288
That still has nothing to do with us.

683
00:46:03,384 --> 00:46:06,744
But when I found this guy,
he said he didn't even have a sister.

684
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,240
Plus, his car was just stolen.

685
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:10,968
Then I gave him
a description of the girl.

686
00:46:11,064 --> 00:46:13,176
He said it sounded like the girl
you brought home last night.

687
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:15,384
Even if it were true,
it still has nothing to do with us.

688
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:16,632
That's right.

689
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:21,624
Oh, the girl gave me some money
to give to the both of you.

690
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,832
She's really returning the money?

691
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,384
Not returning. Just giving.

692
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,880
What do you mean give? She stole this
money from our apartment last night!

693
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:32,568
So you were her victims too.

694
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,104
And you still say it has nothing
to do with you?

695
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,048
Whatever you say.
Just hand over the money.

696
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:39,064
Wait. This isn't the money.

697
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:41,272
She still has the money.

698
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,384
I think I better get some exercise.

699
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:46,168
Me too.

700
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:02,584
Can you tell me where this girl
usually hangs out?

701
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:03,736
Her home.

702
00:47:03,928 --> 00:47:05,656
Any place she goes everyday?

703
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:07,192
The ladies room.

704
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,272
Don't mess around. Tell me the truth.

705
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,056
The truth? The truth is we don't know!

706
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,992
All right. Forget it.

707
00:47:17,432 --> 00:47:18,488
Come on. Please tell me!

708
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,024
I thought you just said forget it.

709
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,904
Please give me at
least something to go on.

710
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,016
We've already said we don't know.

711
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:27,512
Fine. Forget I even asked you!

712
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,952
I'm sorry I ever met you two!
I thought we were friends.

713
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:47,160
We are fellow Chinese.

714
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,888
And you won't even help me

715
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:49,944
with a small favor!

716
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,480
It's not like I'm the Red Cross
asking you for your blood!

717
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,128
I can hear me fine.

718
00:47:55,224 --> 00:47:56,376
Why you can't?

719
00:47:56,856 --> 00:47:57,912
What?

720
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,696
Even the worst Spaniards are better
than you!

721
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,344
What did you say? I can't hear
you over the loud speakers! Louder!

722
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,048
I SAID, SPANIARDS ARE THE WORST...

723
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,872
Sorry. My fault.

724
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:17,752
Okay. You got me again.

725
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:24,952
Who do you think Sylvia is?

726
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,104
She's a Spaniard.

727
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,696
Nonsense. I meant why is she wanted
by so many people?

728
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,232
Because she's beautiful.

729
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:31,768
Retard!

730
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,072
She's no retard! She's very bright!

731
00:48:34,264 --> 00:48:35,800
I meant you!

732
00:48:41,272 --> 00:48:43,000
- Sylvia.
- David.

733
00:48:43,192 --> 00:48:44,536
Long time no see. How are you?

734
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:46,456
Long? It's been less than 24 hours!

735
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,784
They want to force me to do something
against my will!

736
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:52,472
Friend, you should be nice to ladies.

737
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:06,008
What to kick me? Try it now!

738
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:13,688
What's going on?

739
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,128
Ask them!

740
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:16,952
The girl picked my wallet.

741
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:19,160
These two are her accomplices.

742
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:27,192
Stop right there!

743
00:49:40,152 --> 00:49:43,512
She fooled us again! Never believe
anything she says ever again!

744
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,336
You better remind yourself.

745
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:46,968
I never trusted her from the beginning.

746
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,848
Just look at the two of us now!

747
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,888
No need to overreact!
It's you.

748
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,944
It's you!

749
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,576
I came to thank you.

750
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:57,784
If it weren't for you,
I'd have had to spend the night in jail.

751
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,936
Don't thank us.

752
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,336
If we had known
why they were chasing you,

753
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,872
we wouldn't have helped at all.

754
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,000
Tell her not to go yet.

755
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:08,920
- I thought you said...
- Call her back.

756
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,552
Don't go yet!

757
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:12,856
We want to ask you something.

758
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,504
Would you mind coming up to
our apartment for a little while?

759
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,944
I was afraid you'd never ask!

760
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:21,688
You said you have something to ask her.

761
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:24,376
I've decided it's best that
you ask instead.

762
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,072
- Me?
- Go!

763
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:33,368
I would like to ask...
if you'd like something to drink.

764
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,288
Red wine please.

765
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:37,016
That's okay. I'll get the drink.

766
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:38,552
Cut to the chase!

767
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:45,560
Remember you spent the other night here?

768
00:50:46,136 --> 00:50:52,280
The next morning, we found out that...
My shirt was still here.

769
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,816
And the blanket was neatly folded.

770
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:58,712
Money! Gone!

771
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:04,824
But we were missing... missing... you.
That you'd left.

772
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:07,416
Fine. You can take a break.
I'll do the asking.

773
00:51:09,048 --> 00:51:10,968
What David meant to ask was the other
night when you spent the night,

774
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,792
did you steal our money?
- Yes.

775
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,576
The people that were chasing you.
Did you steal from them too?

776
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:16,632
Yes.

777
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,456
Don't be so rude!

778
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:21,048
Rude? You ask then.

779
00:51:22,776 --> 00:51:24,024
But why?

780
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:29,880
You're so pretty.
You could have easily... easily...

781
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,704
What he meant was
with a body like yours,

782
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,240
you could have done quite well

783
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:38,680
even as a hooker.

784
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,672
I detest people calling me a hooker!

785
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,072
I use my brain, not my body!

786
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:47,896
My body is not for sale!

787
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:51,256
Miss, I'm only the interpreter.

788
00:51:51,736 --> 00:51:53,560
You should have slapped him instead.

789
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,728
But it's still not
a good thing to steal.

790
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:03,256
My mother went into the asylum
when I was 14 years old.

791
00:52:04,696 --> 00:52:08,792
I've had to support myself since.

792
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,576
No one has even given me a chance.

793
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:18,776
All the men I've met,
no matter what they said,

794
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,520
the bottom line was the same.
They wanted my body.

795
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:24,824
That's true.
Those were his first thoughts too.

796
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,184
To these men,

797
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:33,848
stealing their money was like
teaching them a lesson.

798
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,192
Remember this lesson

799
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:36,824
when you see the next pretty girl.

800
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:39,864
I told you not to get involved.

801
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,880
I didn't mean the two of you.

802
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:44,568
After tonight,

803
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,504
I know you're good men.

804
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:50,904
I'll try to get the money back to you
as soon as possible.

805
00:52:51,096 --> 00:52:52,920
No hurry.
I just wanted to understand why.

806
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:55,320
When you can,
go ahead and pay him back first.

807
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:58,392
I'm not like him. He was saving the
money to get married in Hong Kong.

808
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:00,792
That's not true.
The money was for emergencies.

809
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,576
That means he doesn't need it.
Pay me first then.

810
00:53:04,152 --> 00:53:07,320
Any which way.
Just so long as the money is legal.

811
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:09,240
Thomas and I were just saying.

812
00:53:09,432 --> 00:53:11,160
Your mother
and my father are good friends.

813
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,048
We can't just
let you carry on like this.

814
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:15,160
- Is that right?
- Yes.

815
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,176
But he was afraid you're already
too far gone.

816
00:53:18,616 --> 00:53:20,056
If given a choice,

817
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:21,976
who would not choose a normal life?

818
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:23,704
What if you were given a choice?

819
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:25,528
Then I would try to start over again.

820
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,176
That's good enough. Four Eyes, didn't
you always say you needed an extra hand?

821
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,000
No. I never said that!

822
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:33,976
Oh yes! But...

823
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:35,416
He doesn't know if you can stick it out.

824
00:53:35,992 --> 00:53:38,392
How would you know if you don't
give me a chance?

825
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,616
All right.
You're on probation for three months.
