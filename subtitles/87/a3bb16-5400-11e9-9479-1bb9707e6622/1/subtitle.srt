1
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>Is there anybody</i>
<i>Going to listen to my story</i>

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>All about the girl who came to stay</i>

3
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>She's the kind of girl</i>
<i>You want so much</i>

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
<i>It makes you sorry</i>

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,200
<i>Still you don't regret a single day</i>

6
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>Hold me tight</i>

7
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>Tell me I'm the only one</i>

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,900
<i>And then I might</i>

9
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,200
<i>Never be the lonely one</i>

10
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,900
<i>So hold me tight</i>

11
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>Tonight</i>

12
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
<i>Tonight</i>

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>It's you</i>

14
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
Who will take me out next week?

15
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,800
You'll be halfway around the world.

16
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,700
Well, it better not be Phil Scully.

17
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,500
Come here.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,700
I'll be back soon.

19
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,900
They give you a furlough
after boot camp.

20
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
And after that?

21
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,200
- Yeah. All right.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
All right, then.

23
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't spend it all at once.
Last one for a while, eh, son?

24
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,300
- Last one ever, Cyril.
- I felt the same at your age.

25
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,300
I told myself, "When I'm 64,
I'll be long gone from this place."

26
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,500
- But I'm still here.
- Move it along.

27
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,200
Some of us are thirsty and
the pubs have been open five minutes.

28
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Hi, Charlie.

29
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,400
You're gonna miss this place.

30
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,100
Don't count on it, Phil.

31
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,200
I've ironed your best shirts.

32
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,900
I'll be shoveling coal in a furnace,
Mum. I don't think I'll be wearing them.

33
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You'll be wearing them
when you go ashore in America.

34
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, well, that could be
months from now.

35
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,700
If you wanted a seafaring life...

36
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
...couldn't you have
signed up for the Mersey Ferry?

37
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,500
At least you'd be home
for your supper every night.

38
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,100
I sometimes feel
you're not telling me everything.

39
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just need a break
from the yard, Molly.

40
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
I'll be back before you know it.

41
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Or do you need a break from me?
Is that what this is about?

42
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Come here.

43
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,700
<i>Close your eyes and I'll kiss ya</i>

44
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
<i>Tomorrow I'll miss ya</i>

45
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,100
<i>And remember I'll always be true</i>

46
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,800
- Pull the other one.
- What?

47
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,900
<i>And then while I'm away</i>

48
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>I'll write home every day</i>

49
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,200
You better.

50
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,000
<i>And I'll send all my loving to you</i>

51
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,300
You bastard.

52
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,900
- Bye, sweetheart!
- Bye!

53
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600
Goodbye, Danny!

54
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,500
Bye.

55
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,000
- Go deep!
- Let's go...

56
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,600
...Wildcats!

57
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
All right, ladies, let's take a break.
Come on.

58
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>Yeah, I'll tell you somethir</i>

59
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,000
<i>I think you'll understand</i>

60
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,800
<i>When I say that somethir</i>

61
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,500
<i>I wanna hold your hand</i>

62
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,900
<i>Oh, please say to me</i>

63
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>You'll let me be your man</i>

64
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>And please say to me</i>

65
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,400
<i>You'll let me hold your hand</i>

66
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,700
<i>And when I touch you</i>
<i>I feel happy inside</i>

67
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,800
<i>It's such a feeling that my love</i>

68
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,100
<i>I can't hide</i>

69
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Hop in.

70
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.

71
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
Sorry. Excuse me.

72
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,500
Shit! Goddamn it.

73
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,300
Thanks, man.

74
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,300
Excuse me, you don't where I
could find Professor Huber, do you?

75
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
No such person.
Not that I'm aware of.

76
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Professor Wesley Huber?

77
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,800
Listen, I've pissed off
every professor in Princeton...

78
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,700
...and he's not one of them.

79
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,600
Oh, wait a second,
there's a Wes Huber.

80
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,200
That's him right over there.

81
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
Can I have a word?

82
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
If you're looking for work here,
check with administration.

83
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,100
I got a job, thanks.

84
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,100
You sound like a limey.

85
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I am, yeah.

86
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,000
I was stationed there during the war.
I had some good times.

87
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah, I know.

88
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,500
At Burtonwood, right?

89
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,700
How would you know that?

90
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,000
l... I believe I'm your son.

91
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't think so.

92
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
Me mother's Martha Feeny.

93
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,700
How'd you track me down?

94
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Through Army records.

95
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
If I would have known about you...

96
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,700
What? You would've come back,
is that it?

97
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,700
You know, she said that wouldn't
have proved that you loved her...

98
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,400
...only that you felt obligated.

99
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,900
Well, it would have been better
than raising a kid on her own.

100
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,800
Yeah, well, she wasrt the only one
in those days.

101
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,800
You could excuse a bastard by saying
his dad was killed in the war.

102
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,300
Did she find someone else?

103
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,300
There were a few hopefuls
over the years, yeah.

104
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
I think I scared them off.

105
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,300
- Listen, kid, l...
- It's Jude.

106
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,900
Jude.

107
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
I got a family.
I got a wife, I got two kids.

108
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,100
Yeah, look. Mr. Huber,
I didn't come here to derail your life.

109
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,000
You know? And I'm not here
for your love or your approval.

110
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm just here so that we both...

111
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,200
Both know
that the other one exists.

112
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
All right.

113
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,100
- Fifteen bucks says you miss this shot.
- Fifty says your sister still marries me.

114
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Yeah, well, maybe.

115
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,600
All right, window. Let's go.

116
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,300
- All right, ladies.
- There you go.

117
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,800
- Ready?
- Yep.

118
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
Okay.

119
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,000
Fore!

120
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Run!

121
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,900
You missed!

122
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,300
- Whatever.
- It was the wind.

123
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,100
- Set me up.
- I believe in you.

124
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,100
You couldn't hit the barn side
of a broad, man. Come on.

125
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
There you go.

126
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,400
Fore!

127
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

128
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
- How do you like me now?
- We're gonna get you, asshole!

129
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,100
How do you like me? Go to bed.
Go to bed, you ain't got nothing.

130
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,200
- Yeah, they're going back into...
- They're not going back to bed.

131
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
- No, they're not.
- Go, go, go.

132
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Go, go, go.

133
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
They went this way. Come on!

134
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,100
Shit, I'm out of shape.

135
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,100
You're the guy who was
asking for the janitor, right?

136
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Yeah.

137
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,100
So, what are you,
like the assistant janitor?

138
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm just bunking down here,
you know, temporarily.

139
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
- Why?
- Why do you need to know?

140
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
You're wanted by the cops, huh?
FBI?

141
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,800
You know, it looks to me as though
you're the one who's on the run.

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah.
Thank you for that, by the way.

143
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
What would they have done
if they caught you?

144
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I don't know. Something involving
genitalia and shoe polish.

145
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

146
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,200
- Where's that accent from?
- Same place as me. Liverpool.

147
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
And do you have a name?

148
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,800
Yeah.

149
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,600
- It's Jude.
- Max.

150
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,700
I'm pleased to meet you.

151
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,800
Well, Jude,
as a stranger to our shores...

152
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,900
...the least I can do is offer you
some Ivy League hospitality.

153
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,500
Cheers.

154
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
Welcome to the nursery.

155
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,700
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>If I sang out of tune</i>

156
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
- Thank you.
- <i>Would you stand up</i>

157
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,700
<i>And walk out on me?</i>

158
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,300
- Hey. I'm Chris.
- <i>Lend me your ears</i>

159
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,400
- <i>And I'll sing you a song</i>
- Thanks.

160
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,700
- <i>And I'll try not to sing out of key</i>
- There we go. All right.

161
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,900
<i>I get by</i>
<i>With a little help from my friends</i>

162
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,900
<i>He gets high</i>
<i>With a little help from his friends</i>

163
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,600
- Take it easy, man.
- Hold it in.

164
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
I can't believe her.

165
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm never having children.

166
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
- Really?
- No.

167
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,100
Think about it, it's pure narcissism.

168
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,500
I mean, people putting out little
carbon copies of themselves, going:

169
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,600
"Oh, doesn't he have
his father's eyes?

170
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,700
Doesrt he have his mother's lips?"
It's...

171
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,800
It's disgusting.

172
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, what about adoption?

173
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Luce!

174
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,900
Lucy!

175
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
<i>Every night</i>
<i>When everybody has fun</i>

176
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,900
<i>Here am I</i>
<i>Sitting all on my own</i>

177
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,000
<i>It won't be long, yeah</i>

178
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,900
<i>Till I belong to you</i>

179
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,200
<i>Since you left me, I'm so alone</i>

180
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
<i>Now you're coming</i>
<i>You're coming on home</i>

181
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
<i>I'll be good like I know I should</i>

182
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,400
- Do you know when?
- Next weekend.

183
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,500
He got a pass
before his outfit ships out.

184
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
I tell you, man,
this is my favorite time of day.

185
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,200
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

186
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

187
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
- Hey.
- Max!

188
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,300
Jailbait.

189
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,900
- How are you? Good.
- I'm good.

190
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
- Damn.
- Max, you're such a pervert.

191
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
What? Some of them
are kind of cute.

192
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,400
When did Emily get tits?

193
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Emily.

194
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,100
This is Jude. I asked him over
for Thanksgiving.

195
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,800
We don't have it in England.
Is it...? Is it a big deal?

196
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,700
Well, it's a heartwarming
American tradition.

197
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Yeah. It celebrates the time...

198
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,900
...when the Indians shared their food
with the early settlers.

199
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,900
And how did we repay them?
We slaughter them in thousands...

200
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
...and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate.

201
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm Lucy.

202
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,000
I went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs werert there.

203
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
- lf you'd asked...
- You'd have said no.

204
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,100
I never knew Princeton
had a golf program.

205
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
They don't.

206
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,000
It's just my way of unwinding,
you know?

207
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,300
Whack a few balls around
at the end of the day.

208
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Those lectures can fry your brains.

209
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,300
"Lectures." What lectures?
He dropped two courses.

210
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,700
Is that fashionable?

211
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,100
Is what fashionable?

212
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,100
- Your haircut, or lack of one.
- Androgyny suits you, Max.

213
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,000
These kids are so spoiled.

214
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,300
I washed dishes
to put myself through college.

215
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,400
You've never washed one since.
More stuffing, Jude?

216
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,300
I'm stuffed enough, thanks.

217
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,400
You have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees?

218
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
- Please.
- You know, Uncle Teddy...

219
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,200
...he won't have to
pay them much longer.

220
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
- I'm dropping out.
- The cranberry sauce isn't as tangy...

221
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I am not cut out...

222
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,100
...for this collegiate crap.

223
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,400
No problem. What are you...?
What's your plans?

224
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,100
You gonna buy a broken-down
station wagon...

225
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,400
...and drive across America
like Jack...

226
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,900
- What is it?
- Kerouac.

227
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,600
- Mom.
- I read.

228
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,200
Well, actually, I was hoping to borrow
your car, Dad. It's got AC and stereo.

229
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,700
Goddamn it, Max!

230
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Be serious for once.

231
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,600
What do you actually intend
to do with your life?

232
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,300
Why is it always about,
"What will you do?"

233
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
"What will you do? What will he do?
Oh, my God, what will he do?"

234
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,200
Do, do, do, do, do.

235
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,200
Why isn't the issue here who I am?

236
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,700
Because, Maxwell,
what you do defines who you are.

237
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,000
No, Uncle Teddy,
who you are defines what you do.

238
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,300
Right, Jude?

239
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Surely it's not what you do...

240
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,900
...but it's the way that you do it.

241
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Sorry you had to sit through that.

242
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,300
Is it like that at your house?

243
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,300
Not really, no.

244
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
It's just me and me mum...

245
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,200
...so me education
is rarely a topic of conversation.

246
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,100
Max said you came here
to find your father.

247
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,500
- You jumped ship.
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

248
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,000
It was weird when I got
this Princeton address, you know.

249
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,600
I had it in my head that he might be
some kind of Einstein or something.

250
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,300
But it turns out he's just
a working stiff like meself.

251
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,000
How'd it go?

252
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,000
It was okay.

253
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
I mean, he didn't invite me back
for Thanksgiving.

254
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Might've been a bit tricky anyway. I've
spent half me life trying to hate him.

255
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,000
He walked out on me mum
when I was just a bun in the oven.

256
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,700
I never realized I had it so easy.

257
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,800
I mean, we're so... normal.

258
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, yeah?

259
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,100
I don't know, dinner was quite lively.

260
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,900
You know, when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other?

261
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,900
- Dessert. Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. All right, yeah.

262
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,900
My God, you...
You have perfect teeth.

263
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
No, you do, they're perfect.

264
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,100
People in Liverpool,
they only seldom do.

265
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,500
They stick out in all different
directions. It's horrible.

266
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,800
You never heard of braces?

267
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes, I have, thank you very much.
We use them to keep our trousers up.

268
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,300
Goddamn it! It's like this
every time I come home.

269
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,200
I mean, what the hell do they
talk about when I'm not here?

270
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,300
You, mainly.

271
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
Jude, shit. I'm sorry, man.

272
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
Come on, we gotta
do something with him.

273
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,000
He's a sailor on leave. He needs
a bar, a brawl and a brothel.

274
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
<i>I've just seen a face</i>

275
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
<i>I can't forget</i>
<i>The time or place where we just met</i>

276
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
<i>She's just the girl for me</i>

277
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
<i>And I want all the world to see</i>
<i>We've met</i>

278
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
No.

279
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,300
Why, thank you.

280
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, yes!

281
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
What will you do
if you don't go back to college?

282
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,800
What any irresponsible, unmotivated
dropout would do:

283
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,900
Go to New York. Like, tonight.

284
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
What's the rush?

285
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,400
I mean, I like it here.

286
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Come on. The most exciting thing
that ever happened here...

287
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,500
...was when they got automatic
pin setting. I'm talking the Village.

288
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
Think about it.
Great music, great dope, orgies.

289
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
It'll be a gas!

290
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah!

291
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,500
She's got a boyfriend.

292
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,200
That's okay. I've got a girlfriend.

293
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,900
Forget it, man.

294
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm not living here.

295
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,800
You must be the two who called.

296
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,100
Yeah. We saw your ad
in <i>Rat Magazine</i>.

297
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Right. Come on in.

298
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,700
It's our kitchen through here.

299
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,300
This would be our main room...

300
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,800
...living room, whatever room.

301
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,700
Real bummer losing my last tenant.

302
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,400
He played sax at the Gaslight.
Out all night, slept all day.

303
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
We could do that.

304
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
You'd have to, man,
because I'm a singer.

305
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,800
I can't have no one screwing up
my beauty sleep before 2:00.

306
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,900
Someone can take this bedroom.

307
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm gonna need two weeks in advance,
guys. Is that a problem?

308
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,000
- No, no, no, that's not a problem at all.
- You look kind of clean-cut.

309
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,300
Then again, could've murdered
your granny with a hammer.

310
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,700
Actually, we're students.

311
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm Jude and he's Max.

312
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm Sadie.

313
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,600
That's me. Out of bounds.

314
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,000
- Are you famous, Sadie?
- Man.

315
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Not yet.

316
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,000
You guys have
a good memory for faces?

317
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah, I think so. Why?

318
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,400
There's no mirror in your bathroom.

319
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
- Oh, man! What a fox!
- Yes!

320
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,200
I mean, for an older woman, huh?

321
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,600
Max, I will pay for my share of the rent
just as soon as I get a job, man.

322
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,700
Jude, don't worry about it.
Look where we are, man.

323
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Move it, pal. Come on.

324
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Get out of here.

325
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,400
Get on the ground!
Get down!

326
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,200
<i>Attention.</i>

327
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,900
<i>The 7:05 Northeast Limited</i>

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200

<i>Rat.</i>

333
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,400
What the hell are you doing, man?

334
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Desmond, this boy
wants to talk to you.

335
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,600
Hey.

336
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
I love it.

337
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,200
"Just stand on your head."
She said, "Why?"

338
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,800
"I wanna see what it'd look like
through a beer."

339
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,400
- Get off me.
- Oh, man.

340
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,600
Hey, do you write your own songs,
Jo-Jo?

341
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

342
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,700
I got 20 in a notebook...

343
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
...another 10 in my head.

344
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,500
Leave room for anything else?

345
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,100
Music's the only thing
that makes sense anymore, man.

346
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,100
Play it loud enough,
it keeps the demons at bay.

347
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,000
Hello, hello. Who are you?

348
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,000
- Prudence.
- Where you from, Prudence?

349
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,300
Nowhere.

350
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,600
Oh, and before nowhere?

351
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,600
Ohio.

352
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,600
Then I was living
with this guy across the street.

353
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Did he do that to you?

354
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,200
He was a mistake.

355
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,800
Where'd she come from?

356
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,500
She came in
through the bathroom window.

357
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,900
Thanks.

358
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
I understand you need to get away...

359
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
...but why not come to Europe
with your father and me?

360
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I'd rather be with Max.

361
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,700
In New York?

362
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,700
Just for the summer,
till I go to college.

363
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,300
I shudder to think how Max lives,
or what he's up to.

364
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,900
He always attracts
the most dubious people.

365
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,500
He's probably surrounded by
promiscuous dope fiends.

366
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,400
Mom!

367
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,800
You know me. I don't even smoke.

368
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,800
The big, bad city's
not gonna get me.

369
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,700
Isn't she fantastic?

370
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,800
Amazing.

371
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
She's our landlady.

372
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,100
- You live with my brother too?
- Yeah, him and Jude took me in.

373
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,600
I don't sleep with them anymore.

374
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,100
Thank you.

375
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,400
Hey, Lucy?

376
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
How do you like New York so far?

377
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,100
This is all I've seen. I only
got off the train three hours ago.

378
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,700
- Oh, yeah?
- Let's hear it for the Po Boys, y'all.

379
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,000
Do you wanna go out
and get some fresh air?

380
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,600
- Yeah?
- How about another one?

381
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,700
- All right, bring it home!
- All right!

382
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,700
Man, it's packed in there.

383
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
Your girlfriend didn't look too happy
about us leaving together.

384
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,300
She... She's not my girlfriend.

385
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,900
Well, you know, she's a friend
who's a girl.

386
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,900
I thought you'd gone home.

387
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,900
No, no. I like it here.

388
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,500
Although I'm not really here.

389
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,300
You know, without a visa
I don't officially exist.

390
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,800
It's exhilarating in a way. It's like
a weird kind of freedom. You know?

391
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,700
Hey.

392
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,600
Are you okay?

393
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I mean, you know,
I heard what happened.

394
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,700
Yeah.

395
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,800
But...

396
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,700
...a letter came for Max
before I left home...

397
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,500
...and I haven't been able
to bring myself to give it to him yet.

398
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,900
- Scrub the floor, right, Jo-Jo?
- That's disgusting.

399
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,900
That was great, man.
You got a really good sound.

400
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,000
You shouldn't have
dropped out of college, Max.

401
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,700
Your sister's right. You had that
whole Ivy League thing going for you.

402
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,100
- And your father's a lawyer and shit.
- Max, what exactly does it say?

403
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,200
It says I have to report to
an induction center on the 7th.

404
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Bummer.

405
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,700
You got a week to contract
some fatal disease.

406
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,200
Guys tried all kinds of stuff
when I did my time.

407
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,900
- You were in the military, Jo-Jo?
- No escaping it where I'm from.

408
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,300
I went in when I was 17.

409
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Say you're a homo.
They don't take homos.

410
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,700
Just say you're a pedophile.
Say you wanna go into the villages...

411
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,800
...and you wanna rape and pillage
all the little girls that look like me.

412
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,500
I remember this one cat.

413
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,100
He ate a ton of beets
the night before the physical.

414
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,800
- Looks like blood when you piss.
- Well, I hate beets.

415
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,200
- Can we get the check, please?
- In a minute.

416
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,100
- What is with these pricks?
- Calm down.

417
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,600
My mate's brother swallowed
a ball of cotton to get out the army.

418
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,000
What does that do?

419
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,700
It shows up as, like,
a shadow on the x-ray.

420
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,200
- Track marks. They won't take a junkie.
- You want him to shoot up?

421
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,100
No. We could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times.

422
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,500
Make it a rusty needle.
Then it'll get infected.

423
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,700
- That could work.
- Yeah. Gets all nasty.

424
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,700
- Max.
- Oh, man, Max, what are you doing?

425
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
You can burn that paper, boy...

426
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,900
...but you still gotta show.

427
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,200
Daniel couldn't wait to go.

428
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,400
He saw it as his patriotic duty.

429
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,200
And I went along with it.

430
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,300
I was proud of him, I guess.

431
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,300
Apparently, he did
something brave...

432
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,300
...so he wore a medal
when they buried him.

433
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,900
You don't have to talk about this.

434
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,200
I want to.

435
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,600
I can't pretend like it didn't happen.

436
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,400
He was my first boyfriend.

437
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,500
He was the first person
I ever knew to die.

438
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,100
I'd never even been
to a funeral before.

439
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,400
I'm so scared for Max.

440
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,700
Listen, no one and no gun
is gonna get Max.

441
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,300
You know, he's so twisted,
he'll bend his way out of this fix.

442
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,600
Hope you're right.

443
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,700
I am right.

444
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,800
I love the bugger.

445
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,700
- Do you have the draft in England?
- Not anymore.

446
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,300
Well, I'd have been exempt
as a shipyard worker.

447
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,900
You should've studied art.

448
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,700
Yeah.

449
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,700
Well, I had to bring money
into the house.

450
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,200
So I joined the ranks
of the great unwashed.

451
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,200
Here. Come here.

452
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
Come here.

453
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,100
A little closer.

454
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,800
I just wanna get your eyes right.

455
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,300
You two, scram!
You're defacing city property.

456
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,800
- Oh, shit.
- What are you talking about?

457
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,500
This was just a crappy wall
and now it's a work of art.

458
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,200
You want me to come down there?

459
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,100
Please do come down.
You'll scuff up them shiny black boots.

460
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,500
Idiot.

461
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,500
Shit! Come on, you don't want to
get in trouble with the law.

462
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,000
- Let's go!
- Go! Go, go, go.

463
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,100
Jude, Jude, come here. Come here.

464
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,500
<i>If I fell in love with you</i>

465
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,100
<i>Would you promise to be true</i>

466
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:11,700
<i>And help me understand</i>

467
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,100
<i>'Cause I've been in love before</i>

468
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,200
<i>And I found that love was more</i>

469
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:28,000
<i>Than just holding hands</i>

470
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:37,000
<i>If I give my heart to you</i>

471
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:45,300
<i>I must be sure from the very start</i>

472
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:54,500
<i>That you would love me</i>
<i>More than her</i>

473
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,400
<i>If I trust in you</i>

474
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,100
<i>Oh, please, don't run and hide</i>

475
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,400
<i>If I love you too</i>

476
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:24,500
<i>Oh, please, don't hurt my pride</i>
<i>Like her</i>

477
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,800
<i>'Cause I couldn't stand the pain</i>

478
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:42,900
<i>And I would be sad if our new love</i>
<i>Was in vain</i>

479
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,700
So that's the way it is.

480
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,600
Yeah. That's the way it is.

481
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,600
Yeah, well, speaking as a brother,
I think she could do better.

482
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,800
Max, get out.

483
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,100
Well, excuse me, but as blissful as
you are in the throes of young love...

484
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,300
...I'm just letting you know
I got a date with Uncle Sam.

485
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,800
<i>I want you</i>

486
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,400
<i>I want you so bad</i>

487
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,200
<i>I want you so bad</i>

488
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,300
<i>It's drivir me mad</i>

489
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,800
Any reason you shouldn't
be in this mars Army, son?

490
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,300
I'm a cross-dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung.

491
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,300
Long as you don't have flat feet.

492
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,200
You know what really pisses me off?
Is I swallowed all those cotton balls...

493
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,000
...and they never even
took an x-ray.

494
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,700
- You still have options, man.
- Yeah, jail or Canada...

495
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,300
...and they both suck.

496
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,800
I mean, I could never come home.
So, what is it?

497
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,400
It's a choice of a 6-by-4 cell or an
endless wasteland of frozen tundra.

498
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,600
- Montreal's cool.
- Man, they speak French.

499
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,000
So learn French.
Learn French or die.

500
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,600
You think Sadie knows?

501
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,900
Knows what?

502
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,200
Let me see.

503
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,000
- No way.
- You look gorgeous.

504
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,300
Sadie, come on. What...?

505
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,100
- It's my band, honey.
- I can't wear this.

506
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,000
It's Tuxedo Club. For my 'do.

507
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,500
Yeah?

508
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,500
- Cool.
- Don't start.

509
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,600
What is it, Max?

510
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,700
Prudence. Come on, sweet pea.

511
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,300
We all love you.

512
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,800
- How long's she been in there?
- All night, I guess.

513
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,400
- Come on, Pru.
- What's going on?

514
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,100
It's Prudence.
I think she's hung up on me.

515
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,000
<i>Dear Prudence</i>

516
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,500
<i>Wort you come out to play?</i>

517
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,800
<i>Dear Prudence</i>

518
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,600
<i>Greet the brand-new day</i>

519
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,800
<i>The sun is up, the sky is blue</i>

520
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,400
<i>It's beautiful and so are you</i>

521
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,000
- Sadie, we gotta go.
- Later.

522
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,900
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ.</i>
<i>How many kids did you kill today?</i>

523
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,900
Our voice is our weapon.
And united we will win!

524
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,800
That's right, yeah!

525
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,800
You can crush the idealists,
but you cannot crush their ideals!

526
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,300
The Americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies.

527
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,900
Every day the hatred increases...

528
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,100
...in the hearts of the Vietnamese
who want us out!

529
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,900
The image of America
will never again...

530
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:53,400
...be the image of revolution,
freedom and democracy...

531
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,100
...but the image
of violent imperialism!

532
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,300
Hey, Luce! Luce, come on,
stop worrying about it.

533
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,800
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

534
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,500
I could go in the Army
and not get shipped to anywhere.

535
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,100
Play a lot of cards, learn how to box.

536
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,800
Come on, look at this.
It's happening everywhere, man.

537
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Maybe LBJ will have a change of heart
and call the whole thing off, huh?

538
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,800
This war is totally immoral!

539
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,100
- As soon as possible.
- Yeah, I can get it.

540
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,400
Paco. This is Lucy Carrigan.

541
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,500
She's an old friend.
She's not a student...

542
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,000
...but she's interested in what we do.
Wanted to meet you.

543
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,400
- Paco.
- Nice to meet you.

544
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,000
How'd you hear about us?

545
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,700
I saw you at the Fifth Avenue peace
march. I was moved by your speech.

546
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,400
I'm thinking of renting the spare room
since Prudence split.

547
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,900
Jesus, Max.

548
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,800
Well, she's Prudence. She'll show.

549
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,400
You're up before 2 and
looking wicked cool. Who's it for?

550
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,300
- I have a meeting.
- Why, is that a prayer meeting?

551
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,400
Yeah, for your twisted soul.

552
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,000
- Put my shirt away when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.

553
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,700
What the hell was that?

554
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,200
That's Dr. Robert.

555
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,100
He's here to plug his book.

556
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,200
Spread the word.

557
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,200
There's a party for him tonight
if you wanna join me.

558
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,200
We could celebrate.

559
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
I haven't said yes yet, Bill.

560
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,600
Sign with my label.

561
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,500
I'll put you in a studio within a month
and get you a publishing deal.

562
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,700
It sounds fantastic, man. But I still
gotta talk it over with the guys.

563
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,000
No, you don't.

564
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,900
- Whose place is this?
- Luna Park, Dr. Robert's publisher.

565
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,500
There she is. Luna!

566
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,600
Bill, good to see you.

567
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,400
Luna Park.

568
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,000
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- This is Sadie.

569
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,700
Fabulous singer and future star,
if she's smart and signs with me.

570
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,700
Oh, look at this, pink punch.

571
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,200
Cheers.

572
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,700
- You're not listening.
- Your guitar sound is a little lazy.

573
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,500
- We need it tighter, not slick.
- This band gets behind me.

574
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Robert.

575
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Time is not on our hands, people.

576
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,800
Time is slipping through them.

577
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,600
We gotta transcend the bullshit,
and fast.

578
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,000
But, hey, no point butting your heads
bucking the system.

579
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,300
Let them get all snarled up
in their dreary hive.

580
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,300
Never knock the way
another cat swings, man.

581
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,700
Hate to mess with your groove,
New York...

582
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,000
...but we're about two years
ahead of you on the coast.

583
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,200
We already graduated
from what's been going on...

584
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
...to where it's gone.

585
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Amen.

586
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,400
Nice. Nice.

587
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:27,900
Love the people. Love the people.
We love the people.

588
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,600
Where are we?

589
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,800
I don't know.
And I don't know how we got here.

590
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,000
What is that place?

591
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,400
Headquarters of
the League of Spiritual Deliverance.

592
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,400
The home of Dr. Geary.

593
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,400
Another outlaw like myself.
We're navigators.

594
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,300
We're aviators. We're...

595
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,400
...eating taters.
Masturbating alligators.

596
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,200
Bombardiers, we got no fears,
won't shed no tears.

597
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,900
We're pushing the frontiers...

598
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,800
...of transcendental perception.

599
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,200
What's weird is we haven't met yet...

600
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,400
...on this or any other plane.
- Hey, doc.

601
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,600
- He says he won't see you, man.
- Why, is he sick?

602
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,100
He just said he's busy.

603
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,400
Did you tell that son of a bitch...

604
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,300
...that we drove 3000 miles
to see him?

605
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,300
- All right, everybody back on the bus.
- What?

606
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,600
We're going home. California.

607
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,000
- Doc?
- We just got here.

608
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,400
- California isn't home to all of us.
- Yeah.

609
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:02,000
What can I say? You're either
on the bus or off the bus.

610
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,000
- Sayonara!
- Screw you!

611
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,400
Oh, well, that's just perfect.

612
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,500
My last blowout before the Army,
we're stuck in the middle of...

613
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,600
- Where are we, huh?
- It doesn't matter.

614
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:21,200
"I am me as you are he as you are
me and we are all together."

615
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,900
That is so right. That's right.

616
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:28,500
You know, and if nobody's everybody
then someone can be anybody, right?

617
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,400
Listen. Do you hear the music?

618
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,500
- Where are we going?
- We're going out of our minds.

619
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
Come on, this way.

620
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,600
- Where are you taking me?
- Down the rabbit hole.

621
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,800
- Oh, I wanna feed the cow.
- Let's go.

622
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,200
Oh, my God, Jude.

623
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,800
Now, that's big.

624
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,200
<i>For the benefit of Mr. Kite</i>

625
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,200
<i>There will be a show tonight</i>
<i>On trampoline</i>

626
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,800
<i>The Hendersons will all be there</i>
<i>Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair</i>

627
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,700
Have you seen it?
It's great, they got stuff.

628
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,800
<i>Over men and horses</i>
<i>Hoops and garters</i>

629
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
<i>Lastly through a hogshead</i>
<i>Of real fire</i>

630
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,400
<i>In this way</i>
<i>Mr. K. will challenge the world</i>

631
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,700
With the blue people. They're great.
They're just chilled out.

632
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,000
I better heat you up.

633
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,800
Is that Prudence?

634
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,200
It is!

635
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,600
Prudence!

636
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,100
Hi, guys!

637
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,300
Oh, man, that was amazing.

638
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,400
That was bizarre, yo. That was...

639
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,700
- Look at you, sweet pea.
- It's good to see you.

640
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,000
- You too.
- Oh, I want you to meet Rita.

641
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,300
She's a contortionist.

642
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,600
<i>Because the world is round</i>

643
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:27,100
<i>It turns me on</i>

644
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,100
<i>Because the wind is high</i>

645
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:57,800
<i>It blows my mind</i>

646
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,100
<i>Love is old, love is new</i>

647
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:26,900
<i>Love is all, love is you</i>

648
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,700
Blood! Down! Down!

649
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,500
Down!

650
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,700
What time do you finish?

651
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,100
<i>I don't know.</i>

652
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,400
<i>I love you.</i>

653
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:38,400
<i>Something in the way she moves</i>

654
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,700
<i>Attracts me like no other lover</i>

655
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,200
<i>Something in the way she woos me</i>

656
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,000
<i>I don't wanna leave her now</i>

657
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,700
<i>You know I believe, and how</i>

658
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:48,500
<i>You're asking me</i>
<i>Will my love grow</i>

659
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,800
<i>I don't know</i>

660
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:55,400
<i>I don't know</i>

661
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,700
<i>You stick around</i>
<i>Now it may show</i>

662
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,300
Hey, you didn't get
my left nipple right.

663
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,000
Oh, is that so?

664
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,000
Well, you know,
you were lying on your side...

665
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,500
...and I was drawing from a distance.

666
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,600
So I couldn't see it properly.

667
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,500
What time is it?

668
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,600
- Eleven o'clock, I think.
- I gotta run.

669
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,900
You didn't get in till 2:30.

670
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,500
You know Columbia's top scientists are
working for the Defense Department?

671
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,200
I didn't, no.

672
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,700
There's gonna be this demonstration
on the campus to protest it.

673
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,500
Paco says we need to radicalize.

674
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,100
It's not enough
to just hand out leaflets...

675
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:13,000
...and lie down in the middle of the
street and give flowers to cops.

676
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,100
Well, will he give you time off
to go to Sadie's gig? Which is tonight.

677
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,900
I'll try.

678
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,800
Well, can you try harder?

679
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,700
I can't believe you're telling me this.
And the rest of the guys?

680
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,200
- I tried to tell you this a million times.
- So this is it?

681
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,800
<i>Oh, darlir</i>

682
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,400
<i>Please believe me</i>

683
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:47,400
<i>I'll never do you no harm</i>

684
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,600
<i>Believe me when I tell you</i>

685
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,900
<i>I'll never do you no harm</i>

686
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,600
<i>If you leave me</i>

687
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,900
<i>I'll never make it alone</i>

688
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,700
I doubt that.

689
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,800
<i>Oh, believe me when I beg you</i>

690
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,700
<i>Don't ever leave me alone</i>

691
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,000
What is this?

692
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,600
<i>When you told me</i>

693
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,200
<i>You didn't need me anymore</i>

694
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,500
I don't believe this.

695
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,300
Hey, where you going?

696
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,800
Where were we?

697
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:18,300
Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.
I don't need you. I'm gonna show you.

698
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,300
What the hell happened, man?
Where'd Sadie go?

699
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,900
Solo, man. Way solo.

700
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:46,300
Hey, how's it going? Hope we're
not interrupting the creative flow.

701
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,100
Still life?

702
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,500
Yeah, yeah, it's...

703
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,600
I'm sorry, what's that doing here?

704
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,400
Well, you don't have one.
I had a spare.

705
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,300
Where should I put it?

706
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,800
Right here is fine for now.

707
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,100
They're transmitting
live from Vietnam now.

708
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,700
It's gonna make a difference.

709
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,700
Bringing the war
right in the people's living room.

710
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,200
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,
mate, but this isn't a living room.

711
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,600
This is where I work.

712
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm sorry, he must really
be caught up with what he's doing.

713
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,900
There you go.

714
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,300
You should probably
try to get an outside antenna.

715
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,500
I gotta go. You'll be there later?

716
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,900
Yeah.

717
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,900
<i>Saigon command disclosed</i>
<i>that 5000 more U.S. troops...</i>

718
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,100
<i>... were committed to the war</i>
<i>last week...</i>

719
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,500
<i>... bringing American troop strength</i>
<i>to over half a million men.</i>

720
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,600
<i>The Vietcong assault</i>
<i>on South Vietnam cities...</i>

721
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,100
<i>... produced record casualties</i>
<i>last week.</i>

722
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,700
<i>Four hundred sixteen</i>
<i>Americans were killed...</i>

723
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,000
<i>... and 15,029 wounded...</i>

724
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,200
<i>... raising total U.S. combat fatalities</i>
<i>in this country's longest war...</i>

725
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,700
<i>... to 30,057.</i>

726
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,000
Well, I got a job.

727
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,800
You know, as in,
"We'll pay you to do it."

728
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,800
I thought you'd be pleased.

729
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,500
What job?

730
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,200
It's a logo
for Sadie's record company.

731
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,600
It's a strawberry.

732
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,900
You know, red, juicy, sexy.

733
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,000
Yeah, get it? No?

734
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,700
Why were you so rude
to Paco before?

735
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,100
It wouldn't have killed you
to talk to him. He's got a good mind.

736
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,200
He's committed,
he's involved, he's...

737
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,600
- A shagger.
- A what?

738
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,100
A shagger. A Don Juan.

739
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,900
A seducer
of young, vulnerable women.

740
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,300
Jude, you know nothing about him.

741
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,300
Every time I go to your place,
there's about 50 people there.

742
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,100
There's one bloke licking stamps
and the other 49 are...

743
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,900
- Oh, they're all female.
- Don't exaggerate.

744
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,500
Trust me, I'm not.

745
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,900
We're in the middle of a revolution.

746
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,300
What are you doing,
doodles and can'toons?

747
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,400
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

748
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,300
No? Well, what did you mean?

749
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,300
Sorry I'm not the man with
the megaphone, this is what I do.

750
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,800
You could at least hear
what he has to say.

751
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,900
I suppose you don't, because
you're never gonna be drafted.

752
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,500
Nor will you, Lucy.

753
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,900
I would lie down in front of a tank...

754
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,200
...if it would stop this war
and bring Max home.

755
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,200
Yeah? Well, it wouldn't.

756
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,200
What do you mean, it wouldn't?
You don't think that it's won'th trying?

757
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,900
I didn't say that. I'm...

758
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,200
Well, maybe when bombs
start going off here, people will listen.

759
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,200
<i>You say you want a revolution</i>

760
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,500
<i>Well, you know</i>

761
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,100
<i>We all wanna change the world</i>

762
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,900
Jude, what are you doing?
I can't do this right now.

763
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,500
<i>You tell me that it's evolution</i>

764
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:06,100
<i>Well, you know</i>

765
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,000
<i>Yeah, we all wanna change the world</i>

766
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,400
Jude, please. Please, don't.

767
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,200
<i>But when you talk about destruction</i>

768
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,800
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>That you can count me out?</i>

769
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,600
- What are you doing here, friend?
- It's not the time. Not now.

770
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,400
<i>Don't you know it's gonna be</i>
<i>All right</i>

771
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,700
- Escort him to the door. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

772
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,600
Come on, let's go.

773
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,100
I've never seen him like that.
I don't know.

774
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,500
You gotta leave, buddy. Come on.

775
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,800
- Jude!
- Who is this asshole?

776
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,300
Jesus!

777
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,300
Are you okay?

778
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,000
Get this clown out of here now!

779
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,600
Get him out of here!

780
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,000
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

781
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,700
All right! All right!

782
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,200
What is the matter with you?
Why would you do that?

783
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,900
<i>On the edge of the balcony</i>
<i>he was shot.</i>

784
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,700
<i>We thought a firecracker</i>
<i>had gone on.</i>

785
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,000
<i>Most of us were downstairs</i>
<i>on the lower level.</i>

786
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,200
<i>Police have issued</i>
<i>an all-points bulletin...</i>

787
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,200
<i>... for a well-dressed white man</i>
<i>seen running from the scene.</i>

788
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,700
<i>We hold these truths</i>
<i>to be self-evident...</i>

789
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,000
<i>... that all men are created equal.</i>

790
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,700
<i>Memphis is a confused</i>
<i>and shocked city tonight.</i>

791
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,900
<i>No one can believe</i>
<i>what has happened.</i>

792
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,000
<i>It's been just a little over an hour...</i>

793
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,500
<i>... since Dr. Martin Luther King died</i>
<i>from an assassirs bullet.</i>

794
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:39,300
<i>Dr. King was rushed to St. Joseph's</i>
<i>Hospital emergency room.</i>

795
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,600
<i>He died from a gunshot wound</i>
<i>in the neck.</i>

796
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,200
<i>I'm sick and tired of violence.</i>

797
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,100
<i>I'm tired of the war in Vietnam.</i>

798
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:55,400
<i>I look at you all</i>

799
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,800
<i>See the love there that's sleeping</i>

800
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,400
<i>While my guitar gently weeps</i>

801
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,600
<i>I look at the floor</i>

802
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,300
<i>And I see it needs sweeping</i>

803
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:25,400
<i>Still my guitar gently weeps</i>

804
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:37,000
Not now. What is this ridiculous
bullshit? He can't even play guitar.

805
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,000
The sound sucked out there.
How many times...?

806
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,400
Get out there and tell Tony to fix it
or I don't go on tomorrow night.

807
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,600
Come on, Sadie,
it's the ratty end of the tour. Cool it.

808
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,200
Find me someone
who can play the guitar, man.

809
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,200
This new guy's
got no soul and no stank.

810
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,900
Do you wanna come up
for one more, Jo?

811
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,300
I ain't gonna find Sadie there, man.

812
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,700
You better go on up to Lucy.

813
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,700
Yeah.

814
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:50,000
Well, she's probably out
fighting for the cause, you know?

815
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,000
It look like you been
fighting for it too, huh?

816
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,500
I don't have one.
That's the problem.

817
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,100
<i>Words are flowing out</i>
<i>Like endless rain into a paper cup</i>

818
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,600
<i>They slither while they pass</i>

819
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,500
<i>They slip away</i>
<i>Across the universe</i>

820
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:18,800
<i>Pools of sorrow, waves of joy</i>
<i>Are drifting through my open mind</i>

821
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,100
<i>Possessing and caressing me</i>

822
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,900
<i>Nothing's gonna change my world</i>

823
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,300
<i>Images of broken light</i>

824
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,500
<i>Which dance before me</i>
<i>Like a million eyes</i>

825
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:58,700
<i>They call me on and on</i>
<i>Across the universe</i>

826
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:05,300
<i>Thoughts meander like a restless wind</i>
<i>Inside a letterbox</i>

827
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:12,600
<i>They tumble blindly as they</i>
<i>Make their way across the universe</i>

828
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,800
Strike! Strike! Strike!

829
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,700
No! No!

830
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:34,900
Lucy!

831
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,900
- Jude!
- Lucy!

832
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,600
- Jude!
- Lucy!

833
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,100
- Jude!
- Lucy!

834
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,200
Die! Die!

835
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:07,800
You have a visitor.

836
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,400
What are you doing here?

837
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,200
I got a call from a friend of yours,
a girl.

838
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,400
Said that you were in trouble,
so I came down.

839
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,800
Are you all right?

840
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:36,600
I told the cops that I was a
U.S. citizen and you were my son.

841
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,100
- What did they say?
- They wanted proof.

842
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,100
I didn't have any.

843
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,800
I talked the cops out of pressing
charges for the riot and stuff...

844
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,900
...but the bottom line,
this is an immigration issue.

845
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,100
Meaning they're
kicking me out of the country?

846
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,100
- I'm afraid so.
- Shit.

847
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,500
Thanks... Thanks for trying,
though, yeah?

848
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,700
Have you told your mother
you met me?

849
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,200
Not yet.

850
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,600
But... But l... But I will.

851
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,900
Look who's coming.

852
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,900
- How's it going, Jude?
- I'm okay, yeah.

853
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,300
So when did you and Phil hitch up?

854
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,100
About two weeks
after you stopped writing.

855
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:04,600
Oh, I'm pleased for you, though.
And a kid's on the way.

856
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,200
That's great.

857
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:10,100
- What was the name?
- Who?

858
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,700
The reason you stopped writing.

859
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,800
Her name was Lucy.

860
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:22,400
It was... It was good
for a while, you know.

861
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,400
It all seems a bit unreal.

862
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,600
Is this real enough for you?

863
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,900
Glad to be back?

864
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:35,300
Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't be happier.

865
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:49,400
<i>She's not a girl</i>
<i>Who misses much</i>

866
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,900
I'll be here same time next week,
okay?

867
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:46,500
<i>I need a fix</i>
<i>'Cause I'm going down</i>

868
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,000
<i>Mother Superior jumped the gun</i>

869
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:28,000
<i>Happiness is a warm gun</i>

870
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:41,500
<i>When I hold you</i>
<i>In my arms</i>

871
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:46,300
<i>And when I feel</i>
<i>My finger on your trigger</i>

872
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:51,400
<i>Oh, don't you know</i>
<i>Nobody can do me no harm</i>

873
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,300
<i>Stop telling me this is a peaceful</i>
<i>march. It's much worse than that.</i>

874
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,400
The dogs and the violence...

875
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,100
...and the people you're with are more
radical than you want me to believe.

876
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:58,600
They should be radical. You should
be radical. We should all be radical.

877
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,300
Daniel is dead
and Max is all fucked up...

878
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,600
...and this war just keeps going
on and on and nobody's listening.

879
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,900
- <i>I'm listening.</i>
- No, you're not listening.

880
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,600
<i>I just don't want</i>
<i>my beautiful daughter to get hurt.</i>

881
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,000
Look, Mom. Don't cry.

882
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,600
Please don't cry.

883
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,800
Everything's really okay here,
I promise.

884
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,600
It's gonna be all right, I gotta go.

885
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,100
Close the door.

886
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,000
I thought it was the other side
who dropped bombs.

887
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:00,600
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks.

- Thanks.

897
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,200
Last call, pal.

898
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:02,700
<i>Hey, Jude</i>
<i>Don't make it bad</i>

899
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:10,100
<i>Take a sad song</i>

<i>Then you can start</i>

01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:01,500
Max!

903
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,200
You don't look too messed up.

904
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,600
Yeah, well, everything
below the neck works fine.

905
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,300
Does she know?

906
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,800
- You didn't tell her.
- Nope.

907
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,800
All right, good. Good.

02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:19,500
<i>Yes, she does</i>

02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,700
- Yeah!
- Hey, Prudence.

918
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,600
- How are you?
- Good. Welcome back.

919
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:28,800
Where's Lucy?

920
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,700
Don't know.
She should be on her way.

921
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:34,600
- Did you give her the right address?
- Yeah. I thought I saw her on the street.

922
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,500
Oh, shit.

923
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:38,700
Let's go.

924
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,100
Spread out.

925
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,300
That's it. Wrap it up. Let's go.

926
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:57,000
You have no permit. You're disturbing
the peace. Come on, off the roof.

927
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,500
- Come on.
- Thank you!

928
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,400
It's all over.

929
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,000
- Come on, let's go.
- Feels good to be back, baby.

930
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,600
Yeah!

931
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,300
Come on, we gotta clear the roof.
Let's go.

932
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,000
- Hey. Be nice, be nice.
- All right. Keep moving.

933
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,200
- Yeah, yeah.
- Joy. Happiness.

934
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,500
That's right.
Background singers, huh?

935
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,400
- Where did Jude go?
- I don't know. And where is my sister?

936
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:20,900
I'm sure I saw her, Max.

937
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,100
I don't understand
what the problem is.

938
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,500
Man, get your hands off me.

<i>Nothing you can say</i>

<i>But you can</i>
<i>Learn how to play the game</i>

02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,700
Who the hell is that?

945
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:14,700
- Jude?
- It's Jude.

02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,200

02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:57,600
Come on. Come on, out of my way.

954
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,200
Let's go.

955
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:06,900
Plug it in.

956
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:10,700
- All right.
- Thanks.

957
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,300
That's great.

958
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:32,900
Oh, please, you have to let me
through. I need to get up there.

959
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:40,700
- I can't believe this.
- The roof is closed. The roof is closed.
