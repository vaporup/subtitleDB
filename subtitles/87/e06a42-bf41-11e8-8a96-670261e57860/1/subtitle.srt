1
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,015
Alex.

2
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,143
Tod and George's dad
just called.

3
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,020
He's picking you up
at 3.30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,606
The bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.00.

5
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,858
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

6
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,904
Mom, you got
to leave that on.

7
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,408
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing...

8
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,912
so l figure it's got to be
on or with the bag.

9
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,831
For luck.

10
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,417
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,877
l'm still here.

12
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,343
So, seventeen, on the loose...

13
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,721
senior trip
with your friends in Paris...

14
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,473
ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,645
Live it up. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

16
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,518
Hitchcock, let me give you
a hand with this.

17
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,520
There you go.

18
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,522
Carter, you dick.

19
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,398
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

20
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,236
- You left this on the bus.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,737
Come on,
let's get your stuff together.

22
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,740
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

23
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,660
- What are you doing?
- He's the man.

24
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,495
All right.
You guys got everything?

25
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:29,914
Yeah, Dad, we're all set.

26
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,711
Does that mean go?

27
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,089
Don't know.

28
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,592
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.

29
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,052
Thanks, Dad.

30
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,721
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

31
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,599
- Alex, take care of them.
- l will.

32
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,486
Didn't think anything could look
worse than my yearbook photo.

33
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,531
How do you think l feel
having to look at you?

34
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,374
What the fuck does he want?

35
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,591
The airport does not
endorse solicitors.

36
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,893
Death is not the end.

37
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,898
lt will be for you
if you harass my students.

38
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,817
Hare Rama.

39
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,619
l have to ask you
a few questions this evening.

40
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,162
Did you pack your bags yourself?

41
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,082
Have your belongings been in
your possession the entire time?

42
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,545
Mr Browning?

43
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:06,802
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

44
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,442
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

45
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:24,403
September 25. 9.25.

46
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,823
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

47
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,214
Fuck off, dude. Dick.

48
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,590
Babe.

49
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,427
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.

50
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,930
Knock it off.

51
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,184
You asshole.

52
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,114
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,687
Let's go take a shit.

54
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,481
- Take a shit by yourself.
- No, dude.

55
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,775
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.

56
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,694
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

57
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,364
The toilets in coach
are barely ventilated closets.

58
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,241
Say halfway
through the flight...

59
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,909
your body wants
that aeroplane food out.

60
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,078
You got to go
torque a wicked cable.

61
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,958
Then directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

62
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,504
Want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

63
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,466
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

64
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,722
He was born

65
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,557
ln the summer

66
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,602
Of his 27th year

67
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,978
Comin' home

68
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,730
John Denver.

69
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,486
He left yesterday behind him

70
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,863
Died in a plane crash.

71
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,365
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

72
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,409
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

73
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:40,581
of VolÃ©e Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.

74
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,087
l've seen it raining fire

75
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,880
ln the sky

76
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:55,095
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?

77
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,813
Go. Go.

78
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,549
Go.

79
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,635
That hurt.

80
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,654
That's a good sign.
Younger, the better.

81
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,740
lt'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

82
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,956
A really fucked-up God.

83
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,461
- Hey, Tod.
- Hello. How you doing?

84
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,939
Can you switch seats
with Christa?

85
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,818
God, l would,
but l got a bladder thing.

86
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,988
lt's a urinary tract infection.

87
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,490
Let's go ask Alex.

88
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,668
Could you trade seats so Blake
and l could sit together?

89
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,505
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

90
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,550
Please?

91
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,016
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

92
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,644
Thank you, Alex.

93
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,979
You're welcome.

94
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:17,446
You really think we'd
titty-fuck them over Greenland?

95
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:22,826
Because of you, l got to watch
fucking "Stuart Little."

96
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,329
Thank you.

97
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,790
Thanks, man. That's great.

98
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,626
Sorry l'm late.

99
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,127
That's my seat right there.

100
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,587
Thanks.

101
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,590
- Hello?
- Ain't going that way.

102
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,342
May l have your attention?

103
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,677
To properly fasten
your seat belts...

104
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,054
slide the flat portion
into the buckle.

105
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,516
There are six emergency exits.

106
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,685
Two doors in front,
two over the wings...

107
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,895
two at the rear
of the aircraft.

108
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,735
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

109
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,615
All right.

110
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,457
Whatever.

111
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,935
lt's fine.

112
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,820
lt's OK, honey.

113
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,529
Could you trade seats so
Blake and l could sit together?

114
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,740
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

115
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,243
Please?

116
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,126
What's up, dude?

117
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,215
- ls there a problem, sir?
- What's your fucking problem?

118
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,427
This fucking plane's
going to explode!

119
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,596
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.

120
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,724
- lf this is a joke...
- lt's not a joke!

121
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,142
Alex, take it easy.

122
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,394
- Sit down!
- lt's going down!

123
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,813
We'll remove you
if this continues.

124
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,607
l'll fucking remove myself!

125
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,695
- That's my seat.
- This plane is going down!

126
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,906
Everybody in the aisle
off the plane.

127
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,867
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.

128
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,703
This fucking plane
is going down!

129
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,455
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

130
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,179
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.

131
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,432
You got this?
No one gets back on board.

132
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,268
- That's my call.
- Wait, please!

133
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,021
l've got forty students
going to Paris. Please.

134
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,564
You must understand
my position.

135
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,942
l do, and l apologize
for Alex...

136
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,735
but one of us
needs to be on that plane.

137
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,239
l cannot let those students
go to Paris for ten days...

138
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,117
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
Sit!

139
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,994
One of you
can go on the flight.

140
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,247
Larry.

141
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,460
They're not taking this well.
One of us can get back on.

142
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,213
The rest can take
an 11.10 flight.

143
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,422
l'll stay.

144
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,967
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.

145
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,718
lt's fine.

146
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,973
Hi, l was in the bathroom,
and the lock was stuck...

147
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,934
Wait, l didn't fight
with anyone!

148
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,229
Damn!

149
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,855
Thanks.

150
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,780
l called your parents.
They're on their way.

151
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,078
Stupid Alex.

152
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,500
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

153
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,544
l saw it.

154
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,379
l don't know. l saw it.

155
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,549
l saw it on the runway,
l saw it take off...

156
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,260
l saw out my window,
l saw the ground.

157
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,471
And the cabin,
it starts to shake.

158
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,017
The left side blows up
and the whole plane explodes.

159
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,562
And it was so real,
like how everything happens.

160
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,314
Been on a lot of planes
that blew up?

161
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,857
You fell asleep.

162
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:32,029
We get thrown off the plane
and blow a half day in Paris?

163
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,905
All because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

164
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,826
Wait! The plane,
it's going to blow up!

165
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,870
Fuck you, Horton.

166
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,623
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital!

167
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,918
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!

168
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,716
There they go, here we stay.

169
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,303
You're paying for my trip.

170
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,846
l wish you were on that plane!

171
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,849
- You fucking prick!
- Shit!

172
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,693
- Call it in!
- Security!

173
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,664
You're looking at me
as if l caused this.

174
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,044
l didn't cause this.

175
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,216
Are there any survivors?

176
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,432
How should l know?

177
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,771
- You think l'm some...
- He's not a witch.

178
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,362
l'm Howard Seigel...

179
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,322
National Transportation
and Safety Board.

180
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,366
We've contacted
all your families.

181
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:42,617
They are on the way.

182
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,538
ls there anyone here
who feels they might need...

183
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,459
medical attention
or spiritual counselling?

184
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,087
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

185
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,550
The cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

186
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,969
The Nassau County
authorities are on the scene...

187
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,055
naval search and rescue
en route.

188
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,308
Excuse me. l'm Agent Weine.

189
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,478
This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBl.

190
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,022
l understand how
you all must be feeling...

191
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,482
and l know it's going
to be difficult...

192
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,276
but we need to ask questions
regarding today's events...

193
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,487
while they're still fresh
in your mind.

194
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,572
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts...

195
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,658
and any potential
criminal investigation.

196
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,413
You said, "Listen to me.

197
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,166
"This plane will explode
on takeoff."

198
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,044
How did you know that?

199
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,837
l got this feeling.

200
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:38,924
This weird feeling.

201
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,426
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding?

202
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,386
On board, did you take
any sleeping pills...

203
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,013
narcotics, hallucinogens?

204
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,557
Do you take any drugs?

205
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,977
l saw it.

206
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:54,940
l saw it happen.

207
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,775
l saw the plane explode.

208
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,652
Did the weird feelings
have anything to do...

209
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,489
with your saying you wished
Carter Horton was on it...

210
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,324
just before it exploded?

211
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,286
Then why'd you say it?

212
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,289
l didn't really think
it was going to happen.

213
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,833
lf that's the case, Alex...

214
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,419
why did you really
get off the plane?

215
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,383
My brother George...

216
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:25,011
he told me to go
keep an eye on Alex.

217
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,849
And so he stayed and...

218
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,525
He told me
to get off the plane.

219
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,486
Larry Murnau said
l should get back on...

220
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,031
but l told him
that he should go.

221
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,035
l sent him back on the plane.

222
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,999
All right.

223
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,501
Nobody forced you off the plane.

224
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,671
You said you weren't friends
with those that were...

225
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,382
so, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

226
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,178
Because l saw
and l heard Alex...

227
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,435
and l believed him.

228
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,958
There he is.

229
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,612
Thank you for the ride.

230
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,010
You are looking
at the first piece of debris...

231
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,054
to wash ashore
from VolÃ©e Air flight 180...

232
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,391
which erupted shortly after
a 9.25 p.m. takeoff...

233
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,893
from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

234
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,146
There are no known survivors.

235
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,898
Coast Guard and naval
search and rescue efforts...

236
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,734
are continuing
at this moment...

237
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,945
even as jet fuel burns
on the ocean's surface.

238
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,656
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

239
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,784
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

240
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,872
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

241
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,081
Amongst the travellers...

242
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,876
a class of forty students
and four teachers...

243
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,004
from Mount Abraham High School
in south-east New York...

244
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,256
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

245
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,425
There are reports
several students...

246
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,720
were removed from the aircraft
moments before departure...

247
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,889
however, investigators
remain guarded...

248
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,849
about the specifics
of this incident.

249
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,603
Authorities from National
Transportation and Safety...

250
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,021
and the Federal Bureau
of lnvestigation...

251
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,399
have arrived at JFKto begin
the initial investigation.

252
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,195
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long lsland...

253
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,114
report seeing the plane explode.

254
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,742
No other aircraft were
visibly near flight 180.

255
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,535
At JFK,
air traffic controllers...

256
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,538
are corroborating
these eyewitness accounts.

257
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,583
After the explosion,
debris apparently rained...

258
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,461
into the Atlantic Ocean
for several miles.

259
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,548
lnvestigators are cautious about
verifying these accounts...

260
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,009
believing they'll learn more...

261
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,406
Thirty-nine days
have passed...

262
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,992
since we lost
our thirty-nine loved ones...

263
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,078
friends, and teachers.

264
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,455
As each day passes...

265
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,583
without a determining cause
for the accident...

266
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,253
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

267
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,923
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...

268
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,009
"Man no more knows
his own time...

269
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,137
"than fish taken
in the fatal net...

270
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,765
"or birds trapped in the snare.

271
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,352
"Like these,
the children of men caught...

272
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,021
"when the time falls
suddenly upon them."

273
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,441
And so,
before we can heal...

274
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,863
before we escape the presence
of death and time...

275
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,991
we must mourn
and celebrate theirs...

276
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,493
with this memorial.

277
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,332
l hope you don't think because
my name ain't on this wall...

278
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,959
that l owe you anything.

279
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,377
l don't.

280
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,714
All l owe these people is
to live my life to the fullest.

281
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:38,009
Why don't you
stay off the J.D., then?

282
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,803
Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do.

283
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,056
l control my life, not you.

284
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,978
l'm never going to die.

285
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,326
l took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,702
Got a seventy.

287
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,829
lt's the lowest score
you can get, but l passed.

288
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,123
The thing is,
when l was done with the test...

289
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,834
you know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

290
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,127
Anyways, he goes....

291
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,382
"Young man, you're going to die
at a very young age."

292
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,678
ls that true?

293
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,264
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

294
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,270
lf l ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,064
Fuck.

296
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,828
Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.

297
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,998
l'm going up.

298
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,679
l don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

299
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,683
l miss you, you know?

300
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,186
Yeah, l miss you, too.

301
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,690
But my father,
he doesn't understand.

302
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,403
Look, when he gets over
this thing...

303
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,740
you and me,
we'll road trip to the city...

304
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,950
catch the Yanks.

305
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,120
We'll do that.

306
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,747
Cool.

307
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,625
l better go.

308
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,627
This thing Ms Lewton
showed me in class...

309
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,130
they're going to let me read it.

310
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,632
lt says what l'm feeling.

311
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,053
Take care, man.

312
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,023
Because of you,
l'm still alive.

313
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,069
Thank you.

314
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:12,288
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

315
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,667
But when we say this...

316
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,795
we imagine
that the hour is placed...

317
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,465
in an obscure
and distant future.

318
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,510
lt never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

319
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,471
with the day already begun...

320
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,767
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

321
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:36,354
This afternoon
which is so certain...

322
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:42,485
and which has every hour
filled in advance.

323
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,038
What happened?

324
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,249
Where's Tod?

325
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,965
Get out of here.

326
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,732
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

327
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:59,487
You caused Tod
so much guilt over George...

328
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,655
he took his own life.

329
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,828
He wouldn't do that.

330
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,665
He said we'd be friends again
after you got better.

331
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:15,085
Why would he make plans
if he was going to kill himself?

332
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,713
Mr Waggner.

333
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:16,480
Almost autumn.

334
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,775
lt's only the end of June.

335
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,654
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

336
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,073
lf you focus, even now,
just one week into summer...

337
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,576
you can almost feel
autumn coming.

338
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,870
l like being able
to see the future.

339
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,915
Why were you at
Tod's house last night?

340
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,420
l've seen enough TV to know...

341
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,839
the FBl doesn't investigate
teen suicides.

342
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,341
They were there last night.
That means, one...

343
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,010
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

344
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,595
Two--they haven't
ruled out anything...

345
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,597
and the fact seven people
got off the plane...

346
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,056
is probably weird enough.

347
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,434
Not to mention, one of
those people had a vision...

348
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,728
of the plane exploding...

349
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,106
minutes before it actually did
is highly suspicious.

350
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,108
And it doesn't help that
the visionary's friend...

351
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,068
just committed suicide.

352
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,697
Why were you there last night?

353
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,663
You know what this is?

354
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,918
This is a...

355
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,881
This is Springy Head Guy.

356
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:29,595
lt's you. Not a likeness.

357
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:33,057
lt's how
you make me feel, Alex.

358
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,352
l'm sorry.

359
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,562
No. Like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know...

360
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,981
what or why it is.

361
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,359
lt's reluctant to take form...

362
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,653
and yet creating an absolute...

363
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,947
but incomprehensible
attraction.

364
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,284
ln four years
of high school...

365
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,411
we haven't said
one word to each other.

366
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,831
At that moment, on the plane,
l felt what you felt.

367
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,542
l didn't even know where
those emotions came from...

368
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,962
until you started
freaking out.

369
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,591
l didn't see what you saw,
but l felt it.

370
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,427
You can still feel it,
can't you?

371
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,223
Something from that day
is still with you.

372
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,019
l know because
l can still feel you.

373
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:23,899
That's why l was there
last night.

374
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,946
l've never dealt
with death before.

375
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,907
This could all be in our head.

376
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,703
lt just feels like
it's all around us.

377
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,538
lt?

378
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,835
What if Tod was just the first?

379
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,045
Of us.

380
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,756
ls that something
that you're feeling?

381
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,384
l don't know.

382
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:54,054
l wish l could see him
one last time.

383
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,640
Maybe l would know.

384
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,934
Then let's go see him.

385
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,716
Easy.

386
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,429
Gives me a rush.

387
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,433
This place?

388
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,060
Doing something
l'm not supposed to.

389
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,690
Come on.

390
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,405
Hurry up.

391
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,255
- ls that him?
- l think.

392
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,758
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

393
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:15,469
That's him.

394
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:19,848
Whatever it was that made him
Tod is definitely gone.

395
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,852
Holy Christ!

396
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,107
Please.

397
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,151
You'll wake the dead.

398
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,205
Why'd his hand do that?

399
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:44,665
Chemicals.

400
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,836
The vascular flush
creates cadaveric spasms.

401
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,714
Look, l'm his friend...

402
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,758
l know who you are.

403
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,803
What are all those tiny marks?

404
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:01,598
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

405
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,725
Pulling at the wire?

406
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,520
lf he was pulling at the wire,
he didn't kill himself.

407
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:07,896
lt was an accident.

408
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:11,066
ln death,
there are no accidents...

409
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,194
no coincidences, no mishaps...

410
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,572
and no escapes.

411
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:21,660
What you have to realize
is we're all just a mouse...

412
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,662
a cat has by the tail.

413
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,498
Every single move we make...

414
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,667
from the mundane
to the monumental...

415
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,753
the red light
that we stop at or run...

416
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,923
the people we have sex with
or won't with us...

417
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:38,010
aeroplanes that we ride
or walk out of...

418
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,305
it's all part of
death's sadistic design...

419
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,432
leading to the grave.

420
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,685
Design.

421
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:49,354
Does that mean if...

422
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,690
you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

423
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:55,569
Alex, you've
already done that...

424
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,613
by walking off the plane.

425
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,865
Your friend's departure...

426
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:04,494
shows that death has
a new design for all of you.

427
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,997
Now you have to figure out...

428
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:11,126
how and when
it's coming back at you.

429
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:13,587
Play your hunch...

430
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:16,673
if you think
you can get away with it.

431
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,009
But remember...

432
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,137
the risk of cheating the plan...

433
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,556
of disrespecting the design...

434
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:30,062
could incite a fury to terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

435
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:35,567
And you don't even want to
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

436
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,448
OK, then. Well...

437
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,785
l'm sorry we broke in,
and...

438
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,038
No harm, no foul.

439
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,627
l'll see you soon.

440
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:02,970
The mortician said
that death has a design.

441
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:07,140
l'm talking about omens.

442
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,685
How do we know,
that just by sitting here...

443
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,562
by sipping this coffee
or breathing the air...

444
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,606
or even crossing
the intersection...

445
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,858
we haven't started in motion...

446
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,986
the events that will
some day lead to our death...

447
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,822
forty years from now,
ten years, tomorrow?

448
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,201
We don't,
unless we open ourselves up...

449
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,496
to the signs
it's willing to show us.

450
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,376
l don't understand.

451
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,546
Did you see Tod die?

452
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,424
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

453
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,760
No, it didn't,
but it might as well have.

454
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:47,597
This is a message
from something, Clear...

455
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,726
or someone,
hinting at a design.

456
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,477
Total bullshit.

457
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,022
You can find death omens
anywhere you want to.

458
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,191
Coffee starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

459
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,236
So does "choke."
We'll choke to death?

460
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,488
l want to hear you...

461
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:06,116
but we'll go nuts
if you start with this shit.

462
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:10,412
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

463
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:14,458
Now, what if
you, me, Tod, Carter...

464
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,753
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton
messed up that design?

465
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,380
For whatever reason,
l saw death's plan...

466
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,716
and we cheated it.

467
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,760
But what if it was our time?

468
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,720
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

469
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:30,015
What if it still is our time?

470
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:33,685
lf it is,
then it's not finished...

471
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:37,731
and we will die.
Now, not later.

472
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:43,987
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

473
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,083
After hearing you,
l do believe...

474
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,503
that Tod killed himself.

475
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,121
Baby, come on, not now.

476
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,667
Looks like we have
a reunion here.

477
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:39,876
Let it go.

478
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,170
- When are you moving?
- Couple weeks.

479
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,381
- That's too bad.
- Carter, you dick!

480
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,508
Losing our favourite teacher.

481
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,594
Guys, there's something
l need to tell you.

482
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:53,390
Lived here your whole life,
and now she's gotta move...

483
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:54,808
We're in danger!

484
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,602
Enough! Both of you!

485
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,729
They died, and we lived.

486
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,523
Get over it.

487
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,733
l will not let
this plane crash...

488
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,153
be the most important thing
in my life!

489
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,737
God!

490
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,407
l'm moving on, Carter...

491
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,617
and if you want
to waste your life...

492
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:16,413
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

493
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,957
then you can just
drop fucking dead!

494
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,528
ls Alex there?

495
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,239
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.

496
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,951
lt's Clear again.
You want to talk to her?

497
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,666
Clear, he's in the shower.

498
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,168
Can l get him to call you back?

499
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:05,128
Sure. Bye.

500
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,548
She's concerned about you.

501
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,467
l'm concerned about you.

502
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:12,219
Why won't you talk to her?

503
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,804
Or to me?

504
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,185
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help...

505
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:21,937
but there's something
l need to understand...

506
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,730
before l can talk.

507
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,398
To anyone.

508
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,569
The National
Transportation Safety Board...

509
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,656
has a new theory tonight
on the cause of the explosion...

510
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,824
of VolÃ©e Air flight 180.

511
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:37,577
Officials believe deterioration
of silicone insulation...

512
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,247
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

513
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,958
may have leaked
combustible fluids.

514
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:44,251
That's Tod's seat.

515
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,211
A spark beneath the coach cabin
in the fuselage...

516
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,838
may have ignited the fuel line,
proceeding to the fuel pump...

517
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,841
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

518
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:24,874
The path of the explosion.

519
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:29,713
First was Tod,
then it was Terry.

520
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,340
They're dying in the order
they would've died.

521
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,551
That's death's design.

522
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,387
Ms Lewton's next.

523
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,143
Whenever l can fall asleep,
l see Terry Chaney...

524
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,187
and in the day,
out of nowhere...

525
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,106
l hear the sound of
my own voice in my head...

526
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:50,317
saying to Larry Murnau...

527
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,277
"No. You know
the whole French thing.

528
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:53,737
"Get on the plane."

529
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,740
Everything reminds me
of that day.

530
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,077
Right. Yeah.

531
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:02,454
l'm hoping a change will help.

532
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,956
lt's just that...

533
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:08,460
l lived here
my whole life, you know?

534
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,712
And everywhere l looked
were great memories.

535
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:17,010
And now all l see
is Larry and those kids.

536
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:20,597
Just looking out
my own front yard...

537
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:23,016
makes me feel nothing but fear.

538
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:31,983
Laura, l'm going to have
to call you back.

539
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:33,610
Right.

540
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,205
This is Valerie Lewton.
l need Agent Schreck.

541
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,524
What are you doing here?

542
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,568
l was just...

543
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,571
checking the air in the tyre
to make sure it's safe.

544
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,199
Get in the car.

545
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,921
Put on your seat belt.

546
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,863
l believe that...

547
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,283
that Ms Lewton is next.

548
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,368
Next?

549
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,913
Yeah, next, because...

550
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:12,083
there's this pattern
that's occurring.

551
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:13,918
Right. A pattern.

552
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:15,879
You noticed that, too?

553
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,730
Mom's favourite.

554
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,254
So what about this pattern?

555
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,507
Did you see it
in one of your visions?

556
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,301
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

557
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,806
l never asked for
what happened on the plane.

558
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,976
You guys are going to
sit there and make fun of me.

559
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:13,186
Whatever. lt's fine.

560
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:16,689
But l saved six lives
on that plane.

561
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:19,108
Six lives, and everybody
in my entire school...

562
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,401
thinks l'm a freak.

563
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,656
l'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

564
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,992
l don't have
a narcissistic deity complex.

565
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:31,412
l'm not going Dahmer
on you guys.

566
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,623
This just is.

567
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:36,459
There is a pattern for us all.

568
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,795
There is a pattern for you.

569
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:41,548
There is a design for everyone,
and l don't know how yet...

570
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,550
but l'm going to break
this one.

571
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:06,507
You came to our attention...

572
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,260
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

573
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,596
Now...

574
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:13,473
l know you didn't
blow up the plane.

575
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,434
We were ready to move on...

576
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:18,728
but then the other survivors
started to die.

577
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:20,605
First, your friend Tod...

578
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:23,358
then Terry Chaney,
while you were at the scene.

579
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,693
And tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

580
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,571
Nobody has control
over life and death...

581
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,283
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

582
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,036
Can you promise me
no one else is going to die?

583
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:37,413
No, l can't.

584
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,457
As long as l'm in here,
it's out of my control.

585
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,084
l'm sorry.

586
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,177
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

587
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:53,471
Thank you.

588
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,856
That kid gives me the creeps.

589
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,067
What do we do?
We got nothing.

590
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,027
That's not
what l'm talking about.

591
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,697
There were
a couple of moments...

592
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,409
where l almost believed him.

593
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,954
Don't take this
the wrong way...

594
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,748
but sometimes
you give me the creeps.

595
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,351
You've got to stop this.
lt's a stupid mug.

596
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,020
You're out of here.

597
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:43,688
Pretty soon you'll be gone.

598
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,314
You'll be gone.

599
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:15,631
All right,
just stay still, OK?

600
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:25,600
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.

601
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:04,680
Dude.

602
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,684
l don't know where he is.

603
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:10,478
He's not talking to me.

604
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:11,979
Why?

605
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,232
Because l didn't believe him.

606
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,567
lf he does contact you,
l think it would be...

607
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:19,278
in the best interest of
your safety if you called us.

608
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:22,114
Now, here's my card.

609
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,158
Toll-free number.

610
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,830
lnteresting work.

611
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:42,551
Carter, you dick!

612
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,404
What are you doing?

613
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,992
Terry should be on this wall.

614
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,996
Shit.

615
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,790
Why'd you want us
to meet you here?

616
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:17,253
They're watching me
to see if l go to Alex.

617
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:19,380
That's why you're taking me.

618
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,090
Why would l want to see him?

619
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:24,927
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

620
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:41,527
Drive the speed limit, OK?

621
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,572
And don't pass on the right.

622
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,450
Billy, wait a minute.
l'm getting a vision.

623
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,536
You're the next one, man.

624
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,330
Man, why'd you say that?

625
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,499
Because if you say another word,
l'll fucking kill you.

626
01:04:16,187 --> 01:04:18,689
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road...

627
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:21,776
so you guys start that way
and meet back in the middle.

628
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:24,028
lt'll take half the time.

629
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,310
Do you think
they're still up there?

630
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:01,941
Somehow, flight 180,
are they still in flight?

631
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,694
Somewhere... are they safe?

632
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:12,493
When l was a kid,
like six or seven...

633
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:15,246
l used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

634
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:18,165
Lying awake at night,
just worrying.

635
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,626
Most kids do, l guess.

636
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:23,921
Most kids never have it happen.

637
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:29,677
When l was ten...

638
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:32,221
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

639
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,807
He heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

640
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:38,811
On reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

641
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,730
A guy blew his head off.

642
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,192
Life became shit after that.

643
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:48,237
My mom couldn't deal anymore.

644
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:52,283
She married this asshole
who my mom with my real dad...

645
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,952
would have crossed the street
to avoid this guy.

646
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,163
He didn't really want a kid...

647
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,957
so my mom didn't, either,
anymore.

648
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:05,754
lf that was the design
for my father and family...

649
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,090
then fuck death!

650
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,387
God, l have thought a lot
about that somewhere.

651
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,264
lt exists, that place...

652
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:17,183
where my dad is safe.

653
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:21,020
Where he had a full pack of
cigarettes and kept driving.

654
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:24,315
Where me and my mom and my dad
are still together...

655
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:27,276
and have no idea
about this life here.

656
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:33,115
Where our friends
are still in the sky.

657
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:36,911
Where everyone
gets a second chance.

658
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,581
Alex, we can't give up.

659
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,963
l can't go home,
because after Mrs Lewton...

660
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,381
they're looking for me.

661
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,634
We're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

662
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,219
lt's a couple of miles
from my house.

663
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:56,639
Browning,
you fucking warlock...

664
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,140
did you hear about
Ms Lewton or what?

665
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,476
Why do you think l was hiding?

666
01:07:00,935 --> 01:07:04,355
Billy told the FBl he saw you
running from her house.

667
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:05,981
l was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

668
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,775
They blame me
for Tod, for her...

669
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:09,235
for the fucking plane crash.

670
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,154
The fire caramelized her blood.

671
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:15,533
Your shoe prints were in it,
your fingerprints on the knives.

672
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:16,867
l told you they were not...

673
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:18,953
l'm not talking about
if you did it.

674
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,872
Or even if
you knew she was dead.

675
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:25,209
Did you know she was going
to be next before she was?

676
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,342
Yeah, l did.

677
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:35,844
l knew.

678
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:39,598
All right, out of us...

679
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:41,267
who's next to see it?

680
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,102
Please...

681
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,396
tell me l'm going to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:49,108
lt's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,488
l should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

684
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,031
What are you whining about?
l'm next!

685
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,118
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

686
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,121
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

687
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,165
Think it's easier to know?

688
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,211
lt's not.
lt's fucking harder.

689
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,548
You get off
having control over me?

690
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,133
Let me decide
how to deal with it.

691
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,011
lt doesn't matter who's next...

692
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,930
'cause we're
all on the same list.

693
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,434
Fuck.

694
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,060
Really?

695
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,152
Then why bother?

696
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:34,570
What's the fucking point?

697
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,697
Me and Terry'll be back
together on the other side...

698
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,324
so why wait any longer?

699
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:41,910
What are you doing?

700
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:45,539
Carter, slow down.

701
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:48,042
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you!

702
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:51,253
Knock it off!

703
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,255
May as well go out
on my own free will!

704
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:55,257
Not with us
in the fucking car!

705
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:03,891
Jesus, Carter!

706
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,018
Carter, stop the car!

707
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,270
What's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

708
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,272
l can get nailed
running this next red light.

709
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:11,607
You all wouldn't get shit.

710
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:13,359
lt doesn't work that way!

711
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,329
l fucking hated French class!

712
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,290
- Get control of yourself.
- That's what l'm doing!

713
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:31,168
l know what you're doing,
and it's all right to be scared.

714
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:33,587
l'm not afraid.
l decide when it's time.

715
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,715
l control my life.
l control my death.

716
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:39,259
You don't have to prove
how big your balls are!

717
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:45,015
Stop driving
like such an asshole.

718
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:46,725
What are you doing?

719
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:49,812
Jesus Christ!

720
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,022
Put your hands
back on the wheel!

721
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:54,108
- Carter, stop!
- Back on the wheel!

722
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,861
Shit.

723
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,615
Carter, easy.

724
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,660
l am so close to puking
right now.

725
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,581
We're afraid, too,
but we're not quitting.

726
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,167
Stop it and stop
this fucking car!

727
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:16,630
Damn it, l want you
to stop this car right now!

728
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:37,568
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.

729
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,403
Move the fucking car!

730
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:42,906
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

731
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:47,244
- Can't you open the door?
- Open the fucking door.

732
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:50,831
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!

733
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,714
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

734
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:06,221
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!

735
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:09,099
Carter, listen to me!

736
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:10,559
This isn't the way!

737
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,769
lt's not the way!
Get out of the car!

738
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:14,646
lt's coming!

739
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:21,153
lt ain't my time.

740
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,123
Shit.

741
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:35,083
Listen to me!
This isn't the way.

742
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,919
Get out of the car!

743
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,466
Come on! Get out!

744
01:11:49,932 --> 01:11:51,141
l can't get out!

745
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,530
Man, he really is next.

746
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,575
Get out!

747
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,285
Fuck!

748
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,223
Oh, God!

749
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,726
l saw it! l saw the belt!

750
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:35,936
You scared now?

751
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:37,437
lt broke!

752
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,106
Bullshit!

753
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:40,357
He saved your life again.

754
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:41,900
That's right!

755
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,527
You're next, Carter!

756
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,821
l'm staying the fuck
away from you!

757
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,407
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don't need this shit now.

758
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:50,242
l don't need it ever!

759
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:51,827
Get away from him! He's next!

760
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:53,495
Fuck you, Billy!
l'm not dead!

761
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:55,414
You will be.

762
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,708
You're dead...

763
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,252
and you ain't taking me
with you!

764
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:06,967
- God, no!
- Oh, shit!

765
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,936
Jesus fucking Christ!

766
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:20,564
You should have been next.

767
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:23,233
You were after Lewton.
That's the plan!

768
01:13:23,692 --> 01:13:25,611
That's the design!
You should be fucking dead!

769
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:26,820
You're the devil!

770
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:29,448
l saw the seat belt.
l knew it would rip!

771
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:31,450
That's how l saved him.

772
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,285
Just like the explosion.
l saw it!

773
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:35,662
- The police are coming.
- Fuck! l saved him!

774
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,581
Because l saved him,
it skipped Carter...

775
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,459
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion!

776
01:13:40,918 --> 01:13:42,336
l have to see it.

777
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:43,795
Then l intervene...

778
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:46,298
and if l intervene,
l cheat the design.

779
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,800
lntervene? Are you God now?

780
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:51,219
God's not afraid to die.

781
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:53,472
Gods don't die! We do!

782
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,808
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.

783
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,644
We have to get you
back to my cabin.

784
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,646
You can hide out
and get your head together.

785
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,814
After Billy, l'm next.

786
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,441
l'm next.

787
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:06,777
Then me.

788
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:10,030
Listen, l'm not going
to let it happen.

789
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,448
Listen to me.

790
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:15,035
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of here?

791
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,837
Rusted.

792
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,463
Tetanus.

793
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,550
Nice one.

794
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,553
l overlooked it.

795
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:24,558
You tried to capitalize,
but l caught you.

796
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,226
You fuck!

797
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:28,979
l can beat you.

798
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,815
Maybe not forever...

799
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:35,068
but l got this cabin
rigged to beat you now!

800
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:29,039
She was there a minute ago.

801
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,957
What are you talking about?

802
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,335
l'm not turning him in.

803
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,296
lt's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

804
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:40,342
l go with you.

805
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:42,510
You can't.

806
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,057
Just tell us where he is.

807
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:48,934
Wait at home.
l give you my word...

808
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,020
we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

809
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:24,094
l never moved.

810
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:27,973
Christa asked me to change,
but l never moved.

811
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,684
l would have been up
next to Tod.

812
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:33,812
Fuck!
Why didn't l remember that?

813
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:36,481
l never moved. Clear's seat
was in front of mine.

814
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,708
She's next.

815
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,421
Get in the car!
We're going around!

816
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:51,991
- There!
- Come on, let's go!

817
01:21:58,373 --> 01:22:00,250
Alex, we're trying to help you.

818
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:05,004
Prince! Get away from it!

819
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:18,977
Hold on!

820
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:51,176
Run!

821
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,223
We lost him.

822
01:23:38,723 --> 01:23:40,934
From the direction, there's only
one place he's heading.

823
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:42,894
No shit.

824
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:33,588
Oh, my God!

825
01:25:39,427 --> 01:25:40,928
Don't move! Stay there!

826
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:44,307
Don't move!

827
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,852
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tyres.

828
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,133
The car's going to explode!

829
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:26,182
l can only hold on for so long.
You know what to do.

830
01:26:26,683 --> 01:26:27,767
Don't!

831
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,395
When l do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll all be over.

832
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:32,438
lt's the only way
we can cheat death again.

833
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:34,065
Don't!

834
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:36,526
l am not going to let it
beat us both.

835
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,236
You know what to do!

836
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,407
l'll always be with you.

837
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:47,662
Don't!

838
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,752
Get away from there!

839
01:27:20,987 --> 01:27:23,030
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

840
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:25,950
Come on, baby. Come on.

841
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:31,956
Shit, he's not breathing.

842
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,292
Hold on, Alex. Come on.
Stay with me.

843
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,288
Well, we made it.

844
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:14,582
Paris.
l can't believe it.

845
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,876
l can't believe
we got on a plane again.

846
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:18,503
Know what l'm saying?

847
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,367
lt's weird being here, huh?

848
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:51,202
We finally completed a puzzle.

849
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:55,039
lt's just
there's something missing.

850
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:56,666
You know?

851
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,128
To Terry.

852
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:02,380
And to Tod.

853
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:04,090
To all of our friends
that can't be here.

854
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,758
Cheers.

855
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:10,930
What?

856
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,432
lf you would've told me
six months ago...

857
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,185
the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

858
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:20,356
l don't know.
Sometimes it feels like...

859
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:23,150
you two are the only ones
who understand.

860
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:28,990
You were right, Browning.

861
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,950
lt did skip us.
There was a design.

862
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:34,495
We beat it. We won.

863
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:38,916
The only thing we won
is a chance at a full life.

864
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:42,128
A chance
that l won't ever waste.

865
01:29:44,839 --> 01:29:47,758
There's just something
l can't figure out.

866
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,678
- About what?
- The design.

867
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:53,264
Just let it go, all right?

868
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:56,309
Hear me out, all right?

869
01:29:57,852 --> 01:29:59,896
- Oh, my God.
- Just listen.

870
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:03,649
The explosion path determined
the order of our deaths.

871
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:06,861
When l intervened
and saved Carter...

872
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,656
it skipped him and went
to the next person--Billy.

873
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,033
Then it was Clear.

874
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:14,118
But l intervened and saved her,
so it went to me.

875
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:18,247
But in my case,
no one intervened, right?

876
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:20,625
l was thrown
from that power line...

877
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,501
by the explosion, so...

878
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,712
So why did it skip you?

879
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:27,548
How do we know this isn't
what was meant to happen?

880
01:30:28,049 --> 01:30:29,925
That out of everyone
on flight 180...

881
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:32,637
you, me, and Carter
were meant to live?

882
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:35,765
Maybe that was
the design all along.

883
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:39,727
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

884
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:42,229
l didn't make up the rules.

885
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:44,649
Somebody's got to intervene
before death can skip them.

886
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:47,943
Alex proved that three times
with the plane, me, and you.

887
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:49,946
For all l know,
it could circle back...

888
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:51,572
and get us all again.

889
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:54,575
But l am the safest fucker
in the world...

890
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:57,328
because you're still next.

891
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:04,251
Can we just stop talking
about this?

892
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,128
Let's figure out...

893
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:23,979
l'll meet you back
at the hotel.

894
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,314
l'll go with you.

895
01:31:25,773 --> 01:31:29,276
No, just stay here,
OK, Clear?

896
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:30,528
All right?

897
01:31:30,945 --> 01:31:33,155
See? lt's true.
l told you you were next, man.

898
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:35,991
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.

899
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,494
Clear, stay there, OK?

900
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:40,162
Stay away.

901
01:32:12,445 --> 01:32:15,614
- l told you you were next!
- lt skipped me.
