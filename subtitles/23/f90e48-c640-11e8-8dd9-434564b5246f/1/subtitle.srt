1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,772
<i>In the first years
of the 21st century...</i>

2
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:50,194
<i>...a third World War broke out.</i>

3
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:54,699
<i>Those of us who survived knew</i>

4
00:00:54,741 --> 00:01:01,164
<i>mankind could never survive...</i>

5
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:03,833
<i>a fourth...</i>

6
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,503
<i>that our own volatile natures</i>

7
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:11,883
<i>could simply no longer
be risked.</i>

8
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:16,971
<i>So we have created
a new arm of the law...</i>

9
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:21,976
<i>...the Grammaton Cleric,</i>

10
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,898
<i>whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate</i>

11
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:32,278
<i>the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.</i>

12
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,743
<i>His ability...</i>

13
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,745
<i>to feel.</i>

14
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:42,997
Police!

15
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,014
You know what to do.

16
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,322
Get down!

17
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:04,996
<i>We have an unknown number</i>

18
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,498
<i>barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.</i>

19
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:10,001
<i>Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.</i>

20
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:14,130
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,591
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,468
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,639
Go.

24
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,022
Where is he?

25
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,232
Shut up.

26
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,276
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,778
Shut up!

28
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,363
Listen.

29
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:20,983
This is it.

30
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,193
Where?

31
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,780
There.

32
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,362
It's real.

33
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,037
Burn it.

34
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,620
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,790
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

36
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,630
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:10,760
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

38
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,303
get it done properly.

39
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:21,020
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

40
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:25,441
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

41
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:28,820
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,907
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,790
<i>Libria...</i>

44
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:44,127
<i>I congratulate you.</i>

45
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:46,129
<i>At last...</i>

46
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,967
<i>peace reigns
in the heart of man.</i>

47
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,803
<i>At last, war is but a word</i>

48
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:57,140
<i>whose meaning fades
from our understanding.</i>

49
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,475
<i>At last...</i>

50
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:03,688
<i>we... are... whole.</i>

51
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:16,033
<i>Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.</i>

52
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,620
<i>Its symptom is hate.</i>

53
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:25,084
<i>Its symptom... is anger.</i>

54
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:29,255
<i>Its symptom is rage.</i>

55
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:34,260
<i>Its symptom... is war.</i>

56
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:41,350
<i>The disease... is human emotion.</i>

57
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:45,521
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

58
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,982
For there is a cure
for this disease.

59
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,486
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

60
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,698
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

61
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,287
<i>And you as a society
have embraced this cure.</i>

62
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,623
<i>Prozium.</i>

63
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,461
<i>Now we are at peace
with ourselves,</i>

64
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:11,964
<i>and humankind is one.</i>

65
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:13,966
<i>War is gone.</i>

66
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,677
<i>Hate, a memory.</i>

67
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,639
<i>We are our own conscience now.</i>

68
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:25,186
<i>And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10</i>

69
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,438
<i>for emotional content</i>

70
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:31,692
<i>all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...</i>

71
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,403
<i>and destroy them.</i>

72
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,447
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:41,411
Against all odds
and your own natures...

74
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:45,832
you have survived.

75
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:09,063
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:12,608
it reminds why we do
what we do.

77
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,818
It does?

78
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:17,739
I beg your pardon.

79
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,037
It does.

80
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:40,344
<i>The following items
have been rated EC-10...</i>

81
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,804
<i>condemned...</i>

82
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:44,724
<i>seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,</i>

83
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,393
<i>seven discs of musical content,</i>

84
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:50,480
<i>20 interactive strategy
computer programs.</i>

85
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:53,524
<i>Seven works
of two-dimensional...</i>

86
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,907
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

87
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,909
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,243
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,912
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,247
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

91
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:09,749
Father's voice.

92
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,501
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:16,297
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:20,259
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

95
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,095
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,889
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

97
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:27,475
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,687
Somehow...

99
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,232
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:37,860
to sense
how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:41,781
to... put myself
in their position.

102
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:47,078
If you had ceased
your interval,

103
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:50,623
if you were
a sense offender...

104
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,792
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

105
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,211
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:56,963
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

107
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,006
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

108
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,508
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,634
Good.

110
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:02,927
And the mother?

111
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,804
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

112
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,639
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

113
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:07,682
By yourself?

114
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:08,975
No, sir... by another.

115
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,229
How did you feel about that?

116
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,316
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,569
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

118
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:22,572
How did you feel?

119
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:27,160
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,995
Really?

121
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:31,456
How is it
that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,421
I...

123
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,801
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

124
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,428
I don't know.

125
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,308
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

126
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:56,689
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

127
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:00,151
Yes, sir.

128
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:07,158
<i>Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,</i>

129
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,952
<i>it reminds why we do
what we do.</i>

130
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,079
<i>It does?</i>

131
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,749
<i>Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,</i>

132
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:18,086
<i>it reminds why we do
what we do.</i>

133
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,170
<i>It does?</i>

134
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,216
<i>It does.</i>

135
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:30,473
<i>Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136 890.</i>

136
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,141
I need it.

137
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:34,143
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,437
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

139
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,148
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,650
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,152
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

142
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,321
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

143
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,656
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:47,990
Check again.

145
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:52,370
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:55,456
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

147
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,541
Cleric...

148
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,336
...there's nothing.

149
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,548
Thank you.

150
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,846
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

151
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,347
every night
for the last two weeks.

152
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:12,974
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

153
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,770
You always knew.

154
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:11,324
"But I, being poor...

155
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,743
have only my dreams."

156
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:18,122
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

157
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:21,459
"Tread softly...

158
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:24,879
because you tread
on my dreams."

159
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,966
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,137
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

161
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:40,103
We both know...
they never go easy.

162
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,354
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,398
No, you're not.

164
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,609
You don't even know
the meaning.

165
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,278
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,280
for a feeling
you've never felt.

167
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,035
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,204
It's gone.

169
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,499
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

170
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,751
There's no war.

171
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,504
No murder.

172
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:09,799
What is it you think we do?

173
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:11,676
No.

174
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,052
You've been with me.

175
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:16,514
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,643
A heavy cost.

177
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:25,231
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,173
Don't.

179
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,802
You and your partner
were close?

180
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,976
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

181
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,895
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:50,775
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

183
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:58,866
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

184
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:02,245
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

185
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,122
before they know it
themselves.

186
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,634
Cleric...

187
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,430
I can only hope one day
to be as...

188
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:24,517
uncompromising as you.

189
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,935
Good night.

190
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:30,732
<i>The later 20th century</i>

191
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,943
<i>saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise</i>

192
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:39,115
<i>of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.</i>

193
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:43,286
<i>The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.</i>

194
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,956
John?

195
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,041
Yes?

196
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:51,252
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

197
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:55,006
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,425
Do you think
I should report him?

199
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,016
Unquestionably.

200
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:13,941
<i>...a single inescapable fact...</i>

201
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:17,028
<i>that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose</i>

202
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,739
<i>in pursuit of war...</i>

203
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:23,576
<i>than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.</i>

204
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,921
<i>"But I, being poor...</i>

205
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:37,757
<i>have only my dreams."</i>

206
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,177
<i>I have spread my dreams
under your feet."</i>

207
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,014
<i>"Tread softly...</i>

208
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,892
<i>because you tread
on my dreams."</i>

209
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,937
<i>Don't move! Don't move!</i>

210
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,605
<i>Comply! Comply!</i>

211
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,607
<i>- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!</i>

212
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,322
<i>Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.</i>

213
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:44,907
<i>We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.</i>

214
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,784
<i>She's charged
with sense offense.</i>

215
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,049
<i>- Hey!</i>

216
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:03,968
<i>Get her!
Get her off him now!</i>

217
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:06,471
<i>Remember me.</i>

218
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,986
<i>- Libria...</i>

219
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,821
<i>Awake.</i>

220
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:29,118
<i>Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,</i>

221
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,747
<i>another step
in our unified march</i>

222
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,417
<i>- Into the unwavering purpose...</i>

223
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:43,132
<i>...move ahead together</i>

224
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:46,803
<i>into the certainty
of our collective destiny.</i>

225
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,200
What are you doing?

226
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,789
I said, what are you doing?

227
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:18,334
I accidently dropped my...

228
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:19,961
morning interval.

229
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:23,005
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

230
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:26,592
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

231
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:30,555
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

232
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:31,973
and get a replacement.

233
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:34,976
Yes.

234
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:36,811
Of course.

235
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,751
Your new partner called.

236
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,211
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

237
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,588
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:06,007
I took the liberty
of telling him

239
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,177
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

240
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:11,763
No, of course not.

241
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,765
That was the right thing
to do.

242
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:19,145
Stop that.

243
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:29,030
<i>Due to terrorist activity,</i>

244
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,532
<i>this site is
temporarily closed.</i>

245
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:37,038
<i>Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.</i>

246
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,500
<i>Due to terrorist activity,</i>

247
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,877
<i>this site is

248
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,380
<i>This site is
temporarily closed.</i>

249
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:49,926
<i>Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.</i>

250
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:56,682
More than punctual, Cleric.

251
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:57,934
Hop in.

252
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:12,657
How were the lines?

253
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,159
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

254
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,911
and get out so quickly.

255
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,206
No, they're...
they're fine today.

256
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:27,422
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

257
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:31,175
You expecting Resistance?

258
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,470
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

259
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:38,558
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

260
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:42,228
Always expecting the worst.

261
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:45,982
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

262
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:49,110
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

263
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,321
How long have you been off
the dose?

264
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,489
Look at you.

265
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:56,284
Look at you!

266
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,459
Look at you.

267
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:09,213
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

268
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:20,933
<i>We have suppression.
We're making entry.</i>

269
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,435
<i>Standard deployment.</i>

270
00:26:22,518 --> 00:26:25,313
<i>Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.</i>

271
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,152
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

272
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:15,863
Eventually.

273
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:18,616
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

274
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:19,951
by yourself.

275
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:23,037
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

276
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:26,249
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

277
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:28,918
Gun!

278
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:48,312
We need her.

279
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,506
What's your name?

280
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,801
O'Brien, Mary.

281
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:22,096
Well, Mary...

282
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,556
you can either wait

283
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:27,727
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

284
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,563
or you can tell me now.

285
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:32,648
Who are your friends?

286
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,863
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

287
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,991
what that word means...
"friend."

288
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,497
There's nothing
you don't feel?

289
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:50,708
How about guilt?

290
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,754
Let me ask you something.

291
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:06,265
Why are you alive?

292
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,021
I'm alive...

293
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,693
I live...

294
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:23,658
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

295
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,326
To serve Libria.

296
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,828
It's circular.

297
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:29,497
You exist to continue
your existence.

298
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,040
What's the point?

299
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,002
What's the point
of your existence?

300
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:36,587
To feel.

301
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:39,841
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

302
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:42,677
But it's as vital as breath.

303
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,388
And without it...
without love,

304
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,933
without anger,
without sorrow...

305
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:53,396
breath is
just a clock ticking.

306
00:29:57,608 --> 00:30:00,445
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

307
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:02,739
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

308
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,117
Processing.

309
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:11,456
You mean execution, don't you?

310
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,543
Processing.

311
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,428
The Gun Katas.

312
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,431
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

313
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:30,391
the Cleric has determined

314
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,644
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

315
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,397
is a statistically
predictable element.

316
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:39,901
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

317
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:42,236
each fluid position
representing

318
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,323
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

319
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:47,283
on the maximum number
of opponents

320
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:49,077
while keeping
the defender clear

321
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,412
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

322
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:53,122
of return fire.

323
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,250
By the rote mastery
of this art,

324
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:59,545
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

325
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:03,174
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

326
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:05,635
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

327
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:09,597
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

328
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,775
<i>Without love...</i>

329
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:06,404
<i>breath is just a clock...
ticking.</i>

330
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:51,676
<i>Prozium...
the great nepenthe.</i>

331
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,970
<i>Opiate of our masses.</i>

332
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,639
<i>Glue of our great society.</i>

333
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,808
<i>Salve and salvation,</i>

334
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,812
<i>it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,</i>

335
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:06,941
<i>the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.</i>

336
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:09,527
<i>With it, we anesthetize grief,</i>

337
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,698
<i>annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.</i>

338
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:18,202
<i>That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation</i>

339
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:20,830
<i>are anesthetized in stride,</i>

340
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,207
<i>we accept as fair sacrifice.</i>

341
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:29,255
<i>For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness</i>

342
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:33,551
<i>and all that it has done
to make us great.</i>

343
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:27,980
Good morning, Cleric.

344
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,982
Good morning.

345
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:34,112
<i>...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth</i>

346
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:40,451
<i>were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.</i>

347
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:43,788
<i>And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom</i>

348
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:46,416
<i>but the disease itself.</i>

349
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,961
<i>We have sought to shrug off
individuality,</i>

350
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:52,672
<i>replacing it with conformity.</i>

351
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:55,633
<i>Replacing it...</i>

352
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:58,428
<i>with sameness...</i>

353
00:35:58,511 --> 00:36:01,013
<i>with unity,</i>

354
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:05,643
<i>allowing each man, woman,
and child</i>

355
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:07,562
<i>in this great society</i>

356
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:11,190
<i>to lead identical lives.</i>

357
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:16,237
<i>The concept of identical
environment construction</i>

358
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,574
<i>allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment</i>

359
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,367
<i>with all the secure knowledge</i>

360
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,287
<i>it has been lived before.</i>

361
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:40,762
What are you doing?

362
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:46,517
I'm rearranging my desk.

363
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,270
You didn't like
the way it was before?

364
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:52,482
I had no feelings about it.

365
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:54,734
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

366
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:01,657
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

367
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,716
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

368
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,387
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

369
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,099
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

370
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:27,683
You clean, we'll sweep.

371
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,310
Yes, sir.

372
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:34,190
Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,191
Go!

374
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,859
Aah!

375
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,320
Take it! Take the landings!

376
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,531
- Aah!
- Aah!

377
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,128
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

378
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:00,508
Nice grab, Cleric.

379
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,078
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

380
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,948
Cleric...

381
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:36,492
Why didn't you leave that

382
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:39,328
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

383
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,878
They miss things sometimes.

384
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:50,089
I'll take it in myself...

385
00:42:50,173 --> 00:42:52,967
make sure
it gets done properly.

386
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:58,056
You know, Preston...

387
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:01,976
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

388
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,270
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

389
00:43:04,353 --> 00:43:08,149
What'll there be
for men like us?

390
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:09,901
<i>Sir!</i>

391
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:11,527
<i>We got something out back.</i>

392
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,456
<i>We're gonna need
two more men on this.</i>

393
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,255
<i>These animals were defended
by women and children.</i>

394
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:32,590
<i>We put them down easily.</i>

395
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:36,302
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

396
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:38,638
Why do they keep
these animals?

397
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:40,848
What, do they...
do they eat them?

398
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,977
<i>What do you want me
to do, sir?</i>

399
00:43:45,061 --> 00:43:46,354
<i>Exterminate them, of course.</i>

400
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,855
<i>All right. Let's do it.</i>

401
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:49,690
<i>- No.</i>

402
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:50,942
<i>What's wrong, Cleric?</i>

403
00:43:54,529 --> 00:43:56,739
<i>Nothing.</i>

404
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,254
<i>- Hey...</i>

405
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:12,547
<i>Grab it.</i>

406
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,715
<i>Grab it!</i>

407
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:23,641
<i>Sir... toss it back in.</i>

408
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:25,560
<i>I'll finish it off.</i>

409
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:31,482
<i>Give it to me, sir.</i>

410
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:33,484
<i>Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.</i>

411
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:48,750
Wait!

412
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:54,297
It seems to me that...

413
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,051
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

414
00:44:58,134 --> 00:45:00,136
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

415
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,680
it's best we know about it.

416
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:09,479
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

417
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,813
They were Resistance.

418
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,107
They could have led us
to the Underground.

419
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:14,817
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

420
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:15,860
they were slaughtered.

421
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:19,113
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

422
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:20,782
the Father has decreed

423
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:24,243
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

424
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:26,704
They are either to be
shot on sight

425
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:28,289
or incinerated without a trial.

426
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:29,499
But it's counter to law.

427
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,376
You're a member
of the Council. Lf...

428
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:33,336
It is not the will
of the Council,

429
00:45:33,378 --> 00:45:36,172
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

430
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:40,301
Sir...

431
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:43,304
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

432
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:46,349
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

433
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:48,559
You must understand, Preston,

434
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:52,230
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

435
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:55,024
it is not the message
that is important,

436
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:58,319
it is our obedience to it.

437
00:45:58,403 --> 00:46:00,530
Father's will.

438
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:03,199
Call it faith.

439
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,284
You have it, I assume?

440
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,249
Yes.

441
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,293
I have it.

442
00:46:14,377 --> 00:46:15,920
Good.

443
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:40,611
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

444
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,072
Mary O'Brien.

445
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:47,303
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

446
00:47:47,345 --> 00:47:49,514
enforcement-related.

447
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:53,768
Thank you, sir.

448
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:28,344
I don't know what else
to do with you.

449
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,432
Go on.

450
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:33,516
Go on.

451
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:37,937
Go!

452
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:14,557
Fine.

453
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,684
But you're going back
in the trunk.

454
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,075
Okay.

455
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,621
Here.

456
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:49,884
<i>Step away from the vehicle!</i>

457
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,178
<i>Step away from the vehicle!</i>

458
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:53,554
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

459
00:49:53,638 --> 00:49:56,474
<i>Step away from the vehicle!</i>

460
00:49:56,516 --> 00:49:58,726
<i>Identification.</i>

461
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,228
I'm a Cleric.

462
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,480
<i>I'm here on official business.</i>

463
00:50:02,563 --> 00:50:03,314
<i>Identification!</i>

464
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:05,733
<i>It's in my coat.</i>

465
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:08,027
<i>Where's the coat?
Where is it?!</i>

466
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,364
<i>I don't have it.</i>

467
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:14,158
<i>Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.</i>

468
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:15,910
You're making
a very big mistake.

469
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:17,036
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

470
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:18,121
<i>We're gonna search
your vehicle.</i>

471
00:50:18,204 --> 00:50:20,498
<i>No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.</i>

472
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,999
<i>Search it!</i>

473
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,800
<i>- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.</i>

474
00:50:30,842 --> 00:50:32,135
I'm trying to tell you.

475
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:34,262
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

476
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:35,763
I'm not...

477
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:37,807
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

478
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:39,183
My name is John Preston.

479
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:41,602
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

480
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,271
<i>Wait.</i>

481
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:47,900
<i>Stand off.</i>

482
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:53,156
<i>I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.</i>

483
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:57,702
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

484
00:50:57,744 --> 00:50:58,745
Thank you.

485
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:01,664
<i>We'll escort you back
to the gate.</i>

486
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:02,707
Thanks.

487
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:11,132
Animals.

488
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,052
Nether's full of them.

489
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:16,012
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

490
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:18,014
Impossible.

491
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:20,016
Just give me my keys.

492
00:51:20,058 --> 00:51:21,184
I'll be on my way.

493
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:28,149
Captain...

494
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:31,360
I'm asking you
one last time...

495
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:33,196
don't do this.

496
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,032
<i>Down on your knees!</i>

497
00:51:36,074 --> 00:51:37,700
<i>- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!</i>

498
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:38,951
<i>Drop down!</i>

499
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:41,287
<i>On the ground! Comply!</i>

500
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,955
<i>Do it!</i>

501
00:51:43,706 --> 00:51:44,791
<i>No.</i>

502
00:51:44,874 --> 00:51:46,209
<i>Fuck!</i>

503
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:51,964
<i>What?</i>

504
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:54,342
<i>Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!</i>

505
00:52:03,643 --> 00:52:04,852
<i>Aah!</i>

506
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,702
Always practicing, Cleric.

507
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:28,454
I guess that's why
you're the best.

508
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,167
Maybe I'm just better.

509
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,045
Something on your mind?

510
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:40,049
Why do you ask?

511
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,384
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

512
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:43,553
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

513
00:54:54,939 --> 00:54:57,567
So, then...
what am I thinking?

514
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:05,616
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

515
00:55:11,956 --> 00:55:13,750
And if they know who did it.

516
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:20,590
Am I close?

517
00:55:23,468 --> 00:55:25,928
So, tell me... do they know?

518
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:36,439
There are theories.

519
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:38,816
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

520
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:41,069
they're premature!

521
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,200
I'm glad it happened.

522
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:52,622
Why?

523
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:54,791
Because now
Father and the Council

524
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:58,378
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

525
00:55:58,461 --> 00:56:00,630
Whoever did it...

526
00:56:00,713 --> 00:56:04,092
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

527
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:15,311
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

528
00:56:32,036 --> 00:56:35,248
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

529
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:38,334
Sector 7.

530
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:42,004
So get ready.

531
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:24,756
That door behind you...

532
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,176
Go.

533
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:31,179
Go, damn you!

534
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,226
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

535
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,145
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

536
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:41,189
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

537
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:42,607
Now go.

538
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,615
Damn you! Follow me.

539
00:57:50,698 --> 00:57:53,409
Now! Let's go!

540
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,003
<i>There will be no detention.</i>

541
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:07,882
<i>Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.</i>

542
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:11,761
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

543
00:58:19,352 --> 00:58:21,437
Look out!

544
00:58:24,273 --> 00:58:25,900
Aah!

545
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:29,445
Aaaah!

546
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,244
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

547
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:38,788
Go!

548
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:41,124
What are you doing?
Cleric!

549
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:42,458
<i>They're Resistance fighters.</i>

550
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:44,460
Cleric!

551
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:48,464
He's a sense offender!

552
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:33,968
<i>Cover all quadrants!</i>

553
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:35,386
<i>Secure the perimeter!</i>

554
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:47,899
What is this?

555
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:50,860
What are you doing?!

556
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:53,488
Nicely done, Cleric.

557
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:55,615
You drive them
into the trap...

558
00:59:57,617 --> 00:59:58,826
I close it.

559
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:10,004
The very definition
of... teamwork.

560
01:00:10,088 --> 01:00:11,589
Don't you think?

561
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:17,220
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

562
01:00:20,932 --> 01:00:24,102
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

563
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,353
Cleric...

564
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:27,730
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

565
01:00:27,772 --> 01:00:30,566
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

566
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:32,193
They have valuable information.

567
01:00:32,276 --> 01:00:33,277
Cleric...

568
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:34,862
They can be put to
much better use.

569
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:35,905
Cleric.

570
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,035
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

571
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:30,960
No.

572
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,758
I think, in the end...

573
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:38,885
it'll be better
if you have it.

574
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:02,116
Captain.

575
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,160
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

576
01:02:08,414 --> 01:02:09,665
<i>Ready...</i>

577
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:19,509
<i>Aim...</i>

578
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,059
<i>Fire!</i>

579
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:36,567
Sir?

580
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:38,486
Yes, Cleric?

581
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:41,364
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

582
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:44,117
against the Resistance.

583
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,119
I'm ready.

584
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:48,121
Today.

585
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:49,997
I wish to show my faith.

586
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,960
I wish, with your permission,

587
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:56,921
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

588
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:58,464
To destroy it.

589
01:03:01,259 --> 01:03:02,844
To destroy it.

590
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:05,012
Good. Do it.

591
01:03:14,439 --> 01:03:17,400
I'm so...

592
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:19,235
so very sorry.

593
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:34,208
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

594
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:35,668
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

595
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:37,045
Good.

596
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:19,962
Errol Partridge.

597
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:26,219
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

598
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:29,055
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

599
01:04:29,138 --> 01:04:32,392
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

600
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:34,644
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

601
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,403
I want to know about him.

602
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:47,949
Well...

603
01:04:48,032 --> 01:04:51,119
I suggest you go ask him.

604
01:04:52,203 --> 01:04:55,206
But I understand
that he's dead...

605
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:58,876
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

606
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,671
Not by my friends.

607
01:05:01,713 --> 01:05:03,381
By me.

608
01:05:12,223 --> 01:05:13,766
Aaah!

609
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,427
You were lovers.

610
01:06:07,612 --> 01:06:10,156
<i>The Underground is our foe,</i>

611
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,784
and greater
than even the threat

612
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:16,746
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

613
01:06:16,788 --> 01:06:21,918
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

614
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:24,754
They are
the secret organization...

615
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:33,221
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

616
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,056
that we find our greatest...

617
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:38,810
Good afternoon, sir.

618
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:41,771
What will it be for you?

619
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:43,564
The latest copy
of the inserts?

620
01:06:43,648 --> 01:06:45,775
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

621
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:46,901
Errol Partridge.

622
01:06:46,984 --> 01:06:49,529
What do you know about him?

623
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:50,947
I beg your pardon?

624
01:06:50,988 --> 01:06:52,865
Everyone out. Now.

625
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:08,673
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

626
01:07:08,715 --> 01:07:11,342
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

627
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:14,303
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

628
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:16,639
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

629
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:19,559
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

630
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:22,687
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

631
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,689
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

632
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:27,608
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

633
01:07:27,692 --> 01:07:29,819
I-I really don't know...

634
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:30,987
Speak!

635
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,657
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

636
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:35,992
Why?

637
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:39,162
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

638
01:07:39,203 --> 01:07:40,204
Jurgen!

639
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:02,727
Interesting.

640
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:05,938
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

641
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:43,851
We've been watching you,
Preston.

642
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:51,359
You're Jurgen.

643
01:08:52,944 --> 01:08:55,696
You're feeling.

644
01:09:10,086 --> 01:09:12,171
Do you know why you came?

645
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:37,447
Welcome to the Underground.

646
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:49,459
Polygraph.

647
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:53,504
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

648
01:09:53,546 --> 01:09:55,715
We have to be sure.

649
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:02,346
Mary.

650
01:10:08,853 --> 01:10:11,022
You're carrying
in your left pocket

651
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:14,025
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

652
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,196
You breathe it in sometimes

653
01:10:18,237 --> 01:10:21,157
when you think
there's no one to see.

654
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,161
But what you feel...

655
01:10:25,203 --> 01:10:27,747
what you feel
could only be satisfied

656
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,458
by falling yourself into her.

657
01:10:36,089 --> 01:10:39,342
She's scheduled
for combustion...

658
01:10:39,425 --> 01:10:41,594
tomorrow.

659
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:49,602
I know.

660
01:10:50,978 --> 01:10:53,314
You know, I was like you.

661
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:57,360
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

662
01:10:57,402 --> 01:10:59,779
is that it has its price...

663
01:10:59,862 --> 01:11:02,740
a complete paradox.

664
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:05,702
But without restraint...

665
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:07,995
without control...

666
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:09,997
emotion is chaos.

667
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:12,125
But how is that diff...

668
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:15,712
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

669
01:11:15,753 --> 01:11:17,880
we can.

670
01:11:17,964 --> 01:11:21,551
It's just that...

671
01:11:21,634 --> 01:11:25,513
some of us...

672
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:27,849
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

673
01:11:27,932 --> 01:11:31,060
so that the rest can have it.

674
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:33,187
Some very few of us

675
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:37,191
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

676
01:11:38,943 --> 01:11:40,111
Like me.

677
01:11:41,988 --> 01:11:43,948
Like you.

678
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:50,955
What can I do?

679
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:55,668
You can kill Father.

680
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,997
<i>- Cleric John Preston...</i>

681
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:35,792
<i>you are to come with us
immediately.</i>

682
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:47,053
Cleric Preston.

683
01:12:47,136 --> 01:12:48,304
Sir.

684
01:12:51,182 --> 01:12:54,310
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

685
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:55,686
Rumor, sir?

686
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:56,729
Yes.

687
01:12:56,813 --> 01:12:59,107
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

688
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,566
one of the Cleric,

689
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:04,737
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

690
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:07,657
that one of our elite number

691
01:13:07,698 --> 01:13:10,910
is actually feeling.

692
01:13:10,993 --> 01:13:12,912
Feeling, sir?

693
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:16,666
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

694
01:13:22,004 --> 01:13:23,256
No, sir.

695
01:13:28,553 --> 01:13:32,014
This person, I'm told,

696
01:13:32,098 --> 01:13:35,810
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

697
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:41,357
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

698
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:43,276
how exactly...

699
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,529
have you been making use
of your time of late?

700
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:55,621
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

701
01:14:00,251 --> 01:14:02,211
Attempting?

702
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:08,051
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

703
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:11,179
if all you do is attempt?

704
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,227
You're...

705
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:20,146
absolutely...

706
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:22,398
100% right, sir.

707
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:25,943
Of course I am.

708
01:14:28,362 --> 01:14:31,783
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

709
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:34,160
If the Resistance
compromises it,

710
01:14:34,243 --> 01:14:36,662
we are doomed.

711
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:40,500
Father is doomed.

712
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:43,211
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

713
01:14:43,294 --> 01:14:45,088
to locate the Resistance,

714
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:46,631
to find this traitor,

715
01:14:46,672 --> 01:14:50,009
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

716
01:14:54,305 --> 01:14:55,431
Do it.

717
01:15:39,809 --> 01:15:41,018
What are you doing?

718
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,065
What are you doing?

719
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:50,445
I, uh...

720
01:15:55,366 --> 01:15:58,369
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

721
01:15:58,411 --> 01:16:00,079
taking your interval.

722
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:02,874
And are you satisfied?

723
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,587
Yes, I am.

724
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,341
Good night, Dad.

725
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:16,137
I don't understand.

726
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,848
My execution's set.

727
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:21,350
Why are you here?

728
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,996
Aren't you gonna dose?

729
01:16:55,885 --> 01:16:57,845
My God.

730
01:16:59,764 --> 01:17:00,848
What...

731
01:17:03,893 --> 01:17:06,062
What'll you do?

732
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:09,273
I don't know.

733
01:17:43,975 --> 01:17:45,226
50 sweepers, maybe more.

734
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:47,729
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

735
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:49,772
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

736
01:17:49,856 --> 01:17:51,441
The danger of assassination
is too great.

737
01:17:51,482 --> 01:17:53,735
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

738
01:17:53,818 --> 01:17:55,445
Even if I could...

739
01:17:55,528 --> 01:17:57,280
even if I could
make it through,

740
01:17:57,363 --> 01:18:00,491
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

741
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,118
that anything would be
different?

742
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:04,996
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

743
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:06,998
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

744
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,499
that the Council is leaderless.

745
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,710
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

746
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:13,046
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

747
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:15,465
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

748
01:18:15,506 --> 01:18:18,176
for even one day... one day...

749
01:18:18,259 --> 01:18:20,803
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

750
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:23,931
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

751
01:18:24,015 --> 01:18:26,017
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

752
01:18:29,854 --> 01:18:31,898
Will you do it?

753
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:41,866
Yes.

754
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:44,786
Can you?

755
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:50,166
I don't know.

756
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:02,053
Don't...

757
01:19:03,888 --> 01:19:05,390
Seeing her one last time

758
01:19:05,431 --> 01:19:08,518
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

759
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,596
<i>...designed especially
to deal with it.</i>

760
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,265
<i>The Cleric was implemented</i>

761
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:49,684
<i>and sent out to search
and destroy</i>

762
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:51,227
<i>such objects that remained</i>

763
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:54,272
<i>and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...</i>

764
01:19:54,313 --> 01:19:55,732
File footage.

765
01:19:55,773 --> 01:19:59,402
The Council...

766
01:19:59,485 --> 01:20:02,029
Viviana Preston.

767
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:04,157
Sentence and incineration.

768
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:07,910
Auditory.

769
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:09,328
<i>Viviana Preston,</i>

770
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:11,789
<i>for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,</i>

771
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:12,999
<i>you stand condemned</i>

772
01:20:13,082 --> 01:20:15,293
<i>to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.</i>

773
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:18,796
<i>You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.</i>

774
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:37,774
The Cleric was implemented

775
01:20:37,815 --> 01:20:39,609
and sent out to search
and destroy

776
01:20:39,692 --> 01:20:41,235
such objects that remained

777
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:45,406
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

778
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:47,450
The Council...

779
01:21:28,157 --> 01:21:30,076
The incineration...
has it gone through?!

780
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,911
It's going through now.

781
01:21:31,994 --> 01:21:33,496
Hey!

782
01:22:01,232 --> 01:22:04,360
<i>Machine turbines priming.</i>

783
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:06,028
Machine turbines priming.

784
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:08,156
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

785
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,866
<i>You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.</i>

786
01:22:09,907 --> 01:22:11,159
<i>If we force the door now,</i>

787
01:22:11,242 --> 01:22:12,702
<i>the turbines will explode
at street level.</i>

788
01:22:12,785 --> 01:22:16,247
<i>...personnel,
clear the area immediately.</i>

789
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:20,752
<i>All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.</i>

790
01:22:20,793 --> 01:22:23,880
<i>Turbines primed.</i>

791
01:22:23,963 --> 01:22:26,674
<i>Fire in 10 seconds...</i>

792
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:28,509
<i>9 seconds...</i>

793
01:22:28,593 --> 01:22:29,927
<i>8 seconds...</i>

794
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:31,304
<i>7 seconds...</i>

795
01:22:31,387 --> 01:22:33,639
<i>6 seconds...</i>

796
01:22:33,723 --> 01:22:35,725
<i>5 seconds...</i>

797
01:22:35,808 --> 01:22:36,934
<i>4 seconds...</i>

798
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:38,644
<i>3 seconds...</i>

799
01:22:38,728 --> 01:22:41,230
<i>2 seconds...</i>

800
01:22:41,314 --> 01:22:44,525
<i>Turbines... fire.</i>

801
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:38,538
Cleric John Preston...

802
01:23:44,168 --> 01:23:46,170
You are under arrest.

803
01:23:47,839 --> 01:23:49,674
This man...

804
01:23:49,716 --> 01:23:51,968
this senior Cleric...

805
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:53,970
has ceased the dose.

806
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:57,598
He is feeling!

807
01:23:57,682 --> 01:24:01,561
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

808
01:24:01,644 --> 01:24:04,480
of our great society!

809
01:24:04,522 --> 01:24:06,190
And I...

810
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:09,193
I have brought him
for your justice.

811
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,987
Ugh!

812
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:17,785
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

813
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,329
Vice-Council...

814
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:22,623
This man is guilty

815
01:24:22,707 --> 01:24:24,500
of consorting
with sense offenders,

816
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:27,837
of having relations
with a female,

817
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:31,174
of sense crime itself.

818
01:24:31,215 --> 01:24:33,551
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

819
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:34,677
to search for unused...

820
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,012
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

821
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:37,847
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

822
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:40,099
you will find
that it was he

823
01:24:40,183 --> 01:24:43,019
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

824
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:49,984
Cleric...

825
01:24:50,068 --> 01:24:52,361
I assume you have something
to say to me.

826
01:24:54,363 --> 01:24:56,949
I know...

827
01:24:57,033 --> 01:24:58,534
it's hard to believe...

828
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:04,082
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

829
01:25:04,123 --> 01:25:07,210
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

830
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:09,754
would become associated
with the Resistance,

831
01:25:09,796 --> 01:25:14,050
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

832
01:25:14,133 --> 01:25:16,135
But it's true.

833
01:25:20,139 --> 01:25:24,560
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

834
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:25,686
And I have.

835
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:30,733
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

836
01:25:30,775 --> 01:25:33,694
The trace shows
that it was your gun

837
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:36,406
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

838
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:37,990
That's impossible.

839
01:25:42,495 --> 01:25:45,498
This is wrong.

840
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,334
<i>I think, in the end...</i>

841
01:25:48,418 --> 01:25:51,337
<i>it'll be better
if you have it.</i>

842
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:53,131
He switched them.

843
01:25:54,132 --> 01:25:55,967
He switched them.

844
01:25:56,008 --> 01:25:57,719
See, I have his gun now.

845
01:25:57,802 --> 01:26:00,555
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

846
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:01,556
What?

847
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:03,850
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

848
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:06,185
for summary judgment
and combustion.

849
01:26:06,269 --> 01:26:08,688
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

850
01:26:08,771 --> 01:26:11,899
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

851
01:26:11,983 --> 01:26:14,360
He is the one who's feeling!

852
01:26:14,444 --> 01:26:15,987
This is a mistake!

853
01:26:18,114 --> 01:26:19,907
Of course...

854
01:26:19,991 --> 01:26:22,869
since a complaint
has been lodged,

855
01:26:22,952 --> 01:26:25,830
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

856
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:28,332
to carry out the search
of your premises.

857
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,543
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

858
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:34,630
or am I being
too... exacting?

859
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:37,050
As you say, sir,

860
01:26:37,133 --> 01:26:39,052
it's the law and the letter.

861
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:42,138
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

862
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,557
that your colleague
is going to his end?

863
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,060
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

864
01:26:47,143 --> 01:26:49,812
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

865
01:26:49,896 --> 01:26:55,068
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

866
01:26:55,151 --> 01:26:57,028
Hmm.

867
01:26:57,153 --> 01:26:58,821
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

868
01:26:58,863 --> 01:27:01,991
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

869
01:27:02,033 --> 01:27:04,369
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

870
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:18,508
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

871
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:20,718
The search team will be up
momentarily.

872
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:23,388
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

873
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,702
<i>The search teams are
already inside, sir.</i>

874
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:47,078
- Excellent.

875
01:28:07,932 --> 01:28:10,226
Looking for something?

876
01:28:14,981 --> 01:28:16,733
If I were you...

877
01:28:16,816 --> 01:28:21,904
I'd be more careful
in the future.

878
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:28,369
How long?

879
01:28:28,453 --> 01:28:30,705
Since Mom.

880
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:34,751
And Lisa?

881
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:36,085
Of course.

882
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:42,550
How did you know?

883
01:28:42,633 --> 01:28:45,136
You forget...

884
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:47,638
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

885
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,311
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

886
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,858
<i>You have a message
for the Vice-Council?</i>

887
01:28:58,941 --> 01:29:00,818
It's done.

888
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:04,280
I've located the Resistance.

889
01:29:04,322 --> 01:29:06,657
Come now.

890
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,743
You'll have them all.

891
01:29:30,681 --> 01:29:34,185
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

892
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,520
Avoid eye contact.

893
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:38,815
If you should break
his personal security zone,

894
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:41,442
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

895
01:29:41,526 --> 01:29:43,152
Is that understood?

896
01:29:43,236 --> 01:29:46,364
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

897
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,366
and then there's the test.

898
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:49,826
Test?

899
01:29:50,827 --> 01:29:53,246
Yes.

900
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:56,332
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

901
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,876
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

902
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:02,213
without first having
tested you, did you?

903
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,802
Please.

904
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:23,192
<i>Cleric...</i>

905
01:30:23,234 --> 01:30:25,236
<i>your weapon, please.</i>

906
01:30:29,741 --> 01:30:31,784
Here.

907
01:30:36,748 --> 01:30:37,874
Sit.

908
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,463
We'll start with
a test question first.

909
01:30:43,546 --> 01:30:46,883
More of a riddle, actually.

910
01:30:48,259 --> 01:30:50,386
What would you say
is the easiest way

911
01:30:50,428 --> 01:30:52,680
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

912
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,772
You ask him for it.

913
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,948
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

914
01:31:14,452 --> 01:31:15,745
...to combine the capacity...

915
01:31:17,622 --> 01:31:18,581
Preston...

916
01:31:18,664 --> 01:31:21,125
Brandt's job was simple...

917
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,711
to make you feel
like you'd won,

918
01:31:23,795 --> 01:31:26,923
to make you feel safe.

919
01:31:30,134 --> 01:31:33,679
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

920
01:31:33,763 --> 01:31:35,264
into the Underground...

921
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:38,768
...until it hit me...

922
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:42,563
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

923
01:31:42,647 --> 01:31:45,358
in order to be trusted by them,

924
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:50,822
my provocateur would
have to think like them

925
01:31:50,863 --> 01:31:53,783
and would have to feel
like them.

926
01:31:53,825 --> 01:31:56,786
But where to find
such a man...

927
01:31:56,828 --> 01:32:02,166
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

928
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:07,797
But...

929
01:32:07,839 --> 01:32:09,132
we've never met.

930
01:32:09,173 --> 01:32:11,008
No?

931
01:32:16,055 --> 01:32:18,599
<i>Don't look so surprised,
Preston.</i>

932
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:20,518
Why should Father be more real

933
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:23,062
than any other
political puppet?

934
01:32:23,146 --> 01:32:26,065
The real Father died
years ago.

935
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:28,067
The Council simply elected me

936
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:31,028
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

937
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:33,239
And you, Preston,

938
01:32:33,322 --> 01:32:36,200
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

939
01:32:36,242 --> 01:32:38,119
are now its destroyer,

940
01:32:38,202 --> 01:32:42,957
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

941
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,667
calmly...

942
01:32:44,751 --> 01:32:46,627
cooly...

943
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:51,424
entirely without incident.

944
01:32:55,553 --> 01:32:57,180
No.

945
01:32:58,723 --> 01:32:59,724
Oh...

946
01:33:00,516 --> 01:33:01,684
Shit.

947
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:05,354
Not without incident.

948
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:13,863
I'm coming.

949
01:34:42,827 --> 01:34:44,662
You really should learn
to knock.

950
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:14,609
How did it feel, Preston?

951
01:35:28,206 --> 01:35:30,458
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

952
01:35:32,377 --> 01:35:33,753
Wah!

953
01:35:33,836 --> 01:35:35,505
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

954
01:35:35,546 --> 01:35:37,131
Ugh!

955
01:35:38,341 --> 01:35:39,467
Ugh!

956
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,552
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

957
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,236
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

958
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:06,994
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

959
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,491
Be careful, Preston.

960
01:36:45,575 --> 01:36:47,952
You're treading on my dreams.

961
01:37:22,987 --> 01:37:24,322
Ohh!

962
01:37:24,363 --> 01:37:26,115
Wait!

963
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:27,241
Wait.

964
01:37:27,325 --> 01:37:28,743
Look at me.

965
01:37:28,826 --> 01:37:29,911
Look at me.

966
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:33,706
I'm life.

967
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:37,293
I live, I-I breathe...

968
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:40,838
I feel.

969
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,635
Now that you know it...

970
01:37:45,718 --> 01:37:48,513
can you really take it?

971
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,640
Is it really worth the price?

972
01:37:56,729 --> 01:37:58,481
I pay it gladly.

973
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:20,628
<i>The following items
have been rated EC-10...</i>

974
01:38:20,712 --> 01:38:22,046
