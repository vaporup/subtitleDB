1
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,675
Okay.

2
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,895
Help me. Help me. Let me go.

3
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
Help me.

4
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,070
Well? Did you send it?

5
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,310
Did you send the e-mail?

6
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Pictures.

7
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,165
Yes. I sent them.

8
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,250
I sent them.

9
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,965
We need to keep you high,
Drakie. Understand?

10
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,690
Please nod if you understand.

11
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:23,985
Now, for you to drink,
I need to take off the gag.

12
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,420
Please ... do not scream.

13
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,560
We do not want to hurt you.

14
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,170
And we certainly don't
wanna kill you.

15
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,650
Now we are absolutely prepared to
do either or both of these things ...

16
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,665
if we need to. Do you understand?
- Yes.

17
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,550
Please don't hurt me.

18
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,190
Please, please let me go.

19
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,603
- I have a daughter and she needs me.
- Shh ...

20
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,229
Please...

21
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,315
We know you don't have a daughter.

22
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:56,912
We know everything about you.

23
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,717
Now I'm sure it's
a natural response.

24
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,119
You're trying to reason with us ...
you're just ...

25
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,571
Now you listen to me!

26
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,515
The only people that can get you
out of here are him and me.

27
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,823
We are your only friends.

28
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,990
I owe it to you to do as we say.

29
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:22,145
Now, are you gonna be quiet
and drink from the bottle?

30
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,969
Good.

31
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,298
Whenever you need the bathroom, wait
till we come in and give us this signal.

32
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,197
Try to hold it in,

33
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:49,549
because we won't be changing
your sheets or your clothes.

34
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,192
Do you understand?

35
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,618
Good.

36
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:24,798
- We should keep a clear head!
- Need a drink.

37
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,384
Just one.

38
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,159
Make sure it's not your breath in there.

39
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,501
Make sure she can't smell any on you.

40
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,469
Why?

41
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,743
Because we are not a bunch
of fucking amateurs.

42
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:38,453
Okay. I'll chew some gum after.

43
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,623
You should eat.
Keep your energy up.

44
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:50,610
I'm not hungry.

45
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,502
I do not care. Eat.

46
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,164
- I said eat!
- I don't want to.

47
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:02,926
What?

48
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,249
Eat!

49
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:09,804
Eat it!

50
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,116
I said I'm not hungry.

51
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,464
Fuck! Shit!

52
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,859
That far I told you
I'm not hungry.

53
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:21,992
You haven't eaten for nine hours,
you've been doing physical work ...

54
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,930
and you're still not hungry?
- No. No.

55
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,419
If you are not hungry, it means
that something is not right.

56
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,855
Maybe you're thinking too much.

57
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,693
About whether we have done
everything right,

58
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:36,086
or whether we have made a mistake
on the way that will get us caught?

59
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,190
That can get us 20 years in jail.

60
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,572
Or maybe you think about whether
we had to rough up that girl?

61
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,639
Or perhaps even kill her?

62
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,764
Or worse ...

63
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,553
Maybe you are getting senti-fuckin'-mental.
Now this girl isn't just theoretical?!

64
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,966
Now, you've looked into her eyes.

65
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,084
Maybe you're having second thoughts?!

66
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:02,468
Maybe your conscience is eating
away at your conviction?!

67
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,009
And maybe you are persuading yourself ...

68
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,904
the best thing to do is just go in
there, untie her, and let her go?!

69
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,379
Would you listen to me?

70
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,469
Fuck that !!!

71
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,159
You understand?

72
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:20,050
Look at me.

73
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,440
Look at me!

74
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:23,996
Fuck that !!

75
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,781
We are in this. We are too far
along to get fucking squeamish.

76
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:34,067
Now, any doubts that you
have, are just bullshit.

77
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,131
They are just major bullshit,
and you know it.

78
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,768
You know it. You know you know it.

79
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,625
So you say it.

80
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:46,550
Say what?

81
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,995
Fuck that !!

82
00:14:52,478 --> 00:14:53,910
- Fuck that.
- Again.

83
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,761
Fuck that !

84
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,665
Now don't think.

85
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,511
Eat.

86
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,743
We got a long night ahead.

87
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,910
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

88
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,313
We should check on her
before I leave.

89
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,923
Well?

90
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,660
How come I always have to do
the fucking dogwork?

91
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,144
Because that's your role.

92
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:33,913
Now go and check on her.

93
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,909
Bathroom alert.

94
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,858
Do you need a number one,
or a number two?

95
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:56,827
Show me with your fingers.

96
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,898
Ready?

97
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,268
Done?

98
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,140
- You're going already?
- Yeah.

99
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,271
It's time.

100
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,609
Be careful.

101
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,675
Remember to dump the phone.

102
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:28,966
I'm not stupid.

103
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:30,991
Just reminding.

104
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:39,458
Don't sleep, check on her,
and don't drink.

105
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,084
Sure. Whatever.

106
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:48,764
No ... Not whatever. You just do it.

107
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,534
You keep your head
in the fucking game.

108
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,155
Do you understand?

109
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,946
Yup.

110
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,538
Fuckin' dick.

111
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,546
What happened?

112
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,766
- Did you make the call?
- Yeah.

113
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:33,907
I made it.

114
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,508
So how did it go?

115
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,771
- It went fine.
- So he is going to pay?

116
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,816
- He said yes, but ...
- But what?

117
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,319
There was a click.

118
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,413
The police were there.
They were listening in.

119
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,228
Police?

120
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,699
Ok. We knew this would
happen eventually.

121
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,052
Yeah, but not so fucking soon.

122
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,306
We planned this. That's why
we dumped the phone.

123
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,934
We planned for this, so calm down.

124
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:55,526
So what did he say?

125
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,157
He said he wanted to speak
to his daughter,

126
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,853
and make sure she was still alive.

127
00:20:58,864 --> 00:20:59,542
And?

128
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,561
And I said no. He was just playing for
time so they could trace the call.

129
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,633
Trace? Fuck me!

130
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,496
Calm!

131
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,340
- We're okay.
- But he agreed?

132
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,869
He agreed to the money,
to the timing?

133
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:13,080
Yes. He said he'd get the money
first thing in the morning.

134
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:16,434
No sequential notes,
no traces, no paybonds.

135
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:20,286
Good.

136
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,307
I want to be sure.

137
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,364
We need to make sure he goes to
that bank as soon as it opens,

138
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,114
and gets that money as fast
as he fucking can.

139
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,131
We need you to do something.

140
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:41,026
He is going to untie you.
When he does,

141
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:46,087
you're gonna to sit on the edge of
the bed, and stay very very still.

142
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:47,327
Understand?

143
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:23,847
You are going to look into this
camera, and speak to your father.

144
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,773
Tell him, that he must pay the money.

145
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,393
He must do exactly as we ask,
or we will kill you.

146
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:33,994
You tell him that you have no
doubts that we will kill you.

147
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:35,619
Understand?

148
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,354
Yes.

149
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,773
Good.

150
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:41,584
Take: 1.

151
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:46,996
Daddy ...

152
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,757
I'm okay.

153
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,287
They just took me ...

154
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,851
I was leaving the house,
and they just took me.

155
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,768
I do not know where I am.

156
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:03,601
Stop!

157
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:08,664
I don't want a narrative. I just
want you to look into the camera ...

158
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:12,234
and tell him that unless he pays
the money, we will kill you.

159
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,678
Any deviation from our
instructions, we will kill you.

160
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:19,706
Any piss, we will kill you!

161
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,824
Understand?

162
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:24,398
Yes.

163
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:28,326
No. She is not scared enough.

164
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,258
Give her some motivation.

165
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,276
That's better.

166
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:44,541
Now, get yourself together
and try again.

167
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,796
Daddy ...

168
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:02,889
I love you.

169
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,571
Please ...

170
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:06,694
Pay.

171
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:08,992
Pay them the money.

172
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,702
Just do exactly as they say,
or they will kill me.

173
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:15,826
Daddy, they will kill me
if you don't.

174
00:24:17,384 --> 00:24:19,744
Please, Daddy.

175
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:22,925
Just do exactly as they say, please.

176
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:25,069
Just pay them the money.

177
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:28,894
I want to come home.

178
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,952
Just give them the money, please.

179
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:47,665
Thank you.

180
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,804
No, no, please. I won't cry.

181
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,842
My arms hurt.

182
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,987
Uncuff her.

183
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:05,795
Move them around a bit.

184
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,592
Go on.

185
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:16,537
Better?

186
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:19,252
A little.

187
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:21,076
Tie her up.

188
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,903
Please Daddy.

189
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:34,231
They just pay them the money.
I want to come home.

190
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,570
Just give them the money, please.

191
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:43,811
This is good.

192
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:48,725
This'll work.

193
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,448
- She did well.
- She did.

194
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,635
She was a good choice.

195
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:58,616
She was a good find, then.

196
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,694
Don't fall asleep.

197
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:08,734
These will keep you awake.

198
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,089
Keep an eye on her.

199
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:12,895
She's worth a lot of money to us.

200
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:14,612
I know.

201
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,240
Take care.

202
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:33,994
No.

203
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:36,994
No.

204
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,994
Get this off.

205
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,375
I can't.

206
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,735
I can't go with you watching me.

207
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,695
Could you just leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

208
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:10,672
I can't shit with you
staring at me, just ...

209
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:12,152
Please.

210
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:15,994
I can't do it with you
standing there and looking at me.

211
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,894
Let me go! Let me go!

212
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,926
Give me the fucking keys
and cut the machine!

213
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,892
I'll kill you when I get the keys
from you ... bloody ...

214
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:13,195
It's Danny. It's Danny.

215
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,939
It's me, Danny.

216
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,325
What?

217
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,725
It's me, Alice.

218
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:21,994
- It's me.
- Danny.

219
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:25,776
- What the fuck are you doing.
- Put the gun down.

220
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,941
- The gun Alice, the gun.
- Was it you? Was it you?

221
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:30,928
- There is a plan.
- A plan? Fuck!

222
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:34,137
- Danny - Just put the fucking gun
down before you kill me, Alice.

223
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,566
Just get me the fuck out of here.
Unlock me right fucking now.

224
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,982
Hold on, alright, okay.
Just listen to me first.

225
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,957
- We're getting some money
from your dad. - What?

226
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:43,855
A lot of money.

227
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,330
You always sayin' how much
you hate your dad.

228
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,820
What the fuck are you talking about?

229
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,269
You hate him Alice, he cut you off.

230
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,300
He's got all that fucking money,
and he's never gonna get ...

231
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:55,155
You've always talked about a way
of getting his money off him.

232
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,690
This is it, Alice.

233
00:29:56,816 --> 00:29:58,359
This is how.

234
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:00,270
This is how we can get his money.

235
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,988
But, you've fucking kidnapped me.

236
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:05,122
Yes. I kidnapped you for us.

237
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:07,986
- The money is for us. It's all for us.
- What?

238
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,445
Look, this is a good thing, Alice.

239
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:11,943
Good?

240
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,636
You've fucking kidnapped me.

241
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:19,638
You've fucking stripped me naked, you
made me piss in a fucking bottle ...

242
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:20,843
in front of ... Who?

243
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:23,427
Who the fuck is the other man?
Do I know him too?

244
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,641
No no. It's Victor. It's Vic.

245
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:27,609
He's no one. He's no one.

246
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,280
I met him on the other side ...
He doesn't Know.

247
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:31,006
About what?

248
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:32,107
About us.

249
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:36,015
He thinks you're just a random rich
girl. He hasn't got the whole picture.

250
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:38,822
He thinks all this is his plan.

251
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:43,359
He doesn't suspect that we're
gonna take all the money.

252
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,002
All of it, me and you.

253
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:49,991
You've fucking kidnapped me, so
I can get some of my dad's money.

254
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:52,701
Uh ... Yeah.

255
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:56,514
Then why the fuck
didn't you ask me first?

256
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:59,920
I thought I was gonna fucking die,
here. I was fucking terrified.

257
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,380
I know, I know. I am sorry, right.

258
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:05,318
But it had to look real.
Feel real ... for Vic.

259
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,521
For you.

260
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,006
Look real?

261
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,627
Can't fucking do that
to somebody, Danny.

262
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,177
You can't make them think
they're gonna fucking die.

263
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:15,998
You can't fake it, Alice,

264
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:17,335
not properly.

265
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:20,501
He would have seen if you're
pretending. He would have known.

266
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:24,916
You told me you loved me.

267
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,549
You told me that you loved me.

268
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,125
I do, baby.

269
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:35,144
That's why ... That's why I did this,
because I love you.

270
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,252
I was gonna tell the
truth out ... I was ...

271
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:38,724
What would you have said?

272
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:41,664
Sorry I fucking kidnapped you. Sorry,
I've totally fucking humiliated you.

273
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:43,483
But we will be rich, Alice.

274
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,477
Rich!

275
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,116
How much?

276
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:49,003
How much am I worth?

277
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,525
Two million.

278
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:55,476
And he is gonna pay ...
2 million, cash.

279
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:56,990
Untraceable.

280
00:31:57,925 --> 00:31:59,992
All you have to do
is lie in that bed.

281
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:01,656
Tied down ...

282
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:04,823
humiliated, abused.

283
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,558
It will only be for
another day or so.

284
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,453
Not too much to ask for 2 million?

285
00:32:08,854 --> 00:32:10,873
For a whole new life.

286
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,993
Alice ...

287
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:16,622
I love you, truly.

288
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,063
So, can I have my gun back?

289
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:25,609
Alice, please.

290
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,762
Just do this.

291
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,523
Fuck!

292
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:36,223
It's him. He's back. He's back.

293
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,883
You have to give me the gun.

294
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,359
If I do not answer the door,
he'll kick it in.

295
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,854
If he comes in here
and sees us like this ...

296
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:45,765
he'll go fucking crazy.

297
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,877
He'll fucking kill us both.

298
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,297
You won't escape, Alice.

299
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:52,440
He'll kill ye.

300
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,121
I'm not joking.

301
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:56,525
Don't be stupid.

302
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:57,940
Give me the gun.

303
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:00,237
Please.

304
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,770
Let him fucking hurt me.

305
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,163
I won't.

306
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:21,504
Danny.

307
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:23,904
Promise me.

308
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:25,403
I promise.

309
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:50,533
Where the fuck were you?

310
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:52,422
She's taking a shit.
I had to keep the gun on her.

311
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,750
And you did it by yourself?

312
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,122
It's no problem.
I just watched her.

313
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:57,111
Look at me! Look at me!

314
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:58,431
Is she ok?

315
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,426
Yeah.

316
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:01,188
Go look if you like.

317
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:22,363
Speak to her dad?
Saw the video?

318
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,288
I think he now understands
the gravity of the situation.

319
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:26,560
So when is the exchange?

320
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,173
Tomorrow.

321
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:29,847
- You made the arrangement?
- No.

322
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,823
He don't have time to prepare.

323
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,436
As soon as he gets the money,
then we start it moving.

324
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,481
- So it's all ok?
- Yeah.

325
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:39,219
- This is gonna work?
- Of course it is.

326
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:46,198
You should get some sleep.
We have a busy day tomorrow.

327
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,452
You don't want to?

328
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,364
No. There is too much adrenaline
running through me.

329
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:51,515
You sleep first.

330
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:52,885
You need me to check on her?

331
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,982
I think I can handle it for a while.

332
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:58,454
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

333
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:09,439
Use this!

334
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,910
Thanks.

335
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,247
Sleep tight.

336
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:53,846
Fuck!

337
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,226
What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me up?

338
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,647
I didn't need to fucking
fall asleep, did I?

339
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:00,238
Shit! The girl.

340
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,774
Wake up!

341
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:41,320
Wake up, Ms. Creed.

342
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,373
It's breakfast time.

343
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:06,737
It's minestrone.

344
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,330
It's hot.

345
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:17,889
Oops.

346
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,589
Got it.

347
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:37,523
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

348
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:02,582
What are you doing?

349
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:05,267
Go back to the other side
and keep her in the eye.

350
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:38,254
Finished.

351
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:40,010
Good.

352
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:41,672
Open up!

353
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,549
Give it to me.

354
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,731
Give me the spoon.

355
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:28,836
- What's gone into you?
- Nothing.

356
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,154
I'm fine.

357
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,373
You don't look fine.

358
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,872
Don't start thinking.

359
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,504
I need you focused.

360
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:39,538
I am.

361
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:44,345
Are you sure?

362
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:45,991
Absolutely.

363
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,830
Good. Cause I need you.

364
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,249
I can't do this without you.

365
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,467
You got me.

366
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,863
Good boy.

367
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,877
Where you going?

368
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,246
Take a piss. Is that alright?

369
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,657
You okay in there?

370
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,519
Danny, what's wrong?

371
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,216
Everything is fine.

372
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,251
Are you sure?

373
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:17,552
But ... I'll just be a second.

374
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:19,991
Danny, are you okay in there?

375
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:23,353
Danny?

376
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:24,328
Danny?

377
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,652
Danny!

378
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:28,753
What the fuck
are you doing in there?

379
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:29,774
Nothing.

380
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:33,232
Danny, open this door right now,
or I'll kick it in.

381
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:35,449
Open this fucking door!

382
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,752
Open this fucking door, now!

383
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,808
Right, I'm coming in!

384
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:45,991
- Jesus fuck ... what the fuck ... ?
- Why the fuck don't you open the door?

385
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:48,275
I do not know what you ...

386
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,949
I was worried.

387
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:52,620
I said I would be out in a second.

388
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:56,749
Something wouldn't go down.

389
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,529
You said you just needed to piss.

390
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,113
Thought I did.

391
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:07,989
It's gone now.

392
00:42:08,937 --> 00:42:10,436
Sometimes a jam.

393
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:17,417
What?

394
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:19,739
Doesn't smell of any stink of you.

395
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,919
My shit don't stink.
What can I say?

396
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,838
Jus' wash your hands
and stop fucking about!

397
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:41,968
It's the adrenaline.

398
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:43,771
Suddenly you shit.

399
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,665
Bad taste in your mouth.

400
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:48,949
Because of the  adrenaline.

401
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:51,100
Happened to me when I made
the first call.

402
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:56,321
Just relax, Danny.

403
00:42:57,721 --> 00:42:59,682
We need air.

404
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,800
Not long till the bank opens.

405
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:07,106
And after that ... Showtime.

406
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:09,747
We're gonna be rich. Me and you.

407
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,988
We're gonna be millionaires.

408
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:17,320
We're nearly there, Dan.

409
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,350
We're nearly there.

410
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:22,155
You're all up?

411
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:23,877
I'm good.

412
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:31,116
- Are you sure?
- Why is that?

413
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:35,255
Two days ...

414
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:38,655
we're gonna be on the other side
of the world.

415
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:41,621
Just me and you.

416
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,687
Just me and you.

417
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,987
Away from this shit.
Away from the past.

418
00:43:50,183 --> 00:43:52,378
And we're startin' new lives,

419
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,290
and new people,

420
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,391
being happy.

421
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:04,940
But the first two weeks,
we'll hardly get out a bit.

422
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,231
We'll just order room service,
and fuck each other senseless.

423
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,688
That sounds perfect.

424
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:15,807
Destiny.

425
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,306
Gotta go.

426
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:54,764
I see you soon.

427
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,217
You take care.

428
00:44:58,687 --> 00:44:59,894
You too.

429
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,788
I love you.

430
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:13,749
I love you too, baby.

431
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,662
- Are you alright?
- Where is he?

432
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:58,893
It's gonna happen soon.

433
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:01,103
That fucking bullet case.
I thought he'd seen it.

434
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:03,999
It's Ok. Got rid of it.

435
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:05,330
How long until he comes back?

436
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:06,676
An hour I guess.

437
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:08,730
Maybe less.

438
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:10,572
Untie me.

439
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:14,382
Come on, Danny. Untie me.

440
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,216
He's gone.

441
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,831
Danny?

442
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:40,361
The other one?

443
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:42,907
Danny? What's wrong?

444
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,716
Come on, Danny. Unlock it.

445
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:47,632
- Do you fucking trust me?
- Of course, but ...

446
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,952
But what? I let you gag me,
tie me back up, that ...

447
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:53,725
I fucking trusted you,
so you can fucking trust me.

448
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,990
I do trust you too.

449
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:56,221
But what?

450
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,586
- You think I'm gonna run?
- No, I do not.

451
00:46:58,786 --> 00:47:00,222
Look, place the end right.

452
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:03,696
As soon he comes back,
we're taking it to the exchange ...

453
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:05,141
Are we gonna get the money?

454
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:06,173
Yeah.

455
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:07,992
Why would I run?

456
00:47:13,508 --> 00:47:14,728
I am sorry.

457
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:19,029
I'm just jumpy.

458
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:27,463
This is fucking stressful.

459
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,425
You think?

460
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,363
Thanks.

461
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:46,950
Those things
are very fucking painful.

462
00:47:48,152 --> 00:47:52,015
- Pins and needles in my
fingers and toes. - Yeah

463
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,886
- Better?
- Ok.

464
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:07,463
Danny, what if your friend ...

465
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,388
think ... what if he ...

466
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:13,504
- What if he is onto us? What if
he suspects us? - He doesn't.

467
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:16,938
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- Believe me, he hasn't got a clue.

468
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:18,950
How did you do it?

469
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:22,809
- What? - How did you get him
to agree to pick me for this?

470
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:24,977
You fit his criteria.

471
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:30,788
Attractive ... Female ...
In her 20s, only child.

472
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:35,096
- Slim enough to cat easy.
- Jesus.

473
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:37,420
Vic's been planning this forever.

474
00:48:37,638 --> 00:48:39,941
Old-timer in prison talked about it.

475
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:42,682
I never really thought
he would do it, but ...

476
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,965
When he got out, he contacted me.

477
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:48,571
He set about looking for a target.

478
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:53,828
Of course, then afterward ...

479
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:55,748
So he tested me?

480
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,483
But you did not tell him that we
knew each other from before?

481
00:48:59,656 --> 00:49:00,601
Of course not.

482
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:04,721
Dad's on the rich list.

483
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,873
He said just write your name
in that newspaper article though.

484
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:09,989
I even cut it out and gave it to Vic.

485
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,392
He went for you right away.

486
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,665
He said you were "Perfect".

487
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:20,764
- Where is he now?
- Arranging the exchange.

488
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,634
At the ...?

489
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:24,754
Near the river ... Driving nearby.

490
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:27,199
So he can escape,
and dad can find you.

491
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:28,780
And Vic gets the money.

492
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:31,319
- By himself?
- I stay with you.

493
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,223
But he could just steal it
and disappear.

494
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:34,141
Ah no, he wouldn't.

495
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:35,208
How can you be sure?

496
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:36,929
I just am.

497
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:38,212
Trust me.

498
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:40,307
It's not even considered.

499
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:43,892
And when he's getting the money,
I'll be setting you free.

500
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,559
And once he has money,
I'm going to take it from him,

501
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:50,794
and we meet up,

502
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:53,239
get the fuck out of here.

503
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:54,835
How you take the money?

504
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:57,523
He trusts me.

505
00:49:58,384 --> 00:49:59,395
It will be easy.

506
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:02,797
- He trusts you?
- Completely.

507
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:09,994
- Danny?
- What?

508
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:13,302
I'm scared.

509
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:15,199
- Don't let me ...
- I am sorry.

510
00:50:16,938 --> 00:50:17,999
It's ok.

511
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:20,990
I won't let anything
happen to you.

512
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:22,994
Trust me.

513
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,880
Everything's going to be fine.

514
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:36,680
- Danny?
- What?

515
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:48,084
I love you so much.

516
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,703
I love you too, baby.

517
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:19,151
Alice, this isn't fucking funny.

518
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:20,201
I'm warning you.

519
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,597
What the fuck ...
What the fuck are you doing?

520
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:23,874
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

521
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:25,985
- Alice, you can't do this.
- Fuck you!

522
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:27,361
I was so close.

523
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:30,103
- Close what?
- You fucking kidnapped me, you cunt.

524
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:32,177
You do not expect me to sit
around and just let it happen?

525
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:34,681
- But we had a plan.
- No, you had a plan.

526
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:36,535
This is my plan.

527
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:39,468
Alice, Alice come back!

528
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:55,181
Police ... Quick. I need the police.

529
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:57,264
Why don't you come and get me?
I have been kidnapped.

530
00:52:57,389 --> 00:52:59,994
I havn't got much time.
I don't know where I am.

531
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:02,652
No, I've been locked here.
I can't get out.

532
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,347
No. I don't recognize anything.

533
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:09,551
I'm up high.

534
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:12,994
Can't you trace the call?

535
00:53:13,044 --> 00:53:15,229
Yeah. Ah, thank God.

536
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:16,870
How long will that take?

537
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,483
How long?

538
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:20,709
No, no-no-no.
You have to come get me now.

539
00:53:20,894 --> 00:53:22,841
If the other guy's coming back,
he'll kill me.

540
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,942
He's gonna come back.
He's gonna fucking kill me.

541
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:27,140
You're have to come right now,
right now, right fucking now!

542
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,220
Calm down?
He's gonna fucking kill me.

543
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:38,770
Wait a second ...

544
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,994
I think, I can get the keys.

545
00:54:05,244 --> 00:54:06,230
I love you.

546
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:08,024
I fucking love you.

547
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:09,801
And you love me, I know you do.

548
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,724
- I know you do.
- Where are the keys?

549
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:14,393
Alice, you can't do this.

550
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:16,265
I love you.

551
00:54:16,376 --> 00:54:17,909
No, Danny.

552
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:23,491
When you love someone, you do
everything you can to care for them.

553
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:28,798
What you don't do, is kidnap them.

554
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:30,504
Understand?

555
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:33,194
You don't fucking jump them
in the streets,

556
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,394
and put them in the back of a van.

557
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,224
You don't put a fucking knife
to their throats.

558
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:40,374
The keys!

559
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,530
I swear it to God, Danny.

560
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:49,284
You need to tell me
where the keys are.

561
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:53,241
In my pocket, right-hand pocket.

562
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:01,232
Go back on the bed!

563
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,097
Get back on the fucking bed!

564
00:55:09,037 --> 00:55:11,098
Don't fucking move!

565
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:55,779
The safety was on.

566
00:55:58,027 --> 00:55:59,517
Not anymore.

567
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,337
The keys?

568
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,840
Throw me the fucking keys!

569
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:43,545
Oh, c'mon ... fuck ... c'mon

570
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:50,845
I'm fucked.

571
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:54,106
Fuck!

572
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:05,269
Why didn't you just listen to me?

573
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:08,982
All would have been alright
if you just listened to me.

574
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:10,413
Is everything okay?

575
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:13,554
- Top-notch.
- She still in there?

576
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:15,962
- Where else would she be?
- Yeah ...

577
00:59:16,872 --> 00:59:18,165
Yes of course. It's just ...

578
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,294
It's time ... It's on.

579
00:59:23,422 --> 00:59:24,440
- He's got the money?
- Yeah.

580
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:26,322
He's just waiting at the location.

581
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:28,949
This is really quite a fucking work.

582
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:33,236
Right. We have to move her outta
there and put her in the warehouse.

583
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,615
- When do we leave?
- Now!

584
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,155
We move now.

585
00:59:45,766 --> 00:59:46,855
This is it.

586
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:50,504
We're gonna have to move you now.
Understand?

587
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:53,316
Nod if you understand.

588
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,549
Hey! Wake up!

589
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:02,972
She's air-cold.

590
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,732
What the fuck did you do?

591
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,020
Nothing. I thought she was sleeping.

592
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,835
Fuck! Must be the gag that's
complicated her throat.

593
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:09,243
Is she alright?

594
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:11,658
Wait here.

595
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:28,067
Thank God.

596
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,770
I thought we had killed her.

597
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,988
Wake up, Miss Creed.

598
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,310
Wake up.

599
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,496
Say something.

600
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,089
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Are you okay? Say something.

601
01:00:38,398 --> 01:00:39,723
You need to calm down.

602
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:41,208
She's alright.

603
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:43,371
Everything is fine.

604
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:47,073
She's got a minute to breathe.

605
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:51,854
Come on. Let's just have
a minute together,

606
01:00:52,031 --> 01:00:53,226
to re-focus.

607
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,747
Come on.

608
01:00:58,369 --> 01:00:59,343
Look at me.

609
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:01,699
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

610
01:01:03,334 --> 01:01:04,783
Shit. Fuck.

611
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,616
Will you do something for me?

612
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:12,990
What?

613
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:16,388
Tell me what to do.

614
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:19,278
I need you to stop worrying.

615
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,628
And just be back.

616
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,397
Makes confident.
That pushes me on ... to be mean.

617
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:25,220
Me?

618
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:27,775
Meanest fuck.

619
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:30,526
That's the back I want.

620
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:32,638
That's the guy they want.

621
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:34,906
So c'mon,

622
01:01:35,161 --> 01:01:36,592
push me right.

623
01:01:36,924 --> 01:01:38,453
Tell me what to do.

624
01:01:41,373 --> 01:01:43,544
Stand the fuck up.

625
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,505
Go, put on your coat.

626
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:02,915
I can't put the van into position.

627
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:06,084
The van?

628
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,679
- Now?
- Yes, fucking now!

629
01:02:08,763 --> 01:02:10,947
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna pack the bag.

630
01:02:11,092 --> 01:02:13,430
- But don't unpack ...
- Just fucking do it!

631
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:14,905
Now!

632
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:16,820
Go on!

633
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:30,985
No ... Please.

634
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,304
No, wait. Please wait.
Wait a second.

635
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:39,884
What the fuck?

636
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,184
How did you get this?

637
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:42,868
How the fuck did you get this?

638
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:45,554
Quietly.

639
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:47,081
Tell me how you got it.

640
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:48,542
Tell me!

641
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:49,715
I don't know.

642
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:51,336
How did you fucking get it?

643
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,540
I don't know.

644
01:02:52,677 --> 01:02:54,448
Please let ... I don't want
to cause any trouble.

645
01:02:54,588 --> 01:02:56,499
I just wanna do exactly as you say.

646
01:02:56,626 --> 01:02:57,650
999.

647
01:02:58,354 --> 01:02:59,544
Police.

648
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:01,589
Did you call the police?

649
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:04,972
- The fucking police ... did you call
the police? - I don't know, I just ...

650
01:03:05,106 --> 01:03:06,634
Tell me the truth.

651
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,276
How could I? I've been up
tied up since I got here.

652
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:11,913
Then how did you
get that fucking phone?

653
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:13,420
- Don't know.
- Tell me the truth.

654
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:14,521
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

655
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:16,200
I don't know it. Don't know.

656
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:18,600
Please don't.

657
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,518
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

658
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:23,447
Tell me! Tell me!
Fucking tell me!

659
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:25,669
Please stop it! No!

660
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:29,668
Danny, help me. Danny.
Danny !!!

661
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:31,853
Danny?!

662
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,383
How do you know that name.

663
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:36,987
Help me, please, Danny.

664
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:39,069
How did you know his name.

665
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:41,097
Do you know him?

666
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,695
No, I ...

667
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:44,328
He just told me his name.

668
01:03:44,476 --> 01:03:46,566
- He gave you the phone.
- No.

669
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:48,246
You phoned?

670
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:49,934
And you throw it down?

671
01:03:52,189 --> 01:03:53,298
What else is there?

672
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:58,150
- I don't know. Please. Please ...
- Fuck!

673
01:04:00,438 --> 01:04:01,331
Fuck!

674
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:03,697
Please, please just take me home.

675
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,134
Shut up!

676
01:04:28,937 --> 01:04:31,567
- What happened here?
- Nothing.

677
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:33,217
Just take me home, please.

678
01:04:33,363 --> 01:04:34,227
Please.

679
01:04:34,928 --> 01:04:36,382
- This is a bullet.
- I don't know.

680
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:37,317
I don't know.

681
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:38,953
Who fired the gun?

682
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:42,994
Who fired the gun?!

683
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:47,412
Please just take me home.
I don't ... I've done nothing!

684
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:49,903
You tell me, or I swear to God ...

685
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,574
you'll never see your family again.

686
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:55,504
Tell me!

687
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:00,608
I fired.

688
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:06,574
I needed the toilet.

689
01:05:06,893 --> 01:05:08,977
He turned his back,

690
01:05:09,728 --> 01:05:11,620
I hit him, and took his gun.

691
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:13,582
Well, if you got the gun,

692
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,485
then why you still here?

693
01:05:16,628 --> 01:05:20,515
Because ... Because he's
gonna fuck you.

694
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:23,031
He's gonna take the money.

695
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:24,560
The whole two million.

696
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:27,704
I am still here because he
made a deal with me.

697
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:30,073
He said if I went along
with the Plan ...

698
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:31,114
he would ...

699
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,354
He would give you
some of the money.

700
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:38,672
It all went so quickly, and ...

701
01:05:38,808 --> 01:05:40,316
you were coming back.

702
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,275
I couldn't get away, so ...

703
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:43,901
I agreed.

704
01:05:46,703 --> 01:05:47,986
I am sorry.

705
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,678
But now you know.

706
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:55,991
You can ...

707
01:05:57,094 --> 01:05:58,989
You can go along with the plan.

708
01:05:59,898 --> 01:06:01,991
You can just pick up the money ...

709
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,394
and you can disappear.

710
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:07,391
He can fuck him instead, right?

711
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:10,669
You can take the money, all of it.

712
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:15,030
Fuck him, right?

713
01:06:15,594 --> 01:06:19,662
You can just take me back
to my father.

714
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:23,607
You can take me back to my family.

715
01:06:23,874 --> 01:06:26,585
All I want is to go back to my home.

716
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:31,885
Please, please, please ...

717
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,124
What is my name?

718
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,641
What?

719
01:06:41,092 --> 01:06:43,774
I ... I don't know.

720
01:06:44,656 --> 01:06:45,952
I don't know your name.

721
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:47,400
Yes, you do.

722
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,878
He told you.

723
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:55,611
Tell me now, please.

724
01:06:56,535 --> 01:06:58,534
He didn't tell me your name.

725
01:07:00,857 --> 01:07:01,413
Please.

726
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:02,772
You're lying.

727
01:07:02,913 --> 01:07:04,596
Please. I just want to go home.

728
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:07,393
- I can see you're lying ...
- I just wanna to go home. I ...

729
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:01,292
What's wrong?

730
01:08:01,433 --> 01:08:03,552
Why would anything be wrong?

731
01:08:06,598 --> 01:08:07,469
You just seem a bit ...

732
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:08,781
A bit what?

733
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:11,035
Shall we go, get her up?

734
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:13,510
I already did it.

735
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:15,317
I was just in there.

736
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:16,815
You were?

737
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,906
Is she alright?

738
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:36,474
Vic, is she alright?

739
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:54,370
I'm going for a piss.

740
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:58,868
Wait here.

741
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,130
Danny, tell me something?

742
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,422
Why did you choose her?

743
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,826
I didn't choose her.

744
01:09:37,532 --> 01:09:38,506
You choose her?

745
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:40,156
Yes, but you suggested her.

746
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,533
Why?

747
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:45,128
You know why?

748
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:47,408
I read about her in the newspaper.

749
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,429
What's this all about, Vic?

750
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:52,149
Jus' ... Something doesn't
feel quite right.

751
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:53,481
What d'you mean?

752
01:09:53,619 --> 01:09:55,028
Just now ...

753
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:57,768
she was acting funny.

754
01:09:58,136 --> 01:10:00,072
Why? What did she say?

755
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:01,612
Say?

756
01:10:04,754 --> 01:10:06,930
Why would you think
she'd say anything?

757
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:09,409
I don't ... Ah ...

758
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:13,243
- You said she was acting funny.
- Yeah.

759
01:10:13,363 --> 01:10:15,540
I didn't say she said anything.

760
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:17,352
What could she say?

761
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,820
What do you think she would say?

762
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,728
Come here.

763
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,759
I said, come here!

764
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:52,342
- Tell me you love me.
- What?

765
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:54,319
Tell me ...

766
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:56,441
you love me.

767
01:10:58,027 --> 01:10:59,919
I love you, babe.

768
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:02,983
Truly.

769
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:07,685
Let's get this thing done!

770
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:06,183
Wait here.

771
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,254
What happened to her face?

772
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:12,220
I told you.

773
01:14:12,363 --> 01:14:13,815
She was acting funny.

774
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,813
So I had to give her a slap.

775
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,901
Bryce, give me your set-keys.

776
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:27,214
You got your own set,
why do you want mine?

777
01:14:27,314 --> 01:14:30,129
Because you don't need
them anymore, do you?

778
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:32,718
Why? Is there a problem?

779
01:14:32,866 --> 01:14:33,785
No problem.

780
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,860
Then give them to me.

781
01:14:49,227 --> 01:14:51,884
Bryce, let's go.

782
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:53,418
To where?

783
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,079
Let's go and get the money.

784
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:56,485
Both of us?

785
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:57,913
The plan was I would stay here.

786
01:14:58,042 --> 01:14:59,720
- Plan has changed.
- Changed?

787
01:14:59,855 --> 01:15:01,483
I need you to meet.

788
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:02,761
In case there's any surprises.

789
01:15:02,904 --> 01:15:05,381
- Like what? - If I knew that, they
won't be surprises, would they?

790
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,307
But what if something happens?

791
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:08,528
What if we don't make it back?

792
01:15:08,728 --> 01:15:10,798
- We'll make it.
- But if we ... ?

793
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:13,514
If we don't, she'll be stuck here.

794
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,903
- She'll die.
- So?

795
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:17,391
If we don't make it,

796
01:15:17,637 --> 01:15:19,554
why do you care
if she don't make it?

797
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:24,957
I don't care.

798
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:26,789
Good.

799
01:15:26,846 --> 01:15:28,956
Now, let's get the fuck
out of here!

800
01:16:18,269 --> 01:16:20,701
- You think it's there?
- Yeah.

801
01:16:21,383 --> 01:16:22,642
It's there.

802
01:16:22,842 --> 01:16:24,662
Go out and get it!

803
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,806
Me?

804
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:26,865
Danny,

805
01:16:27,059 --> 01:16:28,987
just go and get the fucking money!

806
01:16:31,824 --> 01:16:32,978
Now!

807
01:17:38,526 --> 01:17:39,989
There's no fucking money.

808
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,149
They fucked us over.

809
01:17:42,978 --> 01:17:45,841
- We're fucked up.
- No, they didn't fuck up.

810
01:17:46,488 --> 01:17:50,208
The money is not here because
I didn't say it was at this location.

811
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,203
The hole ...

812
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:59,910
- This hole is for the money.
- No.

813
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:04,285
Now, this hole is for you, Danny.

814
01:18:05,234 --> 01:18:06,485
I didn't fuck up.

815
01:18:06,673 --> 01:18:07,988
You did.

816
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,391
Please.

817
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,197
Don't do this.

818
01:18:20,557 --> 01:18:22,484
What did you tell her about me?

819
01:18:22,994 --> 01:18:24,101
Nothing.

820
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:25,990
You told her my name.

821
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:31,375
Only your first name.

822
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:35,970
- Only that we met in prison, that it,
that's all. - You fucking dealed.

823
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:38,875
You killed her, Danny.

824
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:41,754
You've not only killed yourself,

825
01:18:42,654 --> 01:18:44,397
but you've killed her too.

826
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,092
You do not have to do this.

827
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:49,801
We can just finish this,

828
01:18:49,945 --> 01:18:51,733
like we planned.

829
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,927
We'll go away.

830
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:57,496
We'll be happy.

831
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,964
I'll do everything you want me to.

832
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:02,666
It'll just be you.

833
01:19:03,787 --> 01:19:05,405
That's what we wanted.

834
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,927
I love you.

835
01:19:08,525 --> 01:19:10,508
Close your eyes.

836
01:19:10,655 --> 01:19:11,299
Danny,

837
01:19:11,424 --> 01:19:12,874
close your eyes.

838
01:19:13,352 --> 01:19:15,311
Do you remember when we met?

839
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:17,815
Can you remember?

840
01:19:18,939 --> 01:19:21,448
We slept in the cell.

841
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:23,850
I was scared.

842
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:27,149
I was so fucking scared.

843
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:29,461
You protected me.

844
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:32,238
You ... helped me.

845
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:35,359
I will never forget that.

846
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:38,394
I will never ...

847
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:36,597
It's almost over.

848
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:40,759
Please be still Miss Creed.

849
01:23:41,944 --> 01:23:44,408
It'll all be over very quickly.

850
01:23:44,765 --> 01:23:46,719
You will feel no pain.

851
01:23:58,503 --> 01:23:59,753
Danny.

852
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,865
Danny, you're bleeding.

853
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:06,975
I can get you to a hospital.

854
01:24:08,116 --> 01:24:09,751
I'll get you fixed up.

855
01:24:16,993 --> 01:24:18,652
You'll die, Danny.

856
01:24:20,254 --> 01:24:21,236
Listen!

857
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,453
You'll die.

858
01:24:25,713 --> 01:24:27,322
Let me help you.

859
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:28,543
Danny ...

860
01:24:30,894 --> 01:24:32,415
Let me protect you.

861
01:24:32,556 --> 01:24:35,890
- Stand against the fucking wall!
- Ok.

862
01:24:36,832 --> 01:24:38,450
Whatever you want.

863
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:40,353
Danny!

864
01:24:53,132 --> 01:24:54,099
Ah, Danny ...

865
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:56,899
Get me off here.

866
01:25:00,456 --> 01:25:01,625
Keys?

867
01:25:02,237 --> 01:25:03,442
Toss the keys.

868
01:25:03,585 --> 01:25:04,794
Danny,

869
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:06,690
don't do this, please.

870
01:25:06,829 --> 01:25:08,413
Give me the fucking keys!

871
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:16,943
Danny, you love me.

872
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,848
I know you do.

873
01:25:18,985 --> 01:25:19,986
Shut up!

874
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,325
I felt him.

875
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:25,808
When you held me ...

876
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,813
and you kissed me ...
- Shut the fuck up.

877
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:36,298
When you made love me,

878
01:25:36,786 --> 01:25:38,438
there was no fucking doubt.

879
01:25:40,613 --> 01:25:41,988
You love me.

880
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,305
You love me.

881
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:49,976
You give me the gun,
and I'll get you fixed up.

882
01:25:56,047 --> 01:25:57,464
Give me the gun.

883
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,800
Danny, don't give him the gun.

884
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,085
It's Ok my little Danny-boy.

885
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,065
No ...

886
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:06,830
Don't give him the gun.

887
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:07,800
It's Ok.

888
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,540
Get me out of here. Don't, don't ...

889
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,825
Don't cry.

890
01:26:14,275 --> 01:26:17,150
Don't, don't ...
don't give him the gun.

891
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,280
- Danny, don't listen to him.
- What I'm gonna do ... Danny!

892
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,780
Danny!

893
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:03,340
Danny ... thank fuck, Danny, just ...

894
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:06,715
Please, just ... get me out of here.

895
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:13,910
Danny ...  Danny ... Danny ...

896
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,990
Come on.

897
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,950
- Shoulda listened.
- No.

898
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,900
It's alright, babe.

899
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,400
Danny, don't you fucking
leave me here, please!

900
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:31,500
Don't you fucking walk away!

901
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,970
Danny, don't you fucking leave!

902
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,355
No, Danny. Come back!

903
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,220
Danny! Don't you fucking
leave me here!

904
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:41,450
Don't leave me here!

905
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,535
Danny, come back.
Please come back.

906
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:52,135
Danny, please ...

907
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:32,225
Ah, fuck. Give me the keys.

908
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:42,840
Come on, Vic. Come on. Come on.
Give me the keys. Gimme ...

909
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:59,820
Come on. Give me the keys.
Don't... please ...
