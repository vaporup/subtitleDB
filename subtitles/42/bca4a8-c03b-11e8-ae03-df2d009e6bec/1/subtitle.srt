1
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,780
Having been misunderstood by her lover,
Cho Yi Hang,

2
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,743
Lien Ni Chang went on a killing rampage
and slaughtered everyone in Wu Tang.

3
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,286
She broke up with Cho Yi Hang.

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,372
Her hair turned white overnight
and she vanished from the land.

5
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,127
Cho Yi Hang heard about
a majestic flower in Mount Shin Fung.

6
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,796
lf he could pick the flower when it
blossoms and give it to Ni Chang,

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,968
her hair will return to its original
color and her evil ways will cease.

8
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,762
Cho Yi Hang guarded the flower
on Mount Shin Fung

9
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,890
and vowed to remain until it blossomed,
in hopes of reuniting with his beloved.

10
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,367
Ni Chang, as soon as
the majestic flower blossoms,

11
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:00,328
l will come for you.

00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,294

So many are dead already,
don't push me any further!

24
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,986
Save your breath! Let's kill the witch
to avenge our ancestors' death!

25
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:17,781
lf you insist,

26
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,867
l will kill every single descendant
of Chung Yuan's Eight Clans.

27
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,395
Students of Wah Shang Clan,
burn your incense.

28
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,194
Students of Ching Shing Clan,
burn your incense.

29
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,867
Student of Wu Tang,
burn your incense.

30
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,608
lf we don't kill
this white hair witch,

31
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,444
tombstones of the Eight Clans
will soon pile up to the roof!

32
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,613
So, we must unite the descendants
of the Eight Clans

33
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,449
to destroy the evil witch!

34
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:49,122
My elders, l would like to know what
really happened on that fateful day.

35
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,040
How dare you ask!

36
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,291
He should know what happened.

37
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,295
That day, rivers of blood and bodies
of the Eight Clans were everywhere.

38
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,463
When l woke up,

39
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:00,550
l saw Cho Yi Hang let that murderer,
the white hair witch go!

40
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,634
Then why didn't we bring Uncle Cho back
and ask him what happened?

41
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:06,848
- Don't you mention that coward!
- Don't mention the coward's name again!

42
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,142
l feel that at a time like this,

43
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:12,771
when there are so many
more important things to tend to,

44
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,189
why must we dwell
on past hatred?

45
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,149
Fung Chun Kit!
We must avenge our ancestors' deaths.

46
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,278
lf we don't kill the witch, the next
tombstone may have your name on it!

47
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,654
Knock on wood,
knock on wood.

48
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,076
Master Lui,
aren't you overstating just a bit?

49
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:31,038
Kit's wedding is coming up soon.
Please don't say such unlucky words.

50
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,791
l just worry that Wu Tang
may have no descendants left!

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,377
That's simple enough.
Marry him off.

52
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,673
When he has babies,
Wu Tang will have descendants.

53
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:40,964
Apologize.

54
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,132
Yes.

55
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,012
l'm sorry l misspoke.
My elders, please forgive me.

56
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,523
Thank you,
masters.

57
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,733
l'm delighted to
see you get married.

58
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,985
l'm sure your ancestors
would have been happy for you.

59
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,821
lt would have been even better
if Uncle Cho were here.

60
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:17,168
During the old days,
we would have thrown you a big wedding.

61
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:18,545
But now..

62
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,379
We just have to make do.
lt is unfortunate.

63
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,257
l appreciate the love
and concern all the masters

64
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,009
and my brothers have shown me.

65
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,343
l am very content.

66
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:29,680
Kit,
we brothers have something for you.

67
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,267
A jade lyre!

68
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,228
That's right!
Your wife's name is Lyre.

69
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,589
Bridegroom,
you want to take the bride so soon?

70
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,716
No way.

71
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,721
Hey girls, it's his big day,
give him a break!

72
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,057
Good luck!
Good luck!

73
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,100
Lucky money, lucky money!
Catch!

74
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:17,728
Hey, this little brother's
kung fu isn't bad.

75
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:19,564
Don't mention it.

76
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,942
But we're here to tease the bridegroom,
not the best man!

77
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,987
Doesn't matter.
As long as were all having fun.

78
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,449
- Just enjoy yourselves.
- Yes, you're right!

79
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,290
Cover your eyes!
Lyre is your beloved. Be good to her.

80
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,990
The party's in full swing.

81
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,869
You think the white hair witch
will come to give her blessings too?

82
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,673
What a bad omen.
String snaps, owner dies!

83
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,591
Go wash your mouth with soap!

84
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,309
Meng,
you watch the main hall.

85
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,186
Yes.

86
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,187
Tak, you watch over the other side.
Better safe than sorry.

87
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,190
Don't worry, Kit.
We'll take care of you.

88
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:44,982
Right.

89
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,027
Yes, don't worry.
This is your wedding night.

90
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,446
l bet Lyre's hair is turning white
upstairs waiting for you.

91
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,157
Shut your big mouth.
Do you have to mention white hair?

92
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,365
So,
you said it too!

93
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:54,993
Kit.

94
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:57,912
Sister-in-law.

95
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,456
Don't worry.
l'll be right there.

96
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,333
Don't worry.
l'll be right there too!

97
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,793
Don't talk to your sister-in-law
that way!

98
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,214
Tonight is your wedding night.

99
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,341
l'm sure the white hair witch
won't spoil this special night.

100
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:13,219
Yes, but we better be extra careful.
You know..

101
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,014
Yes, we know..go!
Wait!

102
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,477
lf you have any questions about
what to do on your wedding night,

103
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,687
just ask me.

104
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,813
l am an expert
when it comes to making babies.

105
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,741
Finally some peace and quiet.

106
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,534
How did you know
there's a secret passage here?

107
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,370
This is for taking out the garbage,
didn't you know?

108
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,205
That's right.

109
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,231
Are you happy?

110
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,609
Yes. Are you?

111
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:10,735
Yes.

112
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,240
lt's too bad

113
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,408
What?

114
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,246
lt's too bad that my master, uncles
and brothers have all passed away.

115
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,208
l wish they were at my wedding!

116
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,711
l heard you still have an uncle.

117
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,923
His name is Cho Yi Hang.

118
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,966
But no one knows
where he is now.

119
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,763
l don't even dare mention his name
in front of the elders.

120
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:39,722
Why?

121
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,933
Just mentioning his name
gets them angry.

122
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,437
They said he shamed Wu Tang
and the Eight Big Clans too!

123
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,857
Are we going to chat till dawn?

124
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,230
l just want to know the truth
about this whole thing.

125
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,484
Have you ever met
your Uncle Cho?

126
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,571
No, but l've heard that
because of the white hair witch,

127
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,032
he's gone mad.
No one recognizes him anymore.

128
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,658
He sounded like a real romantic.

129
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,828
But was it worth it
for a cold-blooded murderer?

130
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,663
l don't know.

131
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,754
l only know that if
l can't be with you

132
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,008
l would be like my Uncle Cho.
l'll go crazy for love.

133
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,125
What if l become as horrible as
the white hair witch?

134
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,125
Don't be silly.

135
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,461
You're from an orthodox clan.
She was from an evil clan.

136
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,172
How could she even
compare with you?

137
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,884
Uncle Cho was bewitched by her
evil spell. That won't happen to me.

138
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,929
What if l really turned into someone
like her? Will you still love me?

139
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,433
Then l will have to sacrifice our love
and personally slay this ghastly witch!

140
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,768
Don't come out!

141
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,607
Lieu!

142
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,109
Meng!

143
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,818
Tak!

144
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,885
You're the last descendant of Wu Tang,
aren't you?

145
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,889
l won't let you die so soon.

146
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,061
Kit!

147
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,193
Lyre!

148
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:29,744
Kit!

149
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,250
Why do you have to
destroy our clan?

150
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:46,510
Kit, are you all right? Kit!
Kit, don't scare me!

151
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,389
Does your heart hurt?

152
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,934
Go ahead, kill me.
l am not afraid of you.

153
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,895
You are willing to sacrifice
your own life for this man?

154
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,898
Yes!

155
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,331
Why are you so foolish?
Why do you suffer for such a bastard?

156
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,000
Because l love him,
forever love him.

157
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,503
All right.

158
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,630
Then l'll beat you to your senses so you
won't trust those heartless bastards!

159
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,345
Lyre!

160
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,769
You are tough.
We'll see how much of this you can take!

161
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,356
l'll just go over
to kill him now,

162
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,025
so the two of you will never
be together, even in death!

163
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,241
Lyre!

164
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,537
l want you to watch him die
with your own eyes!

165
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,609
Kit!

166
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,306
You white hair witch!
l'm going to kill you!

167
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,812
Damn!

168
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,773
Fung Chun Kit.

169
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,903
Hey, wasn't today your wedding day?
How did you get beaten up so badly?

170
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,169
l want you to know that
there is not one single good man alive!

171
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,628
l want you to personally kill
Fung Chun Kit.

172
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,516
l'm not afraid of you!

173
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,684
Yan,
give her the sword.

174
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,000
Sister, don't be like that.
Leave her to me.

175
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,510
Your hand is injured.

176
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,724
l won't hurt you.

177
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,144
Take a look at me
and you'd know l don't know kung fu.

178
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,480
Come on.

179
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,278
My name is Chen Yuen Yuen.
What is your name?

180
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,029
Lyre.

181
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,867
Lyre. What a beautiful name.
Befitting to such a beautiful girl.

182
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,622
Welcome to our big family.

183
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,106
Don't go.
l beg you. Please don't go.

184
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,819
Good and evil can never stand together.
There's no future for the both of us.

185
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,029
- Don't follow me. Go!
- Don't leave us,

186
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,198
don't leave your
daughter and me!

187
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,799
You be good and
practice your kung fu.

188
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,385
When you grow up, you can help me
kill all the bastards from Chung Yuan.

189
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,721
Then l'll love you.

190
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,972
Little brother,
not only do you want to love her,

191
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,974
you want to make love to her!

192
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,519
Too bad!
You'll have to wait at least 10 years.

193
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:17,592
Sister,
are you thinking sad thoughts again?

194
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,638
l know what you're
thinking about.

195
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,349
You're thinking about
those heartless bastards.

196
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,270
Yuen Yuen, you are luckier than me.
Only Wu San Kuei let you down.

197
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,733
But me, l was betrayed by my father,
Kei Wu Shang,

198
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,945
and worst of all,
that heartless Cho Yi Hang.

199
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:45,869
From now on, if we two stick together,
no one will ever hurt us again.

200
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,791
Men.
l see one, l kill one.

201
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,003
You should consider
yourself lucky.

202
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,257
Even though your wedding night
was ruined, at least you're still alive.

203
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,480
Lyre,
where are you?

204
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,067
l'm not your Lyre. l am Ling Moon Yee
from the Kwan Lun Clan.

205
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,570
You always call me a tomboy,
remember?

206
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,094
Wu San Kuei, you've betrayed yourself
and your country.

207
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,846
How can you say you
did it all for me!

208
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,474
Yuen Yuen,
don't leave me.

209
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,771
lf you would just change your mind,
l'll do anything you want.

210
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,106
You have done plenty
for me already.

211
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,444
You let in the Ching troops. You've
made me a traitor, a sinner in history.

212
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,780
How am l able to
face the world now?

213
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,261
l don't like this tune.
Play another one.

214
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,353
This one is no good either.
Play another one.

215
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:35,480
Laugh!

216
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,232
What are you trying to pull?
Play it yourself!

217
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,864
l was a geisha half my life.

218
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,286
l had to please you men every night
and l never complained.

219
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,582
You've only played one tune
and you're griping already.

220
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,667
Men can be killed
but not insulted!

221
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,670
Scholars like us
cannot be toyed with!

222
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,057
By that, do you mean women
can be toyed with and insulted then?

223
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,518
No. No.

224
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,438
Keep playing!

225
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:16,705
Lyre!

226
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:25,839
Lyre.

227
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,092
How are you doing?

228
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,594
l will avenge for you.

229
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,471
You're badly hurt.
How can you go anywhere?

230
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,182
You witch!
l'm going to kill you!

231
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,978
Take a look at yourself.
You can't even kill a cockroach.

232
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,730
How can you fight anyone?

233
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,775
Now lay down.
You're going to pass out.

234
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,820
lf you don't watch it,
you're going to pass out soon.

235
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,531
See!
l told you already.

236
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,037
The world may be big,
but paradise is right here.

237
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,457
A bride shouldn't be so filthy.

238
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,711
Let me help you clean up.

239
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,593
Why are you crying?

240
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,846
l miss my husband,
Kit.

241
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,641
Tears for love again.
You think he misses you too?

242
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,852
The more affectionate the man,
the more callous he becomes.

243
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,936
His love for you
will vanish overnight.

244
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,529
l was also hopeless
and in despair once.

245
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,826
But then l realized that,
without a man's love, l can still live.

246
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:46,462
Don't cry anymore. Cheer up.
Don't shed anymore tears for men.

247
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,019
Damn!

248
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,525
What are you doing?

249
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,734
Leave me alone.

250
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,278
Where are you going?

251
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,403
Get out of my way!

252
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,864
l want to kill that witch!

253
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,284
You want to kill the white hair witch?
With what?

254
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,952
Your kung fu is the worst amongst
the descendants of the Eight Big Clans!

255
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,871
Come back!

256
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,000
Moon, l really appreciate your saving
my life. But l must find Lyre.

257
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,544
l don't even know
if she's dead or alive!

258
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,047
You think you're the only one
who holds a grudge?

259
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,882
Everybody in Chung Yuan
wants to destroy her!

260
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,925
How are you going to kill her
if you're hurt like this?

261
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,229
Shit!
Almost got myself hurt too!

262
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:50,026
This witch is determined
to destroy the Eight Big Clans.

263
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,654
Now she has even kidnapped Kit's wife.
We don't know if she's even alive.

264
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:54,823
As soon as Kit recovers,

265
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,534
we'll gather all the descendants of
the clans and attack the witch's palace!

266
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,243
To redeem ourselves
and the reputation of the Eight Clans,

267
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,577
the white hair witch
must be destroyed!

268
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:08,836
But l'm afraid the descendants' kung fu
may not be good enough to kill her.

269
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,755
What, do you think
you and l should go instead?

270
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,424
l think we should turn this over
to old Granny of Au Mei Clan.

271
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,801
She would be best
to handle this.

272
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,722
Good idea!
lt's decided then.

273
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,778
You are the representatives
of the Eight Clans?

274
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,074
l am Ling Moon Yee
of Kwun Lun Clan.

275
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,951
l am Fung Chun Kit of Wu Tang.

276
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,786
l am Siu Lau of Wah Shan.

277
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,579
Lan Long of Shaolin.

278
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,874
- Yu Hin of Tim Chong.
- Tun Chai.

279
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,667
Liu Hang of Hung Tung.

280
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,547
You thought l was dead already.

281
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,217
Liu!

282
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,301
Kit!

283
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,432
l will help you
attack the evil palace

284
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,976
and cut the white hair witch
into a million pieces.

285
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,979
Don't be ridiculous.
Everyone is not here yet.

286
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,663
Yee of Ching Sing Clan.

287
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:26,955
How are you?

288
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,709
Your kung fu is more befitting
to join the Peking opera

289
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,002
than to kill the
white hair witch!

290
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:38,884
The world is so big.
Fate has brought us together.

291
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,054
Let's just try to get along.

292
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,596
Amen.

293
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,557
Watch out!
Someone is coming.

294
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,647
lt's the white hair witch!

295
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,023
You're dead meat!

296
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,366
lt's old Granny
from Ngo Mei Clan!

297
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,299
You blockheads!
Were you trying to knock out my teeth?

298
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:20,384
Damn!

299
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,806
Granny!

300
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,641
Granny,
are you all right?

301
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,184
Sorry,
l thought you were the white hair witch.

302
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,688
Just because l have white hair?

303
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:39,903
Moon, don't run around so much.
Go home some time.

304
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:45,285
And don't dress like
a boy all the time.

305
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,914
l am Yip Pak Chow
of Ngo Mei Clan.

306
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:51,790
Granny.

307
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,045
Ngo Mei does not
have any young pupils.

308
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,380
Therefore,
they have sent an old Granny like me.

309
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,590
lt's getting from bad to worse.

310
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,220
The white hair witch's base
is inside the Moon Lake.

311
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,556
Let me show you.

312
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,602
Judging from your kung fu,

313
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:14,021
there is no way you can fight
the white hair witch head on.

314
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,647
You must get in and out
as quickly as possible.

315
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,234
As soon as Lyre is rescued, take off
immediately using the four passage ways.

316
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,653
Do you all know
the Flying Stance?

317
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:22,446
Yes.

318
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,782
Does Air Stance count?

319
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,454
Get someone to
carry you over then.

320
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,375
Her evil palace
is heavily guarded on all sides.

321
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,669
But the west entrance
is the easiest to sneak through.

322
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,546
Oh no,
l've made a mistake.

323
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,473
This is called
the Virgin Stance.

324
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:55,563
Rebels!

325
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,442
You're gathering without the permission
of the Ching Palace.

326
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:00,902
Do you know that
this is punishable by death?

327
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,445
Hand over all your weapons now!

328
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,702
You rebels!

329
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:13,123
Tell me the purpose of this gathering
and you may be pardoned from death.

330
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,046
What?
Nobody wants to say anything?

331
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,589
Then my only option is to
follow General Wu San Kuei's words...

332
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,426
lt's better to kill a thousand innocent
men than to set a guilty one free.

333
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,304
Hey, big nose! Whats in your mouth?
Spit it out!

334
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,583
Oh God, l didn't want to kill you.
You made me. Amen.

335
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,547
You youngsters are too selfish,
didn't even leave one for me.

336
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:04,548
There's one left!

337
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,313
Guess which one is faster.
Your arrow or my dart?

338
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,788
ln a moment like this,
people should die glamorously.

339
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,750
No. Not glamorously.
lt's gloriously!

340
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:12,802
Fung Chun Kit married you to use you
to produce offspring for Wu Tang.

341
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,181
Fung Chun Kit,
you married me

342
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:20,684
only to use me
to produce offspring for Wu Tang.

343
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,983
Men. See one,
kill one.

344
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:34,407
Men. See one,
kill one.

345
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,471
Lyre!

346
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:08,692
Didn't want to look back
But didn't want to miss you

347
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,239
My mind was racing
l was mesmerized

348
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:20,286
When we meet again
Many seasons had passed

349
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:29,795
Was it passion?
Did its flame consume me?

350
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:44,561
lf you still remembered me
Then it was all worthwhile

351
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:50,442
Madly,
and recklessly l waited

352
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:53,902
Just to see your smile
Did you know?

353
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:59,742
l was crazy for you
Was it so wrong?

354
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:06,373
Did you love me?
Maybe hate was just as strong

355
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:14,465
l stubbornly lingered
While my hair turned to frost

356
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:20,804
Did you love me?
l dared not ask

357
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:28,146
My heart went out for you
l was losing ground

358
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:37,112
l lived and died for passion and love
Was that really so hard to fathom?

359
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,365
How come there's no message?
lt's been so long.

360
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:43,161
Maybe even the dove
has found a new love.

361
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:51,628
l know there was no tomorrow
But for now, your hands are in mine!

362
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:55,130
Found the perfect wife.
Are you happy now?

363
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,371
lt's more fun to sit under
the moonlight with someone.

364
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:34,336
Our destiny is predetermined
by the heavens. You actually saved him.

365
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:39,800
lf this had happened earlier, he might
have married you instead of Lyre.

366
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:44,556
Oh no, then you would have been the one
who was kidnapped by that witch!

367
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,224
Bite my tongue.

368
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,190
Listen.
There are so many birds in the forest.

369
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,735
Thousands of them, from phoenix
to rooster for you to choose from.

370
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:02,532
But you had to insist on one
and wouldn't let go.

371
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,952
Now you've even watched him
marry someone else.

372
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:09,289
Because he is a responsible man.

373
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:13,585
l know such a husband is hard to find.
But it's too late now.

374
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,463
l have been there before.

375
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,922
When l was young,
l was stubborn just like you.

376
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,009
Maybe even more so.

377
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:22,844
So what happened?

378
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,139
Like you,
l saw him marry someone else.

379
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:30,726
l am as old as an owl.
Not even a goose would want me now.

380
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,438
Then go find a crow.

381
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,275
We're back.

382
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:41,612
Come, let's find out
what's happening.

383
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,710
l am neither a phoenix nor a rooster.
And l don't ask for much.

384
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,463
As long as it's a female.

385
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:09,474
Now, Fung Chun Kit will lead
on the attack and destroy the witch.

386
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,059
Me?

387
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,603
Granny,
l thought you were going.

388
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:17,648
l'm good at defense.
Attack? l'm just so so.

389
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,443
Then why do you
sit in the middle?

390
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:24,155
lt's better to count on ourselves
than on others. Amen.

391
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,826
lt doesn't matter who leads, the
important thing is to die gloriously.

392
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,954
Don't just keep thinking about
failing and dying.

393
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,206
Do you think the white hair witch
has any children?

394
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,333
Why do you ask?

395
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,670
She killed all our ancestors,
and now we're going to kill her.

396
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,755
When we get old,
we will have no more descendants.

397
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,161
Ying Wai.
ls this the man?

398
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,300
No. Don't!

399
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:34,266
l want you to remember.
You're an animal. You're a pig, a cow!

400
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,726
You must obey my orders!

401
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:53,827
Before Sister rescued me, l ran away
from home because of this animal.

402
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,748
l loved him and suffered for him
with no regrets.

403
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,378
But for a mere 20 taels,
he sold me to the brothel!

404
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:08,967
l will never forget that.
l was nothing more than a pig, a cow!

405
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:20,230
Ying Wai, you let him know exactly
how a cold-blooded animal dies.

406
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:26,027
Kill him..
Kill him!

407
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,070
No.

408
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:38,789
Kill him..
Kill him!

409
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,804
Fung Chun Kit, you married me so l could
produce offspring for Wu Tang.

410
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,806
To restore Wu Tang's reputation.

411
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,141
Fine.

412
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,561
Go and get your dead Master
Tse Yuento do it for you!

413
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:26,591
Here we are.

414
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:32,806
Why don't we retire and pretend we're
dead. Do you think anyone would know?

415
00:42:41,065 --> 00:42:43,524
The old windbags of the Eight Clans
are all cunning cowards.

416
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:47,820
They didn't even dare show their faces,
but sent their little prawns instead.

417
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:56,871
Let's put up a good fight
and show them what we're made of.

418
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:58,665
We won't die.

419
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,002
Ling, you go with Len Long
and attack from the east.

420
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:05,672
Liu, you don't know the Flying Stance.
Go with Yee and attack from the south.

421
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,507
Siu Lau, you attack from the west
and l'll take it from the north.

422
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:09,466
Everybody understand?

423
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:13,054
l'll give you two taels
to trade places with you.

424
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:15,723
Cut this nonsense!
Let's go!

425
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:35,827
You can't even give a good back massage!
You call yourself a man?

426
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:36,869
Come here.

427
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:39,788
What are you looking at?
Just do it.

428
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:09,152
Oh God.. l shouldn't look.
l have sinned!

429
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:02,871
Where is the white hair witch?

430
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:06,585
Where is the white hair witch??

431
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:11,965
Useless!

432
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,014
Women are for you to love,
not to hit!

433
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,808
l only love my mother.

434
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:25,436
That's a dead end.
This way!

435
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:01,347
Bastard!
You are such an ugly witch.

436
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:03,058
l will punish you for the heavens.
l'll strangle you!

437
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:04,518
Go to hell!!

438
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,746
Where is Lyre?
Take me to her..

439
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,710
Lyre!r

440
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:35,839
Fung Chun Kit. You married me so
l could produce offspring for Wu Tang.

441
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,384
To restore Wu Tang's reputation.

442
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:40,094
Lyre.t

443
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:42,306
The witch must have put a spell
on your wife.

444
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:43,639
Ask the others to retreat.

445
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,893
How can we? We haven't killed
the white hair witch yet!

446
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:54,442
Why are you in such a hurry?
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

447
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:55,317
Goodbye my ass!!

448
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:03,118
Siu Lau!

449
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:36,527
Go!s

450
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:54,627
Lyre?

451
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,846
Your beloved is over here.
Why don't you come get her?

452
00:48:37,002 --> 00:48:37,836
Siu Lau.


453
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,228
Kit,
don't go over there!d

454
00:48:57,774 --> 00:48:59,274
Whatever you do,
don't pull the hair out!

455
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:00,110
Go!a

456
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:24,341
Come here!

457
00:49:28,054 --> 00:49:28,762
You damn witch!

458
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:34,519
Yee, run!

459
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:35,519
Don't!

460
00:50:37,623 --> 00:50:41,543
Sister, you've fought and killed
for so many years.

461
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,549
Why don't we just leave here together
and find a better place to live?

462
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:54,307
No, l won't leave here until l've killed
every last soul of the Eight Big Clans.

463
00:50:58,311 --> 00:50:59,313
That is only your excuse.

464
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:05,777
You're actually jealous
of Lyre and her husband.

465
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:10,865
What she has with her husband,
you never had with Cho Yi Hang.

466
00:51:11,908 --> 00:51:13,576
That's why you want
to break them up.

467
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:16,453
You're still thinking about him.

468
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:19,332
You have been waiting for him.

469
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,168
Please don't forget.

470
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,672
He was the one who turned you
into who you are today!

471
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,759
Why don't you just forget about
this heartless man?

472
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:32,886
You don't think he
has hurt you enough?

473
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:40,688
So you think we'll be happy
if we are together?

474
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:53,490
Ni Chang, with your damn personality,
no one will have a good ending with you!

475
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:09,131
Whatever you do,
don't pull the hair out.

476
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:11,801
Moon was hit by the witch's
poisonous white hair.

477
00:52:12,302 --> 00:52:15,304
As soon as the poison starts to work,
it will travel all over her body.

478
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:20,476
She must not use kung fu,
otherwise, her arteries will burst.

479
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:23,605
Are we just going to stand here
and watch her die?

480
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:26,442
You don't have
to be too worried.

481
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:28,985
As long as she doesn't use her kung fu,
she'll be fine.

482
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:33,782
Liu,
where are you going?

483
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:37,952
l'm going outside
to get some wood for the fire.

484
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,123
Maybe he's in shock.

485
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,793
l better go check on him.

486
00:52:57,014 --> 00:52:59,849
Liu, l thought you were going
to chop some wood.

487
00:53:14,697 --> 00:53:18,576
Liu,
l know you really like Moon.

488
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:23,957
But the husband of her dreams
is a hero with great strengths.

489
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,713
Even though you
aren't quite there yet,

490
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,802
if you study harder, practice your
kung fu and stop playing around so much,

491
00:53:36,302 --> 00:53:40,139
in another eight to ten years,
it still won't be too late to court her.

492
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:49,692
Don't worry.
Moon won't die.

493
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,277
We should stop
lying to ourselves.

494
00:53:52,902 --> 00:53:55,529
From the very beginning,
we were all destined to die.

495
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,451
You at least have a purpose,
to rescue your wife.

496
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:00,702
But what about us?

497
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:04,121
Just to avenge the deaths
of our old ancestors??

498
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:05,957
- Liu!
- Liu!

499
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:17,344
l am really getting old!
l misunderstood him completely.

500
00:54:17,427 --> 00:54:23,600
l thought he cried only because of Moon.
l've spoken such nonsense.

501
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,688
Now l found out
the most immature of all was me.

502
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,920
- Liu.
- Liu.

503
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:50,813
Don't die yet!
Let me stab you a couple more times.

504
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,939
l won't have my turn
when we go back to the palace.

505
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,484
Let him go.
Let him go please.

506
00:55:56,525 --> 00:55:58,569
Damn bastard!
Senile fool!

507
00:55:58,944 --> 00:55:59,612
Granny!

508
00:56:06,536 --> 00:56:08,078
What are you all
standing around for?

509
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,332
Go ahead. Go over there
and give it your best shots!

510
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:33,480
Little friend, isn't a little pain
invigorating? Pain builds character!

511
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:37,274
Then why don't you let me stab you?
Let's invigorate each other!

512
00:57:16,148 --> 00:57:17,856
Please let him go.

513
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:19,525
Let the bastard go?

514
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,567
l won't die.
l am not going to die.

515
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:05,404
Moon!

516
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:26,967
Moon!

517
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,932
Moon!

518
00:58:37,855 --> 00:58:41,274
Kit,
don't block the moon.

519
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:52,077
Don't worry, you'll..
save your wife.

520
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:55,788
Evil can never win over
good and righteousness.

521
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,010
Liu, don't always
hide behind a joker's face.

522
00:59:09,552 --> 00:59:12,889
Be serious.
You have to help Kit.

523
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:13,972
l know.

524
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:21,188
Kit.. in the future, when you
and your wife look at the moon,

525
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:31,492
please remember me..
Liu Moon Yee..

526
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:36,412
Moon!

527
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,372
Moon!

528
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,590
Why does it have
to be this girl?

529
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:50,195
l think you two will have to help me
to dig another grave.

530
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:51,487
Granny.

531
01:00:52,322 --> 01:00:56,284
l am useless.
l am too old to be of any help to you.

532
01:00:57,284 --> 01:01:01,706
But l know someone
who may be able to help.

533
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:02,707
Who?

534
01:01:03,332 --> 01:01:05,460
Your Uncle Cho Yi Hang.

535
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:07,420
Uncle Cho?!

536
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:11,757
l have nothing to
lose or fear now.

537
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:18,099
lt was forbidden by the Eight Big Clans
to tell this secret.

538
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:25,146
But l am telling you now.
Your uncle is hiding in Mount Shin Fung.

539
01:01:26,023 --> 01:01:27,064
Mount Shin Fung?

540
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:30,275
Yes.
Go and find him.

541
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:35,823
He may be the only one
who can defeat the white hair witch.

542
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:06,979
Liu!

543
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,149
Liu!

544
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:14,153
Get up, Liu!
Liu!

545
01:02:17,907 --> 01:02:21,619
Get up, Liu!
Let's keep walking.

546
01:02:22,121 --> 01:02:23,331
Keep walking?

547
01:02:23,831 --> 01:02:26,207
We've walked four days
and there's been no sign of Uncle Cho.

548
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,168
Who can live under these conditions
for ten years?

549
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:34,006
You don't want to come?
Then l'll go alone!

550
01:02:39,764 --> 01:02:40,554
Kit!

551
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:42,474
Liu!

552
01:02:43,766 --> 01:02:45,351
l must find Uncle Cho.

553
01:02:46,518 --> 01:02:49,813
l have to tell him Ni Chang has turned
into an evil cold-blooded murderer.

554
01:02:50,105 --> 01:02:52,442
Uncle Cho is the only one
who can help us to destroy her.

555
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,902
Do you understand??

556
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:15,047
Do you know where
Uncle Cho is hiding?

557
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,717
We will freeze to death
before even finding him!

558
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:22,554
lf we're dead,
who will rescue your wife?

559
01:03:23,806 --> 01:03:25,557
lt's far better to
count on ourselves.

560
01:03:29,188 --> 01:03:33,108
As long as l have one last breath left,
l will fight that witch!

561
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,610
Moon said: evil can never win over
good and righteousness!

562
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:37,403
Let's go!

563
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:36,670
ln one incense's time,
save Lyre and get out of here.

564
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:39,591
Should we fail, we'll take
the witch to the grave with us!

565
01:05:10,581 --> 01:05:11,997
Those of you who don't want to die,
get out!

566
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:21,550
Lyre!

567
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:28,139
Sister-in-law.

568
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:03,382
l am Kit!

569
01:06:55,851 --> 01:06:56,853
Lyre,
don't fight anymore.

570
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:18,957
This is from Moon!

571
01:07:30,887 --> 01:07:31,514
This is from me!

572
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:39,853
Now you know what a real man is!

573
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,527
This is from Yee!

574
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:53,118
Forget about me.
Just go!

575
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:54,034
Don't!

576
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:03,837
Liu.

577
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,761
Kit..
l've done my best...

578
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:14,514
Liu!

579
01:08:31,613 --> 01:08:35,076
l just have to see
how strong true love really is!

580
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:53,511
Kit.

581
01:08:57,806 --> 01:08:58,557
Kit.


582
01:09:01,644 --> 01:09:04,605
Lyre.
You woke up from the spell?

583
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:14,867
l want you to kill him
with your own hands!

584
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:18,662
No.
l won't do it!

585
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,380
No!

586
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:05,582
Lyre!

587
01:10:12,506 --> 01:10:13,757
Kit!

588
01:10:22,891 --> 01:10:26,646
So you can't part from each other?
l will let you two die together!

589
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:28,148
Run!

590
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,864
Lyre, run!

591
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:19,157
Uncle Cho!

592
01:12:00,864 --> 01:12:01,617
Ni Chang.

593
01:12:08,747 --> 01:12:09,832
lt's all my fault.

594
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:16,672
Let them go.

595
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:21,429
Why didn't you say these words
ten years ago?

596
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:23,014
lt's too late now!

597
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,726
Go to hell,
you witch!

598
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,805
Uncle Cho!

599
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:08,850
Uncle Cho!

600
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:11,978
Kit!

601
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:17,192
Why don't you fight back?

602
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:23,323
Ni Chang.

603
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:27,201
No matter what wrong l've done,

604
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:34,167
l just want you to know
that l didn't mean to betray you.

605
01:13:44,344 --> 01:13:45,011
Don't move!

606
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,972
Once the hair leaves you,
you'll die!

607
01:14:11,037 --> 01:14:16,418
Witch, to get you this flower, Uncle Cho
waited on Mount Shin Fung for ten years!

608
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,378
And you still want to kill him?

609
01:14:30,764 --> 01:14:32,684
Yi Hang!
Don't move!

610
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:14,851
Ni Chang!
You paved your own road of destruction.

611
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:19,648
Do you remember what l said? No one
will have a happy ending with you.

612
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:55,265
l thought l'd never see you again
in this lifetime.

613
01:16:09,113 --> 01:16:11,117
Have l aged much?

614
01:16:15,412 --> 01:16:20,166
No matter how you've changed,
lt's not important to me.

615
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:26,966
l've become this way,
all because you did not trust me.

616
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,470
Forgive me!

617
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:42,815
Hate and despair

618
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:50,195
Who knew love could be so hard

619
01:16:51,613 --> 01:16:57,369
Love and hate l cannot resolve

620
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:05,295
Passion faded and youth consumed

621
01:17:06,297 --> 01:17:13,219
All at once l held in my hand
The past and the future

622
01:17:13,552 --> 01:17:20,603
Can we call this
love everlasting?

623
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:37,827
l do believe when parting
your embrace will sooth my sorrow

624
01:17:54,094 --> 01:17:58,472
Liu, that day at Mount Shin Fung,
we actually found Uncle Cho.

625
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:05,815
Let's go..

626
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:09,567
Kit, the other day
at the evil palace,

627
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:12,404
l thought l saw
the white hair witch's hair turn black!

628
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:13,363
Really?

629
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:15,657
lt doesn't really matter now.

630
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:18,411
The important thing is
that they are finally together!
