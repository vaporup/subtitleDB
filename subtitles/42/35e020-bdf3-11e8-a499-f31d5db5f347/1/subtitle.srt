1
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,309
Speak up!

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,753
Do you still want to
keep your mouth shut? Speak up!

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,433
All your party members
are arrested by us.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,392
If you still want to waste time,
all of you will die!

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,633
Tell me who is Hui Man-keung,
so just Hui will die.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,355
Otherwise,
all of you have to be killed.

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,557
I am Hui Man-keung...

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,839
Get the one who answered first.

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,033
How many member are there
in the Taiwan People's League?

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,993
I know Hui Man-keung
has got the name list.

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,673
Are you Hui Man-keung?

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,553
You must have the list.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,352
This ship won't
go back to Taiwan.

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,558
Now, it's going back to Shanghai.

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,633
I'll let you go if you tell me.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,551
Otherwise you'll be regret.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,596
Betrayer!

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,989
Get him!

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,598
He's fallen.
Drag him up.

20
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,430
Long live
the Taiwan People's League...

21
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,791
It's time to clear your commode,
get your commode out.

22
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,110
High collar, tight suit.

23
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,628
Moustaches and with a
gentleman stick.

24
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,475
Go on clearing your commode.

25
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,951
Come and take a look,
perfume from Paris.

26
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,150
Just arrived in Shanghai!

27
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,918
Brother Lik,
smell this for me please.

28
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,553
Let me have a look.

29
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,470
It smells good.

30
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,512
Brother Lik, does this suit me?
Smell it please.

31
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,153
You are so innocent!
It fits you most.

32
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,918
Brother Lik, and me too.

33
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,915
Brother Chiu.

34
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,749
Brother Chiu has come!

35
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,029
Brother Chiu...

36
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,634
Stay quiet.

37
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,151
This is from Brother Chiu!
Your payment.

38
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,316
Check it carefully.

39
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,392
Buy one pineapple chocolate,
it's delicious.

40
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,310
Brother Chiu!

41
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,396
Pay, pay now!

42
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,794
Brother Chiu is nice and rich,
Brother Chiu'll be richer.

43
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,712
Damn it!
Can you say something else?

44
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,272
These two ladies look nice.

45
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,993
Look at that bastard! Let's go.

46
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,839
I am powerful! Come and have fun
in the Tri-star tonight.

47
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,588
Brother!

48
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,756
Damn it! I hate raising my head
to talk others.

49
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,755
Are you tall?

50
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,712
Don't hit my head, OK?

51
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,512
Squat now!

52
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,638
You bastard! It's much better.

53
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,438
Your body stinks!
Why do you sell perfume?

54
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,790
This is your payment
for clearing shit!

55
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,273
Hold it.

56
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,434
You sell perfume, huh!

57
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,910
Don't you think
you are somebody now?

58
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,473
I tell you, you are a man
who clears shit!

59
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,432
You are always under me.

60
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,279
Don't forget, I am your boss.

61
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,953
You stink! Horrible smell!

62
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,270
Spray some perfume
to cover your stinky smell!

63
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,836
Bastard! How dare you be cocky?

64
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,794
He is scared by me!

65
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,992
Damn you! Damn you bastard!

66
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,269
Damn you bastard!

67
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,668
Don't you think
I dare not beat you?

68
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,554
I can kill you just by one blow!

69
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,949
You dwarf, stand properly.

70
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,354
Go and eat shit!

71
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,273
Stop fooling me, OK?

72
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,793
I wanna beat you to death.

73
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,439
I picked up this gun over there.

74
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,477
- Stop bothering me from scolding.
- Look.

75
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,200
- Damn it, damn your whole family!
- It's real.

76
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,189
Is the guy dead or not?

77
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,275
You got it over there?

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,956
Dying young! What a pity!

79
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,474
It just fits.

80
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,268
Betrayer!

81
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,358
Fainted! You are good
at taking advantage!

82
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,032
Will he be a rascal? It's not
wise to offend triad members.

83
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,115
There are bullets in the gun!

84
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,753
Hide it, hurry up.

85
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
If we are seen by the police,
we will be put to jail.

86
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,473
He's waken.

87
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,473
Get up.

88
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,915
I am not used to raise my head
to look at others.

89
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,549
Got it.

90
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,958
Tell me, who are you?

91
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,794
That's none of your business.

92
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,109
You stole my gun.

93
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,433
Return it to me.

94
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,918
All of us here are heroes.

95
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,951
We earn our living
in this messy world,

96
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,758
anyway, I am their boss.

97
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,558
Right.
That's right.

98
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,073
You blame me of
stealing your gun?

99
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,553
You mean I am a thief!

100
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,717
In Shanghai, only two kind of
people are holding guns.

101
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,228
Either cops,

102
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,954
or thieves.

103
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,749
Which type are you?

104
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,996
Bullshit, return my gun to me!

105
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,117
Hand him to the police station,
maybe we'll be awarded.

106
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,637
Will they give us money?

107
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,234
We have suffered much instead!

108
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,828
Say that Shorty Chiu!
He doesn't take any glance at us!

109
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,234
Enough, shut up!

110
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,709
Why not throw him to the river?

111
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,110
So he will be
bitten death by fishes!

112
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,555
Lik, come and eat some dumplings.
Eat while it's still hot.

113
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,868
Don't just care of eating.

114
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,793
Pack up of business now!
Make money is more important!

115
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,196
Mom, he seems to be hungry.

116
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,998
Let him try some, to let him eat
food cooked by excellent cook!

117
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,195
Alright.

118
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,593
"Collection of Love Letters"!

119
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,071
I taste the candy carefully.

120
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,189
Too see whether it is as sweet
as your picture in my mind.

121
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,439
Even a man is moved,
a woman will be moved easily too.

122
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,358
Today we only show to soldiers,
no ticket scalper today.

123
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,032
There must be surplus too.

124
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,350
So be a soldier, if you're,
you will get a ticket.

125
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,388
Bullshit!

126
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,153
So what!

127
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,790
Miss Leung, good morning.

128
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,513
Brother Lik, good morning.

129
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,152
Miss Fung, good morning.

130
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,513
I've bought tickets for you.

131
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,754
Sorry, Miss comes late.

132
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,433
Now the movie has been started,
we won't watch it today.

133
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,868
Thank you!

134
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,070
You are going to miss
a very good chance.

135
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,918
I got front seats today! You can
watch it without obstacles.

136
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,115
Forget it! It's not a concert,
front seats aren't attractive.

137
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,749
Just sell the tickets,
or it'll be a waste.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,353
Sell it? Alright...

139
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,272
If you can't sell it,
I'll pay you next time.

140
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,314
Forget it.
See you.

141
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,068
Bye bye...

142
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,708
I've fooled him!

143
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,636
Miss, I don't understand that,

144
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,672
you have watched
"Gone with the wind" for 3 times.

145
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,069
Why do you still
enjoy watching it?

146
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,631
The lead is like a person I knew.

147
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,676
And I have different feelings
whenever I watch it again.

148
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,555
So what?

149
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,148
Come out... Hurry up.

150
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,074
Hurry up!

151
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,355
Get in.

152
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,989
Bastard, are you looking
for death?

153
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,548
Let Miss Fung go.

154
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,515
It's too dangerous.

155
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,237
Hurry up! Leave at once...

156
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,269
Kill him!

157
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,228
Fire! It's on fire.

158
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,310
Don't go!

159
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,032
Are you beating me? You bastard!

160
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,436
- How dare you beat your boss?
- Where is Miss Fung?

161
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,319
- How dare you beat me?
- Say! Tell me!

162
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,155
Help!

163
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,315
Go to hell!

164
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,952
Why do you seize my car?
What are you doing here?

165
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,674
That bastard is too tough!
He's a pain in the ass!

166
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,190
Come out.

167
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,190
I won't come out.

168
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,549
Bastard! I won't come out, never.

169
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,510
Come out.

170
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,919
Bastard, you broke my tyre,
I want you to pay for it.

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,634
I tell you,
this is imported from USA.

172
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,394
I want you to pay for it,
I make money by this.

173
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,677
If you don't pay for it,
I'll ask the cops to arrest you!

174
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,791
It's not wise to
offend me, you know? Pay!

175
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,112
Mr. Ting, Mr.
Fung will see you later.

176
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,839
Mr. Ting, Mr.
Fung will come out soon.

177
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,149
Alright, thank you.

178
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,199
Shorty Chiu is a
dog of Brother Wing.

179
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,396
If not supported by Wing,

180
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,830
he didn't have guts
to do such thing.

181
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,753
What a mess!

182
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,792
Women shouldn't be dragged by men
What a bastard!

183
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,793
Watch Miss.

184
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,950
Before the case is settled,
don't let her go out.

185
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,673
Ask the owner of the cinema
to show her the movie at home.

186
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,875
Give the young man
who saved Ching-ching some money.

187
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,670
Watch him, he maybe in trouble.

188
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,838
Yes, Mister.

189
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,513
My name is Ting Lik.

190
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,879
I am the house keeper
of Mr. Fung.

191
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,630
Mr. Fung appreciated it
very much, this is given by him.

192
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,189
Money?

193
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,272
No, please take it back.

194
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,800
It's an appreciation
from Mr. Fung.

195
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,150
If you refuse to take it,
he will be unhappy.

196
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,709
I know.

197
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,116
But I can't take it.
I did it not for money.

198
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,271
Please tell Miss Fung,
we are good friends.

199
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,989
I am leaving.

200
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,030
This way please.

201
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,593
Have you ever been bitten by dog?

202
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,433
It won't lose its mind and bite.

203
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,949
Brother Lik.

204
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,950
Are you leaving?

205
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,556
I've come for a long time.

206
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640
The Big World is the territory
of Brother Wing.

207
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,030
Don't go for movie any more.
Come and see me only.

208
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,470
Don't worry,

209
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,870
I will watch movie
on every Wednesday.

210
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,871
I just want to do anything
which worries my daddy.

211
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,069
You saved my life,
how can I thank you?

212
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,074
- Give me a hug.
- What?

213
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,153
It's a joke, bye!

214
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,148
Can you send me something?

215
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,630
What do you want?

216
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,955
I've got it.

217
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,514
What did you take?

218
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,437
This letter has been written
by me for a long time.

219
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,552
I've kept it with me for days and
didn't get a chance to give you.

220
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,830
Don't watch here,
go home and read carefully.

221
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,589
Don't think of me.

222
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,548
See you!

223
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,158
How lucky I am! Wonderful!

224
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,158
Come and put out the fire!

225
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,189
Put out the fire!

226
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,156
It's dangerous! Run now!

227
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,953
Where is my mom? Where is she?

228
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,638
- Brother Lik.
- Where is my mom?

229
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,073
I can't find her!
I can't find her.

230
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,111
Why don't you take care of her?
Why don't you save her?

231
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,829
- Brother Lik, what are you doing?
- Get lost!

232
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,873
Let me go!

233
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,710
Brother Lik,
it's a big fire! Don't go!

234
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,434
- It's getting worse, Brother Lik!
- Get lost.

235
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,750
It's dangerous,
you can't go in, run!

236
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,878
If you don't go now,
it'll be too late!

237
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,474
Drag Lik out!

238
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,956
Drag Brother Lik out, hurry up.
Hurry up!

239
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,913
Let me go!

240
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,157
I want to save my mom!
My mom is right in.

241
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,833
- Let me go!
- Come out first, Brother Lik.

242
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,353
Your mom isn't inside,
go out first.

243
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,829
Let's go. Go!

244
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,672
- Mom!
- It's dangerous!

245
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,713
Get him out! Hurry up.

246
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,268
- Let me go.
- Stay calm first.

247
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,913
She isn't your mom!
That's why you don't care.

248
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,230
Take a rest first.

249
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,668
Brother Lik, have some water.

250
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,795
Come on, drink some water.
It's hot.

251
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,115
Are you hurt?

252
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,837
Thank you, I am called Ting Lik.

253
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,593
Everyone calls me Brother Lik.

254
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,233
You saved my mom,
I will protect you from now on.

255
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,555
Fine.

256
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,034
What's your name?

257
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,634
Call me Keung.

258
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,111
Siu-keung, what a nice name!

259
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,915
Brother Wing said if we don't
hand Brother Lik to him,

260
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,308
he will burn any place we stay.

261
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,473
So we can't
make a living in Shanghai.

262
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,478
I think this isn't
a simple matter.

263
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,798
Because we are staying
in Wing's territory.

264
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,275
So he is pushing us
to hand him Brother Lik.

265
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,349
Do you want a beat up?

266
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,352
Stop it.

267
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,309
Take it back.

268
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,992
You are so anxious,
you must be in great need of it.

269
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,552
I think you
need it more than I do.

270
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,272
His boss Wing won't let you go.

271
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,153
That's why he burnt your place.

272
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,310
And he pushed your buddies
to sacrifice you. What'll you do?

273
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,468
He wants me only.

274
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,278
- My life doesn't worth much!
- Just take it.

275
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,833
Mister, do you want any girl?

276
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,389
Let me find a pretty one for you.

277
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,273
Stop bothering me,
I don't want any girl.

278
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,555
You look nice!

279
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,475
I am going to see the boss.

280
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,033
Don't get yourself into trouble.

281
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,029
Don't you worry I can't escape?

282
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,430
I think, starting from tonight,

283
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,193
we will be famous in Shanghai.

284
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,313
I don't want
others to know my name.

285
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,278
I will call you Chun from now on,
so no one knows your name!

286
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,035
- Brother Lik.
- Cheung-kwai, why are you here?

287
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,673
I am going to do business
in the Tri-star.

288
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,993
Put the gun inside his box.

289
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,798
Bastard, you've come!

290
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,793
I am coming to send Brother Wing
some crabs.

291
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,349
Check whether
they are armed or not.

292
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,389
Brother Wing, they have come.

293
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,309
You bastard!

294
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,435
Crabs?

295
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,837
You are giving me face
to send me crabs!

296
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,193
You can't escape this time.

297
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,635
Bastard, I have waited you
for a long time!

298
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,833
Come on... let's play mahjongg.

299
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,318
Kid, where are you going?

300
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,629
Someone inside wants
the shoe shine service.

301
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,955
No one needs you tonight!

302
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,193
Leave! Get lost.

303
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,634
Tri-star isn't
suitable for children.

304
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,551
I will play a game with you.
Choose the biggest you can.

305
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,073
Sixty thousand.

306
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,069
Your turn.

307
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,155
Just forty thousand?

308
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,313
Do you wanna die?

309
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,109
Let's see how far you can go!

310
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,555
Sorry, you are
so unlucky tonight.

311
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,918
How dare you betray me?

312
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,595
Do you remember
who raised you up?

313
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,272
Damn it! Do you know it?

314
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,516
Who is the boss here?

315
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,994
Chiu is my brother,
how dare you offend him?

316
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,554
Don't you want to
live any longer?

317
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,839
Did you think with your ass?
Did you eat shit?

318
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,268
Let me hit you to wake you up!

319
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,069
Don't you want to live?

320
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,149
Draw any domino you like.

321
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,633
Go ahead.

322
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,108
You are like a dying dog!

323
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,435
Open it.

324
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,268
Show me.

325
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,713
Just ten thousand.

326
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,669
No!

327
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,518
Don't kill!

328
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,189
Go to hell.

329
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,433
Stop fighting!
Have you fought enough?

330
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,638
Freeze...

331
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,829
Be frank!

332
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,516
You cops can't take anyone away
you like.

333
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,199
Mr. Chu, you've misunderstood it,
we don't come for an arrest.

334
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,000
Uncle Lau invited me
to eat crabs.

335
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,752
Such nice crabs,
let's finish it first.

336
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,837
You haven't come to have fun in
Tri-stars for a long time.

337
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,508
How is Mr. Fung?

338
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,951
Mr. Chu, you still
remember Mr. Fung.

339
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,677
How can I forget him?

340
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,270
But they killed
Brother Wing here,

341
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,836
if his fellows want me to hand
the murderer, what'll I do?

342
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,749
You know, this is a place
for fun only!

343
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,468
If there is anything happened,
that will...

344
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,557
If you don't cover Wing's gang,
that'll be alright.

345
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,028
I will take Ting Lik away.

346
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,919
For the rest,

347
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,595
We will deal with it.

348
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,674
Brother Four, what action
will the police station take?

349
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,678
What's the matter?
Nothing has happened!

350
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,596
I asked my fellows
to clean the scene.

351
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,113
Nothing has happened!

352
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,996
Lik, from now on, the territories
of Wing will go to you.

353
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,751
I will back you up.

354
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,790
Shorty Chiu can't
hide up any longer.

355
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,198
From now on, we will take over

356
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,958
the shit business in Shanghai!

357
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,195
We will be rich!

358
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,236
Come on, fix the shit! Hurry up!

359
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,469
For anything I get in Shanghai,
I want to share it with you.

360
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,314
I am only a visitor in Shanghai.

361
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,711
I will leave this place
when my work is finished.

362
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,549
Let's wait and see.

363
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,438
Maybe, you don't want to leave
for something unknown.

364
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,589
Miss Lai-man.

365
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,635
Thank you.

366
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,469
Damn it! Hurry up...

367
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,550
Is that OK?

368
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,359
I haven't done such thing before.

369
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,518
Brother Lik,
come and give me some comments.

370
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,988
Should I re-decorate it again?

371
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,949
This is given by Miss.

372
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,390
What's her name?

373
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,669
Fung Ching-ching.

374
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,435
Will she marry you?

375
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,110
Of course!
How can she reject my proposal?

376
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,633
This is rule!
What else can you say?

377
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,108
Where did you get the gold?

378
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,711
- Don't you know it?
- I don't know.

379
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,234
See you...

380
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,756
I just want to be
fair and reasonable.

381
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,674
You killed Wing and then Mr. Chu.

382
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,470
As well as the Commissioner
of Custom Department.

383
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,873
What do you want?

384
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,716
I always have a dream.

385
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,473
I can't waste my life.

386
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,631
I want to get the most
precious thing in Shanghai.

387
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,869
I tell myself,

388
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,956
when I'm qualified, I'm rich,

389
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,908
I must marry her!

390
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,953
I want to be your son-in-law.

391
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,719
Young man, you want to get
my most precious thing!

392
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,993
I think, if you don't mind,

393
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,873
nothing will bother.

394
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,753
So confident?

395
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,229
Lik. I have an important friend
in business.

396
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,079
I want you to meet him,
to communicate with him.

397
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,637
Then, come back and tell me
your point of view,

398
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,835
this is very important to me,
you should understand.

399
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,353
I will do as you instructed.

400
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,072
This cinema has been
bought by me.

401
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,192
you can watch movie
any time you like.

402
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,352
I want to make movies too.

403
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,431
To film everything about you.

404
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,476
You, me...

405
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,713
our family...

406
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,513
and our children.

407
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,835
Don't worry,
I've talked to your daddy.

408
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,276
He's agreed our marriage.

409
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,714
I am sorry.

410
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,720
Please give me some time,
I'll explain this to you.

411
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,909
I'll give you 3 days.

412
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,749
Wonderful!

413
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,719
Wonderful! I can't imagine Keung
will take woman home!

414
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,430
Even Keung falls in love too!

415
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,110
Let me take a look
at my sister-in-law!

416
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,193
I've got you!

417
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,150
Ching-ching?

418
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,953
Are you Fung Ching-ching?

419
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,950
Ching-ching,
do you like Ting Lik?

420
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,999
In fact, I like another guy.

421
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,955
Last summer...

422
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,916
Who is it?

423
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,669
Who is it?

424
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,189
Be careful!

425
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,269
Hold me.

426
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,549
Miss.

427
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,149
Miss.

428
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,629
Room inspection.

429
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,272
Something happened,
it's emergency!

430
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,795
Miss, an escaped soldier
from kirin ran into this train.

431
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,433
They want to check your room.

432
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,275
What do they want to see?

433
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,353
Miss hates people looking at her
in this way.

434
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,275
If Mr. Fung knows it,
we'll be in trouble.

435
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,551
If you are impolite to Miss,

436
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,071
you will be complaint certainly.

437
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,476
What's the matter?

438
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,749
This is Miss Fung's room,
how can you check it?

439
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,511
You are bleeding!
Blood on my hand too.

440
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,429
Luckily they didn't see it.

441
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,190
Let's take a look over there!
Let's go.

442
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,678
Take care of Miss,
I'm going to take a look.

443
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,713
I heard that many Taiwan soldiers
escaped from North East.

444
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,949
I pity you and your buddies.

445
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,989
You will lose much blood!

446
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,109
Let me treat your wound first.

447
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,033
Wasn't it terrible to be trained
in Japanese camps?

448
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,350
Do you want to go South?

449
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,709
Cut the crap.

450
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,719
What's up?

451
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,593
I am tired.

452
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,837
There is an escaped soldier!
Don't let him go!

453
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,919
Freeze...

454
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,148
I don't drink.

455
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,749
Smoke?

456
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,633
I don't know smoking.

457
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,677
Come on, you smoked last night.

458
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,830
Well, why are they
so polite to you?

459
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,439
What's the relationship between
your dad and the Japanese?

460
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,633
I am different from my dad.

461
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,631
He has friends
all over the world.

462
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,231
He makes money in peaceful days.

463
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,793
Now, the NE is in a mess,

464
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,558
he makes money from the mess too.

465
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,273
Many people hate my dad.
They hate me too.

466
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,598
One day, my dad wasn't home,

467
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,592
so I sneaked out.

468
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,918
I went to the North by train.

469
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,795
But no matter where I go,

470
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,918
my father's friends
are next to me.

471
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,193
I am like an escaped soldier.

472
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,273
I was found eventually.

473
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,431
I was taken to this train and
I was sent back home.

474
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,676
Wonderful!

475
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,233
You won again! I lost!

476
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,716
Later, I sent
that guy to hospital.

477
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,555
His leg broke,
he became a cripple.

478
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,996
I am useless,
I can't do anything.

479
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,388
I can't change
anything around me.

480
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,593
I can't go out either.

481
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,555
I hate myself so much.

482
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,677
I really hate myself.

483
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,115
- Let me show you around.
- Fine.

484
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,158
Will you come to Shanghai
to visit me?

485
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,873
Shanghai isn't the place
I am heading to.

486
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,795
I am different.

487
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,795
I am homeless.

488
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,593
My dad hates men
getting close to me.

489
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,592
You are the first one
to dance with me.

490
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,233
May I know your name?

491
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,308
Don't ask my name.

492
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,748
After the next stop,

493
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,233
we are going to say goodbye.

494
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,799
We have to take another train
after the next stop.

495
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,359
Please get yourself ready.

496
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,669
It's impossible for us
to see again.

497
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,993
I don't want to see you leaving.

498
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,993
Close your eyes.

499
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,713
So you won't see me leaving you.

500
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,709
Ching-ching.

501
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,793
What are you thinking?

502
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,548
Nothing.

503
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,633
Dad, I am going out.

504
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,437
Lai-man...
How are you, Lai-man?

505
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,475
Miss, he mistook me as someone,
I fainted after a strike.

506
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,153
How come?

507
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,912
Miss, who are you chasing after?

508
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,715
Do you know him?
What do you know?

509
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,316
Miss.

510
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,835
What's happened?

511
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,590
It's no big deal, don't worry.

512
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,877
Thank you, doctor,
let me send you to the door.

513
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,470
Ching-ching, I am sorry.

514
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,028
In these months,

515
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,151
I've used your name
to write to Lik.

516
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,038
His letters are so passionate.

517
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,798
He has requested to meet you.

518
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,472
I thus replied it wouldn't be
allowed by Mr. Fung.

519
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,033
I know it's my fault to do so,

520
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,278
but I don't know what to do.

521
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,520
Ching-ching, I've got your reply.

522
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,473
I feel like standing on the
highest mountain of the world.

523
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,318
My best friend said
I was losing my mind.

524
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,716
I just told him,
I tried hard for you future only.

525
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,551
Ching-ching, I can't wait.
I want to live with you.

526
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,109
I will tell Mister Fung.

527
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,592
Ching-ching, will you blame me?

528
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,795
What did you say?

529
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,598
So, will you be fond of Ting Lik?

530
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,873
Yesterday night...

531
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,953
Why did that guy assault you?

532
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,434
Did he mistake you
as someone he knows?

533
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,514
Yes, he said he did.

534
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,390
But he asked me
where I made the dress.

535
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,916
Why did he ask such question?

536
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,388
I am puzzled too.

537
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,839
When I told him
the address of the tailor,

538
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,469
he then released me.

539
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,593
- May I ask...
- Is this dress made by you?

540
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,074
Yes... yes.

541
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,435
Where is the woman now?

542
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,949
I don't know.

543
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,670
- Speak up.
- I really don't know.

544
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,479
I know you've come to Shanghai,
that's why I try to find you.

545
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,273
What's your name?

546
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,549
You need not know it.

547
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,754
We won't see each other again.

548
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,635
Go up.

549
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,789
Go.

550
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,075
Go in.

551
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,829
Jump.

552
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,395
Trust me.

553
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,949
Close your eyes.

554
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,153
- Are you alright?
- I am fine.

555
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,270
Let's go.

556
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,557
Hui Man-keung,
aren't you looking for me?

557
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,474
You are Hui Man-keung,
aren't you?

558
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,074
I've got you at last!

559
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,555
Ching-ching?

560
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,749
What's her name?

561
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,993
Fung Ching-ching.

562
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,028
Will she marry you?

563
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,994
Of course! If only I propose!

564
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,433
Lik, before I knew you, we...

565
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,113
You can say anything you like.

566
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,869
Forget it.

567
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:15,957
Will our relationship

568
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,838
be hurt by a woman?

569
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,109
What a nice speech!

570
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,400
If you are married
and you discovered that,

571
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,796
You wife bathed with me
and slept with me,

572
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,793
then I tell you not to harm our
relationship because of a woman,

573
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,712
is that alright?
- What did you say?

574
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,478
I didn't know she is the woman
you are loving most!

575
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,113
Didn't I tell you?

576
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,672
I told you everything!

577
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,711
- But you didn't tell me anything!
- I have nothing to tell you.

578
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,152
I will leave Shanghai
once my job is finished.

579
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,875
At that time, everything
in Shanghai will go to you.

580
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,348
I don't want your sacrifice.

581
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,114
I can give you anything,

582
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,320
but why do you fight
for Ching-ching with me? Why?

583
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,078
Alright, you said you would leave
after finishing your job.

584
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,789
How about Ching-ching?

585
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,188
Can I take her along?

586
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,628
Fung King-yiu won't
let you do it.

587
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,269
Alright.

588
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,069
I am leaving.

589
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,514
But, remember,

590
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,392
take good care of Ching-ching.

591
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,673
Otherwise,

592
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,033
I will kill you.

593
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,270
Give way.

594
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,998
If you take yourself
as a soldier,

595
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,271
better commit suicide
in front of the comrades.

596
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,036
Few hundred members
of the Taiwan People's League...

597
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,912
were sent to NE for training
by the Japanese,

598
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,673
two troops went for
a mutiny together.

599
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,275
But a hundred of your fellows
were unable to escape,

600
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,993
why were they killed in Shanghai?
Except you!

601
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,029
Did you betray your buddies?

602
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,954
I didn't betray them.

603
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,473
After the mutiny,
we moved out of Kirin.

604
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,394
We planned to go back to Taiwan.

605
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,039
God knows!
The one who liaised with us died.

606
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,073
We lost contact with you.

607
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,152
After getting on board,

608
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,511
we discovered that our identities
were disclosed by betrayers.

609
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,109
Why weren't you killed?

610
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,870
Since the list of our party
was kept by me.

611
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,714
The comrades
wanted to protect me.

612
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,349
What a nice speech!

613
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,875
Why did you fight for your fame
and wealth in Shanghai instead?

614
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,673
My clothes were stained
by my buddies' blood.

615
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,274
So I swore.

616
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,078
I wanted to avenge them.

617
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,432
No one will trust
what you are talking.

618
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,829
Now, I want to execute you
right here.

619
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,513
The foe I want to
find has appeared!

620
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,669
If you kill me now,

621
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,400
you will never know
who betrayed our league!

622
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,955
Give me one chance,
give me one chance!

623
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,349
If you don't kill me now,

624
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,749
I can't even escape,

625
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,313
Give me few more days,

626
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,116
so I can take revenge for
my buddies by my own hands.

627
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,150
Lik, I have an important friend
in business.

628
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,279
I want you to see him,
to communicate.

629
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,037
Then come back and tell me
what you think about him.

630
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,394
This is very important to me,
you'd understand.

631
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,870
Mr. Fung,
your son-in-law has come.

632
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,071
I'll arrange it.

633
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,197
I won't miss it.

634
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,157
Ting Lik works without control.

635
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,233
He will ruin the plan of
the Japanese troops in Shanghai.

636
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,074
But it's not
necessary to feel pity.

637
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,912
Our plan is going to start.

638
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,515
Mr. Ting,
our boss invites you to go in.

639
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,908
His car is here,
but he is not around.

640
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,195
- We can't find him!
- Yes.

641
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,038
- How is it?
- We can't find him.

642
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,470
Where is he?

643
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,750
Brother Chun is back.

644
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,672
Brother Chun...

645
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,678
they found Miss Fung at your
home this morning.

646
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,233
So they are looking for you.

647
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,108
Are you Brother Chun?

648
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,718
Mister and Miss Fung are waiting
for you at home.

649
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,874
I'll follow you.

650
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,959
My dad looks fierce,
but he loves me very much.

651
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,635
Long live
the Taiwan People's League...

652
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,153
How can you let
Hui Man-keung escape?

653
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:13,990
What are you still thinking of?

654
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,030
Mr. Fung.

655
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,193
- Daddy.
- Ching-ching.

656
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,873
Your real lover is someone else.

657
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,755
In fact, I rather feel surprise.

658
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,072
Well, Ching-ching,
introduce your friend to me now.

659
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,468
Fine.

660
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,710
- Uncle, I...
- He is called Hui Man-keung.

661
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,472
I see, Mr. Hui.

662
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,271
Nice to meet you,
sorry to let you wait.

663
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,476
Are you the son-in-law
to be of Mr. Fung?

664
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,909
Now, I am not.

665
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,873
But Mr. Fung is the one
I respect most.

666
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,998
He asked me to see you,
that's why I come.

667
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,636
It doesn't matter,
since you come to see me,

668
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,078
I'll arrange something specially
for you.

669
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,635
Sit down please.

670
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,788
Do you want to be Mr.
Fung's son-in-law?

671
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,838
He won't let others
take away his daughter.

672
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,910
Ching-ching's friend
is my friend.

673
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,873
Mr. Hui, where is your hometown?

674
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,269
Kwangtung.

675
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,994
Some years ago,
we moved to Beijing.

676
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,799
I haven't eaten mutton
in Beijing for years.

677
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,036
Mister, I am now going to
prepare the midnight snack.

678
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,835
Fine.

679
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,115
Mr. Hui, please take a seat.

680
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,429
Uncle Leung, just go ahead.

681
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,438
Mr. Hui, the Japanese has
messed up the North.

682
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,318
What kind of business
can you do then?

683
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
We businessmen
won't care about politics.

684
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,831
Mr. Hui, what kind of business
are you dealing with?

685
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,353
My family trade tea.

686
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,309
Tea?

687
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,438
Well, can people grow tea
in the North?

688
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,073
I said, my hometown is Kwangtung.

689
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,031
Mister Fung asked me to kill you.

690
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,515
I won't let you die comfortably.

691
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,556
I will enjoy enough
before your death.

692
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,952
Daddy, he is just joking.

693
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,836
Girls shouldn't interrupt
parent's talk.

694
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,273
Look at you! I haven't seen you
for one day only,

695
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,959
your dress is so dirty,

696
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,269
Why don't you get changed now?

697
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,035
Mr. Hui, want a cigar?

698
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,548
I will do it myself.

699
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,155
- Daddy.
- Miss...

700
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,713
- I heard gun shot.
- You can't go in.

701
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,154
What's happened inside?
Let me go!

702
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,029
Get lost.

703
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,799
- Don't come close.
- Daddy.

704
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,029
Get lost.

705
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,910
- Miss...
- Let me go.

706
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,349
Miss!

707
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,239
Daddy...

708
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,270
Get lost!

709
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,790
- Why do you want to kill him?
- Leave me alone.

710
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,749
Hands off.

711
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,476
No!

712
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,438
Stop!

713
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,391
Uncle Lau,
Brother Lik is upstairs.

714
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,309
Why do you come here?

715
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,438
Since Mr. Fung's death,

716
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,798
Miss seems to be mad!

717
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,271
She has no response to anything.

718
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,549
Now, it's all a mess
in Fung's family.

719
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,556
Everyone wants to kill Mr. Hui
and take over Mr. Fung's place.

720
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,838
Mr. Ting, I hope you to forget
the hatred against Mr. Fung,

721
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,918
for the sake of Miss Fung,
can you come out to do something?

722
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,796
Ching-ching.

723
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,913
Ching-ching. Don't worry,

724
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,318
for you,
I'll fight for what you deserved.

725
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,033
Sure I will.

726
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,072
From now on,
Fung's business is my business.

727
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,511
All of you should remember...

728
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,317
the benefits
which Mr. Fung granted us.

729
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,630
Don't ruin the regulations
which are set by Mr. Fung.

730
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,068
And...

731
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,599
Hui Man-keung's life is mine.

732
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,353
No one can kill him,

733
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,194
except me.

734
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,508
The list which you want.

735
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,995
If you want to kill me,

736
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,394
just go ahead.

737
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,349
Fung King-yiu is the man behind,

738
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,913
We all know it.

739
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,639
Now you killed our foe,
when will you go back to Taiwan?

740
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,236
Don't you think
I am valuable to you anymore?

741
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,959
Everyone in Shanghai wants to
kill you now, you are in danger.

742
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,869
Leave with me.

743
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,835
Hui Man-keung.

744
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,828
Hui Man-keung.

745
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,154
Happy New Year!

746
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,233
I am going to inform Brother Lik,
keep an eye on him.

747
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,152
Brother Lik, he is on the way.

748
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,153
Ask all buddies to wait
for me out there.

749
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,592
- Brother Lik, we want...
- Listen.

750
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,036
Tonight,
either one will leave this place.

751
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,434
No matter who will go out,

752
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,037
you should take any action and
pretend nothing has happened.

753
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,676
Agree?

754
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,190
- Yes.
- Let's go.

755
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,473
Happy new year!

756
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,593
Listen, Brother Lik asked us
to wait outside.

757
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,715
Let's go!

758
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,115
Go!

759
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,793
What's the matter?
What did Brother Lik say?

760
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,997
Brother Lik said,
he wants us to wait outside.

761
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,112
Never go in no matter
what's happening inside.

762
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,035
No way!

763
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,275
This is Brother Lik's order.

764
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,112
They are buddies!

765
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,594
Brother Lik said
no one could enter.

766
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,992
Stay calm. Stay calm...

767
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,635
The old days and things
will leave after the count down

768
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,753
Why do you look for me?
Why don't you leave?

769
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,829
This is a ticket.

770
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,593
If you have chance to leave,

771
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,188
try your best
to go back to Taiwan.

772
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,589
If...

773
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,710
there is sand of Shanghai's
beach under your foot,

774
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,152
I think you'll regret
to be named Hui Man-keung.

775
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,589
No matter what you tell me,

776
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,556
I won't tell you the reason
why I killed Fung King-yiu.

777
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,513
I don't come for an explanation.

778
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,912
I just want to see...

779
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,953
how you keep your promise.

780
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,515
I think you've misunderstood.

781
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,111
I won't promise
anything to anyone.

782
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,192
Stay quiet...

783
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,153
Dear friends,
the critical moment has arrived.

784
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,550
1936 is coming soon.

785
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,754
Time flies.
Another year is coming.

786
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,673
10

787
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,309
9

788
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,079
8

789
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,590
7

790
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,074
Be nice to Ching-ching.

791
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,793
Or I will kill you, I swear.

792
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,678
5

793
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,793
4

794
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,795
3

795
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,909
2

796
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,954
1

797
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,113
Headless bullets!

798
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,872
I pay everything I owed you!

799
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,832
- Brother Keung.
- Don't hold me.

800
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,348
Brother Keung.

801
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,991
I am so happy to hear you
greeting me Brother Keung.

802
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,748
Let me walk out alone.

803
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,629
Let him go.

804
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,275
Don't you think you are great?

805
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,515
You want me to kill you.

806
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,633
Have you though of
your buddies' feeling?

807
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,788
Have you thought of my feeling?

808
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,789
I can't imagine that
you are so selfish!

809
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,675
Let him go.

810
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,469
Do you want to be hero?

811
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,631
Alright, I won't give you a hand.

812
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,148
Walk out alone.

813
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,796
Yee-yung,
don't let Fung's fellows go in.

814
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,519
Got you.
Let's go, let's go in.

815
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,192
Brother Keung...

816
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,908
Keung!

817
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,960
Brother Lik, Fung's fellows
have arrived, they are out there.

818
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,313
What'll we do?
What to do?

819
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,753
No matter what,

820
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,151
I want him leaving Shanghai safe
and alive.

821
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,790
Take him away.

822
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,355
Be careful.

823
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,995
Come on. Hurry up.

824
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,309
Mr. Ting...

825
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,673
Hui Man-keung
has been killed by me.

826
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,394
Let's go back to see Uncle Lau.

827
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,556
I want to go in and take a look,

828
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,590
Can you hear me?

829
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,348
Mr. Ting said he killed Hui
Man-Keung, don't you trust him?

830
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,193
What are you nagging?

831
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,436
Don't you think Mr.
Ting is cheating you?

832
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,520
Are you alright?
Let's go.

833
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,675
Brother Lik!

834
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,993
Brother Keung, hold it.

835
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,469
We are taking you to see doctor.

836
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,514
From now on, I want to share
what I have with you in Shanghai.

837
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,955
I am only a visitor in Shanghai.

838
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,676
I'll certainly leave
after doing my job here.

839
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,075
Let's wait and see.

840
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,232
Maybe you don't want to leave
for something unknown.
