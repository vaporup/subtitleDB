1
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,910
Look, look! They're shooting at us.

2
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,294
Fire!

3
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,614
It's just a dragon dance!
Return to your posts!

4
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:20,887
Start drumming!

5
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:21,855
Yes!

6
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:25,983
Master Wong,
watch out for the gunfire!

7
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,039
- Can you make it?
- Yes!

8
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:54,884
Give me the tail!

9
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,530
Monumental Bravery

10
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,174
Limitless Trust

11
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,619
Look over there, Wong Fei-Hung...

12
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,986
more and more foreign ships

13
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,026
are anchoring in our docks.

14
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:11,455
Britain was given Hong Kong,
Portugal was given Macao,

15
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,557
Russia occupies Hak Lung Gong.

16
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:16,830
Our country is divided

17
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,733
and I'm being sent to Vietnam

18
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,601
to fight the French.

19
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:29,075
How will the Vietnamese
react to this plaque here

20
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,475
that says "Our land, our people"?

21
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:32,952
Step forward!

22
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,009
Yes, Your Excellency!

23
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,586
Take it down! Quick!

24
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,519
Wait a minute!

25
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,693
Excellency, the Government
changes its policies so often

26
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:45,759
you could be called back soon.

27
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,797
The Government is factionalised,

28
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,238
and has reduced my army.

29
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:55,264
I fear that, while I'm gone,

30
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,267
the men that remain here

31
00:04:58,445 --> 00:04:59,673
will be dismissed.

32
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:04,106
You're the chief trainer
of my Black Flag Army.

33
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,581
I hope you'll organise them
into a local militia.

34
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,921
So that if China comes under foreign attack,

35
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,955
they can defend it.

36
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,921
Master Wong...

37
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,099
Get up!

38
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:24,571
Excellency, don't worry!
I hope you'll return soon.

39
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:27,707
Wong Fei-Hung,

40
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,533
the unjust treaties forced upon us
are written on this fan.

41
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:33,504
When you see it, think of me.

42
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,275
When I return, I hope the treaties

43
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,743
will have been erased.

44
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:20,941
Pork buns!

45
00:08:55,682 --> 00:09:02,212
God Loves the World

46
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,058
Here they come.

47
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:24,333
God Loves the World

48
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,978
God Loves the World

49
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:53,764
God Loves the World

50
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:54,796
What are you talking about?

51
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:03,105
The town's full of foreigners.

52
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,680
You're very smart

53
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,819
to do business with them.

54
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,316
I couldn't make it in China,

55
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:11,148
so I went to England.

56
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,321
Let's take a photo
with Chu's pet bird.

57
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,185
What an honour
for our feathered friend!

58
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:19,227
Don't mention it.
Let's take your picture, too!

59
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,694
Thank you very much.

60
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,163
Master Wong...

61
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,100
How is everyone?

62
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,834
Fei-Hung!

63
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,134
Great Uncle, it's been a while.
You're looking good.

64
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:34,780
Thank you!
Fei-Hung, see who I brought with me?

65
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:39,916
Master Wong! Had tea yet?
Everyone's waiting for you.

66
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,881
- 13th Aunt.
- Fei-Hung!

67
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,059
She wants to shake your hand.

68
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,661
It's a foreign custom.

69
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,229
Let me introduce you.
This is Joanna.

70
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,491
How do you do?

71
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:55,894
Do?

72
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:57,967
She's asking how do you do?

73
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,331
Say, "Thank you".

74
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,035
Oh, "kill you".

75
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,335
Fei-Hung, let's take a photo
with the bird. OK?

76
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:06,345
OK.

77
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:09,938
Sit down...

78
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,575
Fei-Hung, taking photos is simple.

79
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:13,853
How does it work?

80
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,109
Look there.

81
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:20,192
Don't move or the photo
won't look good. Sit up.

82
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,893
Ready! One, two, three!

83
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,266
What happened?

84
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:36,537
That's boiling water!

85
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,703
Are you OK? Are you hurt?

86
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:40,613
I'm all right!

87
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,708
This foreign game is too dangerous.

88
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,616
Too much powder

89
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,509
You told me not to move!

90
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:46,419
Are you all right?

91
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,286
Yes.

92
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,756
Grand Uncle,
I'm glad you asked me here

93
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,687
or you could've ended up like the bird.

94
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:54,794
Do you think so?

95
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,865
Chu!

96
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,833
I'll go back to England in a few days.

97
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,432
Yee was in England,

98
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,538
but she insisted on coming back.

99
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,572
At least this way, she won't mix
with those foreigners any more.

100
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,310
Take care of her for me.

101
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:15,977
Take care of her?

102
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,191
Chu, say something.
You're scaring me!

103
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:41,971
Anyone here?

104
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,195
I'm looking for Master Wong.

105
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:49,345
Is anyone here?

106
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,602
Who is it?

107
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:00,582
What's up?

108
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:01,885
I'm from May County.

109
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:03,418
M... ay... May... May.

110
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:06,566
I'm Leung Foon.
I want Master Wong to teach me.

111
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,368
- He...
- He's not here?

112
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:13,737
- I...
- You?

113
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:15,971
- Wong... Master Wong...
- You're Master Wong?

114
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:20,645
- No... yes!
- Ah, so you're Master Wong?!

115
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,480
I was practising kung fu on my cows,

116
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,151
when one kicked my arm.
Please take a look.

117
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:29,855
Good!

118
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,323
Not that one, this one.

119
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,863
Master Wong,
why are you plastering my leg?

120
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,795
I only hurt my arm.

121
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:47,696
Too... late... now!

122
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,671
It's stiff, Master.
Why is it stiff?

123
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,474
Are you... all right?

124
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,249
Oh, I get it!

125
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,353
You want to teach me kung fu?

126
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,723
Roll? You want me to Roll?

127
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,826
I said no, not roll.

128
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,899
I'm good. Even in plaster.
I can move like lightening.

129
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,831
Not a bad stance.

130
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,334
Stupid.

131
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,801
Still not good enough?
I'll keep trying!

132
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,307
I'll show you a few more rolls.

133
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:35,279
What's all this noise?

134
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,490
Who's he?

135
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:38,985
Master is teaching me kung fu!

136
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:41,490
Buck Teeth So
is teaching you kung fu?

137
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,324
- Who are you?
- Buck Teeth So!

138
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,556
- You're not Master Wong?
- Stupid

139
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:52,030
Buck Teeth So? Who are you?

140
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,731
He is Master Wong's student.

141
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,132
And who are you?

142
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,509
I'm also Master Wong's student, Kai.

143
00:14:57,744 --> 00:14:58,768
What happened to you?

144
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,139
Don't ask. I have to get back
to the theatre.

145
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,142
I'm off.

146
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,582
I'm off before he plasters
my other side.

147
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:22,493
Foon, have you finished mending
that hole in the roof?

148
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:24,401
The show will start soon!

149
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,334
I'm here to act,
and you make me fix the roof.

150
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,202
It's not fair! I'm scared of heights.

151
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:33,612
If you can't play this role,
how do I know you can act?

152
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:34,979
When I'm famous,

153
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,148
I'll send you up here to mend the roof.

154
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,560
What are you doing? Summersaults?

155
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,863
What are you playing at?

156
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,702
I thought it was the ship's cannon.

157
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:02,468
You wish! It's only thunder.

158
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:03,937
Cannonfire is good luck.

159
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,401
Maybe we'll all go
and mine gold in America.

160
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,739
Then we wouldn't have to suffer here.
Country bumpkins... so stupid!

161
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,317
Don't move or you'll spoil it!

162
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:14,753
Are you ready?

163
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:17,817
A foreign woman speaking Chinese?

164
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,559
China will be taken over
by foreigners soon.

165
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:31,366
Wait for me!

166
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:34,573
- One, two...
- Wait for me!

167
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:42,876
Wait for you?

168
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,466
It's stuck!

169
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,870
Foon, where the hell are you?

170
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,610
I'm changing!

171
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,380
Hurry up! Don't be so lazy!

172
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,952
Foon, you brag about your kung fu.

173
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,915
You can't even climb the roof
to fix something.

174
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:26,650
You broke the stage
with a somersault.

175
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,461
You show me how to do it
if you're so good.

176
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,230
Miss, I had your dirty clothes

177
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:38,164
washed and ironed.

178
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:39,336
Thank you!

179
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,108
Do you need fresh water?

180
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,942
No, I'm almost done.

181
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:16,875
Who is it?

182
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,269
You're naked!

183
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,118
I'll invite you to our new show.

184
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,024
Thank you, Boss!

185
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:34,322
- Take care, the path is slippery!
- Bye bye

186
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,930
A Chinese
pretending to be a foreigner!

187
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:20,956
Miss...

188
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,106
...your umbrella!

189
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,147
Sir, what's your hurry?

190
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,290
Come up,
there are lots of girls here!

191
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:39,945
It takes so long.

192
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:43,255
Don't move!

193
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:51,391
A gunshot! What's the matter?
Who is it?

194
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:57,485
Master!

195
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:00,633
Master!

196
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:09,179
- Master!
- It's Wing. Open the door.

197
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:11,611
Master!

198
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,291
You opened the door just in time.
I nearly broke it down!

199
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,520
Have lunch with me sometime.

200
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:24,592
Excuse me!

201
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,398
Kai, who's been shot?

202
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:29,860
The greengrocer.

203
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:30,803
Who shot him?

204
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,301
I don't know. Ask Master.

205
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:39,711
Buck Teeth So, if I wasn't here,
you'd have broken that!

206
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,642
Por... ky... Porky...

207
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,575
My name's Wing. Call me Porky
again and I'll get mad.

208
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:46,818
Back so long and you still
can't speak Chinese.

209
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:51,919
- Por... ky...
- Bu... ck... Tee... th.

210
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,023
So, bring the medicine.

211
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:55,588
You can't handle the medicine!

212
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:56,920
What are you arguing about?

213
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:00,154
Master, I'm teaching him
how to be Chinese.

214
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,562
- Give me The Magic Healer.
- The Magic Healer.

215
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:05,464
3, they're all 3 characters.

216
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,239
Master, you know I can't read!

217
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:10,707
And you laugh at those
who can't speak Chinese?

218
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:12,845
Come on, So.

219
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:19,776
Powder for Seven Cuts.
Blood-Clotting Powder.

220
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,544
So is from America.

221
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,049
He studied medicine there

222
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,626
and learns bone setting here.

223
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,526
Then he must be smart.

224
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:30,894
Master, here's the water.

225
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:32,631
Finally.

226
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,199
Take a rest, you'll be fine.

227
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:38,603
Master, this bullet is from a shotgun.

228
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:39,705
Let's bandage him.

229
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:42,630
There are many ships, he can't tell

230
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:43,966
American and British flags apart.

231
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:45,972
He boarded the wrong ship

232
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,573
and got shot.

233
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:51,816
The country's being sold off
piece by piece.

234
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,749
When they argue, it's we who suffer.

235
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:59,790
We can't accept this kind of
treatment any more!

236
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,351
The Manchurians have taken our land.

237
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:06,593
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country!

238
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,326
Brothers of the Local Militia,
let's fight!

239
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,332
- Ca... ca... calm down!
- You're lecturing me?

240
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:19,001
Por... ky...

241
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,770
Watch your mouth! I'm your senior!

242
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:22,876
- Wing!
- Master!

243
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,710
You're too rash. Keep out of this.

244
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:30,820
This is a matter of life or death.

245
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,919
I must meet with the authorities

246
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:34,825
and the Westerners.

247
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:40,222
Otherwise how are we to survive in Fatshan?

248
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,711
Excuse me sir,
you would like something?

249
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:05,550
So, you explain to the captain.

250
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,092
Yes!

251
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,621
Excuse me,
we have an appointment in this restaurant

252
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:16,457
with Mr. Jackson of the Sino Pacific Corporation
and General Wickens of the British Forces.

253
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:18,834
I presume they would have
reserved a table for us.

254
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,895
So we can begin to discuss
this matter more leisurely.

255
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,539
This is my master, Wong Fei Hung.

256
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,040
And I'd be grateful
if you'd show us the table.

257
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:30,908
How... come... your... English...
is... so... fluent?

258
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:31,817
This way please.

259
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,452
Why so many daggers?

260
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:42,493
Excuse me, sir.

261
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:45,592
Your menu, sir.

262
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,172
So, ask them to bring us
some dim sum.

263
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,747
Foon, your job
is to check tickets today.

264
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:11,580
I'm here to learn acting
not check tickets.

265
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:12,746
It doesn't suit me.

266
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,123
It can't be helped.

267
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,625
The others have gone
to America to mine gold.

268
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,662
America?! Gold mining?

269
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,560
Boss, is there really gold there?

270
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,163
Would I lie to you?

271
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:25,802
It's all in the newspaper.

272
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,600
I'd go too if I didn't have to
run this place.

273
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,272
Newspaper?! What newspaper?

274
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,579
They're here for protection money.

275
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,175
You haven't paid?

276
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,180
Yes I have,
but these thugs are from Shaho.

277
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:44,122
How dare they make trouble
so far from their turf?

278
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:45,915
If they mess with me, they've had it!

279
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:47,623
Yes...

280
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:48,493
What are you doing?

281
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:49,887
I know you know some kung fu.

282
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,826
Didn't you say you
wanted to show off your stuff?

283
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,522
Here's your chance.

284
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,668
Boss, I'm not that good.

285
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:59,171
They've come to pay their respects

286
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,337
especially to you.

287
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,538
I'm being set up. Stop!

288
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:08,809
Boss, open the gate!
Boss, open up. Quick!

289
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:12,016
Oh, there's no daytime show.
No tickets left.

290
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:16,678
- Thank you, Boss. I'll come another time.
- Hey kid, come on down!

291
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:20,616
I came all this way, and no show.

292
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,191
Next time I won't bother.

293
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:29,525
I know you're Foon.
You've got something to say?

294
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:30,762
I'm just the ticket collector.

295
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:31,970
We're the collectors here.

296
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,931
You must be quite a guy...

297
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:37,533
facing us all alone.

298
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:38,665
You've got guts!

299
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,105
Got guts...

300
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,774
You must be joking.

301
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:44,711
Let me buy you a gift.

302
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,346
No need.

303
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:52,949
No need for gifts,
just give me a hand.

304
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,451
Go on, chop it off.

305
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:57,960
Chop my hand off?
I'll chop your mother's head off!

306
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:04,465
Don't go!

307
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,898
Come on!
Me against all of you isn't fair!

308
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:11,241
Let's fight one on one another time!

309
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:14,173
Why not now?

310
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,784
Get him! Stop!

311
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,324
Someone's fighting in the theatre.

312
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:36,968
They're armed!

313
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:42,505
Stop! Stop! Get him!

314
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,408
Excuse me, excuse me!

315
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:44,636
What's happening?
A fight!

316
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,606
Fight outside,

317
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,746
we're doing business here. Out!

318
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:52,341
What is it, brother?

319
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:55,447
They want money,
and they want to fight me for it.

320
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:56,951
There are too many of them.

321
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,157
Kill that asshole!

322
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,259
Sounds like trouble.
Let's take a look.

323
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:14,869
That's Porky,
one of Wong's disciples.

324
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:17,471
Never met him.

325
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,838
Porky, out of respect for your master.

326
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,008
I'll let you off.

327
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:26,778
You're Master Wong's disciple?

328
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:27,686
I am!

329
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,378
I saw this young doctor
at Bo Chi Lam.

330
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:30,322
Buck Teeth So

331
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:31,990
That Chinese American.

332
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,021
- Foon!
- What?

333
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,083
I'm not kidding,

334
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:37,719
if you don't bring a hand to Shaho...

335
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,291
they'll be digging
your grave in Fatshan!

336
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:43,258
Let's go back to Shaho!

337
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,197
What? Turning chicken just
because Wong's disciple is here?

338
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:48,406
You want a hand?
This pig will donate one!

339
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,107
Big brother, what shall we do?

340
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,642
Do? Tear them apart!

341
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,023
Brother Wing, this one's for him!

342
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,317
He can have it for free.

343
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,091
You asshole!

344
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:46,128
Shaho's stupid, Shaho's dumb...

345
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,471
You want to mess with me?
I'll beat you to death.

346
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:12,920
Have some refreshments,

347
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,059
enjoy the show!

348
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:28,932
Take that! Hold it!

349
00:30:37,783 --> 00:30:41,742
Add a little water,
make a perfect brew.

350
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:44,949
Who's throwing boiling water?

351
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,521
Find him! Go look up there!

352
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,118
Who threw the boiling water?
Out! Go!

353
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,961
You old bastard,
it must have been you!

354
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,325
No it wasn't. I'm just eating.

355
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:55,429
Really?

356
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:09,810
And that, Your Excellency, is the
position of Her Majesty's Government.

357
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,517
May I suggest that
we leave it at that?

358
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:15,186
Your Government is most generous.

359
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:16,488
Wong Fei-Hung,

360
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:19,417
Wickens of the British forces

361
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,017
and Mr. Jackson of
the Sino Pacific Corporation.

362
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,419
They've kindly agreed
not to press charges.

363
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,527
So stop seeking damages
for the greengrocer.

364
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:30,163
This is unfair.
The people are outraged.

365
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,427
Outraged?!

366
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,701
Wong, you have no authority.

367
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,803
You are a mere civilian.

368
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:39,542
Who are you to negotiate?

369
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,373
This is a new age

370
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:42,844
of international cooperation.

371
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:46,740
It's better to keep the peace.

372
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,848
These rolls are made from our flour.

373
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:55,820
So you appreciate western food?

374
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:59,157
The foreigners draw boundaries here

375
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,422
and set up forbidden areas.

376
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,365
If we fight amongst ourselves

377
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,764
and keep bowing to them,

378
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,036
we'll lose more than flour.

379
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,307
I know you are friends with Lau,
Commander of the Black Flag Army.

380
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,340
He doesn't follow orders

381
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,143
from the Central Government.

382
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:21,085
I've been sent here to watch you.

383
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:22,785
I intend to set an example
here in Fatshan.

384
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,591
Are you all right?

385
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:43,768
What is all this?

386
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,210
Master, it's our Local Militia.

387
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:55,916
Master Wong!

388
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:57,719
Stop them!

389
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,224
Stop!

390
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:04,493
Don't fight!

391
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,921
Kai, I told you
to tell them not to fight!

392
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:12,403
He told you not to fight!

393
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:18,570
Put down your weapons!
You still want to fight?

394
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:23,982
Don't move.

395
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:26,715
I expect you'd have an explanation

396
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:29,944
for this disgraceful intrusion.
Good day!

397
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:32,388
General Wickens.

398
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:45,700
- You're not bad!
- Of course!

399
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:51,074
Boss, that looks like Wong Fei-Hung.

400
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:52,467
Master Wong Fei-Hung.

401
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:54,876
He's outnumbered! Let's take him on!

402
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:00,084
Don't fight!

403
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,518
Don't fight!

404
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,452
Did he hit you? Don't fight!

405
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:12,964
Don't fight, Kai!

406
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,658
I told you not to fight!

407
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:19,928
I said don't fight!
You're still fighting?!

408
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,068
Are you sure?
They're coming. Let me go!

409
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:33,349
Boss, are you all right?

410
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,850
- Who kicked me?
- I don't know!

411
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,921
- Have you taken them on?
- Yes, we have!

412
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,189
Carry on!

413
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,733
- Buck Teeth So!
- Stupid!

414
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,628
I'm so sorry!

415
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,076
So, tell them

416
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:07,986
it's all a misunderstanding.

417
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,911
No need to explain.

418
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,517
If China had no forbidden areas,

419
00:35:13,692 --> 00:35:14,454
we'd all be in danger.

420
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,954
Master, this alien can speak Chinese.

421
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,292
You still want to fight?

422
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,228
Don't call me an alien, you devil!

423
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,862
Listen, we're here to do business.

424
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,232
Don't let this kind of crap

425
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:33,776
keep us from making big money

426
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:36,612
Otherwise you'll get yourself
in real trouble.

427
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:40,848
Goodbye, aliens!

428
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:43,478
Tiger let's go!

429
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,393
Shoot on sight. Run! Run!

430
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:53,726
The authorities are here!

431
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,697
Let's get out of here!

432
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:00,933
Stop! Stay where you are!

433
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,504
Drop your weapons.
Why are the Local Militia fighting?

434
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:06,406
Where's Porky? Gone?

435
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,077
Don't move or we'll shoot.

436
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:15,781
Wong, this area's administered
by the foreigners,

437
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:17,387
yet the Local Militia
dare make trouble here!

438
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:18,849
You're their leader.

439
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,386
Explain yourself!

440
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:25,460
Excellency, as trained soldiers,
these men wouldn't act

441
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:26,855
without a good reason.

442
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:29,863
Soldiers? They're trash
the government discarded.

443
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:31,830
They're under our command now.

444
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:33,004
Excellency...

445
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,630
Tell them report to City Hall,

446
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,365
or get arrested!

447
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,242
Excellency!

448
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:40,803
Master Wong will pay
for all the damages.

449
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:41,707
Yes, Your Excellency!

450
00:36:54,092 --> 00:37:00,895
Beware of fire!
Beware of thieves!

451
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,001
Master, I've lost my appetite.

452
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,877
All this trouble was started
by a gang from Shaho.

453
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,740
Now we have to report to City Hall.

454
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:17,978
Are they going to arrest us?

455
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:23,047
Master!

456
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:29,126
Sit down! City Hall's authorised
to look into this.

457
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,558
If it's a set-up,
they'll find out.

458
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:33,689
So, let's eat. Until the verdict is known,

459
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,295
this'll be our last meal together.

460
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,036
Let's eat.

461
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,452
Attention, Militia men,
prepare to eat.

462
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:05,137
Pick up vegetables!

463
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:09,574
Eat rice!

464
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Swallow!

465
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Pick up vegetables!

466
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,500
Eat rice!

467
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,000
Swallow!

468
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:39,697
13th Aunt!

469
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:41,764
Don't worry,

470
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,828
your men will be fine.

471
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,404
It's late, why aren't you sleeping?

472
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:51,905
I want to take your measurements for a suit.

473
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,012
A suit?

474
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,469
Why would I want a western suit?

475
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,206
It's for when you go abroad.

476
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:06,019
13th Aunt,
is the West really so wonderful?

477
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,724
What do we have to learn from the foreigners?

478
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,857
They invented the steam engine

479
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:15,626
and many other things.

480
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,025
We must move with the times.

481
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:24,034
When we have time,
you must tell me more

482
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,270
about the world beyond China.

483
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:47,731
13th Aunt,
if the western world was so great,

484
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,789
why did you come back?

485
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:55,738
There are still some things here
they haven't got.

486
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,441
Such as?

487
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:01,376
People.

488
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:12,748
I missed some people very much.

489
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:16,853
I was abroad for two years,

490
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:18,689
but my heart was here.

491
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:21,798
You were always in my thoughts.

492
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:24,794
You are very kind.

493
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,600
- 13th Aunt!
- What's wrong?

494
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,970
I thought... No, it's nothing!

495
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:35,469
Fei-Hung, you and I
are relatives by name,

496
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,680
not by blood.

497
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:38,907
We were raised together,

498
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,148
don't call me 13th Aunt.

499
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:44,083
What else should I call you?

500
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:45,289
I'll do it.

501
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:55,898
What's this? It doesn't matter!

502
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,430
It doesn't matter?

503
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:01,336
Of course it does,
one must be precise.

504
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:04,699
Chinese shouldn't wear suits.

505
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,242
Chinese are Chinese,

506
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:07,111
Westerners Western.

507
00:41:08,947 --> 00:41:11,006
There will be railways
and a telegraph company soon.

508
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:12,682
Everything will change.

509
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,517
China will change with the world.

510
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:20,992
You're right. Western guns

511
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,722
and ships are already here.

512
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,325
Everything is changing.

513
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,263
What will we change into? Who knows?

514
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,428
I appreciate your gift,
but you keep it.

515
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:36,766
When all Chinese wear suits,

516
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:37,970
I'll wear one.

517
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:09,567
Come greet the God of Fortune!
Here I am, the God of Fortune!

518
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:12,174
Get out of my way, you bloody priest!

519
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:14,936
Fortune?

520
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:18,572
Sir, we already bought
the God of Fortune.

521
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:20,876
Come greet the God of Fortune!

522
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:24,283
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune!
Sir...

523
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:28,490
Did you buy protection from me,
or the other guy?

524
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:32,488
He's rotting in a ditch.
Want to see him?

525
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,397
Just buy a new one!

526
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,166
If I pay him, what happens
when the other guy comes?

527
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:39,562
Sir, do you need help?

528
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:40,634
You should join us!

529
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,332
- Life is tough right now!
- Give it all

530
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,134
so we can take care of you.

531
00:42:46,378 --> 00:42:48,005
Sir, don't clean me out,

532
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,339
give me a break.

533
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,506
And who'll give me a break?
Hand it over!

534
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:54,982
Robbing your own people!

535
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:58,756
It's Master Wong!

536
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:00,788
You're from Shaho?

537
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,460
Come with me to City Hall.

538
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:03,925
Save me!

539
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:24,315
Stabbing your own people?

540
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,652
Get going! Run!

541
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:42,199
Quick! Run!

542
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,327
Where have you cowards run to?

543
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:00,783
Damn you!

544
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:12,251
It's too high!

545
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:21,871
Run

546
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,701
All right! That's amazing!

547
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:26,066
Did you see
the speed of that kick?

548
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:27,406
- Did you see it?
- No, it was too fast.

549
00:44:27,779 --> 00:44:32,045
Listen to me. This man is a gangster.

550
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:33,678
I'm taking him to City Hall.

551
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,082
Please come and testify against him.

552
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,984
Incredible!

553
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,451
What a jump!

554
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:44,492
Boss,
he demanded protection money from you.

555
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:46,855
Come with me and be a witness.

556
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:48,260
Me?

557
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:52,734
And fear for my life,
like the theatre boss does?

558
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:54,334
You two were practising kung fu in there,

559
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,269
I didn't see any fighting.

560
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:03,112
In America,
people have to walk carefully.

561
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:04,707
Why?

562
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,714
Because they might trip on all the gold.

563
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:10,452
- Is that true?
- There's more!

564
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,651
If you wash your face in the river,
you'll find gold.

565
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:15,454
Is it really that wonderful?

566
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,922
Of course it is!

567
00:45:17,195 --> 00:45:18,389
One visit to America is worth

568
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:21,063
a lifetime of work in China.

569
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,358
Come on, take a leaflet!

570
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,070
There's one for everyone.

571
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,398
People in America wear
dark glasses day and night.

572
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,799
It's so bright it hurts your eyes.

573
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,774
You can't pick up gold
if you're blind.

574
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:42,608
My poor lost sheep,
God's Kingdom belongs to you.

575
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:45,955
You're promoting America, too?

576
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,953
Material things are transient.

577
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:54,530
Only Jesus is the truth.
Come to Jesus. He forgives all sins.

578
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,689
I arrested a criminal today.

579
00:45:57,468 --> 00:45:59,265
Will Jesus be my witness?

580
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:31,758
Beware of thieves.
Beware of fire.

581
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,298
Boss!

582
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:39,542
- Boss, Are you over there?
- I'm here!

583
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:44,481
Get ready!

584
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:03,162
- Master!
- How are you?

585
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:05,568
Are you crazy? Fans in this weather.

586
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:07,604
So, the Governor has locked up
the Local Militia?

587
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:10,371
He won't release them
till the suspects are caught.

588
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:12,709
Master!

589
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:17,446
I can't be a witness
because I'm a suspect.

590
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,783
They even let Hung of Shaho go.

591
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:25,445
When will our men be released?

592
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:27,748
When a witness comes forward.

593
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,087
Master, what about Foon?

594
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,224
- Foon? Do you know him?
- Yes.

595
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:40,968
You must be mixed up in this.

596
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:42,597
What are you hiding?

597
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:49,075
I...
Master, you don't always trust me.

598
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:50,804
So, I...

599
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:52,146
What? Speak!

600
00:47:52,683 --> 00:48:00,283
Mas... Mas... Master... The... There...

601
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,765
Fire...

602
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,960
Calm down, So. Don't panic!

603
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:12,659
Master!

604
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:14,538
So!..

605
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,035
Master, what shall we do?

606
00:48:21,379 --> 00:48:22,505
Those arrows came from the roof.

607
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,144
I'm coming!

608
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:27,346
Never mind me.
Gather... the valuables!

609
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:32,115
Kai, get your weapon.
We'll take them on.

610
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,390
Wing, put out the fire. I'm off.

611
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,660
Alone?

612
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:48,238
Damn!

613
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:49,603
So! Here!

614
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,408
Goddamn steps!

615
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:06,450
His Excellency's fan?! Here it is!

616
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,329
Wow, the roof's like a furnace!

617
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:21,329
It's like hell down here!

618
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,402
Someone's on the roof. Shoot him!

619
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:39,022
It's Master Wong. Run!

620
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:57,836
Bo Chi Lam is on fire!

621
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:04,407
Don't forget the camera, hurry up!

622
00:50:08,486 --> 00:50:09,384
Bo Chi Lam will be lost forever.

623
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:15,988
What Are you doing?

624
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:17,558
Taking a photo of Bo Chi Lam.

625
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:18,854
You'll be burned alive!

626
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,290
You're blocking the sign!

627
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,659
A little more, I can't see you.

628
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:25,133
Should we wait for Master?

629
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:29,369
The... roof... is... is on fire!

630
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,108
So, look this way!

631
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,112
Kai, shift a little to the right.

632
00:51:25,196 --> 00:51:26,561
I thought I had it with me.

633
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:30,532
But I was taking pictures
of the clinic. So, I...

634
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,431
You're just like the foreigners!

635
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:36,470
Don't ever bring this

636
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,169
into the clinic again...

637
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:43,203
or I'll throw it away!

638
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:58,525
His Excellency the Governor is here!

639
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:11,134
Wong Fei-Hung, you open kung-fu schools,

640
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:13,071
triad societies...

641
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:16,939
divide up the town
and run illegal businesses.

642
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:18,714
Now other triads take revenge...

643
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,114
The burning of Bo Chi Lam
is your own fault.

644
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,215
It's time to mend your ways!

645
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,483
Excellency,
mine is not a triad society.

646
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,888
If the authority

647
00:52:32,263 --> 00:52:34,288
labels martial arts illegal,

648
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:40,260
then our grand tradition will be lost.

649
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,266
So when we are attacked,

650
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,970
how will we defend ourselves?

651
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,571
Is that what you call
preserving the peace?

652
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:52,075
You can't even save your clinic
and you dare lecture me!

653
00:52:53,117 --> 00:52:56,143
It's your job
to investigate the fire.

654
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:57,952
You tell me, who did it?

655
00:52:59,323 --> 00:53:00,023
I don't know.

656
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:02,516
You don't know?!
You're hiding something.

657
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:08,891
Wing!

658
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:14,093
Wing, what are you doing?

659
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,038
Master!

660
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:19,665
Can I come in?

661
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:22,006
Foreign devil!

662
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:22,976
- Wing!
- Master!

663
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:26,747
Go on like this,
and you can stop calling me Master.

664
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:27,751
Don't go.

665
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,646
You must have a complaint
against Fei-Hung.

666
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,554
You can tell me.

667
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:39,420
Wong Fei-Hung,
I know who set Bo Chi Lam on fire.

668
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:42,156
I can be your witness.

669
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,191
Check if anyone's from Shaho.

670
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:45,168
Yes.

671
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:46,961
- Hey, are you from Shaho.
- No!

672
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:49,462
Not the way you talk.

673
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:51,941
So many people!

674
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:56,144
Boss, looks like
the Governor's going to arrest you.

675
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,275
Goddamn!
That Jesuit must have squealed.

676
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,417
Shouldn't we go and hide back home?

677
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:03,386
Never! We're afraid of the Governor.

678
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:05,749
He's afraid of the foreigners.

679
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:08,349
So let's find some
influential foreigners!

680
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:11,994
Wait for me.

681
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:16,724
We want to speak to Mr. Jackson.

682
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,794
Do you understand what I'm saying?

683
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:21,169
What's going on down there?

684
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:23,931
Damn, we've no English. Try harder.

685
00:54:24,108 --> 00:54:30,513
Please, please let us in
to see Mr. Jackson.

686
00:54:30,714 --> 00:54:37,552
We all want to see Mr. Jackson.
Jackson...

687
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:40,489
I'd better have a cigar.

688
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:42,784
I don't like cigars.

689
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:50,289
If I keep a dog,
it'll guard my house.

690
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:52,399
You are wanted by the Governor.

691
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,501
What good are you to us?

692
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,037
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

693
00:54:57,441 --> 00:55:00,171
But I am afraid that
without a leader,

694
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:02,503
my brothers' talents
will go to waste.

695
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:05,481
You came all this way
to make money,

696
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:08,313
by sending so many Chinese
to America.

697
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,951
Why don't I give you some women

698
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:12,922
to ship over?

699
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:16,982
No, we don't allow
the labourers to breed.

700
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:19,829
Don't allow them to have descendents.
Otherwise they'd stay for good.

701
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,993
Not as wives as hookers.

702
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:25,758
As many as you want.

703
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:29,937
It's Wong who's the problem.

704
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:32,934
Dare you kill him for me?

705
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:49,421
- Master Wong?!
- Yes...

706
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,623
I'll invite him to the show tomorrow.

707
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:54,093
He won't get out alive.

708
00:55:54,398 --> 00:55:56,958
Or the authorities.

709
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:21,757
Do you hear noise?

710
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:27,457
Something just dropped
into the water.

711
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:51,721
Wing, the Governor is after
the Shaho Gang.

712
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:54,050
Foon, where have you been?

713
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:55,782
I have to go back to the theatre.
Come with me.

714
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,357
Wait. Let me lock up first.

715
00:56:59,096 --> 00:56:59,926
OK!

716
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,356
- Hey, come out first.
- Oh, right!

717
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,172
This is Wing.

718
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:16,044
He'll solve all your problems.

719
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:18,146
Master Wong's students. Welcome!

720
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:20,483
Don't worry.
I'll check the tickets for you.

721
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:21,741
I like gate duty.

722
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:24,182
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

723
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:53,677
Tickets. Show me your tickets.

724
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:56,652
Stay in line.

725
00:57:58,622 --> 00:57:59,554
Do you have tickets?

726
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,854
Tickets?

727
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,993
Do you know who I am?
Look at the poster.

728
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:08,220
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.

729
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:10,628
And I'm Wing! No ticket? Go!

730
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:13,730
The show's starting
and you dare tell us to leave?

731
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:16,338
OK, we'll go, you'll regret this!
We'll go! We'll go!

732
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:18,707
Tickets...

733
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,502
Brother Wing, let's go in.

734
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:23,039
No hurry, the actors aren't here.

735
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:24,202
Thank you so much.

736
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:28,315
Have you seen Wonder Ho
and White Gent?

737
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:30,213
They tried to barge in,

738
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,216
I told them to piss off.

739
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,082
What? They're the actors!

740
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:35,284
Who will act then?

741
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:36,983
Then we don't have a show.

742
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:37,990
You stay here,

743
00:58:38,161 --> 00:58:40,823
I'll go and fetch them.
Tickets...

744
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:50,338
My Master's coming!
I'm out of here!

745
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,002
Excuse me!

746
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:54,602
Mr. Jackson, let me introduce you
to the Reverend Father.

747
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:56,176
Please to meet you, sir.

748
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:57,778
General Wickens, please take a seat.

749
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:00,540
So you accepted the invitation!

750
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:01,451
Please!

751
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:11,251
13th Aunt!
Master Wong!

752
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,555
Why so formal?

753
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,690
Relatives must respect

754
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:19,360
the rule of seniority.

755
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,427
OK, let's just watch the show!

756
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:27,401
Please...

757
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:33,705
Wing, we're in trouble.

758
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:35,175
Master's here. I don't want to stay.

759
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:38,086
The actors are gone.

760
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:39,347
You're going. What'll I do?

761
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:41,887
I can sing.
So what?

762
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:44,386
I can act a little. Let's go!

763
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,552
You dare sing on stage

764
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:47,889
in front of your Master?

765
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,823
Who's going to recognise us
with make up on?

766
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:54,299
OK, let's take a chance.
Come backstage.

767
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:56,769
Lucky you got us

768
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,168
or the show would be cancelled.

769
00:59:58,408 --> 00:59:59,204
I'm amazed you recognised me!

770
00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:00,465
Isn't that Wing?

771
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:04,003
Who's Wing? Let's go! Come on!

772
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:05,948
The White Snake is now a Fat Snake.

773
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:26,932
Porky! Porky!

774
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,807
Hey, Porky Wing's changed profession.

775
01:00:32,476 --> 01:00:33,807
Where will we buy our pork
from now on?

776
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:36,112
Wing, again!

777
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:49,559
Nonsense!

778
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:50,817
I made him do it, don't blame him.

779
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:51,983
Don't blame him.

780
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:53,821
Pack up and never come back.

781
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:55,361
Never come back!

782
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,491
Brother Wing, I'll join you
in the pork business.

783
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:18,621
Watch out!

784
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:29,891
Get down!

785
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:36,802
Seal all exits!

786
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:40,668
Lead the foreigners out.

787
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:41,544
Yes, sir!

788
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:43,702
There's fighting outside.

789
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:49,614
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.

790
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,980
Go after them!

791
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:55,254
13th Aunt!

792
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:02,164
Stop it!

793
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:08,234
The Troops.
Yes, sir.

794
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:09,272
Get ready.

795
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:13,643
Don't shoot at the audience.

796
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,272
Don't shoot!

797
01:02:46,977 --> 01:02:50,674
Son...

798
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:57,186
You fool.

799
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:04,226
Shoot him.

800
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:06,862
No!

801
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:11,194
Limestone powder.

802
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,170
Close your eyes.

803
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:19,675
Stay down!

804
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,856
It's not Wong?
Forget him!

805
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:39,657
Protect His Excellency!

806
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:53,709
Come on.

807
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:57,478
Gun!

808
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:00,983
Take cover.

809
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:09,256
13th Aunt, take the gun
and protect the reverend.

810
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:12,560
They're here for me. Keep away!

811
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:27,606
Reverend Father!

812
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:03,946
Master, take the pole!

813
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,897
Master, I'll help you!

814
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,106
The floor's too thin.

815
01:05:37,414 --> 01:05:39,314
Master, I'll help you!
Oh, and who are you?

816
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,308
Protect 13th Aunt! I don't need help.

817
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,710
Leave her alone!

818
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:27,889
Tiger, use your gun.
You idiot, shoot him dead.

819
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:33,002
Shoot them.

820
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:41,068
No!

821
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:44,246
Reverend Father.

822
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:46,982
Run

823
01:06:49,486 --> 01:06:52,649
Reverend Father!

824
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,552
Wing, come and protect 13th Aunt.

825
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:02,524
They've gone backstage!

826
01:07:23,286 --> 01:07:24,378
Let's see you fight up here!

827
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:29,589
Damn it!

828
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:44,373
Why did you ambush me?

829
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,299
It's you who ambushed me!

830
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,702
Foon? He's Foon?

831
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:50,576
It's dangerous here.
There are killers inside.

832
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:53,973
Question him!

833
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:56,649
Foon, what're you doing?

834
01:07:56,853 --> 01:07:57,553
How would I know?

835
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:58,952
He's been hitting me

836
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:00,144
ever since he came in!

837
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,857
Don't move!

838
01:08:03,526 --> 01:08:04,823
You say don't move,
but you still hit me!

839
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,195
Let's all stop this fighting!

840
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:09,297
Let's go!

841
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:16,804
Master Wong, don't move!

842
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,039
Your Excellency.
Silence!

843
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:23,611
Excellency, they left something.

844
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,347
Glory to the Militia
Death to foreigners

845
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:31,654
Weren't all the

846
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:32,949
Local Militia arrested?

847
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,758
How many have you sheltered?

848
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,456
Your Excellency, I'm being framed!

849
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:44,266
Don't listen to him!

850
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:45,832
Arrest these Shaho thugs!

851
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:47,102
What Shaho thugs?

852
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:50,598
That's the second time you've hit me.

853
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,840
Find out the truth
before you lay blame.

854
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:54,074
The truth?

855
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:00,214
He's taking protection money!

856
01:09:00,683 --> 01:09:02,207
What? My Master?

857
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:03,383
Yes! That's him!

858
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:07,048
Master Wong? Isn't he from Shaho?

859
01:09:07,557 --> 01:09:09,354
Where's Shaho? Near the Yellow River?

860
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:14,189
You don't need to explain.

861
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:18,523
My men will soon arrest
your other members.

862
01:09:19,469 --> 01:09:21,403
But I'm going to arrest you first

863
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:24,369
and close your clinic.

864
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,074
Then let's see you make trouble!

865
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,406
Many people have been injured.

866
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:30,703
Let me help them, then I'll go with you.

867
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:34,876
All right, go ahead.

868
01:09:35,585 --> 01:09:36,745
You'll be guarded.

869
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:38,951
If anything happens,

870
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:42,123
I'll execute you on the spot.

871
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,290
Don't move. You're bleeding.

872
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:51,798
So, fetch the medicine.
OK!

873
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:56,967
Go away. Can't you see
the eviction notice?

874
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:05,805
That doesn't give you permission
to steal our stuff.

875
01:10:06,316 --> 01:10:07,016
Give them back!

876
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:10,546
You dare to hit us?! Go away!

877
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,213
Don't you have anything better to do?

878
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:14,921
Master, they were stealing,

879
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:16,125
I stopped them.

880
01:10:16,326 --> 01:10:18,817
So what? Do you want to fight?

881
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:19,962
I'll fight with you.

882
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:20,696
OK, let's go!

883
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:22,731
No! I mean I'll fight you!

884
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,295
Master, how can I fight you?

885
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:26,568
Where'd you like to be hit?

886
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,069
Is it here? Here?

887
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,441
You want me arrested right away?

888
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,736
If not, don't stop me from saving lives.
Master!

889
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:38,247
Master!

890
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:40,209
Stop acting up!

891
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:44,519
We'll arrest you,
if you get in our way.

892
01:10:47,457 --> 01:10:48,719
Porky's smart,

893
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:49,983
escaping arrest this way.

894
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:03,066
Hit me! Such restraint!

895
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,160
Mr. Cheng!

896
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:27,552
Still bleeding.
Fetch me the coagulant!

897
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:31,330
Coagulant!

898
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:52,082
He's dead. Tell his family.

899
01:12:02,532 --> 01:12:03,232
So...

900
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,150
Fei-Hung!

901
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:24,347
What's this tattoo?

902
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,117
It reads, "Jackson".

903
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,917
Is it his ship's name?

904
01:12:33,763 --> 01:12:35,958
Don't be scared. I'm Wong Fei-Hung.

905
01:12:36,566 --> 01:12:38,363
You're badly hurt.

906
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,499
If you move, you'll tear the wound.

907
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:44,867
You're Master Wong? Help me!

908
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:49,737
Get up. Where are you from?

909
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:54,040
America!
America?

910
01:12:56,052 --> 01:12:58,612
We crossed seas and were

911
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:01,822
denied medicine when we were ill.

912
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,127
Many were thrown overboard.

913
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:12,224
In America,

914
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:13,629
we were branded like pigs.

915
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,539
We were cheated
by the Chinese dealers here.

916
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,998
We signed contracts,

917
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,804
paid for food and passage.

918
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:25,406
Paid for so many things.

919
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:30,681
Those who tried to escape were killed.

920
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:35,420
I came back to China.

921
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:40,153
I... l... Master Wong...

922
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:43,492
Don't worry, you're home now.

923
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,195
Let me see

924
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:47,561
if we can find your family.

925
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:51,267
Try not to think too much.

926
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:57,002
Kai! Keep his contract
with the foreigners secret.

927
01:13:57,513 --> 01:13:59,947
Or the Governor will arrest him.

928
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,849
I understand.

929
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,777
Going to America's better

930
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:08,183
than staying here.

931
01:14:08,524 --> 01:14:16,954
Don't miss out! ...Come on...

932
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,129
Take a look! You want one?
Go to America? How?

933
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:21,461
Take one. You want one, too?

934
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:24,903
The same America as in the newspaper?

935
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:29,507
If you want to go, pay an exit tax,
passage, rental, blanket and food.

936
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:32,009
You can get a 3 year contract.

937
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:33,482
It costs 2 years' salary?!

938
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:35,545
You haven't got any money?
No.

939
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:38,481
Then don't even think about it!
Shove off!

940
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:42,713
You want one?
It's a land full of gold!

941
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,356
A fight's about to start over there!

942
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,993
A fight?
Let's go and watch it. Come on!

943
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:50,894
Don't go!

944
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:58,865
You dare show off in front of

945
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:01,508
my house and hit my disciple.

946
01:15:01,944 --> 01:15:02,933
What's your name?

947
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:04,842
Master Yim.

948
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:36,642
I warn you.
My swordplay is unmatched.

949
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,640
You're a guest,
so I'll let you strike three times.

950
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:44,551
On guard!

951
01:16:05,675 --> 01:16:06,375
Second strike!

952
01:16:33,903 --> 01:16:36,394
Just two strikes
and you already draw your sword?

953
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:41,273
You're not my match.
Let's forget it!

954
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,111
Don't go!

955
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:14,436
You dare strike me from behind?

956
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,192
'Iron Robe kung fu'!

957
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:49,943
I've let you thrust 3 times.
Admit defeat!

958
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:51,307
There must be a way to beat him.

959
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:13,823
Why are you following me?

960
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:15,394
My name is Foon. I'm from May County.

961
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,163
There are lots of gangs in this town.

962
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:18,697
My kung fu is poor.

963
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:20,195
I'm often bullied.

964
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:24,004
I can't even make a living.

965
01:19:24,273 --> 01:19:27,538
Please take me as your student.

966
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:33,343
What's the point of
being a kung fu expert?

967
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:35,172
I can't make a living either.

968
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:54,798
Master, are you hungry?

969
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:57,061
You take shelter.

970
01:19:57,606 --> 01:19:59,005
I'll think of something.

971
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:05,003
Give me a drumstick!

972
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:15,921
Good stuff, eh? We only eat the best!

973
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:21,026
Gentlemen, come inside!

974
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:26,059
The soup's salty. Don't drink it.

975
01:20:30,572 --> 01:20:32,540
The soup's very salty today.

976
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,074
Hey, why'd you steal my bowl?

977
01:20:40,783 --> 01:20:44,844
Gentlemen, welcome.
Come in and have a drink.

978
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,181
Welcome gentlemen.
Let me sing to you.

979
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:48,783
Master, have some soup.

980
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,976
2 men drinking from the same bowl.
Pathetic!

981
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:12,008
Madam, shall I have them thrown out?

982
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:17,441
If I made my name here,

983
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:19,952
no one would look down on me.

984
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:22,547
Right,
you have to become the top dog.

985
01:21:23,459 --> 01:21:24,824
Who's the best in town?

986
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:26,227
Master Wong?

987
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:17,170
13th Aunt, you're right.
China must change.

988
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:19,812
Fists can't fight guns.

989
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:23,015
I'm under house arrest,

990
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:25,411
soon I'll have to fight.

991
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:27,055
Take care of yourself!

992
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:30,083
Fei-Hung, I'll wait for you.

993
01:22:31,093 --> 01:22:31,923
You don't have to.

994
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:34,829
If you do,

995
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:37,360
I won't die in peace.

996
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:41,499
You won't die...

997
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:50,335
I'm just a man...
Go home.

998
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:54,313
Wing, he...

999
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:05,893
Wing, go inside, it's raining hard.

1000
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:08,053
Master didn't tell me to come in yet.

1001
01:23:08,564 --> 01:23:09,264
Wing.

1002
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:16,032
Come back to Bo Chi Lam.
Master!

1003
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:18,869
Come on in!

1004
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:28,240
I...
Master, let me!

1005
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:51,328
So!

1006
01:24:29,178 --> 01:24:30,406
It's raining harder than ever.

1007
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:33,607
It's closed! Push off!

1008
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:49,028
I'm 'Iron Robe' Yim from Shandong...

1009
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:55,995
I'm here to challenge Master Wong.

1010
01:24:58,006 --> 01:24:59,598
Please tell me
which of you is Master Wong?

1011
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:05,068
Master, a challenger!

1012
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:06,372
Wing, bring some tea!

1013
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:09,110
Master!
Bring tea!

1014
01:25:10,886 --> 01:25:11,586
Please!

1015
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:15,518
Kai, take the patients to one side.

1016
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,330
Have a seat!

1017
01:25:26,768 --> 01:25:27,894
Fold the umbrella.

1018
01:25:35,777 --> 01:25:36,477
Have some tea!

1019
01:25:39,615 --> 01:25:40,877
Foon, what're you doing?

1020
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:42,750
Foon?

1021
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,890
Master Wong,
your techniques are famous,

1022
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:54,691
especially your 'Shadowless Kick'
and 'Ten Forms Fist'.

1023
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,224
I intend to open
up my own school here,

1024
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,894
that's why I'm here to challenge you.

1025
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:04,671
Soon the people will know
my martial arts is the best.

1026
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,366
I'm under house arrest,

1027
01:26:06,742 --> 01:26:08,642
you could get in trouble.

1028
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:12,241
I can't fight you today.

1029
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:14,572
Are you a warrior or not?

1030
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:16,951
Master Yim!

1031
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:22,956
I've too many patients here!
It's not the right place to fight!

1032
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:24,214
Wing, Kai!

1033
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:26,685
Do you want to be thrown out again?!

1034
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:56,083
What are you waiting for?

1035
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:57,819
Take the patients to the back.

1036
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:01,787
I'll take you inside.
They're going to fight.

1037
01:27:02,364 --> 01:27:03,388
How dare you touch our patients?

1038
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,593
Move him or he'll get hurt
by my master.

1039
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:08,301
Bullshit! If not for my Master,
I'd beat you up.

1040
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:11,901
Let go!
No!

1041
01:27:13,475 --> 01:27:15,636
God damn it, Foon!
What?

1042
01:27:16,178 --> 01:27:17,270
You dare try again?

1043
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:41,287
Yim, stop fighting.

1044
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,494
If you don't stop, I'll fire!

1045
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:51,605
Don't hurt my Master. Give it to me!

1046
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:06,048
Master, are you all right?

1047
01:29:26,508 --> 01:29:29,136
I've mastered the Iron Robe.
I don't fear guns.

1048
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:33,013
Wong Fei-Hung, I won so easily,
it doesn't count.

1049
01:29:33,381 --> 01:29:34,439
Let's fight again tomorrow!

1050
01:29:34,716 --> 01:29:36,684
If you don't come,

1051
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:39,954
I'll assume victory! Foon!

1052
01:29:42,123 --> 01:29:43,090
You jerk!

1053
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:01,167
You ungrateful shit!

1054
01:30:09,251 --> 01:30:10,445
Stupid.

1055
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:13,520
Speak Chinese, you banana!

1056
01:30:22,264 --> 01:30:22,964
Are you OK?

1057
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,223
Yes, I just slipped!

1058
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,232
The guards were injured,

1059
01:30:26,434 --> 01:30:27,526
there'll be trouble.

1060
01:30:28,036 --> 01:30:29,799
The Governor's men will be here soon.

1061
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:32,670
Wing, Kai, go inside,
take some money and go.

1062
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:36,306
13th Aunt,
go and wake the man from America.

1063
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:39,706
What are you waiting for? Go!

1064
01:30:40,382 --> 01:30:41,280
Take him with you.

1065
01:30:43,218 --> 01:30:46,085
So, you don't know kung fu.

1066
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:50,754
Don't wait for them. Go!

1067
01:30:50,926 --> 01:30:52,325
Master...

1068
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:55,494
Take care!
I'll see you off!

1069
01:31:12,881 --> 01:31:13,581
Don't act on impulse.

1070
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:17,279
Master.
Be careful!

1071
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:20,054
Don't worry, your word is my command.

1072
01:31:20,655 --> 01:31:22,452
Wing, tell 13th Aunt to leave.

1073
01:31:24,092 --> 01:31:27,084
I let them go in order
to get the whole gang. Search!

1074
01:31:27,128 --> 01:31:27,828
Yes, sir!

1075
01:31:27,996 --> 01:31:31,193
Wait! I have many patients here

1076
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:32,827
and many invalids.

1077
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,699
Please don't disturb them.

1078
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:38,171
You're asking me not to go inside?

1079
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:39,904
There must be something hidden there!

1080
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:42,700
My plan was to catch you off guard

1081
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:47,377
and see who might be hiding
among your patients. Search!

1082
01:31:47,582 --> 01:31:48,282
Yes, sir!

1083
01:31:51,953 --> 01:31:55,389
Someone's getting away! After them!

1084
01:31:57,726 --> 01:31:58,852
Go!

1085
01:32:01,696 --> 01:32:02,628
So, go quick!

1086
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:07,162
Get them!
Right!

1087
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:09,633
Wing, fight!

1088
01:32:10,071 --> 01:32:10,771
What? Master?

1089
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,041
Wing, I told you to fight!

1090
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:21,043
Manchurian Dog!
You insult me?

1091
01:32:21,282 --> 01:32:23,375
Samson's Lift!

1092
01:32:27,022 --> 01:32:28,250
Are We really allowed to fight?
Yes!

1093
01:32:38,366 --> 01:32:39,298
Where's my gun?

1094
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:59,216
Where are you going? Come back.
Shadowless Kick.

1095
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:01,114
After them!
Yes!

1096
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:09,130
Don't bother.

1097
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:10,262
The man you want is here.

1098
01:33:11,933 --> 01:33:13,366
Split up.
Right!

1099
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:18,133
This way.

1100
01:33:19,374 --> 01:33:20,966
Hold the pole, the rest go under.

1101
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:50,459
Wong Fei-Hung,
I arrest you on charges of treason!

1102
01:33:52,774 --> 01:33:55,368
Your Excellency, I'll go with you.

1103
01:33:56,177 --> 01:33:58,805
Kai!
Master!

1104
01:33:59,214 --> 01:34:00,181
Kai, fetch medicine for the wounded.

1105
01:34:00,615 --> 01:34:02,207
Medicine from Bo Chi Lam

1106
01:34:03,818 --> 01:34:06,309
is the best.

1107
01:34:06,955 --> 01:34:08,388
How many of you are there?

1108
01:34:09,591 --> 01:34:12,856
Are you all right, Your Excellency?
You good-for-nothings!

1109
01:34:15,597 --> 01:34:17,394
We're almost there. Hang on!

1110
01:34:18,566 --> 01:34:21,126
Now we've got guns, we've got power.

1111
01:34:21,669 --> 01:34:23,500
We have to find women
for the foreigners.

1112
01:34:24,773 --> 01:34:26,138
Sha... Shaho Gang!

1113
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,699
Quick, go that way.

1114
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,580
A woman!

1115
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:38,215
Let go of So!

1116
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,588
You get away!

1117
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:49,425
Don't let her go!

1118
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:57,295
Let go!

1119
01:34:57,472 --> 01:34:58,632
Sir, take care of yourself.

1120
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,570
They are too many. Forget about me.

1121
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,390
Go to hell!

1122
01:35:17,959 --> 01:35:18,659
Run

1123
01:35:21,062 --> 01:35:22,461
Let me go!
Go!

1124
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:32,405
There's one over there.
Get him! Get him!

1125
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:34,639
Damn you!

1126
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:36,169
How dare you come to help?

1127
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:45,045
Attacking the clinic?
Kicking Wong Fei-Hung?!

1128
01:35:45,587 --> 01:35:48,078
Challenging Master Wong!

1129
01:35:48,323 --> 01:35:52,760
We're not going home.
Let's wait here!

1130
01:35:54,996 --> 01:35:57,362
When do you think
Master Wong will get here?

1131
01:36:18,553 --> 01:36:20,817
Open your mouth wide.

1132
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:27,061
Open the door!

1133
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:32,297
Go away!

1134
01:36:39,874 --> 01:36:42,707
You dare shoot me?
You'll be shipped out tonight!

1135
01:36:43,244 --> 01:36:44,734
Do you hate me?

1136
01:36:44,812 --> 01:36:46,245
Will your skin need spicing up?

1137
01:36:46,447 --> 01:36:49,075
When you have to serve

1138
01:36:53,288 --> 01:36:57,190
those stinking labourers,

1139
01:36:57,825 --> 01:37:01,158
you're gonna wish it was me.
Take her to my room!

1140
01:37:01,396 --> 01:37:02,294
Yes...

1141
01:37:03,665 --> 01:37:06,099
Boss, the one who beat Wong is here.

1142
01:37:06,868 --> 01:37:09,666
Great!

1143
01:37:09,871 --> 01:37:11,805
Good, now Fatshan will be ours.

1144
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:18,570
Master!

1145
01:37:18,746 --> 01:37:20,611
You know each other?
Foon is now your senior.

1146
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:21,907
You can trust him.

1147
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:25,784
He's our senior?
Call him Big Brother.

1148
01:37:26,087 --> 01:37:28,555
Big Brother!

1149
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,949
OK...

1150
01:37:32,093 --> 01:37:34,027
Remember he's senior.

1151
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:35,895
Master, I'm busy tonight.

1152
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:37,689
Please excuse me!

1153
01:37:37,966 --> 01:37:40,127
We'll talk about
the new school tomorrow.

1154
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:42,696
Get the presents
for the Master ready.

1155
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:48,909
Master Yim!

1156
01:37:49,243 --> 01:37:51,803
This is to help you open a school.

1157
01:37:52,513 --> 01:37:55,744
The Yim's Fist Style
will soon dominate Fatshan.

1158
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,881
Come... let's toast Master Yim!

1159
01:37:58,386 --> 01:38:02,083
Cheers, Master!

1160
01:39:03,017 --> 01:39:04,041
Don't move! What do you want?

1161
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,380
Master Wong, we all admire you.
We know you've been set up.

1162
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,391
Master Wong,

1163
01:39:13,895 --> 01:39:16,193
we've decided to free you...

1164
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:18,865
and we'll take responsibility for it.

1165
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,925
Master Wong, this way!

1166
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:25,430
Great! Let's go, Master!

1167
01:39:26,574 --> 01:39:29,372
Master!

1168
01:39:30,778 --> 01:39:33,679
China is a land with laws.
I won't make a mockery of them.

1169
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:34,745
Go! Master!

1170
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:36,346
Go with them, Master!

1171
01:39:37,385 --> 01:39:41,151
No, Excellency.
I appreciate it, but I won't go.

1172
01:39:41,589 --> 01:39:43,921
Wong... Master Wong is over there.

1173
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:48,494
Master!

1174
01:39:48,763 --> 01:39:49,855
Master, you're still here?

1175
01:39:50,798 --> 01:39:53,961
So!
Master... Mas... Mas...

1176
01:39:54,969 --> 01:39:55,669
Speak slowly.

1177
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,635
Master, 13th Aunt and I took that man,

1178
01:39:57,772 --> 01:39:59,137
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.

1179
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,205
They killed him
and captured 13th Aunt.

1180
01:40:01,509 --> 01:40:03,602
Think of a way to save her.
What?

1181
01:40:05,446 --> 01:40:06,606
Master Wong, let's go and save her.

1182
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:12,215
Wing, I'll give you a few men.

1183
01:40:12,453 --> 01:40:13,153
Good!

1184
01:40:13,287 --> 01:40:13,987
Let them go!
Right!

1185
01:40:15,323 --> 01:40:17,450
Buck teeth So,
how come you spoke so fast?

1186
01:40:17,658 --> 01:40:20,320
I was... rehearsing all the way.

1187
01:40:30,071 --> 01:40:33,165
I'm sure you'll miss the
Chinese food when you return.

1188
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:38,178
Isn't that Master Wong?

1189
01:40:44,652 --> 01:40:45,352
Aren't they the Local Militia?

1190
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:09,338
Master, you're great.

1191
01:41:09,677 --> 01:41:11,201
You even beat Wong Fei-Hung.

1192
01:41:11,979 --> 01:41:14,971
Give us a little demonstration.

1193
01:41:15,616 --> 01:41:17,880
Just a little!

1194
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:41,001
OK...

1195
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:17,269
Bitch! The hell with you!

1196
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:41,760
OK...

1197
01:42:54,248 --> 01:42:58,446
OK...

1198
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:09,253
That's enough, master, enough!

1199
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:17,630
Master, that's enough!

1200
01:43:19,373 --> 01:43:20,073
What's wrong?

1201
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:22,634
This money is dirty.

1202
01:43:22,877 --> 01:43:23,969
Don't accept it.

1203
01:43:24,512 --> 01:43:25,945
What?

1204
01:43:26,147 --> 01:43:26,847
Is he insulting us?

1205
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:28,113
What do you mean?

1206
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:29,479
You're looking down on us?

1207
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,580
Nothing in this world is perfect...

1208
01:43:35,356 --> 01:43:38,519
Virtue is often found among
the lowly...

1209
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,994
Our priority is to make our name
in Fatshan.

1210
01:43:43,798 --> 01:43:45,925
When that's achieved,

1211
01:43:46,367 --> 01:43:48,198
we can talk about justice.

1212
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,834
That's life. Foon, pick up the money!

1213
01:44:11,058 --> 01:44:13,754
Pick up the money!

1214
01:44:16,163 --> 01:44:19,462
Pick up the money!

1215
01:44:28,109 --> 01:44:33,376
Pick up the money!

1216
01:44:41,722 --> 01:44:47,058
Pick up the money!

1217
01:44:47,728 --> 01:44:48,854
You think you're a big boss?

1218
01:44:49,096 --> 01:44:50,256
I think you're a nobody!

1219
01:44:50,831 --> 01:44:51,531
Foon?

1220
01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:57,571
Pick up the money!

1221
01:45:01,175 --> 01:45:07,603
Pick up the money!

1222
01:45:08,682 --> 01:45:14,848
Pick up the money!

1223
01:45:15,022 --> 01:45:19,584
Make our name in Fatshan?!
That's life!

1224
01:45:47,488 --> 01:45:51,185
Boss!

1225
01:45:51,358 --> 01:45:52,586
Bastard!

1226
01:45:57,898 --> 01:45:58,887
Damn you!

1227
01:46:07,541 --> 01:46:12,444
13th Aunt, wake up!

1228
01:46:13,581 --> 01:46:14,548
Bastard, don't touch me!

1229
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:15,544
Don't scream. I've come to help.

1230
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,317
Foon, is it you?
So many people are coming!

1231
01:46:27,661 --> 01:46:28,361
Go!

1232
01:46:44,512 --> 01:46:45,212
Get that woman!

1233
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:03,325
Foon, stop or I'll kill her!

1234
01:47:03,497 --> 01:47:04,225
Our boss? Go to hell!

1235
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:08,596
Hit me? Damn you!

1236
01:47:08,869 --> 01:47:11,394
Master, they are inside.

1237
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:15,906
Let's go in!

1238
01:47:16,777 --> 01:47:17,477
What happened?

1239
01:47:17,845 --> 01:47:20,211
Master, Foon wasted no time!

1240
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:23,812
He tried to force himself on my wife!

1241
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:26,451
No, it's not true...
Shut up!

1242
01:47:31,825 --> 01:47:35,226
Foon, how dare you!
Apologise to your comrade!

1243
01:47:36,864 --> 01:47:39,355
Yim, we met at Bo Chi Lam.

1244
01:47:39,633 --> 01:47:41,828
Shut up, you bitch! Go!

1245
01:47:44,038 --> 01:47:44,766
You want to rebel?

1246
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,001
Stupid! She's not his wife.

1247
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:50,472
Really?

1248
01:47:50,778 --> 01:47:52,109
She's related to Wong Fei-Hung.

1249
01:47:54,615 --> 01:47:55,315
Wong Fei-Hung?

1250
01:48:01,855 --> 01:48:02,753
Foon is trying to escape!

1251
01:48:03,724 --> 01:48:04,424
Escape?!

1252
01:48:31,852 --> 01:48:32,552
How dare you.

1253
01:48:42,663 --> 01:48:45,723
Come back!
Get him!

1254
01:49:16,497 --> 01:49:18,021
Stop right there.

1255
01:49:19,533 --> 01:49:22,195
I've brought some Chinese girls here
for Mr. Jackson.

1256
01:49:22,369 --> 01:49:24,394
We come to see him tonight.

1257
01:49:24,638 --> 01:49:28,631
Open the gate. Mr. Jackson is expecting us.
Come on...

1258
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:33,403
Open the gate. Come on...

1259
01:49:35,983 --> 01:49:40,613
We're getting cold, please.
Mr. Jackson will be very happy.

1260
01:49:41,588 --> 01:49:44,716
Open the gate...

1261
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:51,326
Thank you, come on.

1262
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:59,069
Take it easy!
Yes, Big Brother!

1263
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:00,969
It hurts.
Right!

1264
01:50:02,609 --> 01:50:06,136
Master, these people have turned on me.

1265
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,880
They'll do the same to you.
Don't trust them.

1266
01:50:09,516 --> 01:50:10,483
You don't trust your comrades,

1267
01:50:10,684 --> 01:50:12,083
yet speak up for Wong?

1268
01:50:13,854 --> 01:50:16,687
How is it? Too tough for you?

1269
01:50:21,729 --> 01:50:22,753
Let him go.

1270
01:50:23,197 --> 01:50:24,425
I'll do anything you want.

1271
01:50:24,932 --> 01:50:27,400
What makes you want
to sacrifice yourself for him?

1272
01:50:27,601 --> 01:50:31,093
You dare try to bargain with me?

1273
01:50:31,338 --> 01:50:32,828
Are you really Master Wong's woman?

1274
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:39,308
When I'm done with you,
your face will be so scarred,

1275
01:50:39,546 --> 01:50:42,538
even Master Wong won't recognise you.

1276
01:50:45,519 --> 01:50:46,952
Where's the woman
you took away today?

1277
01:50:48,622 --> 01:50:51,386
Big Brother! Wong Fei-Hung is here!

1278
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:53,059
Master Wong?!

1279
01:50:55,529 --> 01:50:56,359
Fei-Hung?

1280
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,929
Arm yourselves!

1281
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:00,662
Get all the guns out.

1282
01:51:01,168 --> 01:51:02,999
Go, get all the women on the ship.

1283
01:51:03,904 --> 01:51:05,633
Master, Wong is here.

1284
01:51:05,873 --> 01:51:06,965
You have to protect us!

1285
01:51:07,441 --> 01:51:08,203
Don't worry!

1286
01:51:10,444 --> 01:51:12,674
Foon!
Go!

1287
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,371
13th Aunt!

1288
01:51:15,516 --> 01:51:16,881
Go!

1289
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:19,541
Go, get Wong Fei-Hung.

1290
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,612
You're not needed here.
Go search for 13th Aunt.

1291
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:35,616
Yes.

1292
01:51:37,919 --> 01:51:38,977
Master Wong!

1293
01:51:40,522 --> 01:51:44,583
Master Yim, win or lose,
it's just a game.

1294
01:51:47,328 --> 01:51:49,091
You've got no excuse not to fight.

1295
01:51:55,804 --> 01:51:56,504
As you wish.

1296
01:52:58,666 --> 01:53:00,133
Down there!

1297
01:53:00,468 --> 01:53:01,400
External Chi Kung?

1298
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:05,103
Today only one
of us leaves here alive.

1299
01:53:08,042 --> 01:53:08,804
Hey, how do you fire a gun?

1300
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,836
Don't worry, we have guns.

1301
01:54:19,847 --> 01:54:24,181
You said you're good, come on.

1302
01:54:29,424 --> 01:54:30,686
Master, I'll help you!

1303
01:54:33,394 --> 01:54:34,326
Porky?!

1304
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:47,408
Any more?

1305
01:55:08,563 --> 01:55:10,190
Buck Teeth So!
It's you?

1306
01:55:10,665 --> 01:55:15,102
Come up and get me down. Quickly!

1307
01:55:15,603 --> 01:55:18,902
13th Aunt has been kidnapped by the Shaho Gang.
Go and save her.

1308
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:20,737
What?

1309
01:55:21,275 --> 01:55:22,902
13th Aunt has been kidnapped
by the Shaho Gang.

1310
01:55:23,711 --> 01:55:27,738
Hey, get me down,
Buck Teeth So!

1311
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:30,308
Sorry, I forgot.

1312
01:55:34,655 --> 01:55:35,355
Your Excellency.

1313
01:55:36,657 --> 01:55:37,589
Enemy is approaching.

1314
01:55:45,433 --> 01:55:46,457
General, please!

1315
01:55:46,934 --> 01:55:49,664
This is General Wickens of
Her Majesty's Royal Armed Forces.

1316
01:55:49,871 --> 01:55:53,534
I'm escorting this Chinese officer who
comes in search of escape prisoners.

1317
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:57,333
On his behalf, I request permission
to search your premises.

1318
01:55:57,678 --> 01:56:00,511
This is the territory of
the United States of America.

1319
01:56:00,581 --> 01:56:02,071
Permission is not granted,
and any trespassing...

1320
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:05,142
will be regarded as direct
violation of our Federal Laws.

1321
01:56:06,154 --> 01:56:07,553
Damn your Yankee laws!

1322
01:56:07,822 --> 01:56:08,982
Damn you Brits to hell!

1323
01:56:16,297 --> 01:56:19,198
Stop! Don't shoot... stop!..

1324
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,994
Excellency, it's dangerous here.
You'd better leave.

1325
01:56:29,644 --> 01:56:30,736
Comrades, get inside!

1326
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:36,650
Boss, what now?

1327
01:56:37,018 --> 01:56:37,985
Kai, I'll help Master,

1328
01:56:38,186 --> 01:56:38,886
you save 13th Aunt.

1329
01:56:39,487 --> 01:56:41,421
No, I'll stay!

1330
01:56:41,689 --> 01:56:43,247
You save 13th Aunt.

1331
01:56:43,925 --> 01:56:45,756
I'm Big Brother! You listen to me!

1332
01:56:57,705 --> 01:56:59,673
Neither of you have to stay.
Go save 13th Aunt.

1333
01:57:00,942 --> 01:57:01,642
Go!

1334
01:59:14,075 --> 01:59:14,905
Wong Fei-Hung,

1335
01:59:56,851 --> 01:59:58,079
All's fair on the field of battle!

1336
01:59:59,086 --> 02:00:00,644
You call this Yim's Martial Arts?

1337
02:00:01,522 --> 02:00:04,252
The world's full of surprises.
One must take precautions.

1338
02:00:07,128 --> 02:00:10,188
Be quick, the ship's leaving.
Take them aboard!

1339
02:00:11,899 --> 02:00:12,797
Go, bitch!

1340
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:32,649
Fei-Hung... it's 13th Aunt. Fei-Hung...

1341
02:00:33,387 --> 02:00:39,155
Bring her to the ship, go.
Fei-Hung...

1342
02:00:39,493 --> 02:00:40,585
Troops, attention.

1343
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:46,190
Mr. Jackson, Master Wong is here!

1344
02:00:47,001 --> 02:00:48,662
Master Wong, take him on!

1345
02:00:49,970 --> 02:00:50,994
The ship's over there!

1346
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:55,173
Hung, take them to the cabin.

1347
02:00:55,443 --> 02:00:56,375
Yes, sir.

1348
02:00:56,577 --> 02:00:58,067
Line up the men, ready now.

1349
02:01:06,554 --> 02:01:08,112
Get down, quick!

1350
02:01:12,126 --> 02:01:13,150
Turn around.

1351
02:01:30,044 --> 02:01:31,773
There... there!

1352
02:01:33,781 --> 02:01:35,271
Leave him to me.

1353
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,847
They're yours.

1354
02:03:02,069 --> 02:03:05,800
Wong Fei-Hung,

1355
02:03:08,776 --> 02:03:10,334
Master Yim, our match is over.

1356
02:03:18,085 --> 02:03:19,109
He's leaving.

1357
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:20,619
Master Wong, watch out!

1358
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:30,856
Master Wong, where are you?
We haven't finished yet.

1359
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,037
Master!

1360
02:03:53,287 --> 02:03:56,188
I am a master of the Iron Vest...

1361
02:03:56,357 --> 02:04:03,525
Master Yim!

1362
02:04:05,132 --> 02:04:10,001
Master Yim...
Wong...

1363
02:04:10,137 --> 02:04:16,838
It's true. Our kung fu is
useless against the foreign guns.

1364
02:04:30,257 --> 02:04:31,349
You scum!

1365
02:05:37,925 --> 02:05:39,756
Master Wong, don't go!

1366
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:47,790
Hold your fire!

1367
02:05:51,372 --> 02:05:54,569
Load the cannon.

1368
02:05:58,512 --> 02:06:00,173
This is Commander Man from the
Provincial Government of Guangdong.

1369
02:06:00,648 --> 02:06:02,411
12 o'clock 30 degrees.

1370
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:08,219
12 o'clock 30 degrees.

1371
02:06:08,656 --> 02:06:10,715
No, 10 o'clock 40 degrees.
What?

1372
02:06:11,158 --> 02:06:13,626
10 o'clock 40 degrees.
Aim, fire!

1373
02:06:13,794 --> 02:06:15,921
Wait!
Fire!

1374
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:23,093
Oh, God!

1375
02:06:26,707 --> 02:06:29,574
Damn you Yankees.
They've hit my ship.

1376
02:06:53,967 --> 02:06:55,332
You there, check the ship.

1377
02:06:56,804 --> 02:07:00,831
Who is this Wong Fei Hung?

1378
02:07:06,914 --> 02:07:07,614
Foon?

1379
02:07:08,849 --> 02:07:09,549
Kill him!

1380
02:07:15,522 --> 02:07:16,222
Watch out!

1381
02:07:34,708 --> 02:07:38,109
Master Wong, come on out
and fight man to man.

1382
02:07:39,046 --> 02:07:41,708
Fei-Hung,
he's got a gun in his knife.

1383
02:07:41,915 --> 02:07:43,246
Don't fall into his trap!

1384
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:44,414
Shut up.

1385
02:08:02,636 --> 02:08:04,331
Bitch, you brought them here,

1386
02:08:04,605 --> 02:08:07,301
so I'll burn your face.

1387
02:08:07,508 --> 02:08:09,203
Let's see which is faster,
your fist or my gun.

1388
02:08:14,715 --> 02:08:15,841
Burn!

1389
02:08:22,389 --> 02:08:23,856
Let me go!

1390
02:08:52,619 --> 02:08:53,643
Mr. Jackson.
Sir.

1391
02:08:55,189 --> 02:08:58,386
Mr. Jackson and the Shaho Gang
sold women to America.

1392
02:08:59,059 --> 02:09:00,117
Your Excellency, save us.

1393
02:09:01,695 --> 02:09:06,359
The Shaho Gang
and Jackson stole guns.

1394
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:09,100
By law, you can't kill me,
you must hand me to the Government.

1395
02:09:14,741 --> 02:09:16,299
You've violated international law.

1396
02:09:16,443 --> 02:09:17,239
Put down the gun!

1397
02:09:17,711 --> 02:09:20,737
Why won't it fire?
Did I forget to load it?

1398
02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:24,913
If you don't put it down,
I'll kill him!

1399
02:09:25,152 --> 02:09:25,982
Put down the gun!

1400
02:09:40,534 --> 02:09:41,501
You've offended a Chinese Official

1401
02:09:41,802 --> 02:09:43,463
in a forbidden area.

1402
02:09:43,804 --> 02:09:44,771
How will you explain that?

1403
02:09:45,172 --> 02:09:49,006
Don't let even one Chinese
leave alive.

1404
02:09:49,209 --> 02:09:54,909
Then I won't have to explain
anything to your Government!

1405
02:10:02,155 --> 02:10:03,349
You scum!

1406
02:10:03,657 --> 02:10:04,749
You don't have to explain!

1407
02:10:20,707 --> 02:10:22,538
Your Excellency...
You jumped from this height?

1408
02:10:22,943 --> 02:10:24,843
Child's play. No big deal.

1409
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,709
Thank you, Your Excellency!

1410
02:10:30,884 --> 02:10:32,909
All credit to Master Wong.

1411
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:34,244
Don't mention it!
Thanks, Master Wong!

1412
02:10:34,588 --> 02:10:36,146
Thanks, Master Wong!

1413
02:10:50,671 --> 02:10:53,663
China's changed so much.
How can I deal with it?

1414
02:10:54,808 --> 02:10:58,039
America?
Do they really have gold there?

1415
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:00,940
If they really did have so much gold,

1416
02:11:01,615 --> 02:11:03,742
why would they come here?

1417
02:11:05,285 --> 02:11:07,150
Maybe we're standing on gold now.

1418
02:11:37,217 --> 02:11:39,651
After this ceremony,
you'll be my Master.

1419
02:11:40,153 --> 02:11:42,883
But 13th Aunt
and I are so close now...

1420
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:44,814
We'll be together
from morning to night.

1421
02:11:45,192 --> 02:11:46,750
If one day she marries me,

1422
02:11:47,194 --> 02:11:49,458
then you'll have to call me Uncle.

1423
02:11:49,997 --> 02:11:54,900
I'll be your senior
so you'll have to serve me.

1424
02:11:55,936 --> 02:11:57,904
Foon, what are you thinking?

1425
02:11:59,573 --> 02:12:00,540
Have some tea, Master!
