1
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:46,949
There is not one universe. There are many.

2
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,119
A Multiverse.

3
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,829
We have the technology
to travel between universes...

4
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:57,128
...but travel is highly restricted
and policed.

5
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,407
There is not one YOU. There are many.

6
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:06,139
Each of us exists in present time,
in parallel universes.

7
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,745
There was balance in the system...

8
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:14,082
...but now a force exists
who seeks to destroy the balance...

9
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:17,088
...so he can become The One.

10
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:18,783
President Gore addressed Congress today
where he outlined the White House plan....

11
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,395
Here they come, man.
They're going to take you on out.

12
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:32,965
You're dead, Lawless! You're dead!
Ain't payback a bitch?

13
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,764
Die, Lawless, you piece of shit!

14
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:38,864
Die like all my boys you took out!

15
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,692
I know they're going to kill you upstate...

16
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:08,933
...but no one's getting you on my watch,
so don't sweat, Lawless.

17
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,936
You want that thumb?

18
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,103
Let's move him out of here.

19
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:24,581
I want to hear you scream, Lawless.
Come on, scream for me.

20
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,395
Going to get you, asshole!

21
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,194
Yeah, walk the walk!

22
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:49,007
You piece of shit! You're a dead man!

23
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,062
Something's wrong.

24
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,942
Prisoner down!

25
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,138
Up there!

26
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:40,493
Hold your fire! Cease fire!

27
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,869
Woo, Scott, follow me!

28
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:10,386
Razor wire should have kept anyone out,
let alone moving fast.

29
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,392
There's no blood.

30
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,124
Holy shit! He's doing 50!

31
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:37,002
Adam 13 in pursuit ofsuspect
headed west, Third and Olympic.

32
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,198
Request assistance
from 2 David air unit. Over.

33
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:43,536
Roger that.
Air 14 en route to Third and Olympic.

34
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,306
He's going to the hole.

35
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:50,808
We have to get there,
override him before he jumps.

36
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,209
Give me the go-ahead. He'll never make it.

37
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,509
Check fire. Stick to procedure, Funsch.

38
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,514
You were recruited to apprehend him,
not be his assassin, understand?

39
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:02,812
I can't hear you. Do you understand?

40
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,614
Loud and clear.

41
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:07,549
Yulaw! MVA!

42
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,626
Loud and clear, huh?

43
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,128
Roedecker! Less than a minute!

44
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:53,931
Shit!

45
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,642
Hands high!

46
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,710
Thirty seconds, Roedecker.

47
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:03,912
Who the hell is this now?

48
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,678
You must be the new guy.
Where is Roedecker?

49
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,488
This is your last warning.

50
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,188
Get your hands where I can see them.

51
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,858
Freeze!

52
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,329
You, drop that weapon!

53
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,069
I will kill you.

54
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,264
No, you won't.

55
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,170
Where is Roedecker?

56
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,815
- Here I am.
- What the....

57
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:50,254
Funsch.

58
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,218
You stick to procedure...

59
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,225
...it all works out.

60
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:05,502
Victim 117, Yu Fook Law,
Monoceros Universe.

61
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:10,574
Victim 118, Swen Law, Tucana Universe.

62
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:15,471
Victim 119, Ni Dilaw, Canopus Universe.

63
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:20,646
Victim 120, Kia Jilaw, Serpenz Universe.

64
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:25,647
Victim 121, Seth Law, Procyon Universe.

65
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:30,892
Victim 122, Frun Law, Shauwla Universe.

66
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,860
Victim 123, Lawless, Anubis Universe.

67
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,297
What's the next move?

68
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,238
It won't work for you anymore, Yulaw.

69
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:21,838
The shortest distance
between two points...

70
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,683
...will always be a straight line.

71
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,853
Your line has run out. You don't see that?

72
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,791
There's never been anything
like what I have become.

73
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,597
You know that.
You were there for my first one.

74
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:44,770
- I wish I'd never let there be a second.
- But there was a second.

75
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,561
And a third.

76
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,206
And a 123rd.

77
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,506
Why did you come, Harry?

78
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,904
You miss me?

79
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:58,882
I missed who you were.

80
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,353
You've been chasing me how many years?

81
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:04,749
Two years.

82
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,956
I just need to do it one more time.

83
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:13,296
There won't be a "one more time" for you.

84
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:24,029
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

85
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,476
Gabriel Yulaw.

86
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:46,255
The peoples of the Multiverse
have found you guilty...

87
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:49,221
...of 123 counts of first-degree murder...

88
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:54,462
...and 123 counts of unauthorized travel
to parallel universes...

89
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,297
...by use of illegal quantum tunneling.

90
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:01,033
For these crimes,
you have been sentenced to life...

91
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,735
...without the possibility of return...

92
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,073
...on the Stygian Penal Colony,
in the Hades Universe.

93
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,505
May God be with you.

94
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:18,313
You may make a final statement.

95
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,193
The Multiverse.

96
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,633
Every universe in it is irrational...

97
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,567
...sloppy.

98
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,434
I just try to make it rational.
I just try to make it neat.

99
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,134
You call it murder.

100
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:44,040
How could I murder myself 123 times?

101
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,082
I just took those wasted energies...

102
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:52,255
...and put them into one container: me.

103
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:57,819
It made me faster, smarter, stronger.

104
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,731
What if that is our fate?

105
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,497
To unite with our other selves.

106
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,035
To be unified forever.

107
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,037
To be one.

108
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:16,773
I will be The One.

109
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,014
Gabriel Yulaw...

110
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,118
...are you ready?

111
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,128
Are you?

112
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,798
Wormhole opens in five...

113
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,736
...four, three, two, one.

114
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:36,823
Wormhole's shut.

115
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:39,988
It only had a 30-second window.
Now we have to wait.

116
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,561
Son of a bitch!

117
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,298
- Permission to speak, sir?
- Speak.

118
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,367
Is this part of the procedure?

119
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,340
We'll get him on the other side.

120
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,077
There's only one place he could be going.

121
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:22,097
Aldrich, take these.

122
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:40,182
President Bush addressed ajointsession
of Congress today...

123
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,887
...where he outlined the White House plan
for universal health care.

124
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,733
Ronnie, you're dead! You rat!

125
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,467
Die, you piece of shit snitch!

126
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:18,629
You're going to be okay, Ronnie.
You're doing the right thing.

127
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:42,610
- Go, go!
- Dead! Dead!

128
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,349
You snitch! Dead!

129
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,044
Something's wrong.

130
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,082
Go, go, go! Get him out! Get him out!

131
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:14,347
Get him in the vehicle.

132
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,018
Get out, now. Go, go, go.

133
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:21,459
Oh, shit!

134
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,263
Cease fire!

135
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,547
Is he soup yet?

136
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,693
- No way he got out of there.
- He's got to be.

137
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:09,904
No!

138
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,171
Get him down! Pull!

139
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,776
One Henry Robert! Code 3!

140
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:22,252
Demand immediate backup
in the delivery area!

141
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:30,093
Go!

142
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:45,933
I need a hand over here!

143
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,104
Hey, on the bus!

144
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,800
He's going OJ!

145
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,769
- Get him!
- Let's go, Yates!

146
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:54,204
Gabe!

147
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,316
Gabe!

148
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:06,285
You see that?

149
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:12,390
The good news is you're not crazy.

150
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,694
The bad news....

151
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,250
I lived here my whole life.

152
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,154
And everywhere I look for great memories.

153
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:46,889
Now all I see is Larry and those kids.

154
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:00,670
Gabe.

155
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:02,472
Oh, my God!

156
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:03,979
I'm okay.

157
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,712
- I'm okay.
- Aldrich said you were in the hospital.

158
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,414
- Yeah, I was.
- Did they check you out?

159
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:14,118
I checked myself. Nothing to check. See?

160
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:19,389
I just need to get myself clear. Hey, Ollie.

161
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,966
You were shot. You need to be examined.

162
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,225
You can do it.

163
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,328
Newsflash. I'm a vet.
You don't have paws and a tail.

164
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:30,367
With all that's been happening to you,
you need to see someone.

165
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:33,067
I'm seeing the only person I need to see.

166
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:34,302
I'm serious.

167
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:43,712
We'll go to the hospital,
check on Woo, after I'm done.

168
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,151
You'll be all right, man.

169
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,654
- You guys take care of him now.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,293
Gabe? Hey, T.K.

171
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:57,662
How is he?

172
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:01,096
External injuries mostly.
EMT said he's seen a lot worse.

173
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:04,426
You gave us a bigger scare
just leaving the hospital like that.

174
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,099
Your man went deep tonight, T.K.
Don't know how he made it up that wall.

175
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,404
I wouldn't be here if you guys
didn't make it up right behind me.

176
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,342
We never made it up that wall.

177
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,812
I didn't make it out
of the goddamn parking lot.

178
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,318
Backup unit reported you down.
We continued pursuit, unsuccessful.

179
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:27,720
Only you got a good look at the suspect.
We need a description.

180
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:34,188
Think it's someone out of Ronnie's posse?
Payback for snitching?

181
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,832
It was dark.

182
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,028
You have anything? Anything to go on?

183
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,396
Sorry.

184
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,472
If you remember anything,
we'll be down the hall.

185
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,908
Hey, man, I'm glad you're still with us.

186
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,477
Thanks.

187
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,382
Why did you lie to them?

188
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,251
It was dark.

189
00:27:56,455 --> 00:28:00,016
Gabe, it's not the guys. It's me.

190
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:08,492
It was me.

191
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,129
What?

192
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,362
He wasn't trying to hit Ronnie.
He was aiming at me!

193
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:20,438
Before I saw him, I felt him.

194
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,737
I felt me!

195
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,282
It was me.

196
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:31,245
Maybe the adrenaline
caused some kind of hallucination.

197
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,057
You were shot. Your memory
could've been affected by the trauma.

198
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,653
Or maybe it's part
of what's been happening to you.

199
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,800
People get older. They don't get stronger.

200
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:46,127
They don't get faster all of a sudden.

201
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:54,344
Whatever it is, we're here now, right?

202
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,114
And if they find something wrong with me?

203
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,480
I don't want to lose my job.

204
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:08,453
I don't want to lose you.

205
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:15,958
Mrs. Law,
before we go into the MRI room...

206
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:18,798
...l have some questions to ask you
about your husband.

207
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,338
- Does he have a cardiac pacemaker?
- No.

208
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,735
- Intracranial aneurysm clip?
- No.

209
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,142
Dentures, hearing aid or penile implant?

210
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:31,147
No, no, and not unless he had one put in
since this morning.

211
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:06,849
Mr. Law. Right this way.
I have a few forms for you to fill out.

212
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:10,718
This is a painless procedure
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

213
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:13,490
Dressing room's here.
Remove all your clothing.

214
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,116
You'll find a gown on a hook.

215
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:19,891
The paperwork's already started
so we'll get you in and out in no time.

216
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:22,465
Please remove
all personal metallic objects.

217
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:25,694
That means no keys, no watches,
no credit cards...

218
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,295
...no body piercings, no cell phones....

219
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:36,276
My gun.

220
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:39,283
- No guns, no jewelry, no zippers.
- What?

221
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,908
The hospital has it.

222
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,247
You're going in for an MRl. Gabe?

223
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:47,185
Remember what I said?

224
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:48,993
I feel it again.

225
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:52,296
When you're done,
we'll go get your things, all right?

226
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,298
They're not giving her your gun.

227
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,864
The guys are downstairs.
They can get the gun.

228
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:01,497
Even if you did, you're not bringing it here.
That's a powerful, precise magnet.

229
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,598
All right.

230
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:09,341
If you start the MRl, I'll find the guys.

231
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,506
Lose the wedding ring.

232
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,880
Here. I got it.

233
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:44,712
For Christ's sake, you're getting an MRl,
not a heart transplant.

234
00:31:56,962 --> 00:32:00,864
Mr. Law, I need you to remain still
for three to ten minutes.

235
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:05,699
You can talk, but if you move,
we have to start all over.

236
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:38,066
Hey. Where did you guys go?

237
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,099
I took him in for a....

238
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,605
Something wrong?
Can I get you something?

239
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:49,678
No, I have to talk to the doctor.

240
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,359
Mike, I can't take my break
till I'm done with this guy.

241
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,691
Can you wait half an hour?

242
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,870
Mr. Law, what are you doing?

243
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:15,906
Now we have to start over.

244
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:17,969
Why? What did I do?

245
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:22,473
Back away!

246
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,044
Thought you were gonna kill me.

247
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:29,177
Just give me the chance, asshole.

248
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,750
Get on your knees slowly.

249
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,825
You there?

250
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,427
On the floor, right now!

251
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,059
The floor?

252
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,824
This is a hospital.

253
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:46,499
The floor is full of germs.
You want me to get sick?

254
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:58,348
It's gunfire.

255
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,614
Let's get security.

256
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:01,911
Gabe.

257
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,925
Get back!

258
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:27,737
What have you got?

259
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,342
Nothing.

260
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:30,881
Not a thing.

261
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:46,360
No! No!

262
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,433
Be still.

263
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,542
Unit 15, weapon fire, south tower!

264
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,744
Fourth floor, lmaging Radiologyl

265
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:09,286
Gabe is there.

266
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:13,485
- Hands high! Hands high, Yulaw!
- Don't move! Don't move!

267
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:14,558
Don't move!

268
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:24,334
We all know if you kill me,
you have to kill the other guy.

269
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:29,004
- Just let me take out one leg.
- Cuff him.

270
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,933
I'll cover you.

271
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,437
Go.

272
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:36,773
Back, get back!

273
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:55,826
- It's Gabe.
- Go! Channel 7.

274
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,161
Swing the camera. Follow him.

275
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,437
He cut right at the end of the hall.

276
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:05,174
Don't move! Stay here!

277
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,002
Go back to the room.

278
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,730
T.K., you can't go up there!

279
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,649
Which one is he?

280
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:53,218
- I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Don't move, Gabe! We're here to help.

281
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,957
- I'm all right.
- Do you know where you are?

282
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:59,629
- What's wrong with you?
- Where are you, Gabe?

283
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:03,599
There are three armed men.
They killed a security officer.

284
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,533
- Who are we?
- They went down the hall.

285
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:08,572
- What's my name?
- I was unarmed. I couldn't go after them.

286
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,401
What did you do with the gun?

287
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:14,340
I don't have one. I asked T.K. to get it.

288
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,239
Yulaw wouldn't have known that.

289
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:19,181
This one's safer in their custody.
Let them take him.

290
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,275
You need help before you hurt yourself.

291
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,478
Or anyone else.

292
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:25,847
Anyone else? Someone tried to kill me!

293
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,449
Please! I don't want to hurt you guys.

294
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,063
Let go of me!

295
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:37,758
I don't want to hurt you.

296
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:42,805
I don't want to hurt you guys.

297
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,426
Settle back down!

298
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:13,437
He's close to Yulaw's strength.

299
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,206
Let go! Gabe!

300
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:20,300
It's what I told you. It's me.

301
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,471
Get home.

302
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,748
We have a problem here.

303
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:33,354
Yeah, the real problem is
procedure sucks...

304
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,316
...sir.

305
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,964
All right, new procedure.

306
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,633
Gabe is yours. I will take Yulaw.

307
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,832
How you going to do that?

308
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,107
I'll do whatever it takes.

309
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,635
Sync up your repeater.

310
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,704
Hey, wait a minute.

311
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,674
I've lived through one of those.

312
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:02,742
Let me do it.

313
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:04,711
Sync your repeater, Funsch.

314
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:11,854
All right.

315
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:17,325
When the green light turns red
and stays steady and Yulaw is dead....

316
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:18,591
And you.

317
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,369
You know what to do.

318
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,340
Not a problem.

319
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:38,486
Us splitting up, you going solo,
is way out of procedure.

320
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:42,716
So listen to me. I know where you're from,
what you've been through...

321
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,590
...but this place is different.

322
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:47,226
Not everyone is a combatant.

323
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:50,000
There are innocent people here, also.

324
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:53,893
So if you get into the shit,
you trust your heart...

325
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:55,901
...not your head.

326
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,301
Loud and clear, sir.

327
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,073
How did that son of a bitch
get out of here?

328
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:13,153
Have you seen that new video,
Mr. Fanny's Been A-Pluggin'? It's hot!

329
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,192
Dude, I like Janine.

330
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,389
But she don't do guys.
That girl-girl stuff gets old.

331
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:23,200
Why don't you rent one of those big-ass,
she-male tapes, you freak?

332
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:25,766
Shut up!

333
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:36,144
I can't determine occipital lobe swelling
without a complete MRl.

334
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:39,648
- He was acting schizophrenic.
- Schizophrenia doesn't just kick in.

335
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:43,376
The triggering stressor of being shot
caused a psychotic break.

336
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:47,925
The Fifth Division is looking for him.

337
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:51,085
They understand he's not himself.
They know how to bring him in.

338
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,657
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

339
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,392
- Need a doctor?
- No, I'm all right.

340
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,069
I am not going to let
anything happen to him.

341
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:02,164
If it wasn't for Gabe,
I wouldn't be in this uniform.

342
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,673
Thanks, Bobby.

343
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,476
- Maybe it's best if I go home.
- Good idea.

344
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:09,604
Nothing you can do here,
and he's likely to contact you there.

345
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,172
If I hear from him, I'll let you know.
If you hear anything, I'll be home.

346
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:15,014
I know. I'm going to take you.

347
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:16,984
I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.

348
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:21,785
We'll make sure of it. There are four units
on the way to your house. Come on.

349
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,607
- Circle around. I'll meet you out front.
- All right.

350
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:48,806
Just when I find something
I like in this universe.

351
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,814
Turn off the radio slowly.

352
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,086
Who are you?

353
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:37,094
You're close to his strength.
The last two years, you've gotten stronger.

354
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:39,992
Haven't jacked any more iron.
Haven't changed your diet.

355
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:41,494
But you are stronger.

356
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:45,825
Your mind, too.
Answers come fast without thinking.

357
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:48,201
Who are you? What did you do to me?

358
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:54,408
Not me. You.
You've done this to yourself.

359
00:44:01,052 --> 00:44:03,885
Just like old times, eh, buddy?

360
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,955
Not exactly...

361
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:07,783
...buddy.

362
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,660
Put your hands back on the wheel, Yulaw.

363
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,027
Space is shaped like this.

364
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,362
You believe this is the only universe.

365
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:24,439
There's not just one universe,
there's a Multiverse.

366
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:27,769
Every time a massive star dies
and becomes a black hole...

367
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:30,344
...a new universe is created.

368
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:36,214
They've learned to forecast
where and when a black hole will occur.

369
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,116
A momentary bridge
between parallel universes.

370
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,948
Travel is restricted.

371
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:44,391
They created an agency
to police the Multiverse.

372
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,430
I'm a Multiverse agent.

373
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:49,066
You're a nut.

374
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:51,797
You're the one who's been seeing yourself.

375
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:55,366
In this universe, you're you.
In another, you don't exist.

376
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,901
In another,
you're married to the same woman.

377
00:44:57,975 --> 00:45:01,342
In another, to a different woman.
In another, you're married to a man.

378
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:05,542
There's an energy, strain, wave,
connecting all those lives.

379
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:06,913
We all have one.

380
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,782
The one between you and him
has gotten stronger.

381
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:13,584
You've been feeling him, haven't you?

382
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:20,562
Harry, nobody's proved
that what I'm doing is a bad thing.

383
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:24,928
You've killed 123 people.
I'd say that was a very bad thing.

384
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:27,470
You don't know what'd happen
if you killed this one.

385
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:30,132
It could destroy the system,
but that doesn't matter.

386
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:35,577
I know. Everything must be balanced.
The party line.

387
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:37,810
What do you think would happen?

388
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:42,616
Some people think you'd explode,
some people think you'd implode.

389
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:45,153
You're missing one.

390
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:49,284
Some people think you'd become a god.

391
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:51,623
That's the one.

392
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:56,923
The man you've been seeing,
the "you," he was an MVA agent.

393
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:02,195
Once he was forced to defend himself
against himself in another universe.

394
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,365
Killed him.

395
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:09,503
In doing so, part of the other life's energy
transferred to him.

396
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:13,601
Made him stronger.
Made all of you stronger.

397
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:18,171
Each time he kills one of you,
the energy divides among the survivors.

398
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:20,611
So, I'm next?

399
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,846
You're the last.

400
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:26,585
You and him are it.

401
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,288
I don't want any part of this.

402
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,994
You don't have a choice.

403
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:23,376
First choice, give up. Second choice, die.

404
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,109
Third choice.

405
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,425
So, if everything you say is true...

406
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,965
...what happens to me?

407
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,128
Nobody's got all the answers.

408
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,966
I don't believe you. Stay away.

409
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,298
I'm alone now.

410
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:50,858
I'm here to help you Gabe.

411
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:04,812
Sir, I have to ask you to hold it right there.

412
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:11,981
I said freeze, asshole!

413
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:23,360
Don't you people ever learn?

414
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:52,552
Clear.

415
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:00,594
Let them have a look first.

416
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:03,566
I have to do my girl stuff.

417
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:07,926
Thanks.

418
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:03,984
TV is on.

419
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,225
Yeah, I left it on.

420
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:09,532
When I got the call about Gabe, I just ran.

421
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:13,061
Grabbed my jacket, rushed downstairs.

422
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:15,070
I'll turn it off.

423
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:40,359
Bobby?

424
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:45,726
I appreciate you being here with me
and I don't want to sound rude, but...

425
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:47,967
...can I have a little privacy?

426
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:50,764
Sorry, T.K.

427
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:57,913
I'll be right outside.

428
00:53:58,282 --> 00:53:59,613
Thanks.

429
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,093
I told you it's not wasted space.

430
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,994
You all right?

431
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,663
- I'm afraid.
- Me, too.

432
00:54:57,908 --> 00:54:59,341
Is it safe to come down?

433
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:02,808
No, there are sheriffs all over.

434
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:04,541
I need my gun.

435
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:07,846
I left it at the hospital.

436
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:10,979
I need a weapon.

437
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:17,350
Yeah, okay.

438
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,129
What's wrong?

439
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:55,296
Nothing.

440
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:58,593
They can see inside.
I'm just gonna pull the shade.

441
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:26,320
Jesus. Did you ever think
when we met that day at the bookstore...

442
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,421
...we'd be in this kind of mess?

443
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,135
Even if I knew, I still would have come in.

444
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:39,973
It wasn't a bookstore.

445
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:44,438
Just so you know,
I'm going to take that gun...

446
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:47,813
...and kill you
before you can pull the trigger.

447
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:51,943
There's nothing you can do
except give it to me.

448
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,605
Gabe, drop it!

449
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:21,477
Drop it now!

450
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:25,613
Drop it!

451
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:03,058
Gabe! Get in!

452
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,937
Hey, knock it off!

453
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:25,913
- You're acting like him.
- I am him!

454
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,141
Without her.

455
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:05,083
My grandfather taught me
the energy of life goes in a circle...

456
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,415
...in a perfect flow, balanced.

457
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:11,060
He said, until I find my center...

458
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:13,990
...my circle would never be whole.

459
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:18,833
That day, I first saw her in the clinic...

460
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,930
...l came in with a dog
that was hit by a car.

461
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:27,909
I knew right away she was my center.

462
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:30,072
She made me whole.

463
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,707
How do I kill him?

464
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:50,895
In an hour, there's a forecasted
wormhole opening. Three-minute window.

465
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:56,964
He's attuned to your life wave.

466
00:59:57,607 --> 01:00:01,168
He'll try to find you, kill you,
and get back to the hole.

467
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:03,005
That's where we get him.

468
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,439
Get him? Kill him!

469
01:00:05,982 --> 01:00:06,971
Kill him?

470
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:10,016
You're serious?

471
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:20,554
My own design.

472
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:23,132
Highly modified M-590,
hand-portable system.

473
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,429
Fires 25 smart rounds per second.

474
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:28,467
Multiple tracking modes,
plus the latest countermeasures.

475
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:33,338
Each round carries an explosive warhead
with selectable fuse delays.

476
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:38,346
Tracks, enters, pauses .1 microseconds,
then "Boom!"

477
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:40,540
Mixto rojo.

478
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:44,410
And this is his little brother.

479
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:46,886
Hasn't worked yet.

480
01:00:47,624 --> 01:00:51,151
Don't blame the tools.
I never had the go-ahead to terminate.

481
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:53,629
Let me show you how.

482
01:01:02,973 --> 01:01:04,133
That'll work, too.

483
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:06,572
We kill him, then it's over.

484
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,602
Hey, you two!

485
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,909
Come on! Check that shit!

486
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:16,209
Let's go.

487
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,748
What are you doing?

488
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:20,389
What are you doing?

489
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,987
Permission to speak, sir.

490
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:27,425
I know what I have to do.

491
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:31,058
I'll never get the chance to thank you
for squaring me away.

492
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,099
So, thank you, sir.

493
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,272
I'm calling the cops.

494
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,144
Just making sure you know, if we kill him--

495
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:52,848
You have to kill me. Kill me! I don't care.

496
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:56,386
As long as he's dead, I don't care.

497
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:58,321
If we kill him...

498
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:02,561
...there's a chance, some say,
this whole universe could go with him.

499
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:11,265
The Chinese guy
was tearing the place apart.

500
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:35,322
Wormhole ETA: ten minutes.

501
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:37,332
That vicinity.

502
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:04,023
He's here.

503
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,238
Shit. Take cover!

504
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:58,303
It's a bomb! Don't breathe for 20 seconds
after the blast!

505
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,388
Yulaw!

506
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:26,886
You came here for me.

507
01:06:28,164 --> 01:06:29,495
Now I'm here for you.

508
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:37,172
After this, there will be only one.

509
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,634
I won't be The One, but neither will you.

510
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:31,270
Shit! Three minutes.

511
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:39,454
Thirty seconds!

512
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:48,260
Shit.

513
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,544
Gabe, get out! Get out!

514
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:04,243
Get out!

515
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:36,308
That's him.

516
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:46,852
Scanning, RHV 579. Confirm.

517
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,661
Send him where he belongs.

518
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:07,876
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

519
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:11,982
Wormhole opens in one minute.

520
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,505
No, stop!

521
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:35,272
That's him, that's Yulaw.

522
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:39,114
Wormhole opens in 30 seconds.

523
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:41,508
Get him out!

524
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:48,919
Wormhole opens in 20 seconds.

525
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:58,829
Wormhole opens in ten, nine...

526
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:01,026
...eight, seven...

527
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:05,403
...six, five, four, three, two...

528
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:06,868
...one.

529
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:09,240
Wormhole opened.

530
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,061
That man doesn't leave this room.

531
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:32,758
Sir, he assisted in Yulaw's capture.

532
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:36,366
He's from an uninitiated universe
with no travel passport.

533
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:37,663
He goes back.

534
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,940
He can't go back.
They'll lock him up for life.

535
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,638
He will be cared for, watched over.
Like the other.

536
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:47,915
Balance will be preserved.
The wormhole closes in 40 seconds!

537
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,484
- Sir, permission to speak--
- Permission denied.

538
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:53,180
That order is bullshit!

539
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:57,148
It doesn't matter.

540
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:58,793
Take him!

541
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:24,375
I know where he has to go.

542
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:30,091
I have to send you where you belong.

543
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:35,325
It's procedure.

544
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,965
Coordinates accepted.

545
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:43,168
'Bye, Gabe.

546
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:45,930
Wormhole opens in...

547
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:48,771
...five, four, three...

548
01:17:49,178 --> 01:17:51,646
...two, one.

549
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,412
Look out!

550
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:05,188
Hey, you all right?

551
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:18,831
Ollie?

552
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:39,461
Excuse me, I have a....

553
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:41,893
What happened?

554
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,359
Car.

555
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,301
Do I know you?

556
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:19,326
- Fresh fish.
- Got a pretty mouth.

557
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:24,200
I am Yulaw! I'm nobody's bitch.

558
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:27,298
You are mine.

559
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,276
I don't need to know you.

560
01:19:32,948 --> 01:19:36,281
You only need to know me.

561
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I will be THE ONE.
