1
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:50,588
Buster 19.
Here is Rubber Duck.
Does anybody love me?

2
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:44,624
Godklere.

3
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,670
Damn.

4
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,385
Godklere.

5
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,864
Log please.
- You have the wrong.

6
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:09,589
That girl passed me with 120.
When she slowed down
to comb her hair.

7
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,624
She let me not pass.

8
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:15,507
You have exceeded the
speed limit by 16 km.

9
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:19,983
It costs one hundred U.S. dollars.
- That's right.

10
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,145
It was worth it.
- What?

11
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:28,984
That girl has no panties on.
I looked down and there it was.

12
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:34,824
That was what?

13
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:38,662
You understand me?
She has no panties on.

14
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,542
Look, she's just waiting.

15
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,913
No panties?

16
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,983
Absolutely nothing.

17
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:04,113
Ok, I leave it with a warning.
But watch out now.

18
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:30,153
Breaker 19, bear east
at the l-40.

19
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:34,107
Approximately 243 to pole.

20
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:40,383
Thanks, buddy.
Where are you exactly?

21
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:45,865
I drive east on the same spot.
Where are you?

22
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:48,872
Mile behind you.

23
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:55,747
I see you. Nice car you have.

24
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:02,232
Yes we can.
Spider Mike is behind me
and I am Love Machine.

25
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:07,388
You know why?
I have a color TV ...

26
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:13,907
...a full bar behind
me and a waterbed.

27
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,903
All comfort, friend.

28
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,628
Got a bunch of dancers on board?

29
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:26,271
Yes, he has. A nice couple.

30
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:29,386
Nice load cattle, you mean.

31
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:35,263
Quiet here.
Any idea who is there for you?

32
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,783
No idea. Who then?

33
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,347
This is the Duck, old thief.

34
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:49,430
Jesus, Mike.
It is Rubber Duck.
We have the best first.

35
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:54,031
I've heard more stories about
you than about Jesse James.

36
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:57,190
You are now a real
desperado to move.

37
00:06:57,313 --> 00:07:02,023
Love that old machine takes
what he can get.

38
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:09,626
We will ride his name
into pigsty?

39
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,709
That name has cost me
a lot of money, boy.

40
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:19,226
Can be honest, but
my fan does not.

41
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:22,072
So I do it to calm down.

42
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,230
Go ahead.
I'm not going anywhere.

43
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,584
Breaker 19, Cottonmouth
Rubber Duck.

44
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:36,512
I hear you, Cottonmouth.

45
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:41,504
Not bear to see.
Everything is green, so get it.

46
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:46,309
You have me and two others
behind you, over.

47
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,106
It is a pleasure.

48
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,424
The stench here is not to keep.

49
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,470
Who is that? About.

50
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:59,030
This is the handsome Love Machine
Mack with the fastest available.

51
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:04,392
Maybe so, but I have heard
that you are a limp rag.

52
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,661
Does he mean me?

53
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:12,229
I turn you on your alligator.

54
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:16,949
Mack is my everything that
is on the road rolls.

55
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,228
I do not get behind you, pig.

56
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:05,308
Slow down, there's
a bear's nest.

57
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,823
Holy shit.

58
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,224
Damn.

59
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:33,112
You kicked him well on
his tail, h boys.

60
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,103
Hi, RD.

61
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,066
Guys, this is Papa Bear.

62
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,071
It is long since.
- Six years.

63
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,743
Six years.

64
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:52,784
I should have known it was you.
- What do you mean?

65
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:58,067
On your cup, Cottonmouth.
- Can not, I have no cup.

66
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:03,631
Moreover, I lok no offenses committed.
- That'll do, asshole.

67
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:14,865
I can summon you because
you are 120 reasons.

68
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:21,585
But I will make you well.

69
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:25,149
Let's say you 110 reasons.

70
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:29,462
That will be about ...
- $35.

71
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,944
And insurance does
at one hundred.

72
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:39,867
Maybe something more.
- Come on, Lyle ...

73
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:45,829
If you want to avoid it,
I have a nice cell ...

74
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:50,344
...and your car seized.

75
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,469
How much, Lyle
- Fifty the man.

76
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,784
Dirty bastard.
- Sixty.

77
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:02,464
Calm down, it is not an auction.
- So what?
I deserve more than him.

78
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,948
I'm broke.

79
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:08,588
It's my job to my stretch
of road safe.

80
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:12,547
From me you can rot in the ditch.
- Seventy.

81
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,585
My ass.
- Keep your calm.

82
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:22,023
Now let's go for something
else he invents.

83
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:27,584
Lyle, soon hear from us.
- Why?

84
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,864
Our association will
organize the police.

85
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:34,747
Not me.
I need you rotvakbond not.

86
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:39,422
Not my league, Lyle.
I'm my own boss.

87
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:46,263
Then we have one thing in common.
- Two. We begin to die.

88
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:58,865
What a joker.
What do you know him?

89
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:04,465
Another of my first parking fine.
And he wants to give me my last.

90
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:14,828
Would not it about time to eat?

91
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:20,346
Yes, I do not want.
- You have to treat me.

92
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,591
Raphael's Drive lnn,
here's Rubber Duck.

93
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,263
What is this?
Do you love a sale?

94
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,749
I try to get everything
in one bag.

95
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:40,624
They sell this?

96
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:44,223
No, this bird feathers
gives her away.

97
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,825
I'll tell Violet.
- Roger.

98
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:51,706
Three dollars and a salad.

99
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:58,828
The Duck is coming.
- The year comes.

100
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:03,311
He gives you a ride.
- Maybe, as my taxi is not.

101
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:08,871
2000, I do not go higher.
All the wiring must be renewed.

102
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,263
Take this.

103
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,028
I would not give away.

104
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:20,146
I lose it.
- I guess.

105
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:24,390
Want to see my papers?
My driver's license?

106
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,583
Go, baby.

107
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:34,352
Ok, who wants it
- I prefer.

108
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,784
How much?
- Five dollars.

109
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,869
Ten.
- Twelve.

110
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:42,952
Fifteen.
- Come on. But is fighting.

111
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,388
Hey, Duck.

112
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:00,424
How you doing, Jack?
Throw it full.

113
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,749
That red thing is you
probably better.

114
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:35,912
Did you miss me?
- Yes we can.

115
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:38,704
Do that somewhere else.

116
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:45,031
How is it with my black widow
- I can not complain.

117
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:49,550
How you doing here?
- This is the Duck.
She needed a ride.

118
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:53,183
And then the XKE?
- I sold.

119
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,349
You know each other?

120
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:59,466
He told the officer that
I rode around naked.

121
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,188
I might know.

122
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:08,231
I have sent him to a motel.
He will still wait for me.

123
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:15,261
Ever ridden in a truck?

124
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:20,112
Would you like to?

125
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:22,823
Maybe.

126
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:30,872
Come, I have a surprise for you.
- That you will. Do not go away.

127
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,470
Are you mad at me
- I mad at you?

128
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:37,187
Note how this approach.

129
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:41,272
Is that my elevator
- that's him.

130
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:44,386
Do not be, baby.

131
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:49,143
My heart belongs to you.
- Yeah, for one second.

132
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:53,829
That's not my fault.
When are you going away from
that loser of yours?

133
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,310
He is not a loser.
It's you against him
only one bite.

134
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:01,505
Yes, especially you, Mr.

135
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:07,504
I Love Machine.

136
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,548
No, he called pigsty.
- That is temporary.

137
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,469
Wait, I'll call you.

138
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:28,152
I hear that you are looking for a lift.
- That she has al The Duck.

139
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,583
I'll take you to his truck.

140
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:39,186
Pigsty ...
Sorry, Love Machine, he's birthday.
Leave him here.

141
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:41,873
Let's go get that salad.

142
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:47,988
She likes me though.
- Yeah, that's clear.

143
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:54,426
It is finished. Come on.

144
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,023
Will you help me unpack
your gift?

145
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:27,592
What should I do?

146
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,431
Look outside.

147
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:49,505
What would that vetbuil like
- check insignia, I think.

148
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:53,911
You should also watch out.
- I am in for a joke.

149
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,184
What will he do?
- Bullying policeman.

150
00:17:57,473 --> 00:18:02,752
How do you know my birthday
- I know so much.

151
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:07,747
Buster, I receive one?

152
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:13,225
Yes, I hear you.
- There is a cop on the check.

153
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:18,302
You know who the bear is? Dirty Lyle.
A really big bag.

154
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:23,310
Yes, a real fatboy. Like a pig.

155
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:28,148
When he got out, he bounces
like a ball.

156
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,587
He bounces like a beaver eyed.

157
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:41,231
He was determined so greedy because
he saves for a brothel.

158
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,068
Here he comes.

159
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:53,825
It was nice talking to you.
- You're welcome.

160
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:55,906
Where is the Duck
- Duck What?

161
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:15,109
Lyle is here.
And he is looking moth.

162
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,187
Pigsty.

163
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,949
How much money do you have?

164
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:36,304
I have enough, thank you.

165
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:41,382
I do not know what you run,
but come the hell here.

166
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:44,823
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

167
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:54,383
H, boy. How about you?

168
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:57,348
The bastard.

169
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:01,748
I'm broke, you know it.

170
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:08,627
Then I will arrest you for
vagrancy, young man.

171
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,425
Stand up and lean
against the bar.

172
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:15,862
Stand up.

173
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,062
You heard me.

174
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:23,387
Thanks, friends.
You know how you can
ruin a birthday.

175
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:27,472
Let's go. Pack your stuff.

176
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:31,472
Wait.

177
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,031
They have not done anything
What do you do?

178
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:42,986
He's crazy, man.
He wants to get me for vagrancy.

179
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:46,185
But I'm not going to jail.

180
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:50,462
My wife having a baby.
I must go home.

181
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:54,421
Really, Lyle.
She goes on everyday.

182
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,588
Does anybody know who
the father is?

183
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,027
Go there.

184
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:17,988
Dirty bastard, which
I did not pick.

185
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:31,463
Arizona can now be forgotten.

186
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,986
Go to your car.
- You too.

187
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:48,307
Stand still.

188
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:55,068
I've been waiting for you.
- My car broke down.

189
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:00,262
Excuse me
- Reverse.

190
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:26,344
Did you see that?

191
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,509
Put it on their behalf.

192
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:54,471
I just rebuilt everything.

193
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:08,746
I can not work.

194
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,352
This is my business.

195
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:14,543
Come on, get out.

196
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,870
Grab him.
- As far as I am.

197
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:28,071
Come on, Pat.
- Rear, you.

198
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:13,590
I'll bite your ears
off, big lout.

199
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,828
That's not a cop, but a
donkey with a uniform.

200
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,183
Good fight, Duck.

201
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,630
Help me here. Hurry.

202
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,783
Come on, get out.

203
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:03,392
Ram it together.

204
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:08,622
Pull the wires but rather loose.

205
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:20,509
Pull them out.
- The spark plug wires.

206
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,547
Here he comes close to it.

207
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:28,589
Unpack the distribution.
- Drag the whole lot out.

208
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:37,902
Where you going?
- The border.

209
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,824
Why not?

210
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:44,513
They can make us anything.

211
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:19,946
Happy birthday.

212
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,702
Best.

213
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:18,182
Do not stand there stupid.
Give me my gun.

214
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:23,263
Here it is.
- Give over.

215
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:32,505
Where were you? Help me.
Give me an ax or something.

216
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,907
I have a nail file.

217
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:42,069
You know what you can
do with your nail.

218
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:48,267
Wait a minute.

219
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,587
You say I do.

220
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,628
From the road.

221
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:29,662
Does anyone have a car?
Do not stand there so stupid.

222
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:36,866
Wait. I need your car needs.

223
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,665
What are you doing?

224
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:45,670
Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

225
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:49,468
What do you have in your mouth?
What are you doing?

226
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:53,507
Out. Hurry the fuck.

227
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:01,541
I get you later.

228
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:20,703
How is my nose after that
collision with that cop?

229
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:25,784
Yes, I was rather slow.
He is not broken.

230
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:30,947
It was just as good.
- Yeah, they were
bored to death.

231
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:35,868
To the widow his knockout kick.
- Yeah, look out.

232
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:41,271
Where are we going?
It's getting unhealthy.

233
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,908
Do you remember when
we used road names?

234
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:49,629
Here we come safely to
the state border.

235
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:54,028
Ok, that I will.

236
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:58,546
Who else is more with us?

237
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:02,501
This Old Iguana.
I am a sex-crazed lizard.

238
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:12,185
I have to get the
plane to Dallas.

239
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:16,227
What?
- Wedding Pictures.

240
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:23,067
That plane will not
currently get.

241
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:29,064
H, get away from.

242
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:35,309
Where is your direction?
Get the fuck aside.

243
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:44,706
Give me something to that
crap from my face wipe.

244
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:53,153
Would you like coffee?

245
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:02,549
Well, I still remember him.

246
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:17,827
We go sharp left at
the next junction.

247
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,422
Get her out.

248
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,388
You okay?

249
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:05,024
She all right?

250
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:09,069
Pack my stuff.

251
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,906
You okay, ma'am?
- Yes, thank you

252
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:17,790
White fucking thing.
I had to buy a black truck.
Come on, get out.

253
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:20,541
I get next to you.

254
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:33,061
All right, widow
- Yes, apart from
a bruised butt.

255
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,947
One less.

256
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:56,384
That is ridiculous cop
out that Natoosha.

257
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:22,785
Give me a T-shirt.

258
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,151
Watch out.

259
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:56,788
All Jesus, I was Lyle Wallace.

260
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:06,108
Rubber Duck here.
Was that you, Lyle?
Can you hear me?

261
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:09,985
I hear you.

262
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:16,062
You okay or should I
send a meat truck?

263
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:20,107
That will you need later, bitch.

264
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:25,787
You go first such exercise
for your back stunt.

265
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:29,622
I get the State Police there.

266
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:34,984
And then we will sit behind
your rag, you bastard.

267
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,948
Sorry Lyle, I receive you badly.

268
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:43,302
In addition, he must
first deal with us.

269
00:35:43,713 --> 00:35:49,231
Ten years.
At least ten years, even
with good behavior.

270
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:55,709
Here is Lyle Wallace, sheriff of Natoosha.
I've needed assistance.

271
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,872
I'm at the old farm road 109.

272
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:08,593
I've had enough.
I grab my stuff and get out.

273
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:15,391
If you want to stop here.
I probably get a lift.

274
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:20,507
Ok, I'm ready.

275
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:24,424
Can you hear me? I want out.

276
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:28,313
Would you like?

277
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,982
We are haunted.
If you look like, you can jump.

278
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,230
Would you also for kidnapping?

279
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:43,268
That's for teenagers.
...I am well into his thirties.

280
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:12,627
I'm Bob Buckman, and I
hate truck drivers.

281
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,744
Lyle Wallace County
Sheriff Natoosha.

282
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,307
Get away from me.

283
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:32,304
It must be here somewhere.
An old achterafweg
to New Mexico.

284
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:41,865
We're here.
Get ready for a sharp turn.

285
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:14,585
This is not a road but a path.
- Not even that well.

286
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:17,227
Do me a favor ...

287
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:22,103
Is that window shut.
- Is broken.

288
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:36,104
An invisible escape route.
Now we never find them.

289
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:43,230
Exactly.
This is the plan: we will
soon draw to suit ...

290
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:47,392
...Vaseline and I share and
an extra ration of rum.

291
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,949
There they are.

292
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:59,465
Take that road to the right.

293
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:14,151
My god, what a dust.
- Close your windows
shut, idiot.

294
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:21,104
Here at the Duck pigsty.
Are you still there?

295
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,384
My waterbed sloshes
around in tatters.

296
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:27,823
The heaviest blow that ever
since I've decorated twins.

297
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:30,706
I follow your smell, pigsty.

298
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,710
A curve.

299
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:37,983
Watch what you do.
- Shut up. I drive.

300
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,432
Leave it to one side
of the road.

301
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:45,511
Stay on one side of the road.

302
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:56,426
Why does he want?

303
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,022
We can not wait.

304
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:17,229
Watch out, we store for later.
- Shut up.

305
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:22,502
Word now is not bad.
- I'm not angry, I'm terrified.

306
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:01,067
I got them.

307
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:15,262
What is he doing?
- No idea, it is stopped.

308
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:24,064
These cops can not drive.
Another one of the road.

309
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,912
It's not them.

310
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:02,992
Here Spider Mike.
The kit sits behind me.
I will slow down some.

311
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,793
You fucking ...

312
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:37,062
They deserve a windfall.
Shall we let them through?

313
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:40,512
That seems like a good idea.

314
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:46,511
They are wise.

315
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:50,512
Close the door. It starts tours.

316
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,425
Jesus, they take the sheriff
in the sandwich.

317
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:11,872
There's a bear in
the fall, pigsty.

318
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:26,791
Here you have certainly
practiced.

319
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:56,832
Well done, Sheriff.

320
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:00,427
See ya, cop.

321
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:08,469
Here Sheriff Lyle Wallace for the sheriff of Natchez.
You read me?

322
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,744
Sheriff Stacey Love here.
I get you

323
00:45:14,113 --> 00:45:19,631
I'm in the 109 behind a convoy
of truckers fugitive.

324
00:45:20,513 --> 00:45:23,949
They are led by a certain
Rubber Duck.

325
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:27,782
They can be any time over
the state border.

326
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:31,225
Thanks.
You have our cooperation.

327
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:36,787
We would like to get
another car ...

328
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:46,502
...and a clean pair
of trousers.

329
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:55,751
Attention all cars.
Sheriff Stacey Love You.
Report u.

330
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:08,389
New Mexico, here we come.

331
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:17,344
New Mexico?
I have to go to Texas.

332
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:23,072
Do that again.

333
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:57,351
This Love Machine to the
boys on the hill.

334
00:46:58,073 --> 00:47:01,224
I receive you. Say it.

335
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:03,902
What are you doing?

336
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:10,104
Waiting on you.
We already half hours listening
to what you do.

337
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:16,312
Congratulations.
Especially the Rubber Duck.
That was good work.

338
00:47:16,713 --> 00:47:18,783
We're famous.

339
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:20,824
Thanks, guys.

340
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:30,148
Bald Eagle, Big Nasty and Sneaky Snake
would like to ride with you.

341
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:33,585
Why not? Join it to.

342
00:47:34,153 --> 00:47:39,227
Thanks.
It is an honor to be driving
behind the Rubber Duck.

343
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:48,022
And we also have some long-haired
friends of Jesus to us.

344
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:53,707
Hi, this is Reverend Robert Sloane
with his church moving.

345
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:58,947
The Bible says nothing that you
can not run full throttle.

346
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:04,182
Welcome, Reverend.
We could use some
spiritual support.

347
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:08,108
With pleasure, brother Rubber.

348
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:13,548
Rubber brother?
Who is this guy?
It is no pastor.

349
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:23,305
Why do they call you the Duck?
- Because it rhymes with luck.

350
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:26,266
My dad always said:
Be like a duck.

351
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:30,671
Calm above the water and paddle
furiously underneath.

352
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:40,022
What are you looking for?
- A beer. You too?

353
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:46,470
No, I try to quit.
But give me one of
those T-shirts.

354
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:51,182
Please.

355
00:48:57,713 --> 00:49:01,388
I lived with a man I
could not really.

356
00:49:01,513 --> 00:49:05,665
He let me do something I did not want.
Paragliding.

357
00:49:09,953 --> 00:49:12,342
Speak louder.

358
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:16,668
Hang gliding. I've tried.

359
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,508
And it was terrible.

360
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:25,831
A whole convoy, and they
like racing, but by ...

361
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,431
Luckily it worked.

362
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:36,228
And your boyfriend
- that was nothing.

363
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:43,991
Children?

364
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:47,549
I was married.
I have two children in Spokane.

365
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:50,949
You see them sometimes
- if I get the chance.

366
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:53,587
They have a good mother.

367
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:02,109
Do you have space for Rioolman?

368
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:06,192
We already have some rats.
But must come.

369
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:13,508
Pigs, cesspools and nasty
odors ride back.

370
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:18,312
Welcome to the convoy, guys.
But close.

371
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,749
Here is the Mississippi Flash.

372
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:42,582
The only things that count in
life are fast trucks ...

373
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:44,988
...fast women and fast food.

374
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:49,231
You know how big this is?
Look out, man.

375
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:56,066
Duck, We have a very convoy.
Check it out.

376
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:02,231
Incredibly, where do they come from
- everywhere.

377
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,787
Unbelievable. Why?

378
00:51:05,913 --> 00:51:09,189
You should not ask me.
I run for my life.

379
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:11,747
But they follow you.

380
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:14,947
No, I happen to front row.

381
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:28,823
Duck, there's a bear in the air.

382
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,864
Attention, all trucks.

383
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:37,181
This is federal agent Hamilton.

384
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:40,988
I immediately ordered
your car to a halt.

385
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:44,310
You violate federal laws.

386
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:52,591
Attention, driver
Martin Penwalt.

387
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,388
Sounds crazy, h.

388
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:03,586
You're under arrest.
Immediately stop your vehicle.

389
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,382
Unbelievable. What is this?

390
00:52:07,513 --> 00:52:11,426
You do it wrong, Hamilton.
You have to say ...

391
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:15,592
Rubber Duck, you get me?
Rubber Duck.

392
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,943
Rubber Duck?

393
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:24,742
That is his name-CSF.
Otherwise he does not listen.

394
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:32,823
Attention, Mr.
Rubber Duck.
Bring your vehicle to a stop.

395
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:35,421
You're under arrest.

396
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:44,867
Apparently she told me.

397
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:48,781
Yes, I have the
quipment checked.

398
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:53,868
This is a gentegreerd system with
crystal-controlled stage.

399
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:57,867
We know they are on channel 19.

400
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:11,624
They are ready.

401
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:15,109
Sheriff Wallace, we are
down here ready.

402
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,066
Have you pressed the button?

403
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:25,150
They have their own language.

404
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:31,907
You try it once.

405
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:41,665
Buster 19.
This is the bear in the air,
Sheriff Lyle Wallace ...

406
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:48,551
...Rubberzak to your filthy
black rattletrap.

407
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:54,149
Use such language in
the ether, Lyle.

408
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,663
You're talking about my
beautiful black truck.

409
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:00,512
That thing you call a truck ...

410
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:07,232
...is the most disgusting piece of scrap
that I ever got thrown on the voucher.

411
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:12,428
And Martin, look for you.

412
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:17,982
We have a roadblock with
twenty armed men.

413
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,382
Get ready, here they are.

414
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:29,306
They have orders to you and that piece of junk
to shoot full of holes if you do not stop.

415
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:37,706
Listen, Lyle.
Go for yourself that
are blocking.

416
00:54:38,553 --> 00:54:42,228
But first look what
is on my trailer.

417
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:47,711
Chemicalin, Lyle.
High Explosive substances.

418
00:54:48,393 --> 00:54:54,025
I was not around when I want
to ram your barricade.

419
00:54:54,553 --> 00:54:57,829
Are you serious? You're crazy.

420
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:05,509
Why did not somebody tell me
- he is bluffing.

421
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:11,947
Here he carries 40,000
liters nitromehanine.

422
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:17,305
Jesus, he carries explosives.

423
00:55:17,593 --> 00:55:21,791
It's official.
I want to talk the
person in charge.

424
00:55:21,993 --> 00:55:24,348
Go off the road.

425
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:34,111
There will be a terrible explosion.
Join instantly.

426
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:36,952
Are you deaf?

427
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:59,103
Is there someone who
can answer me?

428
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:05,983
Wait, my mother wants
to talk to you.

429
00:56:06,153 --> 00:56:08,986
Fuck your ass up.

430
00:56:58,673 --> 00:57:01,665
Come again gasp.

431
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:10,185
My god, they go to my town.

432
00:57:10,313 --> 00:57:13,430
Put all traffic stopped.
Let them through.

433
00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:17,341
Warn traffic. And hurry.

434
00:57:19,193 --> 00:57:21,707
See? Nothing wrong.

435
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:53,989
They go right to the city.
Damn, that water carriage.

436
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:59,588
What does that guy?

437
00:58:19,393 --> 00:58:26,902
Here Eighteen Cycling, I would
like to ride with your convoy.

438
00:58:27,273 --> 00:58:30,424
Let them all just drop dead.

439
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:35,105
With pleasure, eighteen wheeler.
Come on.

440
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:49,226
Duck, did you see that?

441
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,948
They are on our side.

442
00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:31,265
Residents of New Mexico, has done something
unheard of in our state.

443
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:36,713
Six trucks were on the border, followed
by the police of Arizona.

444
00:59:37,113 --> 00:59:39,547
Soon more came from.

445
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:44,030
They are not stopped
by roadblocks.

446
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:46,587
My God, you see that?

447
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:52,510
There are not more a dozen,
but 25, 50 or 100.

448
00:59:52,913 --> 00:59:58,306
Ladies and gentlemen, as I can see.
There is no end.

449
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:03,985
I'm going to find out who they
are and where they go.

450
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:09,308
So far, no one hurt, just
the pride of the police.

451
01:00:15,353 --> 01:00:20,029
Buster 19, Rubber Duck.
Breakers 19, Rubber Duck.

452
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:31,627
I'm Chuck Arnoldi, press assistant
to Haskins governor of New Mexico.

453
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:37,267
He bears the truckers for
years a warm heart.

454
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:40,430
I can help you solve problems.

455
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,706
What example?

456
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:51,351
Is this a kind of
protest convoy?

457
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:54,983
And if so, to what end?

458
01:00:57,953 --> 01:01:00,672
Our goal is to continue driving.

459
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:05,822
Reverend, you will see this as a convoy
of spiritual or political issue?

460
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,468
Life is a spiritual matter.

461
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:31,667
Crusher 19, the Rubber Duck.
Arnoldi Here. Can I have a word?

462
01:01:31,913 --> 01:01:34,711
What have you learned, Chuck?

463
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:40,785
A lot.
The governor would meet
with you personally.

464
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:44,986
He is willing to talk
with everyone.

465
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:49,909
He has to establish an area in
Albuquerque for the night.

466
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,582
The police order to
leave you alone.

467
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:57,149
Bullshit.

468
01:01:58,793 --> 01:02:02,103
Can I frank?
- Go ahead.

469
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:07,906
This is unofficial.
It may not be on TV or
in the newspaper.

470
01:02:10,753 --> 01:02:13,187
Translate me?

471
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:19,462
The governor has asked the
National Guard to deploy.

472
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:22,663
But this is an election year.

473
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:27,992
And the governor wants the
Senate to find out.

474
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:34,583
Do you know who they
are along the side?

475
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:37,665
Do you?
- Voters.

476
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:44,185
What will they think if the governor
lets shoot you to pieces?

477
01:02:44,793 --> 01:02:49,150
Help him, he can help you.

478
01:02:53,593 --> 01:02:56,266
Do we have a choice?

479
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:10,182
Spider Mike the Duck.
My wife is about to explode.

480
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:13,032
I'm almost fucking father.

481
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:15,303
That is good news, Mike.

482
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:19,745
I must go now. Best.

483
01:03:19,873 --> 01:03:23,070
We will miss you.
Give my regards to your wife.

484
01:03:23,193 --> 01:03:27,345
This Love Machine.
Good luck with your baby.

485
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:31,341
It was fun, Mike.
- Bye, baby maker.

486
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:35,386
Keep the gas on the shelf
until you get home.

487
01:03:36,273 --> 01:03:42,792
Good trip through Texas.
Put the Alamo greetings from me.

488
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:46,664
Next time I will propose
you my son.

489
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:49,666
Keep it up for me.

490
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:56,385
I hope he saves.
They seem to have no blacks.

491
01:03:57,273 --> 01:04:01,949
A wonderful opportunity
to get the headlines.

492
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:06,267
Liberal, humanitarian headlines.

493
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:10,945
Truckers. Gear, just gear.

494
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:14,743
No, normal people.
- Harness.

495
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:20,189
I think that is more popular
than we convoy.

496
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:25,102
Let sheriff in Wallace.

497
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:28,270
Sheriff Wallace was rushed
to Texas left.

498
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,541
What is he in Texas?

499
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:36,345
It attracts up to 2100 rpm.
Then switch.

500
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:46,111
He drops back to 1800.
This is good for 18 to 21 tons.

501
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:52,145
You love this truck, h
- I do not like this truck.

502
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:57,425
I know someone who really
takes his truck.

503
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:01,472
He even has his dog
named Kenworth.

504
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:06,428
For me it is mainly driving.

505
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:44,710
Where can we find
the Rubber Duck?

506
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:47,222
Give him a chance to
dry himself off.

507
01:05:47,353 --> 01:05:50,789
I want pictures.
- No, you make no pictures here.

508
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:54,025
Thurs with your money.

509
01:05:55,713 --> 01:06:00,833
You have ridden fast, Lyle.
- Yeah, but I am tired.

510
01:06:12,993 --> 01:06:17,748
What are you stupid
black bastard.

511
01:06:20,593 --> 01:06:25,667
You're too late for the party.
You had firmly enjoyed.

512
01:06:30,193 --> 01:06:34,948
You know where to strike.
- You offered resistance.

513
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:39,351
All right, if you
do not save me.

514
01:06:39,473 --> 01:06:44,024
I have not beaten.
I helped you on your feet.

515
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:47,822
Thanks, but I no longer
need your help.

516
01:06:51,753 --> 01:06:56,873
If I hear about your child,
you let me know.

517
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:03,192
For now you stay with us.
- Why?

518
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,789
As bait.

519
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:16,671
Suppose they all come.
- No, that's not his style.

520
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:21,543
We offer a lot of money
for a story or photos.

521
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:27,062
What a lot of money
- $500 for good pictures.

522
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:32,509
For $2500 you get the first
exclusive series.

523
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:37,703
This is no time to do business.
- I will get dressed.

524
01:07:38,353 --> 01:07:40,742
You're the Rubber Duck.
- I'm in a hurry.

525
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:43,945
I want to do business.
- I.

526
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:48,426
You're wet.
- Oh yeah?

527
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:52,309
Suits you.

528
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:55,789
Guess, I'm going squander.

529
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:03,349
Are you the convoy?

530
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:07,551
Do not worry.
I make sure you get help.

531
01:08:17,113 --> 01:08:19,229
I do not sell story.

532
01:08:19,353 --> 01:08:24,222
Of course. You have to bleed.

533
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:27,783
That will be best.

534
01:08:28,193 --> 01:08:32,152
You'll need it for the lawyers.

535
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:37,182
I am concerned.
- Is that so?

536
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:41,066
Where?

537
01:08:41,193 --> 01:08:44,902
Stop this nonsense.
I try to help.

538
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:50,824
I know.
I mean, I want to know where
you feel your question.

539
01:08:50,953 --> 01:08:54,468
Because I'm really not.

540
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:03,263
We can talk it in my car.

541
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:13,743
Breaker 19, SOS.

542
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:19,663
Riding a 18-wheelers heading
west that I receive?

543
01:09:21,673 --> 01:09:25,632
Funny Fly Here, I receive you.

544
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:30,026
Enter a message to Rubber
Duck of the convoy.

545
01:09:57,513 --> 01:10:00,789
Bobby, your timing is perfect.

546
01:10:00,913 --> 01:10:05,987
I'll come back.
- No, wait. What is it?

547
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:15,430
Buster 19.
Spider Mike's in the cell
in Alvarez, Texas.

548
01:10:15,553 --> 01:10:18,590
He was half beaten to
death and needs help.

549
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:23,662
Here Mother truck, emergency.
Spider Mike needs help.

550
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:30,107
I do not know, Bobby.

551
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:33,543
I've been thinking about all those
people that we welcome ...

552
01:10:33,713 --> 01:10:36,591
...and join us.

553
01:10:37,313 --> 01:10:43,582
They follow us just because
they have no one else.

554
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:50,503
And that guy in the helicopter
we believe he can use.

555
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:55,588
Otherwise, he saw us standing.
And so we talk with him.

556
01:10:58,273 --> 01:11:03,984
The less you have, the less
you have to share.

557
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:09,228
Breaker 19, this is
Midnight Mover.

558
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:13,227
Spider Mike's in Trucker's
Hell in Alvarez, Texas.

559
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:21,831
I should only speak
to him first.

560
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:28,227
Keep everyone away.

561
01:11:54,953 --> 01:12:00,744
Jerry Haskins.
Glad you have time for me.
I know how busy you have it.

562
01:12:00,873 --> 01:12:04,627
Here you have a nice cross-section
of the population.

563
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:09,269
I know most of you were
well founded ...

564
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:15,787
...but the question
is what we can do.

565
01:12:16,193 --> 01:12:20,266
I know that your case
must be made clear.

566
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:25,431
Welcome, Governor. The press is waiting al
- Well, I come.

567
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:30,310
I first want to talk with
our hero, the Duck.

568
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:43,745
It's about more than
speed limits, right?

569
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:50,030
Spider Mike's in the cell.
He was beaten up.

570
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:57,151
Spider Mike's in Alvarez.
You must get him out.

571
01:12:57,273 --> 01:13:01,869
His back is broken.
- And his skull is
completely open.

572
01:13:13,193 --> 01:13:17,186
Governor, it's nice to have
you here in Albuquerque.

573
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:20,305
Yes, you're doing
a great job here.

574
01:13:20,553 --> 01:13:24,512
I need to ...
Wait, you know better.

575
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,386
I need to talk alone
with the Duck.

576
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:30,067
Then we see each other again.

577
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:32,787
Everybody out.

578
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:53,184
I think he needs help.

579
01:13:53,673 --> 01:13:55,664
Yes, come.

580
01:13:55,793 --> 01:14:01,390
I promise I will exert all possible pressure.
And that's not enough.

581
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:07,223
But if I were you I'd just
stay away from Arizona.

582
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:11,662
Black or white
- What do you mean?

583
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,710
Coffee.

584
01:14:13,913 --> 01:14:17,144
Black. And what would you go?

585
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:23,907
I want to take you to Washington.
As elected leader.
Because that you are now.

586
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,146
I need you.

587
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:28,468
Come on, Reverend.

588
01:14:35,753 --> 01:14:38,506
And you need me.

589
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:53,428
Spider Mike Lyle is stuck in Alvarez.
They have beaten him half dead.

590
01:14:53,673 --> 01:14:58,463
What does Alvarez in Lyle
- I go get him.

591
01:15:04,273 --> 01:15:08,061
Will you guys grow up again?

592
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:11,744
Would you help us?
- I try.

593
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:18,062
But I can not always get
criminals out of prison.

594
01:15:21,793 --> 01:15:26,150
Sometimes you sacrifice the individual.
- Bullshit.

595
01:15:28,113 --> 01:15:30,547
He's right.

596
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:36,744
It can cost months.
You have something nice,
do not destroy.

597
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:42,584
I'll do what I can, but he must himself
provisionally to survive.

598
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:45,910
Is that all?
- Yes.

599
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:50,548
Well, I must go now.

600
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:56,270
Take over.
You know what we need and
what we fight against.

601
01:15:56,553 --> 01:16:00,262
Take out what's inside.
It helps you.

602
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:04,022
Are you going away? Why?

603
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:09,872
Why do you always do
- I do not know.

604
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:15,467
It was just as good.
Can these people
you do not care?

605
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:29,193
Do me a favor and help Bobby
find out this thing.

606
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,629
You can do better than
him your word.

607
01:16:49,553 --> 01:16:51,828
You coming back?

608
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:07,345
Why did not you at that perslui?
They can you.

609
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:10,591
I did not want.

610
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:24,664
Can I sell you something?

611
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:28,263
No, thank you.

612
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:40,744
All of that loneliness is
a sentimental cowboy.

613
01:20:02,393 --> 01:20:04,384
Windows.

614
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,352
But here I go back.

615
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,386
You said he only would come.

616
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:40,230
Bye, Lyle.
- Where are you going?

617
01:22:41,953 --> 01:22:43,830
Come back.

618
01:24:12,913 --> 01:24:15,188
Central ...

619
01:24:46,993 --> 01:24:50,508
Where are the keys
- but look back.

620
01:24:58,433 --> 01:25:02,631
I knew you would come, but not
that you would need help.

621
01:25:02,753 --> 01:25:06,826
I did not ask.
They came by themselves.

622
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,267
This is something between
you and me.

623
01:25:15,273 --> 01:25:17,104
Look what you did.

624
01:25:17,353 --> 01:25:22,222
You're a criminal,
lying carrier.

625
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:28,504
And what are you?
Yourself look at that.

626
01:25:29,753 --> 01:25:34,668
An old piece of
iscarded rubbish.

627
01:25:35,793 --> 01:25:39,229
Say on, what virtues
you doing before?

628
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:44,787
I am the authority.
Do you understand that?
I represent the authority.

629
01:25:50,473 --> 01:25:54,307
I got shit on you and
your authority.

630
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:57,983
I'm glad to see you.

631
01:25:58,193 --> 01:26:04,223
They'd have to shoot.
If I had a gun, I did it myself.

632
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:09,309
And that badge would
you entitle?

633
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:15,870
Throw him in jail
and get a doctor.

634
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:29,510
No, he had nothing to do with it.
It was Alvarez.

635
01:26:30,593 --> 01:26:33,949
Forget it.
- I forget anything.

636
01:26:34,073 --> 01:26:36,792
This is not over.

637
01:26:38,273 --> 01:26:40,423
For me.

638
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,222
I'm sorry, man.

639
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:50,309
Does not worry about it.

640
01:26:50,713 --> 01:26:52,943
I'm really sorry.

641
01:26:54,473 --> 01:26:58,705
I do not like my other
debts to pay.

642
01:27:40,513 --> 01:27:43,471
Crusher 19, to all trucks.

643
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:47,222
Who does not want them to
Mexico, may now say.

644
01:27:47,393 --> 01:27:51,909
Meeting here. Okay, they agree.

645
01:28:02,953 --> 01:28:08,789
Let them but the tequila ready.
I'm right behind you.

646
01:28:09,193 --> 01:28:11,423
Bald Eagle joins.

647
01:28:21,793 --> 01:28:25,468
And you
- I love Mexico.

648
01:29:05,953 --> 01:29:11,471
Bobby, about 400 meters
to the river we turn.

649
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:20,308
Did you hear me, Bobby?

650
01:29:35,793 --> 01:29:38,751
Ok children to school.

651
01:30:15,633 --> 01:30:18,272
He wanted me dead drive.

652
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:25,391
Where are you, Bobby?

653
01:30:26,113 --> 01:30:31,312
I have a problem, Duck,
but I can handle it.

654
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:35,864
No time for trouble.
We're almost there.

655
01:30:36,033 --> 01:30:40,424
We are behind you and
see you in Mexico.

656
01:30:45,513 --> 01:30:48,107
What's going on?

657
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:51,828
We save us now. Drive through.

658
01:30:54,553 --> 01:30:57,909
My papers are in the car.

659
01:31:24,073 --> 01:31:26,223
He is coming.

660
01:31:53,433 --> 01:32:00,225
Buster 19.
Here is the bear with his gun.
Front of your door.

661
01:32:00,393 --> 01:32:06,468
Get out of your truck with your hands
up or you go into the air.

662
01:32:15,553 --> 01:32:19,148
Martin, can you hear me?
This is Lyle Wallace.

663
01:32:19,273 --> 01:32:23,186
You can not go along.
Get it out.

664
01:32:26,553 --> 01:32:28,783
I remain.

665
01:32:29,433 --> 01:32:31,867
Get out, I said.

666
01:32:56,073 --> 01:32:58,382
Take the door away.

667
01:33:01,913 --> 01:33:04,746
Duck, can you hear me?

668
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:21,469
Go ahead, Colonel.

669
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:28,829
Duck, you're dead. You're dead.

670
01:33:35,313 --> 01:33:37,907
Get out of here.

671
01:33:43,433 --> 01:33:45,663
Ready to fire.

672
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:53,903
Ready.

673
01:33:54,353 --> 01:33:56,469
Focus.

674
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:03,509
Fire.

675
01:34:16,433 --> 01:34:19,266
You poor wretch.

676
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:28,227
A lonely breed.

677
01:36:28,353 --> 01:36:31,026
Loud and proud men.

678
01:36:31,153 --> 01:36:34,828
But not too proud to cry.

679
01:36:37,913 --> 01:36:43,431
Embodies the tradition
of American cowboys.

680
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:48,787
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are gathered here ...

681
01:36:48,913 --> 01:36:52,588
...to this great American
honor ...

682
01:36:52,713 --> 01:36:58,424
...who gave his life for a cause that
is so important for us all ...

683
01:36:58,553 --> 01:37:02,341
...like many great Americans
before him.

684
01:37:02,673 --> 01:37:07,383
These truckers will now pass ...

685
01:37:07,513 --> 01:37:11,950
...the last tribute to
their fallen comrade.

686
01:37:12,153 --> 01:37:15,987
Can I have an amen
for our sister?

687
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:25,787
In their Macks, Jimmy's, Caywalkers
fruit trucks, garbage trucks ...

688
01:37:25,913 --> 01:37:28,871
...and even limousines.

689
01:37:29,273 --> 01:37:31,264
All truckers.

690
