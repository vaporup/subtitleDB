00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,454
Hey, transfer student.

5
00:00:56,025 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm here to give you a lesson,
not to play hide-and-seek.

6
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:13,535
Pricks like you always think
it's cool to fail a grade.

7
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,942
Look at him.

8
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:23,314
You, son of a bitch.
This is a no-smoking area!

9
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
- You bastard!
- What?

10
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:43,168
- That hurt.
- Why'd you hit me?

11
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:46,308
- Wasn't it blue?
- It was pink.

12
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:57,809
Are you okay, Jong-soo?
Our leader's still alive.

13
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:04,359
Did you hit me? It was you, huh?
Tell me, you shitheads!

14
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:08,096
Who the hell
threw something at me?

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,066
Hey!

16
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,101
You rotten punks.

17
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,768
If I told you to behave,
then you should listen.

18
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:21,500
This is why
I can't wear skirts.

19
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,941
Where are you going, asshole?

20
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,958
I heard you're the boss here.

21
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,564
Of course I am, asshole.
You son of a...

22
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:54,399
Then keep being the boss.
I don't care.

23
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,106
Hey asshole,
think you'll be the boss then?

24
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,250
Fuck, you're just a tutor.

25
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:17,357
Fuck? Oh my godness!

26
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:22,302
You little twirps.
You wanna die?

27
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:36,441
MY TUTOR FRIEND

28
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,852
You couldn't hold out
and quit again?

29
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,518
Mom, I can't do it.

30
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:16,956
Think making a living is that easy?
Have you forgotten already?

31
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:20,591
After your father lost his job,
I had to work so hard...

32
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:22,755
Okay, just give it to me.

33
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,231
Deliver it to Room 201, 202
in Chungwon Building.

34
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:30,171
I got you another tutor job.

35
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,798
If you give up on this one,
I'm giving you up.

36
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,171
Mom!

37
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,851
Remember my rich friend
I told you about?

38
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,892
She wants you to teach her son
for three months.

39
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:54,622
All you have to do is
making him study for two hours.

40
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:58,928
Do your best. This job will cover
your tuition for a semester.

41
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,695
She's right.

42
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:15,810
So, you must be Su-wan.
I'm Ji-hoon's mom.

43
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:19,651
How do you do?

44
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:25,591
It's the last room upstairs.
My poor face...

45
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,735
So you're the new teacher.

46
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:53,413
Nice to meet you.
Wow, you're handsome.

47
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,913
Kim Ji-hoon?

48
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:59,786
Ji-hoon is my elder brother,
I'm Sae-hoon.

49
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,394
I see.

50
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,760
Nice to meet you.

51
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,629
Same here.

52
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,899
You're very pretty.

53
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,767
Cute boy,
he's got good tastes.

54
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:15,606
Good luck with my brother.

55
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:28,110
This is a teenager's room?
It's big enough for a family.

56
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:34,983
Hi, I'm Choi...
I'm Choi Soo-wan

57
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:36,456
your new tutor.

58
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,687
Damn it, I told you
I didn't want a tutor!

59
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,985
Stop staring, damn it.

60
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:16,363
So you're 21?
So am I, born in March.

61
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,331
Got a problem with that?

62
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:26,740
How dare you?
Regardless of age, I'm your teacher.

63
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:29,334
I don't know
how you got that way.

64
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,005
No, I don't care. You little prick

65
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,984
better behave, got it?

66
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,245
...is what I want to say.

67
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:46,157
Fine then. It's fine with me.

68
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,890
Frankly, I don't like
to be called teacher.

69
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,498
So let's be friends.

70
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,566
So how shall we have class?

71
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,101
I'm busy with
classes on Tuesday, so...

72
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,697
Tuesday and Thursday,
from seven to nine.

73
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,936
And from one on Saturday.

74
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,244
Textbooks, procedures,
it's all up to you.

75
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:10,581
But it's up to me
whether I come or not.

76
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,879
Just fill in the hours and go.

77
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:16,085
Money?
I'll just give it to you.

78
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:11,875
Mom, do I have to do it?

79
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,707
So what's your point?

80
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:21,080
Alright, I'll do it!
I'll just do it, okay?

81
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,957
Smoke later.

82
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,303
I'm smoking
because I'm pissed now,

83
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:39,138
so are you asking me
to be pissed later?

84
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,731
It's hard to have class.

85
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,870
Then don't piss me off.

86
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:53,149
Damn it.
Then don't piss me off, too.

87
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,582
And textbook?

88
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,697
This is my English textbook.

89
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,831
Don't push it, okay?

90
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:34,485
What are you doing?

91
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
The best of its kind.

92
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:43,701
What is?

93
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:48,836
Don't you know?
Looks just like a flat screen TV.

94
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,407
Study!

95
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:55,042
Your nickname's
Country Chick, huh?

96
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,912
How'd you live
with a face like that?

97
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:03,582
Is this your tutor uniform?

98
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,616
You wore it last time,
so did you even wash it?

99
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,764
Kim Ji-hoon speaking.

100
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:22,740
- Gross, he's got the same ring tone.
- I don't want to go.

101
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,303
Where?

102
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,846
There aren't any hotties there.

103
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,014
I'm getting tutored right now.

104
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:36,846
So what are you bastards
doing not studying? Hang up.

105
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,130
Try reading it.

106
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:12,024
This is boring.
Man, this is so boring.

107
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:29,974
Where are you going?

108
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,211
No, I just came in.

109
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,250
I was studying,
and went to the store.

110
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:41,717
Tell your teacher
to have dinner with us.

111
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,688
That's why I came home early today.

112
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,595
It was on such short notice,
so I'm sorry there isn't much.

113
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,360
But eat plenty.

114
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,595
Yes, Ma'am.

115
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,236
Let's pray.

116
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:05,342
Like I've always said,

117
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:08,937
we're able to sit at this table
thanks to our heroes.

118
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:15,952
Due to the gangsters who fought
for us since Japan's occupation,

119
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:19,927
Sirasoni, Kim Du-han, Lee Jung-jae,
lm Hwa-su, Yoo Ji-kwang,

120
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:25,729
We're sitting here thanks to
these wonderful and great ancestor.

121
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:32,673
I'm grateful for them to bring
this tasty food to our table.

122
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:43,442
Thank you. Thank you.
The end. Let's eat.

123
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,181
Have a nice dinner, teacher.

124
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:34,096
Sir, what is this?
It's delicious.

125
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,000
Cow testicles.

126
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:09,899
Hey! Don't eat
at my house anymore.

127
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,235
You're disgusting.

128
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:21,479
Stop staring or I'll turn your eyes
into golf balls...

129
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,779
...is what I said to myself.

130
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:27,183
Please forgive
my evil thoughts.

131
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:31,551
When I tutor him,
I imagine ripping his guts out

132
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,152
and letting it rot.

133
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:38,596
I imagine him getting run over,
and his two legs break.

134
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:45,129
I imagine a brick falling on him
and smashing his brains.

135
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:49,000
Father, please forgive
these sinful thoughts.

136
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,375
Now that your sins
will be forgiven...

137
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,640
Wait, there's more!

138
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:57,274
When that bastard
smokes in front of me...

139
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:02,051
The way you smoked in the gym
looked spectacular.

140
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:06,592
When you spun around
and flicked your bud,

141
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:10,961
your back was so flexible,
and your legs were so stretched,

142
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,567
it was the greatest move
I've ever seen.

143
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:20,732
Actually, the gym is
no-smoking area.

144
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:28,740
By the way, how did you fall
two grades behind?

145
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,863
Kim Ji-hoon.

146
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,067
I'm Madeleine.

147
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,510
It's Yang Ho-gyung.
You're not Madeleine.

148
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:07,645
I use my Korean name
only for official reasons.

149
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:09,854
Do what you like.

150
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:12,785
Give it to me.

151
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:25,872
'Contradiction. ' Calvin Klein.
You use cologne, right?

152
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,964
I thought this would suit you.

153
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,711
Contradiction. Isn't it perfect?

154
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:41,154
The two of us meeting
in a place like this.

155
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,213
This is a contradiction.

156
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:47,191
Why don't you just marry him?

157
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,924
That's the idea. I finally met
the dream guy I was waiting for.

158
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:53,996
Dream guy?

159
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,098
Ho-gyung, one sec.

160
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:12,077
Hey, you old fart. Heard you
got a taste of living abroad, dickhead.

161
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,280
No wonder I didn't like you.

162
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:22,429
Yeah, so how'd you ever know
what goes on in the other land?

163
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,463
That queer hairstyle...

164
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,736
Oh gosh. I'm sorry.

165
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,875
You shouldn't have acted weak
from the beginning.

166
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,913
Now it's time to come out strong.

167
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,621
Whatever he says to you,
pretend not to listen.

168
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,654
And drill him with hard questions.
Throw them at him.

169
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:01,260
And then say,
"You don't even know this?"

170
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:07,567
- Okay, he's dead meat now. Victory!
- Victory!

171
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,165
Just do it!

172
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,176
Hi, Country Chick.

173
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:25,021
As if the moon went into the clouds.
As if, like, or as.

174
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:29,118
These are used for similes.
Number three is correct.

175
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,064
Can you give me some examples?

176
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:38,470
Ugly like Country Chick.
Ugly as Country Chick.

177
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,769
As if the Country Chick is ugly.

178
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:46,813
Excellent. Next question.

179
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:52,011
You feeling alright?
Why are you smiling? Wanna die?

180
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:56,316
- It's good to smile.
- On pretty faces it is.

181
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:01,554
The next question
deals with a group of poets.

182
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,691
Oh boy, this might be
too hard for you.

183
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:22,482
It's blood.

184
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,384
Hurry and wipe it!
You'll stain the desk!

185
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,718
Is the desk more important?

186
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:37,054
Whenever I see blood, I feel nauseas,
okay? Hurry and wipe it.

187
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:41,625
Where are you going?
We're not done yet.

188
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,913
Change your damn ring tone.

189
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:17,364
Hi, you've reached
Kim Ji-hoon's phone.

190
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:20,838
Who the hell are you
to answer Ji-hoon's phone?

191
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:25,238
Where the hell are you?
Why are you with Ji-hoon?

192
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:28,041
Give him the phone. Now!

193
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,516
What? You bitch.

194
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,853
Do you want your head
shoved down the toilet?

195
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,982
Come the hell out.

196
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,961
So I can put your face
in a mixer and drink it!

197
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,769
Ji-hoon, honey.
Are you still in the shower?

198
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,269
Hey!

199
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:58,772
Hurry and come out.
Since you're gone... Go to hell!

200
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,183
Stop the circus act.

201
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,346
Forgot your clothes?

202
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:11,049
Then turn around,
so I can get dressed.

203
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,587
What are you doing?

204
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,653
We have an hour left of class.

205
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,992
Then go in an hour,
and say I'm sleeping.

206
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,396
No, I can't do that.

207
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:24,306
Just shut up and go later,
I'll give you the money.

208
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,635
Hey.

209
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,615
Do you want me so much?

210
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,981
I can't lie.

211
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:43,454
Hold it in, okay?
How could you want your student?

212
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:44,923
You're scaring me.

213
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,721
That's not what I meant.

214
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:53,327
Why do you want to
get tutored anyway?

215
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,596
If it's to make a fool of me,
then stop getting tutored.

216
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,535
I'm not doing this for myself,

217
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,508
my old dad wants me to.

218
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,942
My old dad is really scary.

219
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:08,376
He'll cancel my credit cards
if I don't do this.

220
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:13,846
So don't get so upset.
It's bad for your health.

221
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:20,327
Let's live easily. See you later.

222
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,790
Hey! Hey!

223
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,897
Who are you?

224
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,459
Were you that bitch
on the phone?

225
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:05,335
Why are you coming out
of Ji-hoon's place?

226
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,905
I'm his tutor, so what?

227
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,375
Tutor? You're in college?

228
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:15,779
Then how come
you look so tacky? Watch it!

229
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:21,846
You're in high school, huh?
I'm older than you, so be nice!

230
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,025
Wanna play it rough,
tacky girl?

231
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:28,185
Hey!

232
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,761
The way you look is a relief.

233
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,633
I know it'll never happen,

234
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,835
but if you flirt with Ji-hoon
for even a second, you're dead.

235
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:44,434
Just tutor him well. Got it?

236
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,142
You rotten tramps.
Don't you have any older sisters?

237
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,817
Do it with the light on, idiot.
You scared me.

238
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,981
Hurry inside.

239
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:46,240
Hey, Kim Ji-hoon! What's up?

240
00:26:53,948 --> 00:27:00,979
You're my handsome man
I fell in love at first sight

241
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:08,394
If it's okay,
I want to wake up by your side

242
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,019
Feel it!

243
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:13,088
Don't worry at all

244
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:17,330
I already know
what you're thinking

245
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't have any
past love or memories

246
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:31,008
I love only you
Why don't you trust me?

247
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:37,787
You're the only one
in my life till I die

248
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:45,423
No, even if I die,
my love is only for you

249
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,030
So please open your heart,
trust me and love me

250
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,382
I reserved...

251
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:09,183
You idiot. You hit the cancel button,
not to reserve button!

252
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:10,690
Asshole!

253
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,711
What did you do now?

254
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,652
Wanna die?

255
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,385
It wasn't me!

256
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,324
Freeze, it's the police!

257
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,238
Tell them there's one more.

258
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,830
Say they missed a pretty boy
looking bastard, okay?

259
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,748
- Go!
- Get the hell going!

260
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:23,286
They said Kim Ji-hoon
isn't a minor.

261
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,330
Shit, that's right!

262
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,336
Get it right, you asshole!
You sons of bitches!

263
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,672
Fuck!

264
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,907
Why haven't you left yet?

265
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,676
You're not asking
to stay over, right?

266
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:15,942
You're not my type.

267
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,785
Take a taxi and go.

268
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,868
What's wrong with you?
Gone crazy?

269
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,641
I've met a lot of misfits before,

270
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,146
but you're the worst.

271
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:54,048
Why do you go to school?
To show off your money?

272
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,625
Even though you pay me to tutor,
you shouldn't do this.

273
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,923
I should get some respect at least.

274
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:08,134
You're not even a person,
so what's the use in learning?

275
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,099
Watch your mouth.

276
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:16,435
Why? You wanna hit me?
Fine! Hit me!

277
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,205
You should be ashamed
of being two grades behind.

278
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:24,777
Then stay in high school until
you're 30 or 40, you bastard!

279
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:37,064
As long as I got paid,
I thought it would be okay,

280
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:39,622
but I can't sell out
my pride anymore.

281
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,164
Bye.

282
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:57,112
Guys who are all talk
aren't really tough. He's a fake.

283
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:01,176
You need to be tougher
on guys like him.

284
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:05,316
But seeing the way he acts
and looks at me,

285
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:07,827
could he really hurt me?

286
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:12,161
It's all an act. Sis, you don't know
high school kids these days.

287
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:16,431
A third of our class pierced their ears.
Some even pierced their bellies.

288
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:23,103
Why isn't mom answering the phone?

289
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,019
Shit! What a shame...

290
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:46,189
Aren't you coming in?

291
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,001
Sit straight.

292
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,270
Don't be late anymore.

293
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,479
Call me two hours earlier
if you're late.

294
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,948
So I won't waste my time.

295
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:07,452
I thought you didn't
want to come anymore.

296
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:13,857
If you disagree with me, then fire me.
And we'll call it quits.

297
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:18,729
I've had a truckload
full of tutors before you.

298
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:22,663
But I was never the one
to say quit first.

299
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,202
They're the ones
who left first.

300
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,000
I thought you'd quit
in less than a month.

301
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,979
But this is fun.

302
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:37,982
I've never quit something
I started.

303
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,419
We'll see who is fun.

304
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,354
We were going to
study phrases, right?

305
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:50,323
Hey, do we really
have to study?

306
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:56,301
Then what else
is there to do here? Date?

307
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,329
Let's study.

308
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,404
Chinese phrases are usually
on tests, so listen carefully.

309
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,606
You know
'Four Enemies One Soul, ' right?

310
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:11,475
Yeah, fighting thugs
on all four sides.

311
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:13,787
'Small Needle Big Molehill.'

312
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:16,049
Exaggerating your ass off.

313
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:18,091
'Dark Play Good Shot.'

314
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:22,026
Good shot?
I know good shots.

315
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:27,466
In pool, you have several
good shots to win the game.

316
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:33,903
Like for example,
you have the snap shot.

317
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:35,999
'True Intimacy Friendly Foe.'

318
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:44,975
Listen carefully. You may think you
have a lot of friends now,

319
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:49,417
but if you're not true to them,
then it won't last.

320
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:55,720
If you run out of money,
then they'll leave you in a flash.

321
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,388
Watch your mouth, bitch.

322
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,955
What? What did you just say?

323
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,741
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:17,542
No smoking during lessons.
Do it on break time.

325
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:21,321
No, just quit instead.

326
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,691
Damn it.

327
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,294
Cheers!

328
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,970
What did I tell you?
You have to come out strong.

329
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:46,171
That was my advice.

330
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:51,048
I'm the one who said
guys are hypocrites.

331
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,647
So I'm the one
who gave her courage.

332
00:35:55,723 --> 00:36:03,424
Hey, hey. I'm the one who taught her
the special methods of tutoring.

333
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:10,060
What's wrong with you two?
It's my life that I'm risking.

334
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:15,403
So this occasion is for me. To me!

335
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,604
Remember, come out
strong one more time,

336
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,274
then you'll totally control him.

337
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:29,812
Don't worry.
He's in the palm of my hands.

338
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:34,160
English idioms can only be memorized.

339
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:38,857
Since your brain is blank,
it'll be to your benefit.

340
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,696
Really funny.

341
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:44,095
You should memorize
these idioms.

342
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,901
Be careful, watch out, take care...

343
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:48,805
That's what you should do.

344
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:53,272
Put up with, bear, and stand
are other examples.

345
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,645
They always come out on tests,
so memorize them.

346
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,087
Here's an easy way
to memorize them.

347
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,749
Imagine a bear standing.

348
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:07,156
The bear stands, so...

349
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:14,497
That's right. When a bear stands,
so will his dick.

350
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:18,227
Get your head
out of the gutter.

351
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,598
You better not
hit my head again.

352
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:24,142
I told you to turn off your phone!

353
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,470
It's yours.

354
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,421
Hello?

355
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:47,734
Si-kyung, is that you?
Where are you? Really?

356
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:54,171
When? I missed you so much.

357
00:37:54,741 --> 00:38:00,908
You sent a postcard to our club,
but you didn't mention me at all.

358
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:17,455
When? Really?
Okay. Bye, bye.

359
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:22,767
What?

360
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:25,897
There's actually some guy
who calls you?

361
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:29,932
He's on a different level
compared to your airhead girls.

362
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,408
I bet he's ugly.

363
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:36,712
He's more handsome than
any actors on the planet.

364
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:38,546
I haven't seen him,
so don't lie.

365
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,180
He's not a bonehead like you
who only likes pretty girls.

366
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:47,024
So you accept the fact you're ugly?
It's a good thing.

367
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:53,924
It's mine.

368
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:02,772
Kim Ji-hoon speaking.

369
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:07,712
I can't hear you.
Speak slowly and clearly.

370
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:10,013
Really?

371
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:14,912
You can't!
I can't let you go today!

372
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:16,888
If you keep this up,
I'll tell your dad!

373
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:20,448
Get out of my way! It's urgent!

374
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:21,459
I won't move.

375
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,292
I'm not kidding, damn it!

376
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,694
You can't go!

377
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,890
You're driving me crazy.

378
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:32,238
Hey! You rotten bastard!

379
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,089
Engine stop!

380
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,399
What situation is this?

381
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,462
We're on our way out
to buy a textbook.

382
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:09,468
Your teacher can buy it herself.

383
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:11,674
We were going to pick it together.

384
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:15,772
And she didn't know
the bus to the bookstore.

385
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,383
You little...

386
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:24,220
Yes, we need
an English textbook.

387
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:28,356
One that fits Ji-hoon's
level just right.

388
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:32,464
Then go buy a book,

389
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:37,026
and take a picture with it
to show me proof.

390
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,982
Ji-hoon! Ji-hoon!

391
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:05,859
Hey! What are you doing here?

392
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:07,923
So they're up there?

393
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:08,593
Yeah.

394
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,959
You two wait here.

395
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,973
Hey, so why did you come?

396
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,075
Think I wanted to come here?

397
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,513
So you couldn't resist
and sided with him?

398
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:24,548
You worthless traitors.

399
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:29,316
Hey assholes,
Ji-hoon's nothing without money.

400
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:36,057
Today, I'm going to make you all
regret siding with Ji-hoon.

401
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:43,066
Shit, do you like
getting your ass whooped?

402
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:57,446
What? So he's in a fight right now?

403
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:00,180
You idiot, think you
came here for a date then?

404
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,453
I thought you liked him,
so how could you be so calm?

405
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:11,794
Stop acting
like you're his mom.

406
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:16,734
If you're that worried,
then go up yourself, damn it.

407
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,062
Stop smiling, you asshole!

408
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,205
Hurry and get off.

409
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:39,185
Get over here. Come closer.

410
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:43,587
The textbook.
Hurry and stand straight.

411
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:51,894
Lean forward. Lean.
Smile.

412
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:56,899
Smile. Raise the book.
Smile!

413
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,665
Isn't he Kim Ji-hoon?

414
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:01,229
It is him!

415
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:02,468
Know him?

416
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:06,374
So this guy is your student?

417
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:10,546
So my temperamental sister
is still alive?

418
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:12,778
Hurry and tell me
what you know about him.

419
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,613
I heard this transfer student

420
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:19,124
trampled all over Lee Jong-soo,
the boss of Surim High.

421
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:23,254
He was a third year senior.
I heard he was so fast,

422
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,354
you couldn't see him move.

423
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,062
But why's he getting tutored?

424
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:32,104
Were there any rumors
that he didn't hit girls?

425
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,160
None.

426
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:36,035
I thought he was a fake.

427
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:41,343
But I didn't know it was him.
Can I have this picture?

428
00:44:41,415 --> 00:44:42,575
I wanna show it off.

429
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,296
Officer!

430
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:13,769
Where are you going?
Please don't leave.

431
00:45:16,149 --> 00:45:18,015
You can't leave, okay?

432
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:23,845
Mommy!

433
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:26,749
You scared me.

434
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,087
Going somewhere, Ma'am?

435
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:34,156
I have an alumni meeting.
Didn't your mom tell you?

436
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:40,968
Oh, right.
So no one's home right now?

437
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,770
Ji-hoon is, why?

438
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:50,944
Stop that! My Ji-hoon is not
that kind of boy.

439
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,877
But still.

440
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:58,015
Have a nice class.
Go driver.

441
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:21,307
What was I going
to teach you this time?

442
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,115
What's wrong with you today?
You were going to teach verbs.

443
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:35,694
'Tutor Freezes to Death
After Teaching Verbs'

444
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:43,962
Verbs might be
a bit hard for today.

445
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:46,968
What else?

446
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:52,837
What's wrong with you?
Feeling sick?

447
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,013
How about prepositions?

448
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:58,642
Prepositions?

449
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:06,720
I like sex positions better.

450
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:20,337
What are you doing?
Let's study instead.

451
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:25,635
Bear me my child.

452
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:33,149
No! No!
No, we're still too young.

453
00:47:42,962 --> 00:47:46,057
Are you fantasizing?

454
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:50,330
What's with you? I already have
too many girls who want me.

455
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:53,899
Take this off, too.

456
00:47:53,973 --> 00:47:56,305
But I'll have to go barefoot.

457
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,970
I know that, you idiot.
Hurry and take it off.

458
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,939
See if he has anything else.

459
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:04,004
Satisfied now?

460
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:11,319
Hey, take this, too.

461
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,522
I'll tell my brother you said hi.

462
00:48:15,595 --> 00:48:23,057
Of course you will, boy.
Wait. Put these on at least.

463
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,765
If you get to know me,
I'm a good guy.

464
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:29,738
Be careful going home.

465
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:36,770
Sometimes I vomit blood.

466
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:44,589
I must have tuberculosis.

467
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,495
Do you know that
it's contagious?

468
00:48:57,803 --> 00:49:00,466
I look too healthy to be sick.

469
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:06,437
So all this came from a
middle school kid's bag?

470
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:08,212
Yes, isn't it great?

471
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:10,613
We should make him
into a regular here.

472
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:14,745
If you beat up Ji-hoon,
we'll give you everything.

473
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,720
Only if he comes.

474
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:35,537
Why do you scums always
hang out at a pool hall?

475
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:38,232
Got nowhere else to go?

476
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,903
Think we like coming here
because we wanna?

477
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:43,711
Then tell me where else
we should hang out, asshole!

478
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:46,116
Stop babbling, idiot.

479
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:51,919
Are you Kim Ji-hoon?

480
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:53,618
Maybe.

481
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:55,758
Be nice to him, asshole!

482
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:59,993
He's a Makjubshi Gang boss
and they control this turf.

483
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:04,167
You look like a
real pain-in-the-neck.

484
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,839
Hey, have you heard
of our gang?

485
00:50:08,908 --> 00:50:14,506
I don't care what gang it is,
but your zipper's open.

486
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,642
Bastard.
Gonna hit me when I look down?

487
00:50:18,718 --> 00:50:22,586
Crazy bastard.
Then leave it open and fight.

488
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:28,252
Son of a bitch.

489
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,350
It's blood.
Big trouble.

490
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:29,149
If he sees blood, he goes nuts.

491
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:04,113
You stood me up again,
you rotten bastard.

492
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:09,316
Why aren't you giving me
the chance to talk to you?

493
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:13,955
Anyway, lessons are over.

494
00:52:14,033 --> 00:52:17,868
I'm too scared of you,
so I can't come anymore.

495
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:22,374
I'd rather my mom kill me.
Good-bye.

496
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,352
Stop pretending,
and help me up.

497
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:50,432
What happened to you?

498
00:53:05,952 --> 00:53:09,513
It's blood!

499
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:11,352
Don't scream, okay?

500
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:17,761
Be quiet or die.

501
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,491
Wanna die?

502
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:24,531
Will you be quiet?

503
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:44,180
Come on, damn it. Stop looking and
bring the bandage. It's in that drawer.

504
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:45,917
Okay.

505
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:54,551
What shampoo do you use?

506
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:56,986
But I use soap.

507
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,796
Don't be so rough, damn it.

508
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,874
Name.

509
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:50,381
Kim Ji-hoon.

510
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,417
Age.

511
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:52,917
Twenty-one.

512
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:54,385
Employment.

513
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,448
Student.

514
00:55:56,522 --> 00:55:57,749
What college?

515
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:59,819
I'm in high school.

516
00:56:01,294 --> 00:56:03,124
Are you proud of that, asshole?

517
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:16,441
Here's your plane ticket,
so go back.

518
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:17,839
I won't.

519
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,106
Go before I get angrier.

520
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,138
I blocked your expulsion,
but there's no use in staying. So go!

521
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:26,283
No, you go.

522
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:30,015
I'm too old to study abroad,
idiot!

523
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:40,098
I told you to
punch faster, boy.

524
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:44,499
Go.

525
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:45,731
I won't go.

526
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:47,238
Give me all your credit cards.

527
00:56:53,011 --> 00:56:58,778
Father! Please, not that...

528
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,160
Did you call, sir?

529
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,185
Clean out his pockets.

530
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:12,095
Dad, you're being too cruel.

531
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:15,424
Don't come closer.
You'll die if you do!

532
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:20,162
Dad! Dad!

533
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:25,711
'Su-wan's Fried Chicken'

534
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:40,149
Open the door and come out!

535
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,287
Okay, already.

536
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:47,388
So what brings you
to a chicken store, Madam?

537
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:49,366
Don't be so cold.

538
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:54,770
You being the only friend
I can turn to makes me mad.

539
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:57,207
So you came to
pick a fight again?

540
00:57:59,444 --> 00:58:04,144
Ji-hoon was never like that.

541
00:58:04,216 --> 00:58:07,618
Even though he fought sometimes,
he was a nice boy.

542
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:11,178
And he never started the fights.

543
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:15,955
I think it was wrong
to send him to America.

544
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:18,327
It was my idea, you see.

545
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:21,825
It's been a week
since he ran away.

546
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:26,629
What if something bad
happens to him, Kyung-ja?

547
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:13,709
Why is he so late?

548
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,850
Don't you have tutoring
lessons today?

549
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,653
That's too bad.
Si-kyung isn't your man anymore.

550
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,566
Here he comes!

551
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:45,540
It's a gift from Ji-hoon.

552
00:59:45,618 --> 00:59:48,142
Wow, can I try it on?

553
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,950
Think it'll look good on you?

554
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:53,116
Shall I buy you one, too?

555
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:57,629
Get a life.
Think you can afford this?

556
00:59:58,196 --> 01:00:00,665
Wow, Ji-hoon,
what a great watch.

557
01:00:00,732 --> 01:00:04,691
It's a Bvlgari. It's my present to him.

558
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,671
It must be really expensive.

559
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:54,212
'Are you some kid to run away?'

560
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,754
'Think you're cool?'

561
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:59,450
'Hungry, huh? I'm eating noodles'

562
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:01,720
'I envy you to
run away at that age'

563
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:04,160
'No, I wanna come, too'

564
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:06,993
'I like getting paid still,
so don't come back'

565
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,999
'Wanna come home, huh?'

566
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,194
'Why won't you study abroad?'

567
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,863
'Can I go for you instead?'

568
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:22,636
- Kim Ji-hoon speak...
- You finally answered!

569
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:26,843
Think this phone is for you?

570
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:29,080
Why'd you fill it
with messages?

571
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:32,283
Let's meet. Where are you?

572
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:33,857
Why?

573
01:01:33,926 --> 01:01:38,555
You hate going abroad that much?
Others would die to go.

574
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:43,464
Forget it.
I'll go crazy talking to you.

575
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:47,370
Hey,
let's meet at your place today.

576
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:49,669
Just worry about your own life.

577
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:52,973
Come back,
so I can give you a present.

578
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:55,274
I'm hanging up.

579
01:01:55,348 --> 01:01:57,316
Anyway, why do you
need to go to school?

580
01:01:57,984 --> 01:02:01,316
Since you're rich,
you won't have to worry later.

581
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:06,586
My old man wants me
to graduate high school. Satisfied?

582
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:11,357
You like your dad, don't you?

583
01:02:15,535 --> 01:02:18,765
I knew you had a nice side in you.

584
01:02:24,176 --> 01:02:26,577
What the hell?
Why did you come here?

585
01:02:26,678 --> 01:02:28,111
Think this is your home?

586
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,341
You told me I had to
fill in the hours to get paid.

587
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:36,551
You greedy snob.
You make me sick.

588
01:02:37,122 --> 01:02:40,718
Then what about you? You came
for your present already?

589
01:02:41,426 --> 01:02:47,160
Present, my ass. What is it?
Give it to me.

590
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:51,667
Here it is. I'm your gift.

591
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:56,667
Have you gone nuts?
I don't want it.

592
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:58,732
Listen carefully.

593
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:04,408
I'm your guardian angel who'll
help you go, I mean, stay home.

594
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:09,109
What for? You want something
from me, huh?

595
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:13,553
Dummy.
You should be grateful.

596
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:17,756
Fine. Just don't call me
Country Chick anymore.

597
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:25,060
Do I look like a Country Chick?

598
01:03:25,136 --> 01:03:27,263
No, her sister.

599
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:33,801
Su-wan, Ji-hoon's
father is here. Ji-hoon!

600
01:03:39,118 --> 01:03:43,350
You can't go!

601
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:50,593
Go study abroad.

602
01:03:51,897 --> 01:03:52,955
No.

603
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,633
Want a beating?

604
01:03:57,937 --> 01:03:59,495
Kim Bong-man!

605
01:03:59,571 --> 01:04:00,868
What is it?

606
01:04:00,939 --> 01:04:05,843
Sir, just give Ji-hoon
to me instead.

607
01:04:05,912 --> 01:04:10,906
Wait a minute. Ji-hoon still hasn't
fulfilled his military service.

608
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:13,816
And he has no job,
but you want to marry him?

609
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:18,879
Pardon?
No, that's not what I meant.

610
01:04:18,957 --> 01:04:21,118
I meant as Ji-hoon's teacher.

611
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,591
Sit first.

612
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:27,098
Sit and let's listen to Su-wan,
I mean, his teacher.

613
01:04:27,165 --> 01:04:28,689
Please sit.

614
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:39,299
Yes, if he studies abroad,
it'll open up new doors.

615
01:04:39,377 --> 01:04:43,245
And maybe he'll change
into a new person.

616
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:49,015
But it could turn into a failure
if he doesn't want to go.

617
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:58,560
And Ji-hoon could become a
drug addict and join the mafia.

618
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:01,560
So what are you saying?

619
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:06,127
So if you could just trust him...

620
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:10,232
You're telling me to trust him?

621
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:13,002
Although I know
it'll be hard to do...

622
01:05:16,448 --> 01:05:19,008
To be more exact,

623
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:21,053
since this is about
Ji-hoon's life,

624
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:26,080
I think it'll be good to
respect his decision, sir.

625
01:05:26,158 --> 01:05:28,022
If he makes the wrong decision,

626
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:32,213
then we have no choice
but to decide for him.

627
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:47,925
I'll raise my average above 50
on the next mid-term.

628
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:50,537
What did you say?

629
01:05:50,606 --> 01:05:51,972
Ji-hoon!

630
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:54,869
I'll get above a 50, okay?

631
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,878
Wait a minute, sir!

632
01:05:57,947 --> 01:06:00,472
From an expert's perspective,
this is an abnormal act of...

633
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:01,878
Shut the fuck up!

634
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,213
It's none of your business!

635
01:06:03,318 --> 01:06:05,947
Do you know me?
I know what I'm doing.

636
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:09,418
Have you really gone crazy?

637
01:06:09,492 --> 01:06:11,686
Speak Korean
so I can understand.

638
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,296
I'll get above a 50, okay?

639
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,131
If I don't, do as you like.

640
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:21,894
Fuck! Fuck!

641
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,939
Just tell him
you'll go abroad.

642
01:06:24,006 --> 01:06:26,168
Make some sense. Pack!

643
01:06:26,242 --> 01:06:27,367
And I'll reserve your ticket.

644
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:30,106
Do you think raising your grades
is as easy as fighting?

645
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,579
If you don't wanna help,
then leave!

646
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,048
Yeah, you won't need my help
since you speak English well!

647
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:35,550
Why do you need tutoring?

648
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:39,144
I can speak English,
but I can't read it!

649
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:42,657
It's different on tests!

650
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,555
This is insane.

651
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,095
Then why did you
make that promise?

652
01:06:47,162 --> 01:06:50,963
How do you expect to raise
your average from 8 to 50?

653
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:53,160
God can't even help you.

654
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:57,602
Feel bad? I'm sorry,
but I have to say it.

655
01:06:57,673 --> 01:07:00,164
It's better than
a promise you can't keep.

656
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:04,941
There's no use in having
an I-can-do-it attitude.

657
01:07:05,014 --> 01:07:08,450
Stop speaking nonsense,
and tell me what to study.

658
01:07:30,706 --> 01:07:34,073
Peasants' Uprising of 1895.

659
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:44,780
Are you feeling okay? Did you hurt
your head when you fought Jong-soo?

660
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:49,222
He's a cruel bastard
for hitting your head.

661
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:52,624
Do you know about
the Peasants' Uprising?

662
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:53,992
What?

663
01:07:54,063 --> 01:07:56,428
It was caused by a death
in the Ulmi Year.

664
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:59,331
Do you know what death it was?

665
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:00,664
What?

666
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:06,135
Queen Myungsung was killed
by the yakuzas.

667
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:10,836
Know who Queen Myungsung is?

668
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:15,518
Come on.

669
01:08:15,585 --> 01:08:20,487
Think I'm that dumb?
It's Actress Lee Mi-yeon.

670
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:26,821
You idiot.

671
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:36,861
It wasn't her in that TV series?

672
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:39,874
It was Kang Soo-yeon, idiot.

673
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:44,879
Fuck, why does he have
to study all of a sudden?

674
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:01,558
I should've just picked randomly.

675
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:07,259
That's what I'm saying.
Here's some solid advice.

676
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,436
Do as your father says.

677
01:09:10,505 --> 01:09:11,836
Wanna die?

678
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:16,671
Go become a mafia gangster,
and form a global gang.

679
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:19,942
Yeah, becoming a national hero
will be easier.

680
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:22,878
You call yourself a tutor?

681
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,749
Then you think
a tutor can do magic?

682
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,321
What will you do
if I get above a 50, huh?

683
01:09:28,758 --> 01:09:34,286
From here to there are the
questions I taught you before.

684
01:09:34,363 --> 01:09:36,763
So you could've
gotten a 60 score.

685
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:41,031
But the result? Only 18.

686
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:43,402
Anyway, so what'll you do
if I get above a 50?

687
01:09:44,072 --> 01:09:45,903
You get above a 50?

688
01:09:47,043 --> 01:09:51,946
Then I'll dance on stage
at our school festival.

689
01:09:56,986 --> 01:10:03,220
That would be fun.
You made a promise, okay?

690
01:10:14,469 --> 01:10:16,539
Sorry to call all of you here.

691
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:20,976
I have a problem,
so you'll have to help me.

692
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:23,137
I'll assign you a subject,

693
01:10:23,713 --> 01:10:25,509
So make 100 questions each.

694
01:10:25,615 --> 01:10:28,209
At least half of them
must be on the test.

695
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:15,259
It's mine.

696
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:22,570
Ji-hoon, you can smoke
two cartons during class.

697
01:11:25,207 --> 01:11:26,299
Ji-hoon, please.
Let's talk about it.

698
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:29,036
Let's be reasonable!

699
01:11:29,812 --> 01:11:33,907
You can't do this to me!
I helped you with the test!

700
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:40,052
The next entry is
a Junior majoring in English.

701
01:11:40,122 --> 01:11:43,092
Let's welcome Choi Su-wan!

702
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:13,147
Hi, I'm Choi Su-wan,
a Junior majoring in English.

703
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:15,223
I hope you enjoy it.

704
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:27,986
Bye.

705
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:34,653
Why are you looking
at me like that?

706
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:37,392
Weren't you embarrassed
for a girl?

707
01:14:37,465 --> 01:14:39,558
Why didn't you
just dance naked?

708
01:14:39,634 --> 01:14:41,465
It looked like a strip show.

709
01:14:43,138 --> 01:14:45,664
Who's the one
who told me to dance?

710
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:48,598
Have plans this sunday?

711
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:50,433
None of your business.

712
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:54,179
Just tell me. Although I know
you won't have any.

713
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:58,079
Our club is visiting
an orphanage. Why?

714
01:15:00,022 --> 01:15:01,545
Is that bastard going?

715
01:15:03,192 --> 01:15:06,719
Who? My honey, Si-kyung?

716
01:15:06,795 --> 01:15:09,321
Honey, my ass.

717
01:15:09,397 --> 01:15:11,831
Why else would I be going
if he wasn't?

718
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:15,159
Hey, is that a volunteer's attitude?

719
01:15:15,237 --> 01:15:18,070
Think what you like. Bye.

720
01:15:59,781 --> 01:16:01,079
How do you do?

721
01:16:33,948 --> 01:16:36,281
I've been thinking a lot.

722
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:43,482
It's been on my mind constantly.
So I've had many sleepless nights.

723
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:46,755
Just say you want
to screw her, asshole

724
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:49,496
Si-kyung.

725
01:16:50,299 --> 01:16:53,995
Su-wan, it's not a choice,
it's fate.

726
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,000
I'm fine with throwing
my everything away.

727
01:16:57,072 --> 01:17:00,531
My family, friends, and future.

728
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:03,406
My mind and body
isn't mine anyway, Su-wan.

729
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:25,628
Si-kyung.
Si-kyung, are you okay?

730
01:17:34,576 --> 01:17:37,568
Hey, Kim Ji-hoon!
What are you doing there?

731
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:15,276
What'll you do now?
They're not your friends anymore.

732
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:17,844
Look at my arm.

733
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:22,441
I can't bathe and wipe my ass.
And look how dirty my hair is, asshole.

734
01:19:24,186 --> 01:19:25,982
Know how precious
the right arm is?

735
01:19:26,054 --> 01:19:29,421
Shit, only if your big head
hadn't dodged him.

736
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:35,120
Fine, I saw you in action
at the pool hall,

737
01:19:36,999 --> 01:19:39,228
so I'll make you Number 2,
okay?

738
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,728
Number 2?

739
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:53,173
Shit. Ji-hoon, you bastard.

740
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:23,375
What's taking you so long?

741
01:20:25,246 --> 01:20:27,237
Are you drunken?

742
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:32,646
You're pathetic for a tutor.
You don't wanna get paid, huh?

743
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:35,580
What?

744
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:56,166
Hi.

745
01:20:57,446 --> 01:20:59,345
How long have
you been drinking?

746
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:03,809
Sorry.

747
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:08,289
Let's have today's class here.

748
01:21:08,357 --> 01:21:15,058
Today's subject
is broken hearts.

749
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:16,687
Did you get dumped?

750
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:19,892
Nope.

751
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,469
Yeah.

752
01:21:28,076 --> 01:21:30,237
Nope

753
01:21:34,183 --> 01:21:35,581
Yeah.

754
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:39,416
Wanna die? Stop screwing around.

755
01:21:39,987 --> 01:21:43,787
Everyone, I've been dumped!

756
01:21:43,892 --> 01:21:50,320
I've been dumped!
Everyone, I've been dumped!

757
01:21:50,398 --> 01:21:53,562
Everybody,
I've been dumped!

758
01:21:54,635 --> 01:21:57,161
I've been dumped...

759
01:21:58,406 --> 01:22:01,603
What the hell
was so good about him?

760
01:22:01,677 --> 01:22:03,804
At first,

761
01:22:08,282 --> 01:22:11,844
I liked his soft smile.

762
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,987
And then...

763
01:22:19,795 --> 01:22:22,525
I liked his voice.

764
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:32,830
And since I liked liking him,
I liked him even more.

765
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:37,902
And then I loved him.

766
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:44,442
Since I loved him,
my heart became broken.

767
01:22:45,787 --> 01:22:52,990
But I could only let him go.

768
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:57,997
There's nothing I can do.

769
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:05,030
I'm stupid, heart-broken,
hopeless, and down.

770
01:23:05,107 --> 01:23:10,374
Hurry and get up!
You're too drunken.

771
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:14,473
Ji-hoon, what are
you two doing?

772
01:23:16,684 --> 01:23:19,482
Now you're trying
to seduce him with tears?

773
01:23:19,554 --> 01:23:22,388
Ji-hoon, don't trust her.

774
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:25,950
Since you're studying with her,
the guys are leaving you.

775
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:30,760
Hey, I'm really tired already,
so you better go, okay?

776
01:23:30,832 --> 01:23:31,662
Ji-hoon!

777
01:23:31,732 --> 01:23:37,295
It's you. The City Chick.

778
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:41,468
Nice to see you.
Wanna drink with me?

779
01:23:41,543 --> 01:23:43,204
Have you gone nuts?

780
01:23:43,277 --> 01:23:46,041
You're always mean.

781
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:48,604
Stop acting so drunk,
damn it..

782
01:23:50,952 --> 01:23:54,650
Why'd you hit my pretty face?

783
01:23:55,857 --> 01:24:01,420
Come here and
I'll give you a kiss. It's so soft.

784
01:24:03,031 --> 01:24:04,362
You crazy bitch!

785
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:08,727
Ji-hoon!

786
01:24:16,812 --> 01:24:17,835
Let go.

787
01:24:18,813 --> 01:24:20,406
You're really overdoing it today.

788
01:24:20,482 --> 01:24:22,415
What's gotten into you?

789
01:24:29,156 --> 01:24:30,987
This is the place.

790
01:24:31,058 --> 01:24:34,222
Why? Wanna throw up?

791
01:24:37,098 --> 01:24:39,067
On a rainy night...

792
01:24:42,437 --> 01:24:45,235
By a red telephone booth...

793
01:24:49,344 --> 01:24:51,642
Under the streetlight...

794
01:24:55,116 --> 01:24:58,678
I wanted my first kiss
at a place like this.

795
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:04,254
You're really overdoing it.

796
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:15,563
I even practiced a pose.

797
01:25:19,707 --> 01:25:23,075
Like this.

798
01:26:13,695 --> 01:26:25,334
Why? Why does God
have to be my rival?

799
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:29,941
Hey!

800
01:26:46,628 --> 01:26:48,595
Who are you to make her cry?

801
01:26:48,664 --> 01:26:53,259
Su-wan may be a Country Chick...
Man, I'm pissed.

802
01:26:53,335 --> 01:26:57,862
She's not worth
getting hurt from you!

803
01:26:57,938 --> 01:27:00,964
I think there's
been some mistake.

804
01:27:01,043 --> 01:27:06,446
Mistake, my ass.
I don't know who she is,

805
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:10,416
but if I see that
she's worse than Su-wan,

806
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:16,048
you and her are dead.
Got it? So who is she?

807
01:27:19,094 --> 01:27:25,692
Fine, the sweetheart
who's in your heart now.

808
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:30,329
This is making me sick.
Who is she? I said who?

809
01:27:30,539 --> 01:27:33,030
You're making a mistake.

810
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:35,335
It's not a woman.

811
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:38,311
I'll be a father soon.

812
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:41,178
- What?
- A father.

813
01:27:43,018 --> 01:27:44,986
You rotten son of a bitch.

814
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:47,250
You already have a kid?

815
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,353
Rotten bastard.

816
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:58,525
Thanks for the milk, asshole.

817
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:34,695
You bastard.

818
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:39,589
Why'd you hit him? Why?

819
01:29:43,004 --> 01:29:45,905
Do you have to keep this up?

820
01:29:47,642 --> 01:29:49,768
Okay, hit me. Hit me.

821
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,250
Are you really a girl?

822
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:12,164
Why does your punch sting?

823
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:18,401
Feel better now?
Was he your first love?

824
01:30:21,509 --> 01:30:23,204
Has this happened to you?

825
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:25,541
Think I'm the type
to get dumped like you?

826
01:30:27,915 --> 01:30:33,411
Have you ever
truly loved someone?

827
01:30:37,092 --> 01:30:43,326
Probably not
with a temper like that.

828
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:55,607
Wanna fly into the sky?

829
01:31:00,147 --> 01:31:01,671
I'm serious.

830
01:31:23,237 --> 01:31:24,465
Like it?

831
01:31:25,307 --> 01:31:30,175
I like it! Very much!

832
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:33,111
Tomorrow is our last lesson.

833
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,910
That's right.

834
01:31:43,758 --> 01:31:45,224
Hey, Su-wan.

835
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:46,452
What?

836
01:31:46,527 --> 01:31:51,795
I've been thinking.
You're a pretty cool chick.

837
01:31:52,467 --> 01:31:54,229
Now you know?

838
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:58,237
This is the first time
I've told somebody this,

839
01:31:58,372 --> 01:32:01,603
but I think I like you.

840
01:32:05,446 --> 01:32:06,970
Hello?

841
01:32:07,081 --> 01:32:10,142
Su-wan. Su-wan.

842
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,021
Can't you hear me?

843
01:32:15,857 --> 01:32:19,656
Su-wan, can you hear me?

844
01:32:23,197 --> 01:32:28,397
What? What? I can't hear you.

845
01:32:30,537 --> 01:32:33,598
Su-wan, pull the left string!

846
01:32:36,244 --> 01:32:38,438
Don't panic.

847
01:33:07,642 --> 01:33:09,803
Su-wan, are you okay?

848
01:33:10,911 --> 01:33:11,809
It hurts.

849
01:33:17,251 --> 01:33:20,880
You have to study English consistently.
There's no other way.

850
01:33:21,589 --> 01:33:26,253
Study the idioms and synonyms
I wrote down before your test.

851
01:33:29,731 --> 01:33:31,755
You've done a good job.

852
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:34,595
Well, I...!

853
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:41,406
I hope I was a
good teacher to you.

854
01:33:41,476 --> 01:33:46,106
There's no need to emphasize
that you were a teacher.

855
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,647
I understand.

856
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:11,437
Wait a sec.

857
01:34:58,786 --> 01:35:00,754
Oh boy, my legs hurt.

858
01:35:30,919 --> 01:35:32,010
Su-wan!

859
01:35:32,085 --> 01:35:35,021
Oh my gosh, it's my friend.

860
01:35:38,259 --> 01:35:39,487
What are you doing here?

861
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:42,620
You bad girl, how'd you
catch me on a date?

862
01:35:44,499 --> 01:35:47,367
This is my friend, Su-wan.

863
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:48,892
- Hello.
- Hello.

864
01:35:49,571 --> 01:35:52,165
The guy I mentioned.
The med student.

865
01:35:54,107 --> 01:35:55,233
Hello.

866
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:58,302
Yes, hello.

867
01:35:58,845 --> 01:36:01,406
Who have you been
hiding from me?

868
01:36:02,517 --> 01:36:05,111
No, he's the one
I've been tutoring.

869
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,655
The bad student?

870
01:36:09,323 --> 01:36:12,121
So you two are dating now?

871
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,094
Think I'm crazy to
date a high school...

872
01:36:20,401 --> 01:36:22,197
It looks fishy to me.

873
01:36:22,836 --> 01:36:26,237
This doesn't seem like
a place to study.

874
01:36:26,808 --> 01:36:31,073
It's our farewell party.
Wanna join us?

875
01:36:31,144 --> 01:36:36,674
No way.
We're getting very intimate.

876
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:39,218
Have fun with your teacher.

877
01:36:41,622 --> 01:36:43,022
I'll call you later.

878
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:50,220
Why? Envious?

879
01:36:50,865 --> 01:36:54,265
Of course. He's handsome,
and has a good major.

880
01:36:54,335 --> 01:36:58,795
Snobs. And being rich
would also be nice, Right?

881
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,464
All you care about is status.

882
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:03,372
That was mean.

883
01:37:04,012 --> 01:37:05,536
Is that your standard
for guys, too?

884
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:08,206
Guys like that wouldn't be bad.

885
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:13,553
But it's crazy to date
someone in high school?

886
01:37:14,821 --> 01:37:16,982
That's now what I meant.

887
01:37:17,058 --> 01:37:21,495
I thought you were different.
But you're all the same.

888
01:37:22,263 --> 01:37:24,128
You all think superficially.

889
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:30,201
What makes you so different from
Ho-gyung who's materialistic?

890
01:37:38,012 --> 01:37:38,910
What is it?

891
01:37:39,546 --> 01:37:40,478
This is yours.

892
01:37:40,548 --> 01:37:41,946
Why should I accept this?

893
01:37:44,818 --> 01:37:49,653
Then don't. I bought it for you,
so it's not even mine.

894
01:38:26,427 --> 01:38:27,916
What is it?

895
01:38:35,503 --> 01:38:39,336
Does Kim Ji-hoon's tutor
live here by any chance?

896
01:38:39,406 --> 01:38:43,308
Su-wan? She went on a delivery.

897
01:38:54,522 --> 01:38:56,183
Stop! Wait!

898
01:38:58,558 --> 01:38:59,651
What do you want?

899
01:39:01,129 --> 01:39:04,689
Are you Kim Ji-hoon's tutor
by any chance?

900
01:39:04,765 --> 01:39:06,232
Not anymore.

901
01:39:06,299 --> 01:39:08,165
Grab her!

902
01:39:09,469 --> 01:39:10,459
Come with us for a moment.

903
01:39:10,537 --> 01:39:11,629
What are you doing?

904
01:39:15,643 --> 01:39:16,631
Hello?

905
01:39:19,714 --> 01:39:21,545
Say something! Speak!

906
01:39:22,817 --> 01:39:23,977
It hung up.

907
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:26,041
Damn it!

908
01:39:29,723 --> 01:39:31,281
What bastard is prank calling?

909
01:39:31,358 --> 01:39:33,088
Hold on for a sec, idiot!

910
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:38,254
What?

911
01:39:39,733 --> 01:39:40,701
Choi Su-wan?

912
01:39:40,768 --> 01:39:42,598
I have to make a delivery,
so stop this.

913
01:39:44,805 --> 01:39:47,433
Hello? Hello?

914
01:39:49,143 --> 01:39:53,978
Who? Lee Jong-soo? Hey!

915
01:39:55,049 --> 01:39:56,914
My ear's gonna fall off,
you bastard!

916
01:39:56,983 --> 01:39:59,884
Of course you have to come.
Here?

917
01:40:01,856 --> 01:40:04,347
Catch her, you bastards!

918
01:40:12,299 --> 01:40:13,494
Hello?

919
01:40:13,567 --> 01:40:16,594
You're with Jong-soo, huh?
Where are you?

920
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:19,902
Damn it,
I'm running right now!

921
01:40:31,219 --> 01:40:33,619
So you ordered the chicken?

922
01:40:33,687 --> 01:40:35,518
I doubted it at first.

923
01:40:35,589 --> 01:40:40,459
But I'd never think he'd like
a Country Chick like you.

924
01:40:41,429 --> 01:40:45,058
Your job was to tutor him,
not seduce him.

925
01:40:52,205 --> 01:40:56,403
Here's the chicken,
so pay me 216,000 won.

926
01:41:02,817 --> 01:41:08,915
I wanna throw you like
that chicken and crush you.

927
01:41:15,295 --> 01:41:17,594
Why'd you throw it?
Who are you to do that?

928
01:41:17,665 --> 01:41:21,156
My dad raised them himself,
and my mom cooked it.

929
01:41:21,235 --> 01:41:23,669
And you throw it away?

930
01:41:33,747 --> 01:41:36,045
Stop it! Stop it!
I said stop it!

931
01:41:36,284 --> 01:41:37,545
What do you want?

932
01:41:37,617 --> 01:41:40,518
She's mine,
so you stay out of it!

933
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,179
No she's not, she's mine.

934
01:41:43,223 --> 01:41:44,622
You bastards.

935
01:41:47,061 --> 01:41:51,361
It's not your day to tutor,
so be quiet.

936
01:41:51,432 --> 01:41:56,267
You're a hostage today.
Ji-hoon's bait.

937
01:41:56,903 --> 01:41:59,394
Pay for the chicken.

938
01:42:00,942 --> 01:42:03,308
Pay for the chicken!

939
01:42:07,848 --> 01:42:08,749
Hello?

940
01:42:08,749 --> 01:42:12,582
We're waiting too long
because of you, asshole.

941
01:42:12,652 --> 01:42:14,848
Are you testing my patience?

942
01:42:16,256 --> 01:42:20,215
- Shut up your mouth!
- Let me go, you bastard!

943
01:42:34,442 --> 01:42:35,670
Are you okay?

944
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:39,276
Do I look okay to you?

945
01:42:40,915 --> 01:42:42,280
Let's go.

946
01:42:46,152 --> 01:42:47,177
Ji-hoon!

947
01:42:50,357 --> 01:42:53,088
He's here. I said he's right here.

948
01:42:56,964 --> 01:42:58,795
You can't leave now.

949
01:43:00,267 --> 01:43:03,964
Jong-soo, you've gone insane.

950
01:43:04,037 --> 01:43:06,165
Ji-hoon, I can't
take it anymore.

951
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:09,004
I wanna make sure today.
Is it that bitch or me?

952
01:43:09,076 --> 01:43:10,269
Move, bitch.

953
01:43:10,378 --> 01:43:13,813
If you listen to me,
I'll let her go, but if not...

954
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,304
No, you move!

955
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:16,450
Ji-hoon!

956
01:43:17,117 --> 01:43:18,847
That's the bastard!

957
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:25,119
Who the hell are you?

958
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:27,353
They're the bosses
of the Makjubshi Gang.

959
01:43:27,728 --> 01:43:30,059
This is fucking humiliating,

960
01:43:30,164 --> 01:43:33,223
but I had to call them
because of you, asshole.

961
01:43:33,567 --> 01:43:36,000
Damn it, who the hell
are you guys?

962
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:37,696
What do you want?

963
01:43:37,772 --> 01:43:41,173
With that Country Chick,
no, with Ji-hoon...

964
01:43:42,043 --> 01:43:45,671
No, I came to talk
to both of them.

965
01:43:45,745 --> 01:43:48,009
Hey, what I want is that...

966
01:43:48,081 --> 01:43:52,576
It's my turn. I brought her here,
so butt out.

967
01:43:52,652 --> 01:43:56,247
Damn it, I'm the one
who went to the store.

968
01:43:56,322 --> 01:44:00,692
You idiot, all you had to do
was have her deliver to you.

969
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,388
Stupid idiots.

970
01:44:03,664 --> 01:44:05,187
Hey! Hey!

971
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:30,515
Are you okay?

972
01:44:32,259 --> 01:44:33,885
What if I'm not?

973
01:44:34,829 --> 01:44:36,955
I see you're still feisty.

974
01:44:40,201 --> 01:44:46,936
Hey, I told you to stop smoking.
Out of breath already?

975
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:09,090
Very nice. Who gave it to you?

976
01:45:09,162 --> 01:45:10,720
Stop it.

977
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:14,590
I thought you'd call me.

978
01:45:17,071 --> 01:45:21,006
What's wrong with all your friends?
Get some new ones.

979
01:45:23,576 --> 01:45:26,170
I sure do know
how to pick them right.

980
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,776
The necklace.

981
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,552
Looks good on you.

982
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:51,997
Wait for me!

983
01:45:55,209 --> 01:45:57,005
Wait for me, asshole!

984
01:46:15,228 --> 01:46:18,755
Like I told you before,
what I want is that...

985
01:46:18,832 --> 01:46:20,629
Go home, you bastard.

986
01:46:21,802 --> 01:46:23,133
But I have something to say!

987
01:46:24,237 --> 01:46:30,233
Hurry and tell me who it is.
Is it me or this bitch? This bitch?

988
01:46:30,844 --> 01:46:32,039
Yeah.

989
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,120
But I like you!

990
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:46,090
She's not the only one
who likes you!

991
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,184
I like you, too!

992
01:46:49,095 --> 01:46:52,429
I can be a better
girlfriend than her!

993
01:46:53,334 --> 01:46:54,995
Hey, stop crying, damn it.

994
01:46:55,768 --> 01:46:57,464
Why do you bother people?

995
01:46:59,906 --> 01:47:01,875
It's my hobby, why?

996
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,376
Go ahead first.

997
01:47:52,293 --> 01:47:55,057
First, we'll take care of them,
then it's our turn.

998
01:47:55,129 --> 01:47:56,755
Do as you like.

999
01:47:58,232 --> 01:48:00,393
Stop crying like a baby.

1000
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:35,460
I heard a lot about you,
so show me what you got.

1001
01:48:35,902 --> 01:48:40,339
Shit, I've been showing it,
so where were you? I'm exhausted.

1002
01:50:14,867 --> 01:50:16,357
Can I ask you something?

1003
01:50:16,437 --> 01:50:18,870
Asking questions
is a good habit.

1004
01:50:19,673 --> 01:50:20,969
Is this your skin?

1005
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,031
Hey! Move those hands!

1006
01:50:28,115 --> 01:50:35,384
Ji-hoon, where are you going?
Please transfer to another school!

1007
01:50:42,629 --> 01:50:44,597
Stop staring, damn it.

1008
01:50:44,665 --> 01:50:46,929
Screw you.

1009
01:50:49,469 --> 01:50:51,870
Do what she says.
