00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,235
It's been exactly 100 days
since I met Hyo-jin

8
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,812
What is she doing now?

9
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,947
At this very moment
I miss her so much

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,826
Spy Girl

11
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:48,504
I met her when I was studying
for college at an institute

12
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,193
Answer the phone

13
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,923
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer the phone

14
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,189
Answer the...

15
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,657
What perfect timing!

16
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,168
Are you coming tonight?

17
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,907
- I told you I was
- You know what?

18
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,774
Those without partners
aren't welcomed

19
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,707
That's bullshit!

20
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,385
There's no way

21
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,856
I'm taking
one of these girls

22
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,532
- Go-bong
- Hey

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,828
- Let's go shoot some pool
- Come on

24
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,596
- I'm not in the mood
- Why not?

25
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,070
What's wrong?

26
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,907
Guys from high school expect me
to bring a partner tonight

27
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,412
Damn!

28
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,074
Your friends are bad!
<Directed by PARK Han-jun>

29
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,517
- What are they thinking?
- You tell me

30
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,878
'Those who don't know them are
N. Korean spies'

31
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,458
What's this?

32
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,257
He opened up this website

33
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,367
Check them out!

34
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,870
Pick one, Go-bong

35
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,596
We'll hook you up

36
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,999
This one!

37
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,574
NAM Jin-ah it is!

38
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,167
She's not available
Hyo-gook's working on her

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,873
- I'll pick another one
- It's okay

40
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,040
What are friends for?

41
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,345
Let's go ask her

42
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,545
NAM Jin-ah... Let's go

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,159
We call the prettiest one Angel

44
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,164
- So Jin-ah is?
- You bet!

45
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,768
The prettiest Angel!

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,165
Here she comes!

47
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,573
Oh God!

48
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,076
Don't you feel like kissing her?

49
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,046
- She's the bomb
- I told you

50
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,353
Thanks

51
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,627
Say hi to Go-bong

52
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,599
His parents are loaded

53
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,570
What are you doing tonight?

54
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,646
Tonight?

55
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,809
I'm pretty sure I'm booked

56
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,426
No, I'm not

57
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,985
That's great
Do him a favor then

58
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,189
What favor?

59
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,369
There's this gathering

60
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,268
And my friends expect me
to bring a girlfriend

61
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,875
So you wanna take me?

62
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,169
For nothing?

63
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:17,013
There's this eye shadow
I've been eyeing

64
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,019
Okay, I'll buy it for you

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,764
Answer the phone

66
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,234
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer...

67
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,430
Be patient, man

68
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,306
She's hot with huge jugs

69
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,741
We'll be right there
Bye

70
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,343
There's a message

71
00:05:54,487 --> 00:06:08,128
I'm bleeding like a pig
Sorry I can't make it

72
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,416
Where is she?

73
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,314
The hottie with huge jugs!

74
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,514
Let me ask you

75
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,624
I heard he was a good student
How come he failed the SAT?

76
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,718
Looking like a woodpecker
she had to rub it in

77
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,728
Two years ago...

78
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,629
He couldn't hold his shit

79
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,728
Last year...

80
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,931
He got high on calmative
and fell asleep on the test

81
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,743
Isn't that whack or what?

82
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,640
Stop teasing him

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,941
Let's make a toast to him

84
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,414
Come on

85
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,609
Cheers!

86
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:08,120
Bastards!
I asked them to take me home

87
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,229
And this isn't my home!

88
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,125
This is great

89
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,324
- Do it right
- Keep them up!

90
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,247
What a stench!

91
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,210
What are you, making pizza?

92
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,950
- Who are you?
- Who the fuck are you? Bastard!

93
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:38,921
He has completely lost it

94
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,720
Who says you can puke here?

95
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,193
- I'm a drunkard walking by
- Fuck

96
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,130
What are you, a comedian?

97
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,428
We're having dinner

98
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,143
Who the fuck are you?

99
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,021
Wearing a raincoat

100
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,224
she appeared out of nowhere
and rescued me

101
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,735
Due to my many bruises

102
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,397
I skipped my classes for days

103
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,376
I can't believe Jin-ah
completely lost it!

104
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,936
A new Angel has come along!

105
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,943
Jin-ah is history!

106
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,514
Hey, how are you?

107
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,313
We have a new Angel
with a bright smile

108
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,612
What's going on?

109
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,889
Go-bong, you don't know?

110
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,554
Those who don't know her are
N. Korean spies

111
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,591
Are you?

112
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,335
What spy?

113
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,029
What the heck is he saying?

114
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,137
Time, distance, and velocity

115
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,145
This formula is also used
in physics

116
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,805
The only difference is...

117
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,112
The speed and distance in Physics...

118
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,835
She's a fox, man

119
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,841
Your heart might stop beating
when you see her

120
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,344
If she's like Jin-ah
I'm not interested

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,845
Let's make a bet

122
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,815
If your jaw drops as you see her
you're buying me beer

123
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,919
Guys!

124
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,613
Am I selling poisonous burgers?

125
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,222
Make your orders!

126
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,726
The Angel is up!

127
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,337
I won!
Your jaw dropped!

128
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,712
Can I take your order?

129
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,320
Line up please

130
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,627
Can I take your order?

131
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:09,133
How nice would it be
if I could buy her heart?

132
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,465
Sir?

133
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,839
Huh?

134
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,035
I'll take your order

135
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,541
Haven't we met before?

136
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,309
- Pardon?
- He's working her!

137
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,713
- Kill him!
- Kill!

138
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,833
Oh God!

139
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,531
Are you okay?

140
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,914
Her dark black eyes are
like black holes

141
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,914
Hey, greenhorn!

142
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,793
Look, Where do you think you are
on a talk show?

143
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,827
Arrogant bitch!

144
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,989
Go wash this

145
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,231
Hey!

146
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,539
Go-bong...

147
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,845
'She's gone'

148
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,914
'Oh, my sweetheart is gone'

149
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,710
Since the day I saw her...

150
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,116
I've been lovesick
which no medicine can cure

151
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,311
Those who don't know her are
N. Korean spies.

152
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,922
Therefore, I am a spy?

153
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,027
I'm James Bond...'
Come to your senses!

154
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,222
You should be studying,
not daydreaming!

155
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,324
By the way...

156
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,732
Why do you keep peeking outside?

157
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,745
Look over there

158
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:40,113
- Who's been to the corner Burger King?
- Me, I have

159
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,184
I was there today

160
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,791
during lunch break

161
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,588
and saw a really cute girl
working there

162
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,888
I saw here too, sir!

163
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,488
- She's the hot new Angel
- Right, she's the Angel

164
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,691
The other day

165
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,099
my hand touched hers
when she gave me my change

166
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,000
and there was this electricity...

167
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,108
I took a picture of her

168
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,504
Let me see

169
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,272
- Sit down, sit...
- She looks good in a picture, too

170
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,976
Boys, she's my ideal girl

171
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,585
Sir, aren't you going to teach?

172
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,482
The ugly ones are always
obssessed with studying

173
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,287
Our grades aren't good
because of your ugly faces

174
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,191
What did you say?

175
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,000
Go-bong
I am sorry about before

176
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,006
I bought a digital camera
on easy payments

177
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,014
So I could take her pictures
and put them on the net

178
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,131
Following the incident
they gave me a red card

179
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,105
A red card...

180
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,181
It was a military draft notice
for me

181
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,283
Mom!

182
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,484
Why'd you give me this now?

183
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,488
It's only 10 days away!

184
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,387
I need time to wrap things up

185
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,494
What do you have to wrap up?

186
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,894
Say goodbye to your friends
and put away some things

187
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,000
The army will help you grow up

188
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,694
I have a crush on this girl!

189
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,000
This is why you couldn't
make it to college!

190
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,301
Grow up in the military!

191
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,603
No way!

192
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,817
No way I'm enlisting now
I have things to do

193
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,016
Like what?

194
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,316
You know what!

195
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,722
I wanna go out with Hyo-jin

196
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,129
I can help you with that

197
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,527
- Can you?
- How on earth...

198
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,027
You pick up the tab instead

199
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,538
Nothing's free with him
He's like a snake

200
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,342
But if it's for Hyo-jin
money isn't the issue

201
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,813
I want smoked chicken

202
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,818
Then, a few days later...

203
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,720
Answer the phone

204
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,520
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer the phone

205
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,128
- Anser the...
- Hello?

206
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,925
Get your ass out now

207
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,125
I'm completely broke

208
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,432
Hyo-jin's waiting for you
at a cafe

209
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,735
- Really?
- Of course! Shake a leg

210
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,934
Bye

211
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,122
It really is her!

212
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,533
Then again, what made her
agree to see me?

213
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,226
Sir!

214
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,231
Wow, she's hot

215
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,342
- Come here, Go-bong
- Sir!

216
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,038
Looking at your chick's picture
on the job?

217
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,410
- What are you, an officer?
- Sorry, sir!

218
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,109
I will confiscate this for you

219
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:56,831
Why can't I meet a cute girl
like this?

220
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,645
Who's there?

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,328
Hi

222
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,027
Out of sheer coincidence

223
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,538
It's been a week
since I started working here

224
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:40,441
It's physically hard
but I enjoy serving people

225
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,512
Why am I working here?

226
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,713
I'm waiting for this man

227
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:56,358
But I have no idea
when he will show up

228
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,331
There you go
Enjoy it

229
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,630
As the manager told me

230
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,536
I try to smile at customers

231
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,040
Welcome to Burger King
But there's...

232
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,941
But there's this weird girl here

233
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,311
- She took my title?
- Right

234
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,611
I checked it on the website

235
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,913
and she's the Angel now

236
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,435
It bends!

237
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,439
They must've used good materials

238
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,643
Is that right?

239
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,338
Sing us the latest song

240
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,614
The latest song?

241
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,014
Go ahead before I kick your ass!

242
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,724
# Roll it well

243
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:08,129
# Press it well

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,428
Shut!

245
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:16,205
# Just like the rice stuck
# on the dried laver

246
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,138
What the fuck are you doing?

247
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,735
Rolling sushi in a hamburger store?

248
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,613
Don't

249
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,213
try to pick up boys here
because you're the Angel now

250
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,912
What are you talking about?
What Angel?

251
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,523
Get on my nerves again

252
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,626
You will be sorry you even
thought about working here

253
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,426
This can kill you

254
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,628
Got it?

255
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,938
Watch it, bitch!

256
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,343
So I decided

257
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,710
Once I meet the guy
I've been waiting for...

258
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,716
I'll give them a lesson

259
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,220
A few days later...

260
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,624
The unthinkable happened

261
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,623
There you go
Enjoy it

262
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,130
Look!
It's that spy girl!

263
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,235
- Really?
- Yeah, that's her!

264
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,027
Excuse me

265
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,234
Yes?

266
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,741
You're that spy girl, right?

267
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,739
What... A spy?

268
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,710
You're so pretty, Hyo-jin

269
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,323
I was trying to be
as normal as possible

270
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,428
But my identity has been exposed
on the Internet!

271
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,630
A spy...

272
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,871
I can't believe this

273
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,304
What am I gonna do?

274
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,040
Suddenly

275
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,910
all the memories flashed
before my eyes

276
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,911
Because...

277
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,816
I'm really a spy

278
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,723
36-1004 Pyong Yang

279
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:28,538
20 Miles north of DMZ
October 10, 2003, 01:47 a.m.

280
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,642
Comrade, all set?

281
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,811
Your mission in S. Korea?

282
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,910
Track down Comrade KIM who
embezzled the operational funds

283
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,320
And check on other agents

284
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,120
Hail the Republic!

285
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,226
Comrade LIM?

286
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,228
Comrade LIM?

287
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,037
Are you okay?

288
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,411
I'm fine

289
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,607
Good

290
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,509
Comrade LIM

291
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,313
Good luck!

292
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,505
My flippers!

293
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,488
I swam across the river
without flippers

294
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,594
It was so hard

295
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,255
You could never imagine

296
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,924
It was so hard that I almost
turned myself in

297
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,627
to live a peaceful life

298
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,606
You ruined my appetite!

299
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,116
Frisk him

300
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,016
- He's fucking broke!
- What, brok?

301
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,917
Sons of bitches!

302
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,218
Where did you pop out from?
What the fuck is going on!

303
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,526
Who the fuck are you?

304
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,529
Grab him, grab him
Hold on a second

305
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,734
Who is it?

306
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,041
'Red azalea blooms
on Peony Peak.'

307
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:33,716
'Red azalea blooms
on Peony Peak.'

308
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,416
So what?

309
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,721
Red azalea...'

310
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:42,526
Why do they keep sending
agents here?

311
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,631
Why didn't you eat
before you came?

312
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:53,135
Damn, there's nothing to eat

313
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,524
I made a fortune selling this

314
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,731
Can't you be nice?

315
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,937
Press a shape
if you want another one

316
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,108
What's that?

317
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,110
A poison stinger

318
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,720
That's cheating

319
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,126
Can I use my saliva then?

320
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,522
That's okay

321
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,231
How old are you?

322
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,530
I'm 21

323
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,640
Why the hell did you get
into this espionage thing?

324
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,645
Espionage thing?

325
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,542
Comrade PARK!

326
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,309
Watch your mouth

327
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,216
'Comrade PARK'?
Am I your freaking friend?

328
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,914
What should I address you by?

329
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,216
By my name

330
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,020
Can I?

331
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,520
Excuse me, sir

332
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,030
Mu-soon
no word from Comrade KIM?

333
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,225
Nothing.

334
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,131
I don't even know if he's alive

335
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,542
Oh, I forgot
I left my wallet at home

336
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,410
- You pay for this
- Me?

337
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,211
I don't have any shots

338
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,512
If you say so

339
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,215
Hello?

340
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,225
What are you doing?

341
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,728
You told me to shoot

342
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,129
Who told you to shoot a gun?

343
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,235
You said you don't have a shot
and told me to shoot

344
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,132
When did I tell you
to make a hole in the head

345
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,034
I meant to pay money, okay?

346
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,641
Are you from another planet
or something?

347
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,242
Put that thing away!

348
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,179
Let me tell you

349
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,388
This is pretty good

350
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,586
It's junk food

351
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,961
I sell them for a living now

352
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,634
- I don't want it
- It won't kill you

353
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,537
I ate nothing but junk food
when I was your age

354
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,137
By the way...

355
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,505
How much did KIM run with?

356
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,011
A good 50 thousand won

357
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,617
Bastard!

358
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:57,323
I'm meeting the family tomorrow

359
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,327
They might know something

360
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,227
You have another family?

361
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,231
Not that family!

362
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,531
I meant agents, fool

363
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,036
Oh, okay

364
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,939
What a picture!

365
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,341
Now you bring chicks home?

366
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,072
Who's this?

367
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,083
- A spy
- A spy?

368
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,949
Stop lying!

369
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,080
Why would a hottie like this
be a freaking spy?

370
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,726
Have you gone insane?

371
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,830
You think she's my lover then?

372
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,228
Tell her who you are

373
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,532
'Red azalea blooms
on Peony Peak.'

374
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,640
Fine!

375
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,733
Shut up

376
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,812
I miss the old days

377
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,506
Tell me about it

378
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,312
We were better-off back then

379
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:59,412
Now we don't have any
fringe benefits

380
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,025
All I got left over the years is...

381
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,120
arthritis that hurts like hell
when it rains

382
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,927
Mu-soon, aren't we climbing?

383
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,530
We will
Where's the fire?

384
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,833
The mountain will still be there

385
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,444
Everybody feels down

386
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,045
Why don't you sing for us?

387
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,909
I can tell you're a good singer
from your fat lips

388
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,915
- Yeah, go ahead
- Come on

389
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:44,024
# From Mt. Baekdu to Mr. Halla

390
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,832
# We are one country

391
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:54,934
# Divided in half

392
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,109
# How much we have wept

393
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:07,122
# Take care, my friend

394
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:12,025
# Goodbye, my friend

395
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:17,931
# Voices carrying tears

396
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,735
# We will meet again

397
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,204
You saw him?

398
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,406
Yeah.

399
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,616
He had a black suit on
carrying a briefcase

400
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,120
I didn't recognize him at first

401
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:43,523
But it was KIM, all right

402
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,427
I think he's gone sour

403
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:54,062
So I decided
to stake out a building

404
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,469
where he often visited

405
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,538
I had waited for hours

406
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,311
Right then...!

407
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,615
Welcome to Burger King!

408
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,328
We're very well organized

409
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,231
Don't try to find out
who my boss is

410
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,837
We just do our thing

411
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,533
Are you okay?

412
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,844
Please leave me alone

413
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,716
A communicator?

414
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,119
I need to make a report

415
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:50,421
I'm positive
KIM has sold himself out

416
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,028
I need a communicator now

417
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,132
Where'd I put it?

418
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,600
I haven't used it for so long

419
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,571
Spies don't use that anymore

420
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,335
Right, there's the E-mail
That would be easier

421
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,478
Spies don't use that

422
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,580
Let me see
where did I put it

423
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,146
Oh, I might have sold it

424
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,548
How could you do that?

425
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,246
Have you forgotten your duty
to reunify the nation?

426
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,881
You're green
and completely clueless

427
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,060
It's not something
you can achieve in a day

428
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,631
Take one step at a time

429
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,327
And reunification will come
eventually

430
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,835
Mu-soon!

431
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,439
We're to build the road
to reunification!

432
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,533
What are we, bulldozers?

433
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,637
Get inside and clean!

434
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,059
Answer the damn phone!

435
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,337
Hello?

436
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,200
Huh?

437
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,897
Who's this?

438
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,669
This is me

439
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,040
That was corny!

440
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,171
Put dad on the phone

441
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,476
Your daddy?
What's his name?

442
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,677
I'm out of damn coins!

443
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,848
It's PARK Mu-soon, bitch!

444
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,687
Oh, you must be Hyo-jin

445
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,024
What the...
How do you know my name?

446
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,961
Your dad told me about you

447
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,623
He's not home now

448
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,963
His only daughter is on the run
from loan sharks

449
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,872
And he's hired a maid?

450
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:45,036
That junk food business is
going well, I see

451
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,145
Tell him I called, okay?

452
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:52,546
If you don't
I'll kick your ass later!

453
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,420
Hyo-jin...

454
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,751
If she called

455
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,229
why didn't you persuade her
to come home?

456
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:12,129
She said what she had to say
and hung up on me

457
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,934
She's such a headache!

458
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,938
Forget KIM

459
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,015
Kill those loan sharks instead

460
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,919
Yeah, kill them all!

461
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,115
Tell her to quit
if she's going to work like that

462
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,334
Your usual?

463
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:56,142
Schoolgirl, why do you always order
the biggest and the cheapest?

464
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,647
I'm not a schoolgirl

465
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,581
Then, a jobless?

466
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,418
This could be your lucky day

467
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,925
Why don't you work here?

468
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,623
How about $2.51 an hour?

469
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,833
That's great

470
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:24,039
Catch KIM and make money
at the same time. Two birds!

471
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,939
What if it reveals my cover?

472
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,444
So naive!

473
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,812
Who would imagine
you're a N. Korean spy?

474
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,813
That's true.
I don't have ID, though

475
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,616
Didn't they make one for you?

476
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,420
They told me you would

477
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,019
What am I a public servant?

478
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,123
Whether North or South,
public officials are all same!

479
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:01,537
Your father is PARK Mu-soon
and mother is OH Mi-ja

480
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,508
The part timers working here
are called the Crew

481
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,118
I'm in charge of the crew
all the part timers

482
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,710
I'm also the Angel

483
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,718
What are you doing?

484
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,532
When they want it to go

485
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,225
charge them 10 more cents

486
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,235
If they bring back cups
reimburse them 10 cents

487
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,330
Got it?

488
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:35,744
Too many things at the same time.
It's kind of confusing

489
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,213
If you're too stupid, quit now

490
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,113
Keep waiting for the man

491
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,114
How'd you know that?

492
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,816
You can't fool me

493
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,519
I know you got a job here
so you can meet him

494
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,024
Does she know about me?

495
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,494
Who could it be?

496
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,436
You'd better find out
who did this, otherwise...

497
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,098
What?

498
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,338
We'll be called back home

499
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:12,610
and sent to the mines
There goes our life

500
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,912
Who runs this website?

501
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,317
What are you doing?

502
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,122
Maybe we could find out
who this person is

503
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,819
An answer maybe to my question

504
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,630
Thanks to your fans,
sales have skyrocketed

505
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,332
If you welcome customers
with a bright mile

506
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,035
you will also have fans
like Hyo-jin

507
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,645
Always keep that in mind.

508
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,010
Let's give her a big hand!

509
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,228
Anything to say?

510
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,529
Nothing

511
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,934
It's thanks to you all

512
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,041
Hey!

513
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
What do you take me for?

514
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:18,608
Sorry. I gotta go

515
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,228
'Bad money drives out the bad!'

516
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,228
I'm the Angel here

517
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,131
If you mess with me again

518
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,409
you'll lose all your hair

519
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,933
Got that?

520
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,717
We'll be watching you

521
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,216
I catch KIM, she's dead

522
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:03,019
Yeah, beat the crab out of her

523
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,823
Punch her in the chest
and make her tits lopsided

524
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,626
That slut deserves it!

525
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,334
RE: We run the website~

526
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,234
Chungsol Institute?

527
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,908
Bastards!

528
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:38,954
Did you?

529
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,032
You put the pictures on the net?

530
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,068
- What pictures?
- My pictures!

531
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,036
You put them on the net?

532
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,640
Should I tell her?

533
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,835
No way

534
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,612
Delete my pictures

535
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,309
Can't do that

536
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,717
Words didn't work with them

537
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,313
So I changed my strategy

538
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,519
Please!

539
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,329
On one condition

540
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,725
What's that?

541
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,930
Our friend has a crush on you

542
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:27,635
You be his comfort woman

543
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,439
A comfort woman?

544
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,912
Nonsense!
I'm a well trained...

545
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,014
I'll report you to the police

546
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,114
To the police?

547
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,025
My old man is a sheriff

548
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,320
Go ahead
Should I go with you?

549
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,227
A sheriff?

550
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,928
We can delete pictures
that we uploaded

551
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,037
But not the ones put up
by others

552
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,036
Unless we close the site

553
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:00,132
What do you say?
Will you take our offer?

554
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,810
No way!

555
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,609
That means...

556
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,512
Not in a million years!

557
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,710
- Let's go, my friend
- Alright

558
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:11,612
Wait!

559
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,596
Miss. PARK Hyo-jin?

560
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,764
Turn your head a little bit

561
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:30,874
Like this?

562
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,169
Give yourself a bigger smile

563
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,643
A reporter?
Do something about it

564
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,248
You're putting all of us at risk!

565
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,849
Those stupid bastards!

566
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,750
Why are they messing
with a damn spy?

567
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,458
It hurts!

568
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,255
I'll meet him

569
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,761
Shut down the site first

570
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,369
I will, after you meet him

571
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:03,764
Fine!

572
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,954
You put up my pictures?

573
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,350
Yes

574
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:30,961
Can you please tell them
to close down the site?

575
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,365
That's...

576
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,768
I can delete the pictures

577
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,568
But I can't tell them
to shut it down

578
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:42,872
You!

579
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,343
You're studying for college

580
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,442
Right

581
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,446
But...

582
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,550
Not any more

583
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,549
What do you do now?

584
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,359
In fact...

585
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,060
Nothing

586
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,464
I just had a crush on you

587
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,362
And I knew
it was a mean thing to do

588
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,167
But they told me it'd work

589
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:15,074
God, he looks goofy

590
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,543
What's your name?

591
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,941
Go-bong

592
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,446
Funny name, isn't it?

593
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,448
My father loves climbing

594
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,754
You know Mt. Everest is
8,848 meters high

595
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,661
In English, my name means
'the highest peak.'

596
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,665
He named me after that

597
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,070
My father, after he saw me grab
a pencil on my first birthday

598
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,072
He had high expectations
for me

599
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,076
He was so disappointed
when I failed the SAT

600
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,050
This is weird

601
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,948
I'm usually very shy
with girls

602
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,146
But now with you

603
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,656
Let me ask you

604
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,454
How do you know so much
about me?

605
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,462
Oh, Jin-ah told me

606
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,162
NAM Jin-ah...

607
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,670
I'll be back

608
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,440
This is punishment
for exposing my identity

609
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,641
I'm so scared, Hyo-jin

610
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,143
You'll be sorry

611
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,754
How dare you challenge me!

612
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,857
Let me warn you

613
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,256
You're no match for me

614
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:41,160
There should be only one Angel

615
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,856
And that has to be me

616
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,667
The loser leaves, okay?

617
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,574
It'll be good exercise

618
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:05,753
What should I do with you?

619
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,750
Fine!

620
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,451
I'll keep my end of the bargain.

621
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,656
I will leave
Don't stop me!

622
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,652
You're not going anywhere

623
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,955
There should be one Angel

624
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,659
Two can't coexist!

625
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,368
It's impossible!

626
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,074
You know what?

627
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,445
I might quit soon

628
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,250
- Really?
- Yeah

629
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,053
As long as I meet the guy
I've been looking for

630
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,949
Jin-ah

631
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,256
Let's be friends
while we work together

632
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,059
Okay

633
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,962
Let me use your phone

634
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,472
Answer the phone

635
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,738
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer the phone

636
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,040
Hello?

637
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,746
I thought you told me to wait

638
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,552
So I can see you tomorrow?

639
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,764
Have a nice trip back home

640
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,568
Let us think about it

641
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,177
Thanks
Give us a call

642
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,574
Bye

643
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,446
Why don't you defect?

644
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,947
In this country...

645
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:19,554
You can live on easy street
as an actress

646
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,453
Shut up!

647
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:26,551
Forget about KIM
You're going back

648
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,356
But I have to catch him

649
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,866
You might get busted
before that!

650
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,567
Hyo-jin!
You made the paper!

651
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,039
Those who don't know here
are N. Korean spies!

652
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,345
Those who don't know her are
N. Korean spies!

653
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,454
They read the paper too

654
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:56,348
A submarine is coming
to take you home

655
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,658
Hyo-jin!

656
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,062
How are you?

657
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,576
Hey, Hyo-jin

658
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,543
I saw the paper
You look absolutely gorgeous

659
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,841
I'll have it laminated

660
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:29,550
Hyo-jin, you'll be better
after the movie

661
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,253
I heard it was hilarious

662
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,167
It's a comedy

663
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,945
Hyo-jin!

664
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,040
Hyo-jin!

665
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,344
Hyo-jin!
