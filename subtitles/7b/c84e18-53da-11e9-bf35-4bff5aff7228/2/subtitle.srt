1
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,018
Hey

2
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,735
Are you upset?

3
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:55,172
Come on, stop it

4
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:57,403
You were okay yesterday

5
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,745
Stop pouting and say something

6
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,508
What do you say?
With a black suit on...

7
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,119
I might look like Bond

8
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,121
- I'm Bond, James Bond!
- Take them off

9
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:46,222
No more pouting, okay?

10
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,628
Okay

11
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,435
Hyo-jin

12
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,329
Have you seen 'Cinema Paradise'?

13
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:58,736
- No
- No?

14
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:00,633
It's playing

15
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:05,343
Trailer produced by AVProduction

16
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:08,511
My God, she's naked!

17
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,518
I said, 'Cinema Paradise'!

18
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:17,421
That is 'Cinema Paradise'!

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,124
New Nude Paradise

20
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:24,527
Oh god, this is so...

21
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,133
Answer the phone

22
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:33,333
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer the phone

23
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,445
- Hello?
- Hey, loser

24
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,047
- You busy this Saturday
- I have plans

25
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,911
Don't lie to me

26
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,917
Let's go do a survival game

27
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,214
No, count me out

28
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:49,324
Still upset at me teasing you
for not having a girlfriend?

29
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,426
I do!
She's right next to me

30
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,823
Stop lying

31
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:55,931
Let me talk to her then

32
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,327
Put her on

33
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:03,134
Hyo-jin, will you talk to him?

34
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:04,940
Who is it?

35
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:09,040
It's my friend
He wants to talk to you

36
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:12,341
Why should I?
No way

37
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,210
- Please do this for me
- No way

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,317
Put her on!

39
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,614
If you don't...

40
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,915
Okay, don't do that!

41
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,321
I can't believe this!
Give it here

42
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:26,821
- Hello?
- Alright, alright

43
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:29,727
Forget it! Who would fall
for a loser like you?

44
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:31,526
There are more fish in the sea

45
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,033
Unless some homely chick is
dying to get laid

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,637
Forget about it

47
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,229
If you change your mind
meet us at 9 on Saturday

48
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,935
Hey...

49
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,541
What the...!

50
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:50,511
You should help me clean
on your day off

51
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,314
Where are you going?

52
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:54,116
To practice shooting

53
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:57,021
Have you killed?

54
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,627
I smile at people...

55
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:02,528
they almost die, gasping

56
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:03,927
Look at her

57
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,933
Hasn't she become sassy so fast!

58
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,930
Bye

59
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,734
Have fun

60
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:17,041
We assassinated people

61
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:20,512
by putting poisonous mushrooms
in the soup

62
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:28,015
Or we let them eat swellfish soup

63
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:31,422
That's right
There's no antidote to it

64
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:36,628
Those were our days

65
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,931
Where the hell is she?

66
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:50,145
Is she coming or what?

67
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,806
Let's wait a little longer
She might be lost

68
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,814
You sure she lives in Seoul?

69
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,512
- Yeah, I am!
- Don't shelter her

70
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:02,915
We can't wait forever

71
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:06,119
- She's here!
- What?

72
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,230
Right there

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,133
Gorgeous, huh?

74
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,836
Huge!

75
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:21,436
I think she wears a C-cup

76
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,740
I'm pretty sure
she has it tailor-made

77
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,723
Say hi to my friends
from high school

78
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,325
Hi

79
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,621
- Hello?
- How are you?

80
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:42,230
Sorry I'm late

81
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,730
You should be

82
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,731
I'm not the one
Just because you live in Seoul

83
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:48,029
you don't have to know
where Galleria is

84
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,333
You called him the other night?

85
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:52,839
Right

86
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:58,644
Go-bong, let's go

87
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:00,806
My car is a convertible

88
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,713
I have a great stereo system

89
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,217
- Please, ride with me
- You call this a car?

90
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:08,118
We welcome you all

91
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:11,021
Conquer our headquarters

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,321
and you win the game

93
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,175
You already killed me!

94
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,180
I just made sure

95
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,460
Wait for me!

96
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,031
Hyo-jin, wait for me!

97
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,783
You're too slow!

98
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,277
What are you, a SWAT member?

99
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,051
No way, what are you...

100
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,454
Keep down!

101
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:24,960
Why don't we play in the stream?

102
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,433
We have to fight hard to survive

103
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:32,132
This isn't a real thing

104
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:38,140
No!

105
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,618
It stings like hell!

106
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,788
Hyo-jin, it stings a lot

107
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,265
Try not to get shot

108
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,828
Give me a hug before I die

109
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,543
They're all playing
in the stream

110
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,208
Who the hell is that?

111
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,015
Did you have fun?

112
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:52,017
Yep

113
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:55,317
It's a great way to relieve stress

114
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,824
You were like
'Zena the Princess Warrior'

115
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,122
We should do it again later

116
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,247
What's the occasion?

117
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,422
Mu-soon?

118
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:35,157
Why don't you try

119
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,196
our new product?

120
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:41,964
New burger with salad

121
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:43,695
it's only...

122
00:09:55,017 --> 00:10:02,389
# Happy birthday to you

123
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:07,291
# Happy birthday, dear Hyo-jin

124
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,695
# Happy birthday to you

125
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:16,996
Come on, blow them out

126
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:19,198
Okay

127
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:29,579
I didn't know
it was my birthday today

128
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:32,186
How could you forget
your birthday?

129
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:33,788
This is why Mu-soon...

130
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,583
Here comes the finale

131
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:42,294
It's an ice cream cake!

132
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,288
God, it's hot!

133
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:12,690
Couple Dance Contest!

134
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,693
A stereo for the 3rd place

135
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,695
A digital camera for the 2nd

136
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:19,392
A camcorder for the winner!

137
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:22,802
- Let's go
- What?

138
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:25,304
Let's win some prizes

139
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,081
It's getting wild, guys!

140
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:43,691
Let's go

141
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,689
Hit it for the next couple!

142
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,499
What are they doing?

143
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:03,712
God, you guys suck!

144
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,692
Hyo-jin!

145
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:20,779
She's through!

146
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:24,289
Those who don't know here
are N. Korean spies!

147
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:25,791
Is it impossible?

148
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:29,796
I just wanna push back
the enlistment date

149
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:33,595
That's out of the question
unless you have a disease

150
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:45,412
I have a bad case of constipation

151
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,071
Doesn't that count?

152
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:01,796
Try our new lipsticks

153
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:03,891
Hi

154
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,794
Let me recommend this

155
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:09,096
It's a hot item

156
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,707
Having a hangover?

157
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:20,872
Stop it

158
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,385
Hey, dance queen!

159
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,282
She was wild last night

160
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:27,888
Tell me about it

161
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,694
What are you doing?

162
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,798
Kimchi burger and cider please

163
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:52,509
Did you say cider, sir?

164
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,986
Wow, the rumors were true

165
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:04,189
For here, right?

166
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,460
Kimchi burger please

167
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:10,156
It's KIM, all right

168
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,425
Should I do him?

169
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,735
Bring him alive?

170
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,740
Okay, I'll bring him alive
no matter what!

171
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,202
Okay

172
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:14,995
Comrade KIM!

173
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,495
Me?

174
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,001
My last name is PARK

175
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:24,605
You got the wrong person

176
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,001
You're dead!

177
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:47,115
Not bad at all

178
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:50,191
I never made mistakes

179
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:25,084
Do you know what flower
blooms on Peony Peak?

180
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,497
I guess that's a Peony

181
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,904
I'm here to meet Hyo-jin

182
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,498
You made a trip for nothing
She's not home now

183
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:48,076
Honey, should I make
swellfish soup?

184
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,683
With lots of mushrooms in it

185
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,682
I don't mind dying

186
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,796
Sorry if I surprised you

187
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,296
Mother!

188
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,883
What unit are you with?

189
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:31,885
Shut up!

190
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:35,195
You wasted that money
in a pyramid business?

191
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,195
What's that?

192
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,796
It's a scheme
They sell jade mats

193
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,337
You pathetic loser!

194
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,840
You should be sent to
a logging site in Siberia

195
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:50,105
and work your ass off

196
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:52,942
until your balls freeze off!

197
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:56,181
You're no different

198
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,582
You're supposed to be studying

199
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,780
Not following a chick around!

200
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:10,295
Do you have any idea
who we are?

201
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:13,094
Hyo-jin's parents

202
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,396
And my future...

203
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,805
Have mercy on me!

204
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:21,408
Get off of me!

205
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:28,878
No!

206
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:31,281
You can't die now!

207
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:32,613
Get away!

208
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,279
These are expensive!

209
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:39,385
You need some Viagra?

210
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:44,323
I didn't do it for my own sake

211
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,627
I wanted to make big bucks

212
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,226
So I could look after
senior spies like you

213
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:55,036
How could you get into
that pyramid thing?

214
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,145
Do you have any idea
how frightening it is?

215
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,717
They're better organized
than we are

216
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,512
What's Viagra?

217
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,422
All yours

218
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,925
What are you looking at?

219
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,620
Get out of here

220
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,829
If I can't date Hyo-jin
I'd rather die!

221
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:21,333
God!

222
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:25,929
I don't care what you do
Just get him out of here

223
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,242
- Don't lose any
- Okay

224
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:40,414
Don't be such a wuss

225
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,921
What'd you come over for?

226
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:45,026
I... just...

227
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,321
I saw you going after that guy

228
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,327
I had to do something

229
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:52,829
You thought I would like you

230
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,525
if you come here
dressed like him?

231
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,638
I'm not interested in men

232
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,638
Who's that guy then?

233
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,538
Huh?

234
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:09,109
He's...

235
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,813
He's my cousin

236
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:17,118
He lost a fortune
in that pyramid thing

237
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:20,227
Oh, I see

238
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:27,734
Take it

239
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,431
A lipstick?

240
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:34,442
It'll look good on you

241
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:37,342
Why are you giving it to me?

242
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:44,013
You put it on, and we can...

243
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:48,713
It's the last bus
Get on

244
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,124
Hurry up, kid!

245
00:22:56,364 --> 00:22:58,025
Bye

246
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:10,340
I'm happy to find out
she's not spoken for

247
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,946
Why do I feel so empty then?

248
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:26,120
Due to personal matters

249
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,821
Hyo-jin's leaving us today

250
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:31,932
I'm sure you're all sorry
that she's leaving

251
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,533
Let's give her a big hand

252
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:39,638
Hyo-jin...

253
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:43,635
Damn

254
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:48,112
Now it feels real you're enlisting

255
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,807
I know

256
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:52,818
Does Hyo-jin know?

257
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:58,719
What are you, playing?
Do it right!

258
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,918
Okay

259
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:14,935
Hyo-jin!

260
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,542
You!

261
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:22,110
You've been impersonating me?

262
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,309
You're Hyo-jin?

263
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:28,513
That's right!
I'm the original Hyo-jin

264
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,819
You're a spy, aren't you?

265
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,930
I can collect $150K
if I turn you in

266
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:39,033
You don't think I can

267
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,226
because my dad is one?

268
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:42,631
Think again

269
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:46,338
I need money to pay back
loan sharks

270
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:47,634
Good thing I got you

271
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:48,742
You!

272
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:49,844
What?!

273
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,639
I'm serious!

274
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,713
They might sell me off
to an island!

275
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:57,306
- Shut up before I make you!
- Honey, honey

276
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,919
Apologize to your daddy!

277
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,920
What for?!
I'll pay off my debt with a bounty!

278
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,618
You too!

279
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,123
What'd I do to you?

280
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:10,424
Little bitch!

281
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:15,124
Hyo-jin, let's talk inside

282
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,329
I have nothing to talk
with a spy

283
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:20,236
Yeah, I'm a spy

284
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:23,837
Please let us go home

285
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:28,710
They're waiting for me
back home

286
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,215
My mom and dad

287
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:33,111
What's this, a soap opera?
Out of my way!

288
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,620
- Hyo-jin!
- Let go!

289
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,125
You think I'd go soft on you
because you're bleeding?

290
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:44,526
Wrong!

291
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:52,931
I can't believe this

292
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:55,634
- Hyo-jin!
- I can't believe this

293
00:25:56,578 --> 00:26:00,810
First time back in a month
and you beat her up?

294
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:04,407
Who do you think you are
making my girl bleed?

295
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:07,015
I'm bleeding too!

296
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,318
- So am I!
- So what?

297
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:13,120
Spies don't fuss
over damn bloody noses!

298
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,923
What? Do you think spies are robots?

299
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:18,532
- We feel pain too
- Leave it!

300
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,327
You ingrate bitch!

301
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:23,926
I took you in
and you broke my girl's nose!

302
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,832
You're bad

303
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,841
I gave you the stereo

304
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:31,843
It's a piece of junk!

305
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,811
Take it back!

306
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,434
Hyo-jin!

307
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,418
Hyo-jin, what's wrong?

308
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,736
Sorry

309
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,431
I shouldn't have done that
I got you in trouble

310
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:38,443
I...

311
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:42,313
I have something to tell you

312
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:50,824
In fact...

313
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,319
I'm from the North

314
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,729
I know

315
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,233
You do?

316
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,039
And you're okay with that?

317
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:08,435
I know you live
in the north part of the river

318
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:14,006
Look, Hyo-jin

319
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:17,015
I have a favor to ask of you

320
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:18,015
Answer the phone

321
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:21,918
Okay, I'll ring until
you answer the phone

322
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:26,220
Answer the...

323
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,123
It's Hyo-gook
Hold on

324
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:42,570
My daughter gives me
enough headaches, okay?

325
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,578
You should sleep at home

326
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:48,238
Don't stay out all night

327
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,816
The submarine will be here
the day after

328
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:54,114
You shouldn't miss it

329
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:55,313
Okay?

330
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:58,721
The table is set
but you can't eat?

331
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,522
Jump on her
when she's drunk

332
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:03,425
Hey, listen

333
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:05,930
Once you enlist
that's it between you two

334
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:09,036
You have to make her yours tonight

335
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,138
Okay, Good luck!

336
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,134
Forget it, man

337
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:15,037
Come on

338
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:17,041
- She's my type
- No way

339
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,511
Her belly button is so clean

340
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,719
Nothing happened last nigh?

341
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:16,624
Of course!
I'm still a virgin

342
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,931
Thanks for massaging my feet

343
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:52,830
I can't let it get wet!

344
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,831
Hyo-jin, I'm going away
the day after

345
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:34,441
Where?

346
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:37,942
Far from here...
I will be gone for 2 years

347
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,805
Going abroad to study
because you can't make it here?

348
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:43,109
Huh?

349
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:45,512
Yeah...

350
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,019
So...

351
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:51,420
I was wondering
if you could wait for me

352
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:06,030
Go-bong, I wish I could

353
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:11,436
But things won't allow me to

354
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,507
I'm sorry

355
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:23,012
I've been seeing you
to have my pictures deleted

356
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:27,225
I couldn't afford to let myself...

357
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:31,426
...be known to the world

358
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:36,136
It's okay

359
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,631
Sorry I brought it up

360
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,436
I understand

361
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:49,707
I can use some music

362
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,640
- Do what like you?
- This place is packed

363
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,143
- You shut up
- This is fucking embarrassing

364
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:14,730
Hyo-jin, you're sleeping
next to me

365
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:18,934
I'm recording this
in my dad's favorite tape

366
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:22,736
If he finds out
he will be furious

367
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:25,641
But I'll be in the army

368
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:27,906
What can he do?

369
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:30,414
Beat up his son with a gun?

370
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:35,716
You're so beautiful
even while sleeping

371
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:37,824
I feel like kissing you

372
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:40,517
But I won't

373
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:44,028
Because I'm a guardian dog
of a Sleeping Beauty

374
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:48,033
I wonder how you'd react

375
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:52,128
when you find me sleeping
beside you

376
00:35:57,578 --> 00:36:01,412
Your boyfriend is enlisting?

377
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,016
If it's alright with you

378
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,209
why don't you let it play?

379
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:41,021
Mu-soon!

380
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,315
Mu-soon!

381
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:45,222
Who are you people?

382
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,327
What are you doing here?

383
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,429
Who the fuck are you?

384
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:51,422
Me?

385
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:55,633
I'm... PARK Hyo-jin

386
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:56,827
What?

387
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:02,239
You told me it was her

388
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:07,006
That's right, boss
That is PARK Hyo-jin

389
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:09,907
Do your job right!

390
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,431
You're dead, bitch!

391
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:38,439
No!

392
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,024
Hey! Hey!

393
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,319
You're worse than leeches!

394
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,419
Okay, I surrender

395
00:37:57,564 --> 00:37:58,929
Bye!

396
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,234
You're going back tomorrow
Drink all you can

397
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,531
- Thanks
- Bottoms up

398
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:11,538
Don't look at me like that

399
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,011
I know I've been bad

400
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,513
Good to have everybody

401
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:21,320
Let's drink

402
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:24,515
Good luck to both of you

403
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:26,922
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

404
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:29,325
Not without me!

405
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:43,438
Angel: PARK Hyo-jin

406
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:05,429
Deleted

407
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,229
Would you like to close down the cafe?

408
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,911
The page doesn't exist

409
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,842
Mu-soon...

410
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,413
He's your first love, huh?

411
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,713
Why don't you try this?
Go ahead

412
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,916
You know what?

413
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:09,427
If you get too obsessed
with doing it right

414
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:12,726
you become greedy
and end up breaking it

415
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:17,030
Just like that

416
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:21,232
It's the same greed
that fails the first love

417
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:48,630
- Go-bong!
- Hey!

418
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:55,933
What are you doing here?

419
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,845
We'll take you to the base

420
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,705
No, it's okay

421
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:04,512
Where's Hyo-jin?

422
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,019
It's okay

423
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:09,816
I told her not to come

424
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,515
Let us come with you

425
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,017
It's okay

426
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:17,619
Who knows? I might run
into another angel on the train

427
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:19,823
Come on!

428
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,229
Bye

429
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,217
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

430
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:40,115
- It's Hyo-jin
- What?

431
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:38,642
What happened?

432
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:44,410
I was worried you might
break out of barrack

433
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:45,711
No way!

434
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,129
What if...

435
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:07,431
What if we'd met earlier?

436
00:43:30,464 --> 00:43:34,924
I have a message for parents

437
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:40,028
Please don't come too often
to see your sons

438
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:43,336
I also have a message
for girlfriends

439
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:47,709
Don't give them broken hearts
while you're separated

440
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,510
They're most depressed

441
00:43:50,651 --> 00:43:54,314
when they get broken hearts

442
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:57,514
Help them commit themselves
to the training...

443
00:43:57,658 --> 00:44:00,525
and send them a letter of friendship

444
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:05,325
We all thank
the families and friends

445
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:09,526
of our proud sons
enlisting in the army

446
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,128
with the deepest of appreciation

447
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:16,335
Salute to the commander!

448
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:18,034
Loyalty!

449
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:25,718
At ease!

450
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:43,534
Let's go, kid

451
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:13,027
You know what?

452
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:19,933
I wanted you to put this on
and kiss me

453
00:45:30,884 --> 00:45:31,851
Hyo-jin!

454
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:37,018
Hyo-jin!

455
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:39,717
Put that lipstick on
and come to see me!

456
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,021
I'm leaving you now!

457
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:44,027
But we'll meet again!

458
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,426
Hyo-jin!

459
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,031
Hyo-jin!

460
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,728
Man!

461
00:46:58,872 --> 00:47:00,737
He looks horrible

462
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:02,535
It must've been real hard

463
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:07,536
I knew from the beginning
that she wasn't human

464
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:09,335
I think she is...

465
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,738
An angel!

466
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:33,726
Comrade KIM bribed the commander
with Viagra

467
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:35,732
and escaped going to the mines

468
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,532
And the jade mat KIM gave me

469
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:41,538
turned out to be fake

470
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:45,941
I knew it!
Freaking pyramid stuff!

471
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,913
I got back from the field training
by the truce line

472
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,110
I hope for reunification

473
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,721
So I can see you again

474
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:58,915
Oh, I miss Hyo-jin too

475
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,721
How's she doing?

476
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:04,625
You're PARK Hyo-jin?

477
00:49:04,764 --> 00:49:06,629
I said so, bitch!

478
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:09,326
God!

479
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,233
You think that name scares me?

480
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:14,237
Watch it before you get
a bloody nose

481
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:15,238
What?

482
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,637
You freaking impersonator!
