1
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,882
After an accident
caused my blindness...

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,087
It was like the end of my life.

3
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,393
But Mom used to try
to make me feel better...

4
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,993
by saying 'Now you're
a sleeping beauty in a forest.’

5
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,665
The right man, your Prince

6
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,775
Will awaken you.

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,212
And it's true, he's here for me!

8
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,813
Dong-gun?

9
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,980
What is this painting of?

10
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,586
One of the greatest paintings ever!

11
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,289
It's 'The Seascape in Hawaii' by A.
de Saint-Exupery.

12
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,998
With the crystal clear sky and

13
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,730
Pretty clouds above the horizon...

14
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,140
And the lush green grass

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,109
And exotic tropical trees...

16
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,904
I have just one word for that,
'dream place'...

17
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,080
Dong-gun is my eyes.

18
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,787
Through his eyes,
I see the sky and the sea...

19
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,694
and undisturbed grassland...

20
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,191
With him being with me,
I can be anywhere.

21
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,196
- Hae-joo
- When I need him

22
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,740
He's there for me out of nowhere.

23
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,514
He's everything I got.

24
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,277
You know why?

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,757
He's
literally a guiding light in my world.

26
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,796
And he completes me.

27
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,798
There's no reason
to lament for being blind.

28
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,896
You know what
the beauty of being blind is?

29
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,705
In my world, the others are blind...

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,873
That's why I'm
far from being miserable.

31
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:27,303
771e Beast and the Beauty

32
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,488
Watch out, a horrible
space beast is in front of you!

33
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,494
Hae-joo, come on.

34
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,095
It's raining pretty bad, huh?

35
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,700
Hae-joo, wait!

36
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,410
Your shoelaces are untied!

37
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,193
Hello!

38
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,809
Okay, it's done!

39
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,482
Hae-joo, what's going on?

40
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,781
Don't tell me the beast
implanted a memory chip...

41
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,593
Dong-gun!

42
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,991
I got an eye donor.

43
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,697
You know what that means!

44
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,801
I'll be able to see
the world with my eyes!

45
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,432
Dong-gun!

46
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,398
You screwed it up, focus!

47
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,702
I'm awfully sorry.

48
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,506
- Do it right, man!
- Okay, let's do it again!

49
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,377
Help me, Space Beast!

50
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,584
Good job, let's have
a lunch break.

51
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,288
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your lunch.

52
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:47,605
You're the greatest
beast dubbing artist ever!

53
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,801
I can see the beast in you!
I'm one of your biggest fans.

54
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,505
What's wrong with you?

55
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,888
It's about my girl friend,
who'll recover her sight.

56
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,082
I don't believe you got one,
in the first place.

57
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,790
Go to Sungbook—dong, driver.

58
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,908
It won't start, huh?

59
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,490
What a fateful moment!
That's how it started?

60
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,898
Somehow it appears so.

61
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,284
- Go to Itaewon, please.
- Okay, lady.

62
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,282
Sungbook—dong, please.

63
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,982
No problem, Miss.

64
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,095
- You work until late, huh?
- Yes.

65
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:24,295
Where to, Miss?
Let me guess, to Itaewon, right?

66
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,700
If you keep getting paid so low...

67
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,398
Obviously you're not a cab driver.

68
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,805
Damn, that's embarrassing!

69
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,885
I'll return it, a sure thing.

70
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:21,892
No, it was my fault
and let me treat you, please.

71
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,207
You returned my mobile phone
and treated me dinner!

72
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,603
Thank you very much!

73
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,508
It was my pleasure...
I was happy to be with you.

74
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,112
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

75
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,978
Hey, wait a moment!

76
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,886
I can't remember
the last time when I was this happy.

77
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,684
What a beautiful neighborhood!

78
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,198
Your shoelaces are untied
so dangerous.

79
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,702
I should've owned up earlier,
I am sorry about that...

80
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,304
Here you go.

81
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,301
Wait.

82
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,186
Hae-joo, I'm so sorry about that.

83
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,490
I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

84
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,693
Just let me have a chance
to explain what I look like.

85
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,599
What can I say...?

86
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,910
Why of all men Jun-ha
was the one?

87
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,504
TAK Jun-ha.

88
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,379
Who is he?

89
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,484
I've got one word
for this guy, 'perfect'

90
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,186
Every single girl
was crazy about him.

91
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,591
Oh, shit!

92
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,410
I've never seen such a handsome,
hot and great guy.

93
00:11:54,847 --> 00:12:00,183
When Iwas lost, thinking about
what guy I should be for her...

94
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,787
Jun-ha is the guy for her.

95
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:09,893
He just deserves my angel
way more than I.

96
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,092
So she thinks you
look like Jun-ha?

97
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,100
What?

98
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,407
Hae-joo!

99
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,586
For her, I am the prince,
her eyes and everything...

100
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,288
under the one condition
that she's blind!

101
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,395
Never do I enjoy
her being blind, but...

102
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,795
How bittersweet!

103
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,104
I'm telling you,
she'll be disappointed to see...

104
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,400
this world that's not
always beautiful.

105
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,579
How should I take care of it?

106
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,378
What am I gonna do?

107
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:11,287
She'll even see
my gross and hideous face!

108
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,790
Oh, man, what should I do?

109
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,874
Hae-joo, open your eyes slowly.

110
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,906
Mom, it's you?

111
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,107
You're older than I thought!

112
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,682
And Dong-gun, he isn't here yet?

113
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,689
Who is Dong-gun?

114
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,189
The guy who gives her a ride
to work and back home every day.

115
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,703
How come I haven't
even seen him once?

116
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:36,501
No one did! Anyway he'll
be here, so we'll see him.

117
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,808
I'm sure he's a hot
and handsome stud.

118
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:45,178
So handsome that people
think he's had plastic surgery!

119
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,180
Dong-gun?

120
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,187
Dong-gun!

121
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,592
Dong-gun!

122
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,109
Who are you?

123
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,282
Hello, I am, Jung-suk,
a friend of Dong-gun.

124
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,589
He is on an urgent business trip,
so I am here for him.

125
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,197
You all look like
scared stiff, sorry.

126
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,600
Who did you say you are?

127
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,501
Congratulations!

128
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,680
Who are you?

129
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,198
Dong-gun, I can see everything!

130
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:15,103
Don't tell me you didn't know
whom Iwant to see now!

131
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,903
When will be here?

132
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,307
Too noisy, Hello?

133
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:30,981
Die, you stupid monster beast!

134
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,089
Wait!

135
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,678
Cut!

136
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,381
Cut!

137
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,084
I said cut, dumb ass!

138
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,792
- You're nuts?
- I am really sorry.

139
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,490
I can't take your shit any more.
Let's have a break.

140
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,498
- Let me give it one more try!
- No way!

141
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,694
- Let's have a break.
- Oh, please.

142
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,198
You must be better than that!

143
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,603
I'm really sorry.

144
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,377
Dong-gun, what's
the matter with you?

145
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,683
Something wrong with Hae-joo?

146
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:45,192
Jung-suk, just be honest,
do I look that terrible?

147
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,888
Do my looks scare you off?

148
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:51,196
- You look handsome to me.
- Are you sure?

149
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,204
Then how come everybody
reacted as if I was a monster?

150
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,101
What did Hae-joo say
when she saw you in person?

151
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,214
She didn't recognize it was me.

152
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,677
You didn't tell her?

153
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,877
I was so petrified that
I pretended not to be me.

154
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,578
Why not?

155
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,885
I made up a lie
about my looks, being stunning...

156
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,096
Is that why you didn't
tell her the truth?

157
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,391
Come on, this is good timing.

158
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,298
Being blind, she had no idea

159
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,700
what it means to be handsome!

160
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,000
She is so innocent
in that subject.

161
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,703
Just let her get used to your looks
and believe you're handsome...

162
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,373
You have no time
for crying out of self-pity, you ass!

163
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,383
Just call her.

164
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,887
- Does it work?
- Sure.

165
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,388
Move your ass
and make her your girl!

166
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:53,487
You lose this crucial moment,
you'll lose her forever!

167
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,500
In case any hot son of a bitch
makes his move on her...

168
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,402
this game is over
for you, period!

169
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,606
Okay, you can join
the others for lunch.

170
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,903
Call her.

171
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,780
His plan does work?

172
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,785
Probably it will.

173
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,695
Could be possible.

174
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:36,297
Dong-gun, how come didn't call me,
nor answer your phone?

175
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,899
It's torturing me,
not seeing you now!

176
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,605
So you're okay?
You can see everything?

177
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,273
Sure I can,
when the hell will you be here?

178
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,975
Tell me when!

179
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,383
Well... soon.

180
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,682
Did you like my present flowers?

181
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,190
Aren't they like you imagined?

182
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,693
Sorry Ijust sent Jung-suk for me.

183
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,093
But he does look nice and handsome, huh?

184
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,996
No kidding! He was horrible!

185
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,002
All my family were frightened to death!

186
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,402
Dong-gun, Hello?

187
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,183
Plastic surgery for all these?

188
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,986
Trust me, that's a death wish.

189
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,592
Let me see.

190
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,501
You look okay, why bother
to change your looks?

191
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,402
My advice, just get rid of the scar.

192
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,910
- Will it make me look better?
- Much better!

193
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,777
You'll be proud of how you look!

194
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,583
How long will it take
to get rid of the mark?

195
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,591
No ER case for this?

196
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,393
I see, then...

197
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,089
Including the surgery and recovery...

198
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,301
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks...?

199
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,273
Dong-gun, you didn't
get any of my calls?

200
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,378
Call me back as soon as you get
this message. It's Hae-joo!

201
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,599
You crossed the damn line!
I'll kill you!

202
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,806
Answer the phone before I lose it!

203
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,807
You know what you got to do, right?

204
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,882
Here, honey!

205
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,790
Honey!

206
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,589
Here.

207
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,599
1, 2, 3...

208
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:04,979
70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75
steps and turn left...

209
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:13,888
The 12th floor and the 15th door.

210
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,500
The toilet is broken again!
It sucks!

211
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:09,103
Hey, you must be Jung-suk!

212
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,273
You got any idea
where Dong-gun is?

213
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,682
I mean Dong-gun, your friend!

214
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:22,985
Well... let me think.
Where could he be?

215
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,392
Maybe, probably...

216
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,000
- He's in Hawaii.
- Hawaii? Why?

217
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,897
As I told you before...

218
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,097
He's on a business trip,
as a dubbing artist for a beast.

219
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:44,779
I don't get it.
He didn't say a word to me...

220
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,184
Hae-joo, don't cry.
He'll be back soon, trust me.

221
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,386
He didn't see it coming,
it was hustle and bustle.

222
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,794
I can tell it was
too hectic to call you.

223
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:09,601
How else would
I have his mobile phone!

224
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,709
Hello, that's right.

225
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,778
Dong-gun is in Hawaii!

226
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,977
Hawaii?

227
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,197
Hae-joo!

228
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,500
He'll be here soon.

229
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,707
He said he's going to give
you a great birthday gift.

230
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,814
That's his plan!

231
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,801
Hae-joo, Dong-gun sent you a postcard!

232
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,598
- It's from Hawaii?
- Really?

233
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,402
- Let me...
- No, this one!

234
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,487
Okay, I will!

235
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:36,289
Hae-joo, how much
I want to be with you now!

236
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,898
What a twist of fate is it that...

237
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,999
I'm this far away from you now.

238
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,598
Even on a positive note...

239
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,700
that Hawaii is so beautiful...

240
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,504
I am not as happy as
the others here 'cause...

241
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,405
you're not here.

242
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,878
Be patient, sweetheart,
I'll give you the greatest gift

243
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,181
for your birthday

244
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,491
But I think it's fair for you
to do something for me.

245
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,897
I want you to write me postcards, too.

246
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,297
You don't know
how much I want to hear you.

247
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,001
But I'll send you postcards
instead of calling you...

248
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,407
until you learn to write.

249
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:32,874
It'll take 2 weeks for you
to learn to write.

250
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,379
I'll be there by the time

251
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,481
you've done your homework!

252
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,781
Hae-joo!

253
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,384
You can see, can't you?

254
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,692
You see me, too? Oh my god!

255
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,192
It's unbelievable!

256
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,290
Hey, guys!

257
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,611
Hae-joo, please!

258
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,109
Swing'!

259
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,581
I can read!
I did homework!

260
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,786
Come back, Dong-gun!

261
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,800
Dong-gun!

262
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,576
Dong-gun!

263
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:35,486
You're a lazy boy!
I missed you so much!

264
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,096
Who the hell are you?
You know her?

265
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,995
Mr. TAK, hurry, we're losing them!

266
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,795
Sons of bitches!

267
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,212
You just stop right now, you assholes!

268
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,181
Don't be so mean!

269
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,980
You bastards!

270
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,983
Look what the dirty pigs did!
It hurts.

271
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,689
Get in there you scum!
Move your asses!

272
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,295
Hey, Miss, where are you going?

273
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,204
Well...

274
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,308
I have no idea how to get home!

275
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,612
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

276
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,790
What?
Something on my face?

277
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,291
No.

278
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,280
What do the Chinese characters mean?

279
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,088
The 3rd dragon

280
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,992
It's like the 'ABC' of the alphabet!

281
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:08,704
Don't be so harsh,
I didn't learn Chinese yet!

282
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,102
Whatever.

283
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:21,282
Mister, someone must
have scribbled on your arm.

284
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,881
Shall I erase it for you?

285
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,692
It means I'm the number 3
of the Dragon Gang!

286
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,991
Mr. 1st Dragon, Mr. 2nd
Dragon, I'm the 3rd and...

287
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,191
Shut the hell up, you bastard!

288
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,701
How the hell you laugh!

289
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,605
Wait.

290
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,972
Use this handkerchief
or it'll get infected!

291
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,693
- Goodbye, Dragons!
- Good night, angel!

292
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,089
- Thank you for the ride.
- My pleasure.

293
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,701
Are you okay?
You must've been frightened!

294
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,798
I'm okay, it's not the first time
I got in the wrong car...

295
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,001
I see.

296
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,280
Wait!

297
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,283
Let me see...

298
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,484
Your shoelaces are untied!
So dangerous!

299
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,196
Why are you looking at me?

300
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,209
I see. I look like your
dead boyfriend, don't I?

301
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,083
He's not dead!

302
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,579
Get your hands off me!

303
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:09,182
Just wait. Let me finish this up.

304
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,395
Sorry, I didn't mean it!
Itjust happened!

305
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,108
Hello, everybody.

306
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,306
Good night!

307
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,780
I went in the wrong direction.

308
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,481
Tell me, is that Dong-gun?

309
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,389
- No!
- That's gotta be Dong-gun!

310
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,392
Invite him in!

311
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,690
We want to say hello to him!

312
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:00,506
How funny it is to make
such a ridiculous mistake!

313
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,981
I saw a man who looks like
the way I imagined you are!

314
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,985
To begin with, Iwas stupid
to think you are in Seoul!

315
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,650
Well, I take the stupid part back.

316
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,792
Let me see.

317
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,995
What?

318
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,797
It worked out great.

319
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,907
The surgery came out great!

320
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,907
Oh, great!

321
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:37,572
- Let me look at myself in the mirror.
- No, not yet.

322
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,582
Don't take away this bandage
until I tell you to.

323
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,689
- The hideous thing goes forever?
- No, it was never here!

324
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,883
Thank you, doctor, Ifeel reborn.

325
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,004
Miss JANG Hae-joo, come with me.

326
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:09,408
What? Go where?

327
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,377
I did nothing wrong.

328
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,875
This is where you wanted to go?

329
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,979
What, you want to go to police station?

330
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,093
You're blocking the screen!

331
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,593
You're the last person
I want to be with now!

332
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,192
- Son of a bitch...
- Bastard!

333
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:17,075
Excuse me. I'm outta here.
You can eat mine, too.

334
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:22,174
Be a good girl. It's a bad habit
not to finish your meal!

335
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,188
Okay, I'll eat this,
you're taking me home!

336
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,794
Sure, just finish this first.

337
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,878
How nice to have this meal!

338
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,981
Do you like it?

339
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,388
Let me ask you something.

340
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,091
Your dead boyfriend...

341
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,692
How long had you been with him?

342
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,993
It's not funny any more!
He's very much alive!

343
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,502
He'll be back from Hawaii soon!

344
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:20,008
How about this?
I'll be your temporary boyfriend!

345
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,872
What? It's not bad, is it?

346
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,278
Mr. Prosecutor,
please do your real job!

347
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:31,582
You didn't read the newspaper?
I nailed the Dragon Gang!

348
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,986
You watched it all!

349
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,696
- Stupid jerk.
- Dirty pig.

350
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,197
Oh, Hae-joo, What's your favorite?

351
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,170
Just go home!

352
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,403
Wait!

353
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,481
I'm Do-shik, number 17
of the Dragon Gang!

354
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,789
And you?

355
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,793
- What?
- Tell me who you work for.

356
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,890
I work for Toonibus Station!

357
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,700
Tune-a-bus Station'?

358
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,998
Never heard of it.

359
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,670
Tune-a-bus'... then
you deal with vehicles?

360
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,703
What's your role
in the syndicate?

361
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,440
I'm here to get revenge on
TAK Jun-ha, and you're, too?

362
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:40,713
TAK, that son of a bitch,
is a dirty and sneaky dog.

363
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,021
And fucking mannerless to my boss!

364
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:49,390
This is what I'm gonna do,
'knock him off', 'delete' him!

365
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,859
I'm psyched up
just thinking about it.

366
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,307
Hey, this is it! Let's do it.

367
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,299
You!

368
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:15,114
You... are my sunshine
my only sunshine...

369
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,995
You called me?

370
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,204
- Nah, man.
- Are you messing with me?

371
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:42,479
We've met before, right?

372
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,281
Aren't you KOO Dong-gun?!

373
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:53,495
Long time no see!
How have you been?

374
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,696
I think I should be okay.

375
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,684
Oh, goddess of fate,
you are so cruel...

376
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,990
Of all the men...

377
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,592
You sent Jun-ha to... Hae-joo!

378
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
I feel so sympathetic for you.

379
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:30,191
We've got the same enemy.
Let's 'delete' him clean.

380
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,894
For my family, and
for your 'would-be' family!

381
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:37,406
As a team, we can do this
easy and clean.

382
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,006
- Don't leave me behind.
- Taxi!

383
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,774
Hey, Tune-a-bus!

384
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,048
What a timid boy!

385
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,690
Hae-joo, how have you been?

386
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:03,091
In Hawaii, a prosecutor is
the worst choice for a boyfriend,

387
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:06,691
Cause in Hawaii, people are
so nice and kind that...

388
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,204
there is no work for prosecutors.

389
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:15,510
Only the 'dumb and dumber'
apply for prosecutor jobs.

390
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:19,173
The worst part is that they
break the law by themselves!

391
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,986
Give it back to me.

392
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,289
- I said, give it back to me!
- No, sir.

393
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,893
You damned stubborn pig!

394
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:36,295
I'll make you regret that!

395
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,594
Help! He's killing me.

396
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,679
Hae-joo, where are you going?

397
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,976
How lucky I should see you here!

398
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,281
Get in!

399
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,890
I'll give you a special ride
in a more than special car.

400
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,592
Get in, Hae-joo!

401
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,288
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor!

402
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,992
Look what you're doing,
like a brainless thug!

403
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,899
I see why prosecutors
have such a bad rep in Hawaii.

404
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,902
It's so obvious!

405
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,802
What? Hawaiian thug?

406
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:22,207
Hae-joo, let's make the best
use of this damn patrol car.

407
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,780
With a siren on top,
we'll get there fast and safe!

408
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,883
Stay away from me,
or I'll call the police.

409
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,220
I work for the police!

410
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:37,890
Help! He's killing me!

411
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,979
Dong-gun... hurry!

412
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,783
Okay, let me see.

413
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,295
What?

414
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:19,496
Don't panic! This isjust a small
side effect of the anesthesia.

415
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,196
Let me take a mirror!

416
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,603
Oh, God!

417
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:34,982
Just one week is enough
to get your brows back!

418
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,792
Are you sure?

419
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,203
Hae-joo, I am sorry to say this...

420
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,409
It's unexpected, but I've got
to work one more week here...

421
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,273
What?

422
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:09,279
Dong-gun, don't be sorry.

423
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,183
I know you're stuck with work.

424
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:19,993
But I miss you so much.

425
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,307
It's weird that I can feel you
only with my eyes closed...

426
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,071
The moment,

427
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,776
I open my eyes,
you're not with me any more!

428
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,685
What an irony of fate!
My heart has never hurt

429
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,691
like this before.

430
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,993
Ifeel like my best friend has gone
the moment my eyes are opened.

431
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,102
I don't even have a photo
to remember you by!

432
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:09,305
If I do, I could see and
feel you in the photo.

433
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,778
Oh, God, can't you give
me anything to feel him by?

434
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,186
Excuse me.

435
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,893
Where do you have
the painting of Hawaii?

436
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,697
Sorry, but we don't have any.

437
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:17,676
Hae-joo, you don't
have an umbrella, do you?

438
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,783
Hae-joo...

439
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,280
I cant' bear to see
the shit going on there!

440
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,188
They are becoming horny.

441
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,894
Your game is almost over.

442
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,690
Can you believe thisjerk
has almost won her heart?

443
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,402
You need this?

444
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,605
- Damn, that thing's scary!
- You don't like it?

445
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:49,973
How about this?

446
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,176
You need a much bigger one?

447
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,878
Look at the jerk and your girl!

448
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,184
They're going away!

449
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,206
My handkerchief?

450
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,078
I had a grueling fight
with thatjerk to get it back.

451
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:28,480
The pig made frantic
attempts not to let it go.

452
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:33,188
I gave this to him!
Why did you take it back?

453
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,690
Not to the worst tempered
shit head of a criminal ever!

454
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,886
You still don't get it yet?

455
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,795
It's me that you
should sympathize with!

456
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,700
I was hurt trying to get
the criminals!

457
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,202
It hurts so much.

458
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,700
Thank you for the ride.

459
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,602
I've been dry and safe.

460
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,209
You have no idea
how happy I am to do this!

461
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,779
- And I'll be there for you tomorrow.
- No, thank you.

462
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:35,082
You'd better stop this.

463
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:45,383
Hae-joo, you don't have
the slightest idea why I do this?

464
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,693
It's tougher than nailing criminals.

465
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,502
You don't like my weapons so...

466
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,276
I worked hard to get you this.

467
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,580
- What the hell is this again?
- Accidental death!

468
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:15,580
Don't you know how to 'think'?

469
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,489
If a prosecutor is run over by this,
it's called an accident, right?

470
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,497
What a brainless crap!

471
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:26,591
Just stay away,
I am in trouble already!

472
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,906
You really want to kill someone?

473
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,876
You're nuts!

474
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,787
Oh my, they're doing it!

475
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,792
Look, they are kissing!

476
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,898
Their tongues are moving!

477
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,308
Now where's your
'be moral' attitude?

478
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,574
You said it's brainless crap!

479
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,281
Calm down?
What's it with you!

480
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,890
You should kill TAK, not me!!

481
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:43,977
What?

482
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,579
Hae-joo!

483
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,979
Sorry about this!

484
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,882
No need to be.

485
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,475
You were so miserable, that's why.

486
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,383
But at least we learned something.

487
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,788
The 'speeding cart
murder op' is too dangerous.

488
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,090
Cut the revenge crap!

489
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,803
What are you talking about?

490
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,997
You sit and watch your girl fall for him?

491
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,005
You know what?
Honesty is the best policy.

492
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,669
When I get rid of the bandage,
I'll tell her everything.

493
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,280
What a sappy, goofy idea!

494
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,783
Don't tell me you have
any chance against him!

495
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,979
Finish him off! Delete him ever,
there's no other way!

496
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,386
Delete what?
Is he a file or something?

497
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,992
Please cut the stupid crap!

498
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:08,496
Screw your 'knock off'
'delete', whatever!

499
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,593
You have no brains or guts
to confront him!

500
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:15,796
Anyway I'll be promoted
to the 2nd Dragon!

501
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,197
I could guess.

502
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,886
Hey, Jun-ha!

503
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,988
- So happy to see you again!
- So am I.

504
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,785
Last time I was too busy
to have a long talk.

505
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:39,486
Today, let's go get some drinks
or something, buddy.

506
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,789
But I have an appointment...

507
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,697
No, not drinks,
we should have dinner first!

508
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:51,398
Hey, Jun-ha, hi again!
What's up?

509
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,201
- Hi, Dong-gun.
- How are you doing?

510
00:56:56,346 --> 00:57:00,874
There's a good restaurant.
Let's have lunch, dinner, whatever!

511
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:05,579
- I'm not hungry at all!
- Yes, you are!

512
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,780
Jun-ha, wait!

513
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,592
Jun-ha, again, hi!

514
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,495
I couldn't wait to see you.

515
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,692
- You must be hungry.
- No, not at all.

516
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:25,101
Please come with me,
I got something to tell you.

517
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,580
Hey, one more bottle of this please.

518
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,588
Down as much as you can,
but we're going Dutch!

519
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,282
Let's drink until one of us falls.

520
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,394
Can I borrow that bottle?

521
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,498
Oh, water!

522
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,880
No!

523
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,703
Not a chance!

524
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,211
You don't get me this time
forget it!

525
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,472
No!

526
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,776
NO!

527
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,586
This leech nearly got me again!

528
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,790
Hey, give me some water!

529
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,610
Hae-joo!

530
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,680
Hae-joo!

531
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,184
She's playing the piano
with her eyes closed?

532
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:21,682
J) I can see you but like
in the mist.

533
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,785
J) You are 50 close and far from rear/1.

534
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:35,486
J) The moment] tout/1 you,
you move back.

535
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:41,502
J) 0/1, you feel like a rainbow.

536
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,707
J) How else can I...

537
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,379
Hey, our enemy is playing
disgusting romantic crap!

538
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,581
He sings in a 'cool guy'
seducing way!

539
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:06,184
I bet, they'll do it tonight, period!

540
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:13,596
J) I can see you,
but like in a mist.

541
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:21,208
J) You are so close and far from reach

542
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:28,680
J) The moment] tout/1 you,
you move back.

543
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:36,385
J) 0/1, you feel like a rainbow.

544
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:43,187
J) I Wis/1 I could be next to you, some day...

545
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,698
You need this

546
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,099
Hit and run. You got it?

547
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,596
I'll let the power down.

548
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:59,177
J) Please give me strength

549
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:07,388
J) to ﬁnd tlle way to be wit/1 you.

550
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:13,689
J) But you’re already in my heart...

551
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,201
The power company
screws up my song!

552
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,203
Hae-joo!

553
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:41,789
How stupid I was to do
the ass's 'hit and run' crap!

554
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,100
Dong-gun?

555
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,908
Dong-gun?

556
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,081
Hunt for any of the Dragon rats.

557
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:17,191
Give me a call.
I'll be waiting.

558
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:34,504
Hae-joo, you'll be all right.
Get some sleep.

559
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,395
Jun-ha...

560
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,898
You're a great guy.

561
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,276
Totally different from
the prosecutors in Hawaii!

562
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,787
How embarrassing!

563
01:04:56,025 --> 01:05:01,292
Dong-gun, where are you?

564
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,898
Who are you?

565
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,196
Hae-joo, I am Dong-gun.

566
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,396
You can't be Dong-gun!

567
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,702
I want you to understand
why I had to run away

568
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:17,074
Sorry, Hae-joo.

569
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,680
- Dong-gun!’
- Huh?'

570
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,580
It's not your looks but your soul
that I am in love with.

571
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:39,090
Hae-joo, your true love freed me
from a long spell and curse.

572
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,693
Dong-gun, you look so cool!
I love you.

573
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:53,780
Eat this, love is patient
but your stomach is not.

574
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,181
You don't know when to quit!

575
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,280
Don't get mad at me!

576
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,199
I can't believe this!

577
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:24,473
It'sjust one of the few cases,
a nasty bit of tough luck!

578
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:29,075
I hope this will help
to relieve your feelings!

579
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:32,187
NO!

580
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,484
Are you a quack or something?

581
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:38,184
I looked just monstrous before,

582
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,990
now I'm whacky psycho!
NO!

583
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,578
You need more brown?

584
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,193
Dear Hae-joo. ..

585
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,793
What should be the 3rd excuse?

586
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:27,204
Look!

587
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,577
Thank you, Jun-ha.

588
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:45,986
Is your boyfriend still alive?
Not dead yet?

589
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,891
What is he like?

590
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,701
- He's a space beast.
- Pardon?

591
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,804
No kidding! Then you
went out with a beast?

592
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:04,174
My self-pride hurts,
I'm a loser against a beast?

593
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:09,375
Don't take it wrong.
You're a great guy.

594
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:17,691
It's his nickname, I like the growling
beast sounds he makes.

595
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,893
That's all?
Then let me beat him.

596
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:29,903
If I make a better beast sound,
I win your heart, right?

597
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,398
Trust me, this is my game.

598
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,875
Sorry, that's a dog bark.

599
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,595
I'm laughing so hard
it's making me cry.

600
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,576
I can feel the unavoidable
chemistry they share!

601
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,578
Dong-gun, what should you do?

602
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,299
Hello.

603
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:37,001
- Wait a moment, Hae-joo.
- For me?

604
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,902
Hello.

605
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,769
Dong-gun!

606
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,881
Where are you now?

607
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,188
I was taken to an ER.

608
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:06,199
Some mad jerk threw
a bottle and Iwas hurt!

609
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:11,600
I don't know what shit

610
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,004
was in his head, damn!

611
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:25,785
You're still in Hawaii?
Come to see me!

612
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:30,290
So sorry but I can't
come back to you,

613
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,984
I changed my mind!

614
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:37,292
Hot chicks on the beach
are going nuts for me!

615
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,605
No man would leave so many chicks

616
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,608
behind forjust one so-so girl.

617
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,177
You think I'm a jackass!

618
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:53,679
I'm notjust saying
this is exciting but...

619
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:58,276
I'm seriously thinking of
marrying one of the babes here.

620
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,878
I'm sick of the 'soul mate' love shit,
so you find someone else.

621
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:05,187
If you need my advice,
a public prosecutor is an option.

622
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,193
Good bye.

623
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,672
Hello!

624
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,077
What?

625
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,288
I'm going to Hawaii!

626
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:37,883
Hae-joo!

627
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,689
Mom, don't worry, it won't take long.

628
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,296
Hae-joo!

629
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,899
Thisjerk's got me infuriated!

630
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,704
Jun-ha!

631
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,674
You're here to grab me for
lunch, dinner whatever!

632
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,181
- How have you been?
- Good.

633
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,585
How is it going with the girl?

634
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,391
With Hae-joo?

635
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,593
I don't know...
but it's tough.

636
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,191
She doesn't know
how much I feel for her.

637
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:24,299
You must be
way deep in love with her!

638
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,499
You know what drives me crazy?

639
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:32,475
I don't think I can compete
against her boyfriend.

640
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,377
She's as firm as a rock.

641
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,679
I bet you deserve her better.

642
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:44,288
Just keep caring for her,
and she'll turn to you.

643
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,488
You're such a great guy!

644
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,696
And you two are meant
for each other.

645
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,899
You feel so weird!

646
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:07,380
I'm honored to treat
a messenger of love!

647
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,177
What do you like to eat?

648
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,583
How about Chinese noodles?

649
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:16,680
How about a rain check for that?
Why don't you see her now!

650
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,988
- I'm in a hurry.
- Where are you going?

651
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,992
Hawaii? You just
came back from there!

652
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,199
Tell me, why Hawaii again?

653
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:33,001
Jung-suk, there's a visitor
for you in the lobby.

654
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,886
You're here for me?
I'm Jung-suk.

655
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:34,798
You're... Jung-suk?

656
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,405
Sure... Iam.

657
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,375
Dong-gun, well...
where could he be?

658
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:50,178
He's probably in Hawaii!

659
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,783
I'm Jung-suk, Dong-gun's friend.

660
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:58,689
He is on an urgent business trip,
so I am here for him.

661
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,503
What?

662
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,903
Hey, Miss, your passport, please.

663
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,171
Sorry, but I don't have one,
but I should go in there!

664
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,780
It's an emergency.

665
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,975
Sorry, but you're not
allowed in without a passport.

666
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:59,576
I said an emergency.
Are you deaf or something?

667
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,987
Come this way,
we need to investigate this.

668
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,989
I've been waiting this long!

669
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,390
Come this way, come on!

670
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,395
Amazonian strength
out of this small girl!

671
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,499
- You're such a blockhead!
- This way!

672
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,101
Dong-gun!

673
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,006
Miss, stop there.

674
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,874
Dong-gun!

675
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:30,073
I'm begging you,
5 minutes is all I need!

676
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:33,381
Just give me 5 minutes.

677
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,982
What the hell!

678
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:42,188
Whatever story you got,
better not make a fuss.

679
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,599
Hey, Miss!

680
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,802
Can I go to the restroom
for a minute?

681
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,705
I swear, the man on the photo is me!

682
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:59,780
- Do I look so different?
- Totally different!

683
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,876
What a scum!

684
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,086
Don't think this cheap
forged passport would work!

685
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,190
I swear, I am a good citizen!

686
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,691
Look at me, I admit
I altered the photo a bit.

687
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:16,491
And ID number,
KOO Dong-gun!

688
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,999
I'm being wrongfully accused!

689
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:39,676
Hae-joo, what are you doing here?

690
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,891
- What's this mess about?
- You wanna get beaten?

691
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:59,603
Hey, you son of a bitch!

692
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:05,971
Don't tell me you don't know
how much I miss you!

693
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:09,882
Why are you doing this shit!

694
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,077
You're not here for fun!

695
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:25,288
Sorry but I don't get it,
Hae-joo.

696
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:26,401
Iam Jung-suk.

697
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,093
- KOO Dong-gun!
- Yes, sir!

698
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,999
- Here fingerprint!
- Right.

699
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:17,977
Hae-joo, why are you
being held at the airport?

700
01:19:23,882 --> 01:19:24,025
Dita], “In!

701
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:27,290
What's up?
Waiting for your plane?

702
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,090
You're going on a trip, right?

703
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,297
You and I never stop
meeting by accident!

704
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,892
Hae-joo, this is Dong-gun,
my high school friend.

705
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,302
I met him 2 weeks ago,
the first time since high school.

706
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,102
Say hello.
This is Dong-gun.

707
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:46,569
This is Hae-joo, she's pretty, right?

708
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:49,683
Say hello.

709
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,680
Nice to meet you, Hae-joo.

710
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:57,185
Jun-ha is a really great guy.
He can make you happy.

711
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,385
- What?
- Dong-gun!

712
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,199
So you're running away, chicken!

713
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:11,395
You're okay not seeing me forever?
You dirty coward!

714
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,371
So you didn't want to see me?

715
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:19,778
Stupid son of a bitch!

716
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,480
You worthless shit!

717
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,884
You're not the Dong-gun
I've been in love with.

718
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:32,985
He is a man of his word,
and will be with me...

719
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,892
as he promised...

720
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:39,894
A chicken like you,
is not my boy friend!

721
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,200
You've met before?

722
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,895
Let me go!

723
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:56,578
You're not brave enough to look at me?

724
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,784
Don't pretend to be Dong-gun,

725
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:08,392
he's not such a loser!

726
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,699
Even if Dong-gun felt
for some other girl...

727
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,502
He wouldn't sneak away
like you do.

728
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,199
Just get away!

729
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,274
I won't see you again.

730
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:33,986
Hae-joo!

731
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,689
Hae-joo...

732
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,292
Happy birthday to you.

733
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,082
Wait, Hae-joo!

734
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:47,088
Jun-ha, 'mother-four-Q'!

735
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,189
What a jerk!

736
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,099
Take it easy.

737
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,502
Good night.

738
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,904
Wait!

739
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:09,379
TAK Jun-ha, you filthy pig.

740
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,182
You dirty dog!

741
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,787
Who's this sucker!

742
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,982
Go to hell!

743
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,890
Where is he?

744
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,398
Dear Hae-joo. ..

745
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,282
What are you doing?

746
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,492
The mail carrier
just came right?

747
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:33,191
- What's that?
- What's what?

748
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,700
- You're hiding something.
- Hiding what?

749
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:40,497
I'm a man of law and order,
a prosecutor.

750
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,109
See, I am clean.

751
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,871
It's not funny,
give me what you're hiding.

752
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:46,773
In this hand?

753
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,779
It's clean.

754
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,788
Credit the beauty
of trusting someone!

755
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,084
Okay, I don't mind, whatever.

756
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:01,195
Here, the electricity bill is so big!

757
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:04,097
Join the energy saving movement!

758
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:12,502
Hae-joo, give me
the pleasure of driving you,

759
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:17,669
I had my car washed for you.

760
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,975
Dong-gun, I love you!

761
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,583
They're the first words I learned.

762
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,287
Damn!

763
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,789
All thisjust sucks. I can't stand it!

764
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,799
Sir, calm down.

765
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:49,870
What makes you so happy?

766
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,395
Hae-joo, the beauty &
Dong-gun, the ugliest beast ever

767
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,699
Hae-joo!

768
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,505
You're okay with everything?

769
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,202
Such as?

770
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,473
Your shoe laces won't get loose?

771
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:45,592
JANG Hae-joo

772
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:56,795
Dong-gun, I love you.

773
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,606
They're the first words I learned.

774
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,585
I saw a man who looks like...

775
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,380
I love you...

776
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,489
When are you coming?

777
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,497
Something to feel you by...

778
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:39,573
I miss you so much

779
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,168
Sorry about Hae-joo,
but I can't do this any more.

780
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,283
Jun-ha, son of a bitch!

781
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,295
- Let me go!
- You're not allowed!

782
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,692
Let him in!

783
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,097
Hands off!

784
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:44,572
Is this what you wrote?
Did you mean it?

785
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,179
Long time no see.

786
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:53,586
Just explain to me,
what's going on with Hae-joo?

787
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:58,590
It's true and correct,
she's losing her eyesight.

788
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,293
What's worse, another
transplant is not possible.

789
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:09,595
So, you broke up with her
'cause she's going blind?

790
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:13,302
You two-faced sneaky pig!

791
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:17,070
If Hae-joo's going blind again,

792
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,076
she needs you more than ever!

793
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:27,978
To be up front,
I don't think I can do that.

794
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,191
I've got to think about my career...

795
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,987
So if Hae-joo goes blind...

796
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:42,496
She'd be too much a burden
for me to carry.

797
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:48,902
You son of a bitch!

798
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:07,583
You don't deserve a bit of her love!

799
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,282
- Hae-joo, good job.
- Thanks a lot.

800
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:10,686
See you tomorrow.

801
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:26,601
Hae-joo...

802
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:47,283
Hae-joo, you don't see me?

803
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:50,090
What a monstrous twist of fate!

804
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,496
I'm so sorry.

805
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,603
I'm the one to blame for this!

806
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,001
I'm so sorry!
Please accept my apology!

807
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:05,375
I am awfully sorry, Hae-joo.

808
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:06,980
Who are you?

809
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:13,781
I'm KOO Dong-gun.

810
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,483
You don't remember my voice?

811
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:20,287
What are you talking about?
I don't know you!

812
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,396
Just get off the stage.

813
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,095
Oh, Hae-joo.

814
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,702
You should've begged more, idiot!

815
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:41,575
Oh my God,
my eyes hurt like hell!

816
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:44,583
- Are you alright?
- Hands off, don't do silly things.

817
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:58,890
I am Dong-gun, your boy friend, ex...

818
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:00,694
Why are you doing this to me?

819
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:04,896
Dong-gun dumped me and
ran away to Hawaii, or wherever.

820
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:10,074
Hae-joo, I didn't dump you, but...

821
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:12,873
Ididn't mean it. Idon't
even know where to start!

822
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:18,179
The bottom line is
I'm back home, to you!

823
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,777
You like the space beast, right?
It's back for you.

824
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:27,586
Oh, princess Hae-joo,
forgive me just once!

825
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,994
Now I see what the beast sound
is like!

826
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:39,899
I don't want to hear anymore.

827
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:45,069
The moment I can see again,
you'll run away!

828
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,271
That's never gonna happen.

829
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,179
I didn't mean to
hurt you or something.

830
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:53,377
Ijust thought Jun-ha
could make you happy.

831
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,989
And Dragon Gang guy
ruined everything...

832
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:59,286
I even saw a plastic surgeon
to look better, but...

833
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:01,395
When did you get this mark?

834
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:09,196
- When Iwas a kid...
- Did it hurt?

835
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:14,106
You can see me?

836
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,674
You idiot!

837
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:25,280
I miss you so much!

838
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:39,789
Why do you think
I wanted eye surgery?

839
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:46,805
I wanted to see you smile and cry and...

840
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,774
In that way, Iwant you in my life.

841
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:55,678
I'd stop loving you
if I found you weren't handsome?

842
01:35:57,518 --> 01:36:03,081
I love you whether
it's a dark or bright world.

843
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:09,692
So just be with me,
whether you're a beast or a prince.

844
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:18,703
Oh, Dong-gun!

845
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:34,179
Do you like my looks anyway?

846
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:38,089
You're the cutest beast ever!

847
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:33,778
TAK Jun-ha!

848
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,882
Mercifully I'll spare you your life.

849
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:39,784
In return for that...

850
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,682
Send her back to my friend.

851
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:50,288
I know every piece of shit about you!

852
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,799
He even knows about
the attempted cart murder!

853
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:58,399
Ready to join your buddies
in the big house!
