1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,560
Get up!

2
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Kwai, go now, they are coming close!

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,680
I can't move! I can't!

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,200
We can't be caught by those bastards.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,120
Let's go, they are after us.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Kwai...

7
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,120
Go now.

8
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,240
Ferry Station, Hong Kong

9
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Are you Master Wong Fei-hong?

10
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,120
Yes, what's the matter?

11
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,200
A lady asked me to send you
this bunch of flowers.

12
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,120
Thank you.

13
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
You're welcome.

14
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,440
Fei-hong, I can't come to see you off.

15
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
Because I am following an important news.

16
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,080
3 branch leaders of the "Boxer Association"
are wanted by HK Gov't.

17
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
It's really exciting.

18
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm sorry, I'll come to visit you when I'm free.
Yours Aunt Yee.

19
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
3 tickets to Canton.

20
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
They're the wanted criminals.
Go and catch them.

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Go!

22
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
Don't go!

23
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,080
Yuen Long, Yuen Fu, Yu Pao,
you bastards of the Boxer Association!

24
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,120
Surrender if you are wise!

25
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
You're surrounded.

26
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
The Boxer Association?

27
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
You bastards, do you want to arrest me?

28
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,800
You are dreaming!

29
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,080
Attack!

30
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Leave us alone,
or I will kill this guy!

31
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,160
Be careful of my flowers!

32
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
You shut up!

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,560
We are civilized, don't be that rude.

34
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,560
So what?

35
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,720
So, I will counter attack!

36
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,640
- It's OK, hold the kid.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,440
- Who are you?
- Wong Fei-hong from Fu-shan.

38
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
Wong Fei-hong?
Let's go!

39
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
So what?
Let's beat him to death.

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Yes!

41
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
Channeling?

42
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Shit! I can't make it.

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,040
I am protected by God!

44
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,240
Go now.

45
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,600
My God, come and help me.

46
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
Please, The God of Monkeys,
come and help me.

47
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,120
Please, The God of Kwan
come and help me.

48
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
Please, The Prince Na Chai,
come and help me.

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,320
You are bluffing!

50
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,160
How dare you!

51
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Master Wong,
thank you very much.

52
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
- Don't mention it.
- I am leaving.

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Please.

54
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
- Take them away.
- Yes.

55
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Go.

56
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,480
Wong Fei-hong,
the Boxer Association won't let you go.

57
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,640
Po Chi Lam Pharmacy

58
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

59
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,520
Why do you push me out?

60
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,000
12, 13, 14

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,120
You are look like a cripple.

62
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,120
- But you play like a cripple.
- Yes...

63
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
Stand properly.

64
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,240
"Single leg crane"!

65
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,320
Why did you kick me away?

66
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,560
This Po Chi Lam is rather small.

67
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,460
Relax.

68
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,760
It's OK.

69
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,040
Thank you, Master Wong.

70
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
Now, take this herb home,
drink the tea and you'll be alright.

71
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Ah So.

72
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Ah So.

73
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,520
What are you doing?

74
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,120
I just wanted to fetch a piece of water-melon.

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
But I was kicked back by the juniors.

76
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,320
Pal, why are you hurt like this?

77
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I was fine before coming here.

78
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
But I was seriously hurt by your students.

79
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,680
Are you coming for medical treatment?

80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
No.

81
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
But now, it is.

82
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,100
Fu.

83
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,040
Master, we don't mean it.

84
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
It's too small, you can't give treatment
when we are practising.

85
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
More and more students joined us.

86
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Why don't we rent a bigger place?

87
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,880
I know it!

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
But the rental rate is high in Canton,
how can we afford it?

89
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Master, if our patients are hurt by us
when they come for treatment, that's a pity!

90
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,240
You are so talkative!

91
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,360
So, you'd better give me some idea.

92
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,760
Master Wong, you'd move this time.

93
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,840
Who are you?

94
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I am the representative of the landlord,
this is a letter of rent raising.

95
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,040
You needn't look at it,
3 times will be added to your original rent.

96
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,560
I don't think you can afford it,
you'd better move!

97
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Watch the stance!

98
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
My cousin can be claimed as foreigner,
in fact a banana.

99
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
I'll teach you some English,
so you won't lose face.

100
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,800
Alright.

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
In morning, how do you greet others?

102
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
Good morning.

103
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
How to greet others at night?

104
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,880
What?

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Good night.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,160
How about in the afternoon?

107
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,880
Afternoon?

108
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Good afternoon, I guess.

109
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
Good afternoon.

110
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Just say sorry, if you bump into someone.

111
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,060
Sorry, sorry.

112
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,080
How impolite is the Cantonese.

113
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,360
What shall we do now, dad?

114
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,880
Let's find a place for a rest,
then find out where the monks are.

115
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,580
Let's go!

116
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,280
My dear cousin...!

117
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,960
Cousin Robert!

118
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
I am not your Robert.

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,960
Foreigner?!

120
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,320
Say hello!

121
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,880
Good morning.

122
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,000
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

123
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
Hello Benjamin.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Hi, Robert.

125
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,860
He is Robert.

126
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm sorry, Benjamin!

127
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
I'll call you later!

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
Bye bye.
Bye bye!

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
Cousin Robert.

130
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,840
Hi, my dear cousin.

131
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,880
He is my senior.

132
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
You come early.

133
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
You've told me
that many flats with low rent are available.

134
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,880
You must help me to rent any of it.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Oh! I'm busy.

136
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
What did he say?

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,800
I don't know.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,160
It means busy.

139
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Busy!

140
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Many customers are waiting for me.

141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,880
The electricity supply is always out of order,
it always...

142
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,120
See, it's out of order again.
Why don't you drink some brandy first.

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
I'll fix it and I'll come back later.

144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Take you time...

145
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
OK, bye bye.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,320
It's imported wine.

147
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,280
It's called brandy, the taste is hot.

148
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,040
You know, someone only drinks a mouthful,
then he will be fainted.

149
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,800
I haven't tried it before.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
How poor are you! What a shame!
You are poor!

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
I haven't tried it before.

152
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,800
- Do you want a try?
- Sure.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Come on.

154
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,880
I am really blind!

155
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,840
I can see nothing, am I fainting?

156
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,400
- What'll we do?
- No matter how, let's drink!

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,840
- Why not drink it all?
- It's great!

158
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
I beg you, leave some to me.

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
You are so greedy!

160
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Come on, I beg you!

161
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Ghost!

162
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,480
I am scared!

163
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
Drinking brandy will make one see ghost.

164
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
Ghost...

165
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,880
They beated me.

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,120
What's the matter?
Why are you so rude?

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
Shit, cousin.

168
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,360
You are shameless, heartless, you bastard!

169
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Why did you hit my client?

170
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
He is human!
I mistook him as a ghost.

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,080
- Where did you get hurt?
- My heart!

172
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,880
Your heart?!

173
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
You hurt his heart.

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
My lung too.

175
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Your lung?!

176
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh, you hurt his lung.

177
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,120
What lung?

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,400
Lung, lung for breathing!

179
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,880
I don't know what you are talking indeed.

180
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
Oh, My God!

181
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
How can Wong Fei-hong's students
do whatever they like?

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Are you from Po Chi Lam?

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,400
Sure! Don't you think we are the dogs of
Po Chi Lam?

184
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
So what?

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
I admire Master Wong very much,
may I know your name?

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,080
I am Wong Fei-hong...

187
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,920
Wong's student Leung Fu,
he is my junior Ah So.

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
How are you?
They are my sisters.

189
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,360
Ching Ha, Chow Hung and Man Yuk.

190
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,880
Your look is a little bit weird!

191
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,980
Yes, it's strange!

192
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,920
You are kidding.

193
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Why don't you apologise now?
Say sorry!

194
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Sorry! Sorry!

195
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Mr. Wong, they want to find a new place
for Po Chi Lam's removal.

196
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,520
They want a spacious apartment.

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
You have a good place, right?

198
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, it's next to my shop, a spacious one.

199
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,920
About the rent, I will make it 70% less.

200
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,200
It's very kind of you to give us
such a low price!

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,160
I wish to learn Kung-fu from Master Wong.
If I can make it,

202
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,880
I will give you a commission equivalent to
3 months' rent.

203
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,040
Cut the crap, let's go now.

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Mr. Wong.

205
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
You may call me Mass Tar Wong.

206
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,440
My surname is Wong, named Mass Tar.

207
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,440
Spell M-a-s-s T-a-r! Mass Tar Wong.

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,960
I admire you so much.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,920
You are flattering me.

210
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
Are you satisfied with this house?

211
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,520
He likes it so much!

212
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
If the price is OK, I will move Po Chi Lam here.

213
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
If you think it's rather expensive,
I may lower the rent.

214
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,560
We may share the sacrificial pork
on the 2nd and 16th of the month.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
We are running business together.

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, your flat is for business purpose too.

217
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,800
I wish to learn Kung-fu from you actually.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
You are flattering me.

219
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
Hey, why not go for a drink?
It's my treat.

220
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,540
Lets go.

221
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
Our master promised his dad not to drink.

222
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Sure, sure.

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Let's make it a deal.

224
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,580
Fine.

225
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,000
- Fu.
- Yes

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Fix the contract with Mr. Wong.

227
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,280
I've to greet the new military officer now,
excuse me.

228
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
See you.

229
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,040
Good bye.

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
You are welcome.

231
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,120
Who the hell is that military officer?

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
This way please.

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Please.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,440
Are there anyone practising Kung-fu inside?

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Our Excellency wants to do some exercise.

236
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
Master Wong, after you.

237
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,160
Are you Master Wong?

238
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,840
I am Wong Fei-hong, how are you,
Your Excellency?

239
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,360
Give Master Wong the tea.

240
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,880
Sit down please.

241
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,880
I have just come here to take care of
the law and order of this place.

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,880
I know Master Wong is
the master of the local militia.

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,880
Your students are all geniuses of martial arts.

244
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,080
So I would like to meet you...

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
May be, I need your help in future.

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,040
You are flattering me.

247
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,960
Please be seated.

248
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,360
The Governor is taking opium now.

249
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,880
He will come out later.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,240
I have heard that your Kung-fu
belongs to the school of Shaolin.

251
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,880
Your No-shadow Kick is really famous.

252
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,840
But, what sort of Fists do you play?

253
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,880
Kung's? Tiger and Crane?
Or Cross Fists?

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,120
Sir, you mean famous, it's being exaggerated.

255
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
Please don't misunderstand.

256
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,320
Master Wong, you are wrong.

257
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,040
It's a bad habit of keeping
your Kung-fu secretly.

258
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,900
You are naughty!

259
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,240
Master, is this officer an idiot?

260
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:31,980
Don't be big mouth.

261
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,580
Yes.

262
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
Thank you, Master Wong.

263
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
You are really great!

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,880
Your Excellency,
I am a doctor and know little Kung-fu.

265
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,440
How can I compare with you?

266
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
Master, he did it on purpose.

267
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,320
You are nosy.

268
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,520
Me?!

269
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,920
My Kung-fu is not great.

270
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,400
I can't make any muscle
after numerous practices.

271
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,800
But, I know one person,
whose Kung-fu is great.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Who is it?

273
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,400
He is a notorious robber,
he robbed and raped.

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,160
If he were not drunk that day...,

275
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,240
...we would not have caught him.

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Kill me if you have guts!

277
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,520
Don't play any trick!

278
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
Why are you so fierce?

279
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
Master Wong is here.

280
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,200
It's not your turn to be fierce.

281
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
Wong Fei-hong?

282
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
Don't be misleaded by this Skinny!

283
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,880
He is protected by inner air.

284
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,320
He is hard to be killed...

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,240
Right? He didn't make a noise.

286
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,880
I want your life!

287
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,920
Help! Save me please.

288
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Be careful!

289
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Master Wong, please beat him for me.

290
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,400
Bravo, please kill him for me.

291
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
You bastard, I want to kill you.

292
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,440
What's the matter?

293
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,280
Nothing special, a prisoner escaped.

294
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
He is executed to death just now.

295
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,560
Master Wong, I am sorry!

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
I will buy you a drink one day.

297
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I promised my dad not to drink.

298
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Sir, I've to finish some personal matters first.
Good bye.

299
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
Thank you very much.

300
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
See you.

301
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,560
Wong is quite famous locally,
why did you fool him?

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,040
You needn't do so.

303
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
Such a proud guy!

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
I should show him a lesson,

305
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
otherwise, he will be our obstacle.

306
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,440
How can you let him...

307
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,520
to block your road to success?

308
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,720
Thank you everybody.

309
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,520
To be the chairman of "Moral Reform Society",

310
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,520
I don't think I am qualified to do so.

311
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,480
Fei-hong, you'd not be that humble.

312
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,040
In these days,
most of the youth forget morality.

313
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,920
It's hard to find a youth
with a righteous heart like you?

314
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,560
So we prepare this signboard to you,
"A humble and righteous symbol".

315
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,480
This is the present for your new school too.

316
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank you very much.

317
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,720
Buddies, let's do some exercise to warm up.

318
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,120
So you will have perfect performance
in the coming lion dance show.

319
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,540
Hey, guys.

320
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Miss, you have so many sisters!

321
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
She is our mother.

322
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,720
Auntie.

323
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,840
Be quiet, our master hates us being courted.

324
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
Are you that afraid of him?

325
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,880
Right, we just chat, isn't it sinful?

326
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,920
We haven't seen such dumb bell!

327
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,800
Master Wong, you have good students.

328
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,440
They are so smart.

329
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,520
Handsome.

330
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,920
With good spirits.

331
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
They are talkative too.

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,320
All are decent.

333
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
What are you doing?

334
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,800
We just chat with our neighbours.

335
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,840
Is he your master?
He is quite handsome.

336
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,920
Do you take females as students?

337
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,920
They dress so little and look bitchy.

338
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,560
You can tell they are not decent girls.

339
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,520
Stop chatting with them, got me?

340
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,520
He is blaming us.

341
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Let's fool him.

342
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,840
Give me the drum.

343
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,520
- Good!
- You play the drum very well!

344
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
Don't see and don't listen to the indecent things.

345
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,480
My drum play is to remind you all these.

346
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,160
We know playing drum too.

347
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,520
We can sing!

348
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,920
Hi!

349
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,480
Get ready the lion.

350
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,180
Yes.

351
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,880
Isn't our neighbour shop opening today?

352
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,080
Why don't they have any ceremony?

353
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,120
Yes, no ceremony is held.

354
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
That's a female lion.

355
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,600
It's a bitchy lion! So bitchy!

356
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,520
Master, it's time to worship our ancestors.

357
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,040
Ah So, you take care of here,

358
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,520
I am going to worship the ancestors.

359
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
OK, I have got it.

360
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,760
Hey man, I want it.

361
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,520
Help yourself.

362
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,520
Congratulation!
Wish you all the best.

363
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,520
Thank you!

364
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,920
Master, there is a guest for you.

365
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,520
Aunt San, serve the guest.

366
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,920
Mister So, here you are!

367
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,640
Mass Tar Wong, you have recruited
so many female students.

368
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,160
It's hard to teach the girls Kung-fu.

369
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,520
Students?
I only know how to teach females.

370
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,800
I am not interested in teaching boys.

371
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,520
Mass Tar Wong, how humble are you!

372
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,800
No, I mean it, I will teach them
how to be good hookers!

373
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,760
What? A brothel?

374
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Heung Chi Kun?

375
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,680
Damn!
Po Chi Lam is opened next to a brothel.

376
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,000
The ancestors will get angry too!

377
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,960
Master, shit!

378
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,300
- What?
- Yes.

379
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,200
Pick up the spirit tablets at once.

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
This is a brothel.

381
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,720
Ah Fu!
Ah So!

382
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Master!

383
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,480
Mass Tar Wong, yours...

384
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,520
It is a high classed amusement night club.

385
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

386
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
But you haven't asked me for details.

387
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,520
Ah So,
why didn't you inquire the details first?

388
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,520
I am sorry, I forgot to tell them.

389
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,880
I am sorry, I will move
right after I find another place.

390
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,520
Don't maybe, I won't take any rent,
let me provide catering, OK?

391
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,800
Master Wong...

392
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,560
Master...

393
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,680
You are losing my face, you know?

394
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
I will talk to you later!

395
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,680
What are you going to tell me?

396
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,520
I don't think you are so foolish.

397
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,080
Master Wong is so angry that,
please ask mercy for me later.

398
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,560
I do want him to take me as student!

399
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,440
Is he your friend?

400
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,040
No.

401
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,960
Who are you?

402
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
How can you talk like this?

403
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,920
Damn it.

404
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
You are not righteous!

405
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
I am not lucky to be Wong's student.

406
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
So, just forget it.

407
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
Mass Tar, is she a hooker too?

408
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,040
What's her price?

409
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,480
Damn you!

410
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
She is my God-sister.

411
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,640
Woo, she is beautiful!

412
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
Let me try first.

413
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
Miss, are you a student?

414
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,840
I am Ah So.

415
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,440
I am Ah Fu.

416
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,520
Are they your friends?

417
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't know them at all.
Who are you?

418
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,500
Go!

419
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
How can you be so impolite, I wanna beat...

420
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,520
How can you beat your sister-in-law?

421
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,800
How do you know she will be your wife?

422
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I don't know, I will discuss with
my little brother first.

423
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Who is your little brother?

424
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,920
After drinking this nutritious medicine,
they can't hear.

425
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,520
The company which sell this medicine
refuses to be responsible.

426
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,520
So, we decided to report to the police.

427
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,640
But, it's not the most important thing!

428
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,040
First of all, to treat these kids first.

429
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,960
I will give them a treatment,

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,640
if it doesn't work, come back to me again.

431
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,640
The foreigners are aiming for money!

432
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
It's too bad to sell such harmful medicine!

433
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,120
The foreigners come a long way to China,

434
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,520
they just want
to earn large sum of money from us

435
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
What gentlemen, what democracy or freedom,

436
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,520
are all excuses for them to cheat money.

437
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,800
We have to strengthen ourselves,
so as to have better future.

438
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,960
Master Wong, we'd better leave now.

439
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,560
Please.

440
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,580
Hey, let's go.

441
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
They are deaf, they can't hear you.

442
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,240
Yes.

443
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Let's go.

444
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Please.

445
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Ah So, Ah Fu!

446
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,520
I am coming.

447
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,760
- Master!
- Master!

448
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,960
It's pay day.

449
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,040
Fu, you first.

450
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
Your salary is 8.5 taels.

451
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
After minus your lunch fee,

452
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,760
only 6 taels are left.

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,040
Thank you master.

454
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Ah Fu, your clothes are getting old.

455
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,920
Take these 2 taels and by some new ones.

456
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
Thank you master.

457
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,520
How lucky!

458
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
My clothes are getting old too.

459
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
Ah So, your salary is 7.5 taels,

460
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,600
plus the cleaning fee, that is 4.3 taels,

461
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,640
you will get 11.8 taels,

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,840
I won't be that mean, why not round it up?

463
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,600
Make it 12 taels, OK?

464
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,160
OK, but you borrowed 7 taels from me.

465
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,520
And you cheated my money twice in buying food.

466
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,520
You have taken 13.8 taels already.

467
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,440
You owe me 2 taels.

468
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,520
It'd be 1.8 taels,

469
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
You said you are not mean!

470
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
I will lend you 2 taels.

471
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,520
Don't waste it.

472
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,480
Thank you, Master.

473
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,240
Don't go to the next door.

474
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,960
How can we afford to go there?

475
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
Ask all the juniors come in.

476
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,520
Here come the hens.

477
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
Go, go, make it the other day.

478
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Hold it.

479
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Master, please take it,
I come to join your Kung-fu teaching school.

480
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
I am not a good teacher,
so I dare not take you as student.

481
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,760
No, I wish to be your student!

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,040
If you take me as your student,

483
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,520
I will be responsible for all your expenses.

484
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,720
I am busy, I have no time to teach you Kung-fu.

485
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,600
Are you kidding? Listen to me.

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,760
Just teach me something,
I will be satisfied then.

487
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,640
In fact, I have learnt some Kung-fu.

488
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,440
Say, Tiger stance, Crane stance
and sissy stance!

489
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
I have learnt some of it.

490
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,520
You are that great,
it needs no further learning.

491
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,520
That's different, I want to improve myself.

492
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,600
Do you insist to listen the truth?

493
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes...

494
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,080
I won't take a pimp to be a student.

495
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,520
You operate a brothel next to my school
and you didn't inform me.

496
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,520
You make me lose face!

497
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,200
If I take you as my student,

498
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,520
should I call you Mass Tar (Master)?

499
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,480
So, you are the master of Mass Tar!

500
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,240
Why don't you practise now?

501
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,120
Don't you allow me to piss?

502
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,520
Hope you won't come to our school again.

503
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,080
Master Wong.

504
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,880
Take back your hens.

505
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,560
They love hens, I guess, none is left.

506
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,920
I am sorry, I can't help.

507
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Come and discuss later.

508
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
I charge 10 taels for that.

509
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
What are you talking?

510
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,160
Play the Tiger and Crane stance now.

511
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,460
Come

512
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,160
Coming...

513
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
What are you doing?

514
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,160
You will be killed,
if you play like this during fighting.

515
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Master, won't be that bad next time.

516
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
I am not bad! But you!

517
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,520
Yes! It's fine.

518
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Ah Fu

519
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes

520
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,460
I am now going out, lock the door.

521
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,520
Master, isn't it necessary?

522
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,420
Why?

523
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,480
Do practise the Kung-fu.

524
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
No one should step out of here.

525
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,560
Don't go to the next door, got me?

526
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,600
Master, trust us, I will keep an eye on them.

527
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,440
You needn't lock the door.

528
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,520
I am not trusting you only!

529
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,000
I have been beaten by master for you all.

530
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,600
What are you going to appreciate for it?

531
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,040
Damn!

532
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,440
Stop sighing please!

533
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,480
I think, I am not that lucky enough
to be Wong's student.

534
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,440
We can stay for a while.

535
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
We have to leave soon.

536
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,480
Luckily I built a secret passage
between 2 houses.

537
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,120
It's for the convenient sake of the sugar daddies.

538
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,280
But our master is not a suggar daddy at all.

539
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,440
Otherwise, we will make him join us.

540
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,120
Shit, tell me which man is not fond of woman?

541
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,120
Right!

542
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,760
Our master is so decent!

543
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,360
I don't think so,
he hasn't met the one he loves, right?

544
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,160
Let Chor Hung and Miss Nine seduce him.

545
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
If he is not tempted, I will cut myself.

546
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,800
Which part will you cut?

547
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,400
My tits.

548
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
Save it for your sons.

549
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,920
If you want to bet, let's bet for 10 taels.

550
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,400
I don't think you can seduce my master.

551
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
He is not easily be tempted.

552
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,800
I won't give it a damn.

553
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,680
Do you have money?

554
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,320
You have, haven't you?

555
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,180
Me?

556
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,960
Just collect the debt tomorrow.

557
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:36,920
10 taels!

558
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,400
Hurry up. Work hard!
Please help!

559
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,920
Come and help, come on...

560
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,320
What are you looking?

561
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,440
Why do you hide a woman inside the box?

562
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,760
Are you abducting?

563
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,800
None of your business, go away.

564
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,560
Why are you fighting?

565
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,000
Sir, I am glad to see you here.

566
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,760
They hide a woman inside the box
and want to smuggle her away.

567
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,440
It's abduction!

568
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,540
- Really? Let me take a look.
- Yes

569
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,080
Fine.

570
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,880
Where is she?
Where has she gone?

571
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,840
Fu,
I know you always make trouble in the pier.

572
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,800
Since you are the student of Wong Fei-hong,

573
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,800
so you abuse his name to do bad deeds here!

574
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,960
Are you blackmailing them?

575
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,880
No, I didn't,
they did hide a woman inside the box.

576
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,040
Well,
why don't you open those boxes and check it.

577
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Fu, you want to ruin other's property?

578
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,800
Are you a poor learner,

579
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,760
or is Wong Fei-hong a poor master?

580
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,960
I can defeat you by single hand!

581
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,040
- Take him away.
- Yes

582
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,240
Ask Wong Fei-hong,
see how he teach the students.

583
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,940
Where is Ah Fu?

584
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,280
He has gone to the pier for work.

585
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,320
Listen, I've been searching
a suitable treatment for the deaf kids.

586
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,000
But, I have none improvement.

587
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
This medicine is a serious poison.

588
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,000
It will hurt the hearing system
if you drink too much of it.

589
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,720
I want to drink some,
to feel the effect.

590
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,440
How can you choose such a stupid way to test.

591
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,160
If it poisons you, it'd be shit.

592
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,120
Limited quantity would be alright.

593
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
Pay attention to me.

594
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
If you find that I can't hear clearly,
remind me at once.

595
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes, master.

596
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
Lock it properly.

597
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,800
He knows it is poisoned,
but he does want to drink it.

598
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,000
He may be losing his mind.

599
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,080
May be, he is lacking of something excited!
Say women!

600
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,440
That's why he has so many acnes on his face.

601
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,760
In fact, we give him two women, it's right.

602
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,280
We needn't feel guilty!

603
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,720
No guilty!

604
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,480
Hey, the women are coming.

605
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,640
- Yes.
- Hide up!

606
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,920
Master, 2 patients come to see you.

607
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,960
You know I never give treatment at noon.

608
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,800
Master, we come a long way here.

609
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,360
Please be merciful.

610
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
What's wrong with you?

611
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,960
Everyday, right at noon, and right at 4 a.m.

612
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,840
We feel itchy, from foot, and then to waist.

613
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
Then to the busts,

614
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,240
and to the head.

615
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,000
From head and then to the back.

616
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,600
And it goes downward, till...

617
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,240
There!

618
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,800
May I feel your pulse?

619
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,840
Fine.

620
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
Show me the wrist only.

621
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,200
I don't feel anything wrong about you.

622
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,120
But my heart beats quickly!

623
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,240
Me too,
why don't you listen to it, it's beating!

624
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,960
- Beating quickly, listen!
- What are you doing?

625
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,960
Listen to my heart beat!

626
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,800
There is difference between
Chinese and Western treatment.

627
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,440
Please dress up.

628
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,760
Master Wong.

629
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,800
Oh, they are the bitches from the next door.

630
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,160
I have to punish you.

631
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,160
I know what sickness you are having.

632
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,400
What is it?

633
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,720
Your blood stream doesn't go smoothly.

634
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
The joints go wrongly,
and the nerves are not in good order.

635
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
Really?

636
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,440
If you don't take treatment at once,

637
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,240
you may be cripple one day.

638
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,760
Kidding? How to get cured then?

639
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,720
Help! It hurts.

640
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,000
Please lower me down, please let us go.

641
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,920
Help, please let us go...

642
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
Are you feeling better?

643
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,720
Very good, we are fine, please let us go.

644
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
So long! I am dying!

645
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,440
No, we don't want treatment anymore.

646
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Tell me, who instructed you to be here?

647
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,440
Don't!

648
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,960
If you don't tell me, I will...

649
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,040
Oh, you love hookers too!

650
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,800
I can't tell from your appearance.

651
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,040
Don't misunderstand.

652
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
They are patients.

653
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Men always love women.

654
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,240
You shouldn't be shy.

655
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,440
Anyway, the brothel is right next to you.

656
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
It's convenient to call for hookers.

657
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,920
You...

658
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,620
Fu.

659
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,080
What's the matter?

660
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,720
He, he framed me.

661
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,800
Your students bullied others in the pier.

662
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,240
They didn't pay,
so he framed them to be kidnappers.

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,400
He beated others too.

664
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,800
But, it's lucky of him to meet me,

665
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,700
we are friends,

666
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
if only he didn't kill,

667
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,760
I would let him go.

668
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,960
Officer, if he committed any crimes,

669
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,800
I would not stop you punishing him.

670
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,000
A poor master, a poor student of course.

671
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,920
Master Wong, if you want to call
for hookers again, be careful.

672
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,800
I am leaving, so as not to stop you
from making fun.

673
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Hey, what do you mean?

674
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,920
You know what I mean.

675
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,480
I won't see you to the door.

676
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
A humble and righteous symbol?

677
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,200
It's broken.

678
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,200
Why don't you leave now?

679
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,920
I am sorry, Master Wong.

680
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,800
Go.

681
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't mean a mess.

682
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Go, go now.

683
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,800
Ah So, did you call them here?

684
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,880
I, in fact, actually, not at all, may be,
there is a chance...

685
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,840
Fine, fine!

686
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,800
See! I have warned you!

687
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,240
Damn, he said fine!

688
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,720
What a big trouble!

689
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Ah So is in trouble now.

690
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,400
He must be scolded by Master Wong.

691
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,720
Kidding, it's so noisy!

692
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,960
Master, how are you?

693
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,480
I am fine.

694
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,440
Fu, let's go and see the Kung-fu performance.

695
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Dear friends, my daughter and I
visit here for the first time.

696
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,400
Our money is used up,
so we want to perform for some money.

697
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,400
Hope you're generous to pay for our performance.

698
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,080
Dad, you perform stabbing in the throat first.

699
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,920
Young Master.

700
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,560
Hey, girl, it's nothing special!

701
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,800
What do you want?

702
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,600
Why don't you perform stabbing the tits?

703
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,360
I will pay you 100 taels if you perform this.

704
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
Dad, forget about him.

705
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,800
Should I lend you my stick?

706
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,960
Damn you!

707
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Help! Help!

708
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,400
Yin-er, it's enough.

709
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,040
Thank you for saving us.

710
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,400
You're welcome.

711
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,000
You are strangers, aren't you?

712
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,080
Right, we come from Shansi.

713
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,440
I am Wong Fei-hong,

714
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,600
you are Kung-fu masters,
why do you perform in street?

715
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,800
We're far from home,
in fact we don't wish to perform for money.

716
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,080
We are both inside the world of martial arts,
if you need money,

717
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,560
Master Wong, we perform only,
but we are no beggars.

718
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Thank you anyway.

719
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,960
Well, I won't push you.

720
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,920
If you have any needs,

721
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,400
come to Po Chi Lam.

722
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
Thank you.

723
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,400
Dad, Master Wong is a kind hearted man,

724
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,320
why are you treating him that cool?

725
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,400
It's a world filled with traps,
you can't trust anybody easily.

726
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,400
By the way, we come to find your sister
and those perverted monks.

727
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,880
Don't involve in any other business.

728
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,080
Dad, look! Nun-yan Temple.

729
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,600
Let's go in and have a look.

730
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,200
Don't go!

731
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,400
Do you wanna go?
I will beat you to death.

732
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,040
How dare you escape?

733
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,040
Help!

734
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,040
Save me!

735
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Nun-yan Temple is really suspicious!

736
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,400
Master, our Legate Officer from the
Holy Temple is long waiting.

737
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,400
Please forgive me.

738
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,600
Master Liu Hung, long time no see.

739
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,480
The Holy Master asked me to send
his regards to you.

740
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,400
I haven't seen him after I come to Canton.

741
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,400
How is his healthy?

742
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,600
He is fine.

743
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,320
But, the suppression from the government...,

744
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,400
...he is a little bit unhappy.

745
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,440
After the women are sold to South Asia,

746
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,680
we'll have much capital to use,
please ask Holy Master not to worry.

747
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,400
But 3 branch leaders of ours
are kept by the British in Hong Kong.

748
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,520
Really?

749
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,920
It's requested by the Ching Gov't,
we're going to save them.

750
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,360
Who is it?

751
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Super Kick, be careful!

752
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,720
Go now!

753
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,360
- Dad!
- Go now! Hurry up!

754
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,400
Damn it, where have those wolves gone?

755
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,320
No business at all!

756
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,920
I have to buy some food
to worship the God tomorrow.

757
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,560
You lost, undress now.

758
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,080
We only have clients who won't pay!

759
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,440
I have to take a rest!

760
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,520
Po Chi Lam!

761
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,840
Which sugar daddy comes that late?

762
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,000
Who is it? No one appears!

763
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,960
What's the matter?

764
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,560
What a perverted wolf! He is so anxious!

765
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,880
Let me have a look! Here comes...

766
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,520
a woman!

767
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,000
She is the girl we saw in this afternoon.

768
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,400
Help her up.

769
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,000
No hurt can be told from her body.
But her organs are hurt.

770
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Let me fetch her some pills.

771
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
Master Wong.

772
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,000
I want to see Master Wong.

773
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,920
I am Mass Tar Wong.

774
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,920
Not you,
I want to see Master Wong Fei-hong.

775
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,040
Right.
I am his student, Leung Fu.

776
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,760
Who beat you so seriously?

777
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,640
The perverted monks of Nun-yan Temple did it.

778
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,480
Nun-yan Temple?

779
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,040
Hey, please speak clearly.

780
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,560
Nun-yan Temple is a bad place,
the monks kidnapped the women.

781
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,840
And sell them to South Asia as hookers.

782
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,320
My younger sister has been caught by them
to Canton.

783
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,640
How do you know it?

784
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,960
I traced the clues and followed them
for 2 and a half years.

785
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,400
They are from a heresy.

786
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,720
They earn money from abduction.

787
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,520
My dad and I sneaked into Nun-yan Temple,
but we were hurt.

788
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,320
I don't know my dad is alive or not.

789
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,600
I have to tell Master now.

790
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,880
You are sick! It's a good chance,
we'd make good use of it.

791
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,400
- How?
- If we destroy the gang,

792
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,680
and make this an achievement of our Master,

793
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,400
Master will forgive us then.

794
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,640
You idiot! She is good in Kung-fu,
but she is seriously hurt!

795
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,440
If we go, we may be beaten to death.

796
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,000
We'd use our brain.

797
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,080
Call the cops at the right timing.

798
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,400
So they will be caught red-handed.
That's great!

799
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,440
Are there any traps inside the temple?

800
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
There is...

801
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,820
How can you come out to scare us
without any make-up?

802
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,900
We scared each once, let's break even.

803
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,780
Are we going to Nun-yan Temple now?

804
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,020
Are you afraid?

805
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,940
Sure, I am not good in Kung-fu.

806
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,380
If there is a fight, it means dangerous to me!

807
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Cause you're not good in Kung-fu
and you don't seem to be powerful.

808
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,300
If you are as strong as Ah Fu,

809
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,620
the monks will suspect us, right?

810
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,660
That's right.

811
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,380
Don't show up.

812
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,820
Watch Miss Nine and her.

813
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,340
You will achieve this time.

814
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,980
My Master will take you as student after that,
trust me.

815
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,500
Well, I have to take this risk then.

816
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,380
Ladies and Gentlemen,
are you coming for worshipping?

817
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,900
Our young masters have heard
that it's good to beg for marriage here.

818
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,060
So they come to beg for marriage.

819
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,380
It's wise of you,
our God will give believers good marriage.

820
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,380
I want pissing.

821
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,380
Please take him for pissing.

822
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,420
Coming.

823
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,380
Miss, please.

824
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,980
I feel someone watching us.

825
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,340
Me too, it seems to be horrible.

826
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,040
Yes.

827
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,060
Don't scare me.

828
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,540
A bad luck mark.

829
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,380
If you want to beg for marriage,
stay here for one night.

830
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,540
Tonight at 12 a.m.,
the marriage star will enter your life.

831
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,660
After receiving the spirit of it,
you will get good marriage.

832
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,300
To stay one night here?

833
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
She is great!

834
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,760
Isn't it?

835
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,020
Damn it.

836
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,380
Miss Nine.

837
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:05,980
It's a trap!

838
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,780
Are you leaving?

839
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,420
I am coming to help.

840
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,380
Why are you so clumsy?!

841
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,380
Why did you push him away?

842
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,540
I am sorry, I will make it sharp next time.

843
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,380
One more, an easy one.

844
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,940
Hand this to me. You guy save the girls.

845
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,380
- Alright
- Give you a fist.

846
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,380
Ah Fu, Ah So, come out and serve the tea.

847
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,080
Please!

848
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,900
Where are the kids? They should be blamed.

849
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,380
Uncle Cheung, take a seat please.

850
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,060
Thank you.

851
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,420
Ah Fu, Ah So!

852
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,420
Master Wong, may be they have gone for a walk.

853
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,580
I have told them not to go out.

854
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,420
They love fooling around and fighting.

855
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,380
They may murder someone one day.

856
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,720
Master Wong!

857
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,520
Master Wong!

858
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,620
Master Wong!

859
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,900
I remember you, you are the one
who performed Kung-fu in the street.

860
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,340
Yes, Ah Fu and Ah So have gone to
Nun-yan Temple.

861
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,340
What?

862
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Are you dying? Go to hell!

863
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,900
Shit!

864
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,700
What are you laughing? We are all tied.

865
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,380
We are civilized, let's forget fighting.

866
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,500
But peace!

867
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,780
I tell you, I will take revenge!

868
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,540
Let's stay in peace.

869
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,900
May I stop?

870
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,800
Why do you still hit me?
I have stopped!

871
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,940
What is it?

872
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,380
Arrest them.

873
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,380
Flying Tiger and Crane!

874
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:36,740
Master.

875
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,740
Wong Fei-hong.

876
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,500
Run for our lives!

877
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,300
Master...

878
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,060
Do you still treat me as your Master?

879
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,380
Miss Nine has been caught by them.

880
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,540
Where is Miss Nine?

881
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,860
Over the sacrificial stage.

882
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,860
Bring me there!

883
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,820
Where is the sacrificial stage?
Tell me.

884
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,300
It's over there.

885
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,300
Go.

886
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,380
What are you doing?

887
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,500
To save her from the trap.

888
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,060
You know it's a trap.

889
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,620
If three of us all go in,

890
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,820
once the door is shut, how can we get out?

891
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,500
You are right.

892
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,620
Stay here!

893
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,220
Yes.

894
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,520
Go!

895
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,820
Master Wong!

896
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,380
Wong Fei-hong, you offend our God.

897
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,780
Our God will punish you.

898
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,660
Why don't you kneel down?

899
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,820
You swindlers!

900
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,780
You misuse the God's name for abduction.

901
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,820
Wong Fei-hong, you are sinful!

902
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,460
I am now giving you a way out.

903
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,660
I will recruit you as student.

904
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,860
Confess now.

905
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,380
What? Let me send you to hell!

906
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,020
Shao Lin Fists?

907
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,100
We are from the same school,
so we are schoolmates.

908
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,260
How can you beat your schoolmates?

909
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,940
We are from the same school,
but you are a bad student.

910
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,940
Master Wong.

911
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,420
No-shadow Kick from Fu-shan.

912
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,340
Wong Fei-hong, you said it's No-shadow Kick.

913
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,180
Can't Wong Fei-hong tell lies?

914
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,220
Stupid!

915
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,260
No-shadow Kick from Fu-shan!

916
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,980
Wong Fei-hong, you are cocky,
I won't let you go.

917
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,860
You hate me telling lies,
you hate me telling truth too,

918
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,940
it's really difficult to serve you!

919
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,500
It's my turn.

920
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,860
This is for Miss Nine.

921
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,300
This is for Ah So.

922
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,940
This is for Beggar So.

923
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,020
Who is Beggar So?

924
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,460
I don't know who is Beggar So too.

925
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,460
I know I am a good boxer until now.

926
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,960
- Search every inch of it.
- Yes.

927
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,100
Your Excellency.

928
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,580
Master Wong, I am pleased that you are OK.

929
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,380
Dad, why does Wong Fei-hong
stay with the man who hurt us?

930
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,020
There must be something wrong.

931
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,520
- Let's go.
- Yes.

932
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,140
The monks are hooked with the government.

933
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,380
It's wise that we didn't trust Wong Fei-hong.

934
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,100
I think we'd better leave now.

935
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,580
Your Excellency, there are many women
kidnapped inside the temple.

936
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,940
Please send them home.

937
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:49,940
Women?

938
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,980
Are you kidding?

939
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,060
Those 2 perverted monks
have almost caught Miss Nine.

940
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,180
But the master of this temple
reported to the police station that,

941
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,340
he said that you came to mess up the temple.

942
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,380
What?

943
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,180
Please give us a fair trial.

944
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,300
It's a base of abduction,
how can he frame us of messing up?

945
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,500
You used to mess up in the pier,

946
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,260
therefore, I trust him more this time.

947
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,940
Master Wong, although we are friends,

948
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,060
but, it's my duty, I can't help you always.

949
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,900
You'd better ask those girls
who are kept inside the sacrificial stage.

950
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,100
Sir, there are only injured monks,

951
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,580
we have found no woman.

952
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,180
How dare you mess up the temple!

953
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,020
You hurt the monks and
ruin the reputation of the monks.

954
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,620
I know you are a great Kung-fu master,

955
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,620
but you should behave yourself!

956
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,380
Ah So, what did he say?

957
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,980
Are you kidding?
He shouted and he almost made me deaf!

958
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,620
Can you hear that?

959
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,620
Sir, Wong Fei-hong hurt 46 monks.

960
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,940
Most of them are seriously hurt.

961
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,340
Many may became cripple.

962
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,940
The temple is seriously damaged,
it needs to be repaired.

963
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,460
Please give us a fair trial.

964
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,940
My reputation is ruined by this rascal.

965
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,980
Hope you would help the innocent monks.

966
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,940
You hide so many dressless girls,
how dare you claim you're framed?

967
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,380
Yes, we went for worshipping,

968
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,220
A monk sneaked in and wanted to rape me.

969
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,520
Me too.

970
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,940
So, where are the women
and where are the monks?

971
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,300
Sir, the Nun-yan Temple is filled with traps
and they're heresy.

972
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,100
I saw the women being abducted
are kept in the temple.

973
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,940
So I have to self defend.

974
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,340
They have the freedom to worship their own god.

975
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,300
But you've no proof to say they are abductors.

976
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,500
Wong, I can't help you this time.

977
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,900
Master, he didn't help you.

978
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,060
Don't you think I am deaf?

979
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,220
Well, I decided,

980
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,460
defend Wong Fei-hong now.

981
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,300
No, how can we demonstrate
the lion dance tomorrow?

982
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,460
Master, they are framing you.

983
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,700
Shut up.

984
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,220
I would like to leave for a while,
all of you stay here.

985
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,320
- Sir.
- Sir.

986
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,380
You come to bail Wong Fei-hong?

987
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,300
Sir, 4 commercial associations
would like to bail Wong.

988
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,460
Hope you would let him go.

989
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,980
After the celebration, we'll investigate
this case and find out the truth.

990
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,460
If you think 4 associations are not enough,

991
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:38,020
we may ask Mr. Sasin, the manager of the
13 companies to bail him.

992
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,380
Are you threatening me with the British?

993
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,620
After careful consideration,

994
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,940
since Wong is bailed by
4 commercial associations,

995
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,940
and the case is really suspicious,

996
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,860
I decided to defend the master
and the monks of Nun-yan temple.

997
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,940
Wong is temporarily released.

998
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,940
I will investigate the case
and the final trial will be held later.

999
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,140
Sir, we are innocent.

1000
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,860
Master, we can go for the lion dance tomorrow.

1001
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,040
Bravo!

1002
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,060
What's happened?

1003
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,940
The men from the commercial association
come and help.

1004
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,300
I don't think it's easy to frame him.

1005
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,100
They want him to give lion dance!

1006
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,300
Well, I'll make him lose face then.

1007
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,340
Give the medicine to Wong Fei-hong.

1008
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,940
So, let's forget those few hundred taels
which you owe me.

1009
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,540
No, I can't do this.

1010
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,640
No?

1011
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,900
I will take you to prison then.

1012
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,940
Thus you will suffer something more than death!

1013
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,500
Hurry up...

1014
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,580
Our pyramid lion dance will make them all eyes!

1015
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,420
Have the tea please.

1016
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,100
Why the tea is a little bit sour?

1017
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,100
Really?

1018
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,140
May be the tea leaves are expired,
I will ask Uncle Fok to buy some.

1019
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,940
He must buy some cheap leaves!

1020
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:30,100
Well, Mr. Wong Fei-hong
gives the puppet a real life.

1021
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,940
It looks like a real lion!

1022
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,220
What? You said he is a liar?

1023
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,020
No, a real lion!

1024
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,940
He said Wong is a liar!

1025
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,180
What'll we do now?

1026
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,140
It's a big day today, don't arrest Wong
although he is a liar.

1027
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,940
I think so.

1028
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,300
Lions pyramid!

1029
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,900
Forward!

1030
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,780
Bravo! You're great!

1031
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,600
- On the shoulders.
- Yes.

1032
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:21,900
Wonderful!

1033
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,700
Oh, cockroaches!

1034
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,300
Be careful!

1035
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:52,860
It's so tricky!

1036
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,420
Are you kidding!

1037
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:09,940
Moving of centipede.

1038
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,740
Swing!

1039
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,180
Master, the centipede is really tricky.

1040
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,260
Centipede dance is some hex from the North.

1041
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,700
It's very dangerous, you'd be careful.

1042
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,860
Kidding!

1043
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,740
Get the bait.

1044
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,440
Bravo!

1045
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,780
Watch the kick!

1046
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,260
Why can't master follow the beat of the drum?

1047
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,320
Let me do it!

1048
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,380
Step back!

1049
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,940
Watch my stance.

1050
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,380
What are you doing? Stop!

1051
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,980
Congratulations!

1052
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,300
The centipede can start the fire!

1053
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,060
Master, you'd think something to defeat
the centipede.

1054
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,100
Make use of this chance to teach him a lesson.

1055
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,780
Cut the crap, let's fight one by one.

1056
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:26,020
Master Wong, don't go.

1057
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,020
So what?

1058
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,820
The master of Nun-yan Temple,

1059
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,820
has just committed suicide in the prison.

1060
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,940
It'll arouse bad feeling from the public
if the news is announced.

1061
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:42,260
Master Wong, you'd discuss it
with the government.

1062
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:44,960
Your Excellency.

1063
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,260
I can't hear what you are talking about.

1064
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,820
I am deaf.

1065
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,220
They are coming out.

1066
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,420
Please.

1067
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,780
I have come to a conclusion with Master Wong.

1068
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,100
He has a problem of hearing,
so I will announce it to you now.

1069
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:35,780
Since Master Wong is the coach
of the local militia,

1070
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:40,060
if we charge him destroying the temple
and killing the master,

1071
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,460
it'll bring all of us a difficult problem
in handling the case with justice.

1072
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,300
So Master Wong'll leave here for a while.
He'll go back to Fu-shan.

1073
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,780
Po Chi Lam will be attached by the government.

1074
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,300
No one should enter.

1075
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,300
You are lying!

1076
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,300
Master won't leave Po Chi Lam.

1077
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,180
- Shut up.
- That is our home.

1078
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,780
Listen to me.

1079
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,180
I have decided.

1080
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,820
I can't hear what you are talking, but...

1081
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,060
I hope you will remember
what I am going to talk.

1082
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:09,660
Master...

1083
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,660
Master Wong!

1084
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,100
His Excellency tells the truth.

1085
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,060
Master!

1086
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,380
Damn you bastard,
how dare you attach Po Chi Lam!

1087
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,700
I will sue you with all my best.

1088
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,260
I forgot to tell you,

1089
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,060
you operate the indecent nightclub,
we have got proof,

1090
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,180
the government is going to
attach your business too.

1091
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,300
From tomorrow onwards, no business!

1092
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,300
I don't think you can make a dead set at me.

1093
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,300
Let's wait and see.

1094
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,020
Master Wong, I am busy, see you.

1095
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,780
You will be busy,

1096
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,220
Busy for your family's funerals.

1097
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,780
Ah So, pack some clothes for me.

1098
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,180
I am leaving.

1099
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,700
I don't want to drag you down.

1100
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,020
The government wants to go against me only.

1101
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,700
We are not capable to fight with them.

1102
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,060
Let's wait a better chance for counter attack.

1103
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,700
I will go back to Fu-shan to cure my ears.

1104
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,380
Stay here, don't do anything impulsively.

1105
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,220
I am sorry, Master.

1106
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,300
You are a man, don't cry.

1107
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,700
He cries too.

1108
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,980
It's different,

1109
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,460
he can't be counted as man.

1110
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,780
What am I then?

1111
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,300
Master.

1112
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,700
Fu, don't argue with anyone in the pier.

1113
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,780
You'd take care of your buddies.

1114
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:36,900
Yes.

1115
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,780
Master.

1116
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,180
Take care!

1117
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:04,980
Take care!

1118
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,380
Anybody here?

1119
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,300
Miss Ti, it's me, Wong Fei-hong.

1120
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,540
You are shameless.

1121
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,060
Miss Ti, I can't hear you.

1122
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,580
Are you still acting?

1123
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,820
Dad.

1124
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:08,980
Don't get mad.

1125
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,460
He hooks with the bastard officials,
there must be trap.

1126
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,860
Master Wong, we have left Canton.

1127
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,540
Would you let us go?

1128
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,940
I... I can't hear what you are talking about.

1129
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,580
I am deaf.

1130
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,380
He mistook the medicine, so he becomes deaf.

1131
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,780
Are there any tricks?

1132
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,020
His pulse is abnormal,
it is the symptom of being poisoned.

1133
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,380
I have treated some patients
who got blind and deaf in Shansi.

1134
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,420
Let's take research, hope it would cure you.

1135
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,700
I have thought some possible solutions too.

1136
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,060
But, it's hard for a doctor to cure himself.

1137
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,380
If you can help, that's good.

1138
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,860
My solution, "3 needles shooting",
it's difficult to do it myself.

1139
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,740
To stab 3 needles into the body
at the same time.

1140
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,420
So I need your help.

1141
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,460
Come and buy duster! It's cheap.

1142
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:09,540
Fat hens!

1143
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,540
It's cheap!

1144
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,340
How much does the hen cost? Mr. Pimp.

1145
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,540
Don't call me Mr. Pimp,

1146
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,380
I'm Mass Tar Wong.
30% off if you call me Mass Tar Wong.

1147
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,340
Idiot

1148
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,860
You are insane.
If you scold me, I will beat you.

1149
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,460
Brother, we'd better not to quarrel with them.

1150
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,980
No matter how, I am a famous pimp.

1151
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:26,860
Mr. Pimp.

1152
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,380
Damn you!

1153
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,420
How dare you beat the officers?
Are you looking for trouble?

1154
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,380
I don't know it's you.

1155
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,980
Don't sell right here! Get lost.

1156
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,540
What do you mean?

1157
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,900
You always give us trouble.

1158
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,980
You just forbid us to sell here!
What do you mean?

1159
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,300
Cause you offend Mr. Lui,
he instructed me to give you hard time.

1160
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,380
If you don't go, I will beat you.

1161
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,380
I am scared! What is law and order?

1162
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,460
If you dare hitting me right here,

1163
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,340
I will eat up all feathers.

1164
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,980
Don't quarrel with him.
What'll we do now?

1165
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,980
Hi, you look poor!

1166
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,500
I come a long way to search for you.

1167
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,380
Lui Yat Siu wants to make a dead set as us,

1168
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,380
so we can't earn a living in Canton.

1169
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,540
I have found a job in a brothel of Hong Kong,

1170
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,380
you are the No.1 pimp,
why don't you start your career in HK?

1171
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,740
But we don't have the travelling expense.

1172
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,380
I earned hardly for limited travelling expense.

1173
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,620
So I can't help you two.

1174
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,380
If you can get some money, come to me,
let's go together to HK.

1175
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,380
What'll we do?

1176
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,860
Nothing can do, we have no money!

1177
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,660
Hey, I've some golds hidden in Heung Chi Kun.

1178
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:37,980
Come on...

1179
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,500
It would be shit if we are discovered.

1180
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,060
It's dark here, no one would discover us.

1181
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,580
When this house was under construction,

1182
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,020
the Fung-shui master told me
to hide gold under the poles.

1183
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,940
There are 10 taels of gold hidden.

1184
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,780
Once get it, we'll have enough money
to go to Hong Kong, come on.

1185
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,380
Will it be taken by the workers
who did the decoration?

1186
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,860
What a big mouth!

1187
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,300
Here is the pole.

1188
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,700
Where is she going?

1189
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,700
I thought I have killed her,
but she disappeared.

1190
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,900
Master would punish us if he knows it.

1191
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,040
- Search now.
- OK.

1192
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:24,020
- Will she run to the street?
- Let's go out and have a look.

1193
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,380
Don't make any noise,
or we'd be in deep shit.

1194
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,320
Sorry.

1195
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:39,380
Many girls... are kept next door.
Go and save them.

1196
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,780
They will be shipped...

1197
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,380
...to South Asia...

1198
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,700
Those bastards lock the girls in Po Chi Lam.

1199
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,620
Go and save them...

1200
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,020
- How are you?
- How are you?

1201
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,860
Stay here, I would take a look.

1202
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:53,940
Don't!

1203
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,460
It doesn't matter, if she tells the truth,

1204
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,860
I would sue them.

1205
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,180
No! Don't go!

1206
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:59,580
Wake up.

1207
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:17,300
Master Liu Hung,
Wong's students could do nothing now.

1208
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,060
But I have found that,
Wong didn't go back to Fu-shan.

1209
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,740
He hides up in a village near by,
staying with the Kung-fu performers.

1210
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,380
3 days later, the 13 companies will hold
the stone-laying ceremony.

1211
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,380
We have to kidnap their manager Sasin.

1212
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,620
Will Wong Fei-hong bother us?

1213
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,900
In order to be safe,

1214
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,660
I have sent someone to kill him.

1215
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,900
He is deaf, he can't escape.

1216
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:46,700
That's good. Wong caught 3 branch
leaders of us for Ching Gov't.

1217
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,700
We have to kidnap Sasin.

1218
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,940
So the British will give Ching Gov't pressure
to release our buddies.

1219
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,620
Don't worry,

1220
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:56,500
the Express Dowager is paying attention to us.

1221
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,380
We will be treasured by her one day.

1222
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:03,340
So we will have great power
and control the whole country.

1223
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,980
Be careful not to disclose your real identity.

1224
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,660
Who knows it, will be killed.

1225
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,660
Who is it?

1226
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,380
It's you, Mr. Pimp.

1227
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,380
You attached Po Chi Lam and Heung Chi Kun
to keep girls!

1228
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:30,580
You bloody bastard!

1229
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:31,660
Bloody bastard?

1230
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,460
You have heard our talk? Haven't you?

1231
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,380
Master Wong would punish you two.

1232
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,580
Bastards!

1233
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,980
He is too nosy! Damn Wong Fei-hong,
he caught our buddies.

1234
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,980
So we should go against him.

1235
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,540
Are you coming to challenge me?

1236
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,780
Say Wong is a bastard,
then I will let you alive.

1237
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,020
OK, I say. Wong Fei-hong is a hero.

1238
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,940
Say, Wong Fei-hong is a bastard wolf.

1239
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,820
Long life to Wong Fei-hong.

1240
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,500
Say?

1241
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,980
Say, Wong is shameless.

1242
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,420
Wong is your dad.

1243
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,620
Don't you scare death?

1244
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,380
He is nothing worth,
but don't bother the neighbours.

1245
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,380
Fong, Yuen.
Dig a hole and bury him.

1246
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

1247
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,660
Let me show you to the door.

1248
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,780
You perverted monks.

1249
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,360
Mass Tar Wong!

1250
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:39,900
How do you feel?

1251
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,560
How are you?

1252
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,740
Go now.

1253
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,340
I am now sending you to hell,

1254
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,780
...to serve your master.

1255
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,380
Your crane is not as powerful as mine.

1256
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Hurt?

1257
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:06,640
Ah Fu.

1258
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,400
The Flying Tiger and Crane.

1259
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,160
Please stop!

1260
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:26,880
Let's take risk.

1261
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,160
What are you doing?

1262
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,200
Save Mass Tar!

1263
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,200
Hurry up!

1264
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,120
Brother, how are you?

1265
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,000
Inform Master Wong now.

1266
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,400
Lui has sent someone to murder him.

1267
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,680
He is seriously hurt,
let's send him for treatment first.

1268
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,800
There is no time left,
go and save Master Wong.

1269
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,760
Why not take to Master's home?

1270
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,480
Are you kidding?

1271
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,720
When did you become so clever?

1272
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,720
Watch him.

1273
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,120
I have discovered a big secret too.

1274
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,160
Don't tell us now.

1275
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,080
Why?

1276
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,560
It's common in the film that,

1277
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,480
once a person got hurt seriously,
he'd die after telling the secret.

1278
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:24,640
Cover the mouth...

1279
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,800
Master Wong!

1280
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,080
It's poor to be deaf.

1281
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:48,560
In fact you are handsome.
With good Kung-fu and strong enough.

1282
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
I wish I had a husband like you.

1283
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,880
It's good to marry you, right?

1284
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,160
Why are you laughing?
You are like a fool.

1285
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:04,480
Am I pretty?
Do you like me?

1286
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,800
You look silly!
It's useless even I am willing to marry you.

1287
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,480
Why are you still laughing?
Stupid.

1288
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,800
Yin-er, have you got the herb?

1289
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,440
Dad, it's ready.

1290
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,440
After taking these,
you will be totally cured.

1291
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,160
Thank you.

1292
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:23,880
Don't mention it.

1293
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,720
I am sorry for bothering you.

1294
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,120
It doesn't matter.

1295
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,480
Dad.

1296
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,440
What?

1297
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,400
Can he hear us?

1298
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,160
He has recovered two days ago.

1299
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,480
But he improves very much today.

1300
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,760
Where are you going?

1301
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,760
What a shame!

1302
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,520
What is she doing?

1303
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,440
Maybe, she feels happy for me.

1304
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,520
Master Wong!

1305
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,960
We will soon reach there.

1306
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,120
Master Wong!

1307
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,120
Master.

1308
01:25:59,400 --> 01:25:59,720
How is he?

1309
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,880
Go now.

1310
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,800
Lui Yat Siu attached
Po Chi Lam and Heung Chi Kun.

1311
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,680
In order to keep those women
and the perverted monks.

1312
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,680
He discovered this,
and was seriously beaten.

1313
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,040
Master Wong...

1314
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,440
He can't hear you.

1315
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,960
Why don't you show him a sincere eyesight,
with tears!

1316
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,480
This is your last chance.

1317
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,760
My master is mean and old fashioned.
Sometimes, he is cunning too.

1318
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,480
But, anyway, he is a good master.

1319
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,000
Get this chance to join his school.

1320
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,080
You understand me very much.

1321
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,760
Sure, I have strong observation ability.

1322
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,240
Can you listen?

1323
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,480
What do you think?

1324
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,400
Why don't you inform me first?

1325
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,520
You said I am cunning.

1326
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,020
I am sorry.

1327
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:38,880
The heaven will punish you.

1328
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,120
Punishment at once.

1329
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,600
Keep on shooting.

1330
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,480
Why do you leave a dying person here?
You bastards!

1331
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,560
Are you scared?
You have a red face.

1332
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,060
It's very hot!

1333
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,060
Who is it?

1334
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,720
Master Wong, Lui Yat Siu they...

1335
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,800
They have a secret mission.

1336
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,120
What is it?

1337
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:32,040
They plan to kidnap Sasin,

1338
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,600
on the anniversary celebration
of the 13 companies.

1339
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,480
What are they aiming at?

1340
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:44,480
They are from the Boxer Association,

1341
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,840
They want to trade Sasin
with their buddies who were caught.

1342
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:53,640
Master... I think I am dying.

1343
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,480
But I have a wish.

1344
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,880
I beg you, take me as your student.

1345
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,400
OK, I promise you.

1346
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,040
Leave with peace now.

1347
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,720
Master, I am still alive.

1348
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,400
Why did you freeze?

1349
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,600
I am tired, I want a rest.

1350
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,920
Damn you!

1351
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,800
What? Again?

1352
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,480
No, it's my ass... it's attacked by the arrow.

1353
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,400
Go and help Master, quick.

1354
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,520
Give me a weapon for self defense.

1355
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:57,520
Take it.

1356
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:59,480
I am dying.

1357
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,640
How can you give me such thing?

1358
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,480
You're too bad.

1359
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,160
I am scared!

1360
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,600
Don't be afraid.

1361
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,480
When I lie on you,
I feel like holding my sister.

1362
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,600
Just take me as your sister.

1363
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:39,660
Go.

1364
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,660
Arrest him.

1365
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,560
Get going!

1366
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,800
Stop chasing.

1367
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,960
Master, we can't stay here.

1368
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:10,920
Of course.

1369
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,520
What'll we do then?

1370
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:13,360
Go back to Canton,

1371
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,480
to fight with that centipede again.

1372
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,480
Sit down... Take a seat.

1373
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,040
Thank you.

1374
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,680
Do you want to watch the bait?

1375
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,480
It's a very good show. Exciting.

1376
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,120
Hi, John. Hi, David. You look fine.

1377
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,540
Hurry up!

1378
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:57,540
Stop.

1379
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,960
We come to report...

1380
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,520
You are not allowed to enter.

1381
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,480
What are you talking about?

1382
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,480
The centipede wants to kidnap Mr. Sasin.

1383
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,880
I don't know what you are talking about.

1384
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,160
The centipede is played the men
from the Boxer Association.

1385
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,480
Get lost, I know English.

1386
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,120
Ask your boss to leave at once.

1387
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,800
The centipede is very powerful.

1388
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:18,520
We come to save him.

1389
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,480
Give us $150,000 bonus.

1390
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,040
We don't want HK Bank cheque.

1391
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,040
But Holland Bank Cheque.

1392
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,480
Get them out of here.

1393
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,200
How are you?
Are you fine?

1394
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,560
How can you beat others in such brutal way?

1395
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,480
Cousin Robert!

1396
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,300
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Sure.

1397
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:36,920
What's the matter?

1398
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,020
I.. I...

1399
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,640
I am happy to see you here.

1400
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,960
What's the matter?

1401
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,080
The players of the centipede are
from the Boxer Association,

1402
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,040
they want to kidnap Mr. Sasin.

1403
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,240
Follow me.

1404
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,480
I will take you to see Mr. Sasin, hurry up.

1405
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,520
Luckily we meet cousin Robert.

1406
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,020
Freeze.

1407
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,000
Do you want to ruin Mr. Lui's plan?

1408
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,880
They're bad guys. Watch them.

1409
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,560
Wong Fei-hong?!

1410
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,480
He must be coming to save Mr. Sasin.

1411
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,480
Forget about him, go!

1412
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,280
Yes.

1413
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:54,480
The Swinging of Centipede.

1414
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,040
Turning of Centipede

1415
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,120
How dare you kill me?

1416
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,520
I kill whoever blocks my road to success.

1417
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:16,440
Damn you! You betrayed us?

1418
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,360
You shouldn't hit your cousin...

1419
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,080
Oh yes, I shouldn't hit my cousin...

1420
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,080
But I should hit my cousin hardly.
Go to hell.

1421
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,040
Your Kung-fu has improved.

1422
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,360
Master Wong taught me that.

1423
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,000
Wanna go?

1424
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:52,760
Lui Yat Siu.

1425
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:59,040
Damn you, but you can't hear me at all.

1426
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,720
You can't escape now.

1427
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,640
Wong, you always ruin my plan,

1428
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,560
you know, our God will punish you!

1429
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,040
China is suffering now,
you bastards still create internal troubles,

1430
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,560
I want to terminate you!

1431
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,040
Continuous Kicks?

1432
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,480
If I guess it correctly, you must be
Lui Fai of the Boxer Association.

1433
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,960
But, it's too late.

1434
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:31,940
Not late!

1435
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,960
No Shadow Kick.

1436
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,600
I know your No-shadow Kick is powerful.

1437
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,400
I do have preparation.

1438
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,040
Your toes are broken.

1439
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,400
How can you use your No-shadow Kick again?

1440
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,640
Wine can't give you guts!

1441
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,160
You promised your dad
not to drink any wine.

1442
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,280
Well, I will represent your dad
to punish you.

1443
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:06,200
You have asked me before,

1444
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,040
what kind of fist I am playing?

1445
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,480
Now, I am going to tell you.

1446
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,160
Isn't it Lui Tung Bun's Fist?

1447
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,160
No,

1448
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,560
it's Drunken disciples of God.

1449
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,360
What kind of stance is it?

1450
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,960
It's Han's Flute!

1451
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,540
Wrong!

1452
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,320
It's the Drunken Crane.

1453
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,280
Continuous Swinging Punches!

1454
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:09,900
Wrong again?

1455
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,600
I seldom drink wine,

1456
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:02,120
because I can't stop giving heavy punches
if I get drunk.

1457
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:05,540
Really?

1458
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,200
The punch is not heavy enough.

1459
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,240
Drunken Tiger, to catch the wolf!

1460
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,240
Are you drunken or not?

1461
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:49,360
It doesn't matter to be drunken or not.

1462
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,080
Drunken Fist? Great!

1463
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,040
You look awful!

1464
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:57,940
I want you to cry.

1465
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,640
Laugh now.

1466
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,960
Thank you.
Master Wong, thank you.

1467
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:42,600
You are bad egg too.

1468
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,680
If you sell the harmful medicine again,
I will teach you a lesson.

1469
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,180
OK...

1470
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,260
Master Wong.

1471
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,600
You may find your sister now.

1472
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,600
How can I find her in such a big world?

1473
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,120
Anyway,
I will treat Miss Nine as my sister.

1474
01:43:58,860 --> 01:43:59,700
Master Wong...

1475
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,520
I have been stepped by hundreds of people,
I am dying.

1476
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,480
I have a big secret to tell you.

1477
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,000
Damn!
