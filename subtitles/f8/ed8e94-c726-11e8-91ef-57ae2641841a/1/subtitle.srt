1
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,781
Your principle loan
was $75,000.

2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,848
Yes.

3
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,442
But after unpaid payments
and interest...

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:57,123
You owe a total of $210,308.

5
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,258
I see.

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,793
Do you understand?

7
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,090
Yes.

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,825
Anything else, sir?

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,227
No. You made me
all the more sure now.

10
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,994
Thank you.

11
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,139
Thanks for calling.

12
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,207
Happy Cash Private Loans.
Good day.

13
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:51,443
Kim's Island

14
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,552
Stupid.

15
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,054
Can't even die.

16
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,352
The 63 Building.
That'll kill me for sure.

17
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,132
What the!

18
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,870
What is this?

19
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,195
What's with this place?

20
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,075
It's... an island.

21
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,629
A ship!

22
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,274
Hey... Hey!

23
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,811
Over here!

24
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,185
Over here!

25
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,888
Help!

26
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,268
Over here!

27
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,828
Help me!

28
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:19,144
No! Not that!
Help! I'm stuck!

29
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,509
No! Don't go! Stop!

30
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,156
Stop! Please!

31
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,987
Come back, here!

32
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,839
What am I a castaway?

33
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,718
Yes! It's working!
It's on!

34
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,319
Not the battery!

35
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,730
911, how may I help you?

36
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,633
- Emergency?
- Yes.

37
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,933
Sorry to trouble you
when you're busy...

38
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:58,878
But... ah... I'm stuck
on a deserted island.

39
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,012
Pardon?

40
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,615
- A deserted island.
- A deserted island?

41
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,845
Yes, that's right.

42
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,385
What deserted island?

43
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,989
Well, this island is... ah...

44
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,449
I'm not sure
how you can get here.

45
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,093
It's the one on Han River.

46
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,530
- Han River?
- Yes, that's right.

47
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,865
- A deserted island?
- Yes, on Han River.

48
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,033
- Get out.
- Hello? Hello?

49
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,568
Hello?

50
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,746
Oh, no! The battery!

51
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,942
Su-jung. That's it!

52
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,082
Pick up! Please!

53
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,625
What?

54
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,961
- Hi, Su-jung.
- We agreed not to call each other.

55
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,131
I know hon.
But I'm stuck in a rut here.

56
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,268
Don't call me hon.
I'm so over you. Bye.

57
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,404
Su-jung! Don't hang up!
Please!

58
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,736
Su-jung? Is that you?

59
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,049
Su-jung! Su-jung?

60
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,150
Good afternoon.

61
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,854
This is SK Telecom.
Mr. KIM Sung-geun I presume?

62
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,223
Yes, but I'm a little busy now.

63
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,092
Really?
But we have a special offer

64
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,162
for our prime customers
like you.

65
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,564
Our new calling plan will...

66
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,569
It's urgent.
Please call 911 for me?

67
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,504
I'm stuck on a deserted island.

68
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,142
- A deserted island, sir?
- Yes, that's right!

69
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:42,715
Well, with our offer you can be
anywhere and make calls for only...

70
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:47,186
Wait! This is no joke!
I'm really stuck on an island!

71
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,922
The one on Han River!

72
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,491
I can see the 63 Building
from here!

73
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,361
And the National Assembly building!

74
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,296
I'm serious, here!

75
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:01,300
I'm running out of battery!
So call 911!

76
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,165
Help me!

77
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,787
I can do it.

78
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,557
I can make it.

79
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,106
I can do this!

80
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:58,020
It's okay.
I can do this!

81
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,907
I can do this...

82
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,512
I can do this...

83
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,676
Dad!

84
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,839
Stop floundering!
That's why you're sinking!

85
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,249
Tread water with your arms.

86
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,013
Everyone else can do it!
Why can't you?

87
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,721
Tread water like the other boys!

88
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,290
Like this!

89
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,205
Aren't you a little old
for this job?

90
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,207
Your TOEIC score's only 700?

91
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,476
Why'd you quit your old job?

92
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,773
The company...

93
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,103
restructuring...

94
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,274
It went bankrupt!

95
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,379
I'm sorry!

96
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,760
Su-jung!

97
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,733
I know, I'm mean.

98
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,897
But hon...

99
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,939
Being mean or incapable,
you know what's worse?

100
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,409
I can't do this.

101
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,306
We're through.

102
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,809
Su-jung!

103
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,253
Su-jung!

104
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,519
Fast and easy loans like shopping.

105
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,555
Fast and easy loans like shopping.

106
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,898
Don't lose hope.

107
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,561
Fast and easy loans.
Happy & Cash.

108
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,823
Stupid.

109
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,932
Getting out of here
won't change anything.

110
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,393
Attention citizens.

111
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,558
This is the
Civil Defense Corps...

112
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,531
Civil Defense training.

113
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,105
Maybe I should
kill myself after.

114
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,266
Salvia flowers.

115
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,907
I haven't tried it
in a hundred years.

116
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,451
So sweet.

117
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:14,626
So sweet... I could cry.

118
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,821
I guess I can die anytime later.

119
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,605
It's not so bad.

120
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,585
It's delicious!

121
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,656
The water's great!

122
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:03,303
Who cares if I die eating this?
That wouldn't be so bad.

123
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,912
Everything's A-okay.
Life suddenly got easier.

124
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,690
Come on.

125
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,824
Come on!

126
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,829
Just a bit more!

127
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,972
It's working! Yes!

128
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,970
Damn it.

129
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,872
They're all lies.

130
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,320
So boring.

131
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,864
Social Security Card
KIM Sung-geun

132
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,388
Are you happy?

133
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,137
A delinquent credit card.

134
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,974
Also delinquent.

135
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,176
This one, too.

136
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,307
And this...

137
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,252
A gold delinquent card.

138
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,176
Can't you hear me!

139
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,885
Anyone!

140
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,946
Can't you see me!

141
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,848
Look!

142
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:31,923
Call this delinquent, huh!

143
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,221
This ain't delinquent!

144
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,594
I'm living fine without
those damn cards!

145
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,936
After 7 years of saving up
for a house...

146
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,200
I finally got my own place.

147
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,540
The duck nestles me.

148
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,409
I am an ugly duckling...

149
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,415
that became a slug
rather than a swan.

150
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,085
Just an ugly duckling...

151
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:56,693
Almost there!
Just a bit further!

152
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:13,151
I need some protein, guys.

153
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,778
Gotcha!

154
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,059
Freeze. Don't move.

155
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,254
It'll be over quick and harmless.

156
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:32,504
How can you all be so selfish!

157
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,769
Shut up bird!

158
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,603
Damn bird!

159
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,915
I'm eating it.

160
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,349
I can do this.

161
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:19,644
Kentucky Fried Chicken,
'Finger-lickin' good'.

162
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:23,273
Thanks for droppin' in.

163
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,481
Damn, that's hot.

164
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,783
Hot! Hot!

165
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,405
Birds taste better than fish.

166
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:57,003
Perhaps evolution is the process
of becoming tastier.

167
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,794
So bored.

168
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,433
Nothing else like it.

169
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,702
The perfect boredom.

170
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,347
'Blue bear' went shopping
yesterday.

171
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,518
Chanel pumps.

172
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:10,981
Save as

173
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,238
I bought 'em at the mall.
Aren't they pretty?

174
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,102
There's no need to go
outside my room.

175
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,839
With a few clicks,
everything can be mine, easily.

176
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,194
It doesn't matter
if it's real or not.

177
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:27,761
The replies on my site
decide that.

178
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:41,404
Age, looks, jobs...
Anything's possible.

179
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,925
Are you awake?

180
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,818
Do you need anything?

181
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,822
Milk

182
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,465
Okay.

183
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,367
I'll be a little late, today.

184
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:18,544
Make sure you eat, okay?

185
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:42,207
Though I haven't been out
of my room in 3 years...

186
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,142
I keep strict rules here.

187
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,784
First, I get up
after Dad leaves at 8 a.m.

188
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,786
- Bye, dear.
- I'll be home late.

189
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,381
I get ready, then go outside.

190
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,698
172 calories for breakfast.

191
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,702
I put on 3000 steps
on the pedometer before 9 a.m.

192
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,205
I go to work at 9.

193
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,216
I clean.

194
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,297
I wait to go to the bathroom
till mom leaves at 12!

195
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,369
525 calories for lunch.

196
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,673
I put on 6000 steps to digest.

197
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,602
After some fresh air...

198
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,214
Ah... fresh air.

199
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,147
I plan a new life again
and work at self-improvement.

200
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,371
After finishing off at work,

201
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,740
I pursue my hobby.

202
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,447
Taking pictures of the moon.

203
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,625
I take pictures of the moon...

204
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,025
cuz there's no one there.

205
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:48,121
When there's no one,
you can't feel lonely.

206
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,331
Then I put on the last 1000
on my pedometer.

207
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,542
It's not for health reasons.

208
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,617
After putting on 10,000 steps,
I feel like I had a good, busy day.

209
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,350
It's an all-too-healthy
way of escapism.

210
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,198
- You're home.
- Hi.

211
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,065
I sleep when Dad gets home
at 9 p.m.

212
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,235
Actually, it's hypnotism,
not sleeping.

213
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,067
To erase away the day.

214
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,036
And to start fresh tomorrow.

215
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,108
To be true to each new day.

216
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,016
You're sleepy.

217
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,319
Once in spring and in the fall...

218
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,425
That day comes just twice a year.

219
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,366
Now, for the countdown!

220
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,199
Relax. Stay calm.

221
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,659
Ten...

222
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,897
Nine...

223
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,232
Eight...

224
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,703
Seven...

225
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,036
Six...

226
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,168
Five...

227
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,278
Four...

228
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,277
Three...

229
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,448
Two...

230
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,506
One...

231
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,741
Blast off!

232
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:35,529
Attention citizens.

233
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:40,543
This is the Civil Defense Corps...

234
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,274
For just 20 minutes a year...

235
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,449
the world seems like
the empty moon.

236
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,997
It feels...

237
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,364
lighter with 1/6th the gravity
like on the moon.

238
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,067
I wish the world would
freeze like this.

239
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,471
So life could be 1/6th lighter...

240
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,505
It's a sign from an alien!

241
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:26,339
I already tried hypnosis 13 times,
but it's no use.

242
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,987
It's not my fault.
I must forget. I can forget.

243
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,554
You're sleepy.

244
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:11,018
He's alive!
Thank you!

245
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,645
The alien is a freak.

246
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,378
'Help' changed to 'Hello'.

247
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,675
Good shot!

248
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,648
Instant black bean noodles

249
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,037
12 grams.

250
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,247
Just cuz of 12 grams.

251
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,839
I crumbled.

252
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:02,493
Black bean powder, sugar, dextrin,
caramel coloring...

253
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,120
Oh, caramel...

254
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:10,129
Seasoning, flour,
yummy flavorings...

255
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:14,436
Damn delicious
Modified Glucosyl Stevia.

256
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,075
Damn. I wanna eat this so badly.

257
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,144
It doesn't have to be wheat.

258
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,551
I don't even expect that much.

259
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,487
If I can make noodles,
anything would do.

260
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:43,157
All the times I was stupid enough
to pass on black bean noodles.

261
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,829
I regret it so much.

262
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,567
Just one bite, dear?
Please?

263
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,369
- No.
- Just one bite?

264
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,497
No! No! No!

265
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,273
Eat first.

266
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:04,348
Eat the noodles first! Stupid!

267
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,407
Black bean noodles, everyone?

268
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,212
Spicy noodles for me.

269
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,380
If I sprinkle this down my mouth...

270
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,249
will the craving go away?

271
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,632
Damn it!

272
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,567
Stop pooping guys.

273
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,845
Eating and pooping all the time.

274
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:17,620
That's why you'll always be
just damn birds.

275
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,563
Poop!

276
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,708
Poop! That's it!

277
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,544
That's it! Poop! Poop!

278
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,914
This could work!

279
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,983
Wait, wait, wait!

280
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:24,443
Think bird brain!
What do birds eat?

281
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,424
That's it!

282
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:31,962
If they eat and
can't digest the seeds...

283
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,294
What happens to the seeds?

284
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,532
See!

285
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:43,365
It'll work!
This will definitely work!

286
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,539
Why am I talking to you?

287
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:50,881
There's definitely a seed
in here somewhere!

288
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,576
Start scraping!

289
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,654
It's working!

290
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,389
This scraps it good!

291
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,964
Finally getting use
out of this card!

292
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,303
It's poop! Poop!

293
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,524
First, I must find good soil.

294
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,323
How can I do that?

295
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,363
Of course.

296
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,467
To make a field,
I have to dig up furrows.

297
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,274
And I also need manure.

298
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,278
Things I need
keep popping into mind!

299
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,761
I'm suddenly getting smarter.

300
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,201
Desire makes humans smarter.

301
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,642
Always constipation or diarrhea...

302
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,680
When's the last time
I made some good poop?

303
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,646
This can't make good fertilizer.

304
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,520
I have to get healthier.

305
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,890
I must make healthy poop.

306
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,332
And...

307
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,562
I have to make a lot.

308
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,248
Taking dinosaur DNA
from a fossilized

309
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,683
mosquito and
making Jurassic Park...

310
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:10,380
Or finding a wheat seed in bird poop
and making black bean noodles...

311
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,555
which has the higher probability?

312
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,018
I should hope for a miracle.

313
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,598
But it doesn't matter.

314
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,638
I got all the time in the world.

315
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,872
It's salty.

316
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,470
I made this salty taste
on my own.

317
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,713
Maybe it's cuz
I ate bland tasting food.

318
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,817
I couldn't be more proud
of my salty tasting self.

319
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,989
I feel like the
most delicious thing

320
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,719
at the top of the
evolutionary chain.

321
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,062
I'm damn delicious.

322
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,393
I'm good!

323
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,365
I know how you feel, bud.

324
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,038
This suit can turn you
into a scarecrow.

325
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,347
No need for this anymore.

326
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,804
Hopeful retail price: 85 ¢

327
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,108
Hope

328
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,317
I've been watching him
for two months.

329
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,497
This is my mini homepage
of the alien

330
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,489
who can only be seen from my window.

331
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:17,564
He is shy.

332
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,373
Likes dirty things.

333
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,269
Enjoys adventures.

334
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,644
He's a total freak.

335
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,843
And he's very curious about
Earth's black bean noodles.

336
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,112
Will I be invited to join...

337
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,820
this lonely alien's world?

338
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,960
I must go out into the Earth.

339
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,557
Can I do it without NASA's help?

340
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,431
Just once.

341
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,473
Only one time.

342
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,114
Representing
the 6 billion people on Earth...

343
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:02,518
I'll reply to an alien's message.

344
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,619
Since Armstrong...

345
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:26,902
This is another
giant step for mankind.

346
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,009
Five...

347
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,210
Four...

348
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,588
Three...

349
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,612
Two...

350
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,120
One...

351
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,450
Blast off!
