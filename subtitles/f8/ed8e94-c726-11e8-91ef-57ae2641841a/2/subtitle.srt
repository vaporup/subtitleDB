0
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,563
See you later, hon.

1
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,330
Didn't you find the note?

2
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:16,634
Why aren't you replying?

3
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,549
Three Months Later

4
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:31,002
It's a sprout!

5
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,216
Fast and easy loans like shopping.

6
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:39,015
Don't lose hope.

7
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,955
Banana flavor.

8
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:35,959
Don't you think?
It's gotta be.

9
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,573
It has to be meant for me.

10
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:43,110
Then why else
would it be there?

11
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:48,410
It said, 'Hello'.
You know what that means?

12
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,053
Think about it.

13
00:05:54,088 --> 00:06:01,790
It means someone's been
watching me.

14
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,193
A freak? A psycho?

15
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,594
After 3 months and 17 days.

16
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:46,236
I finally got a reply.

17
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:34,272
The images and sound
are slowly getting clearer.

18
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,944
You're sleepy.

19
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:19,321
That's right, a pen-pal.
Writing to someone you don't know.

20
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:23,727
Then you get curious
and imagine who it might be.

21
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,091
It's an international pen-pal
cuz it's in English.

22
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:31,639
But it's the best
when you don't know who it is.

23
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,302
It doesn't matter who it is.
Right?

24
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:41,479
Hey, pal!
Startin' to ignore me?

25
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,886
What's wrong?
Going through puberty or somethin'?

26
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,557
Corn... Corn!

27
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,898
See this?

28
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:40,337
We can make noodles
with corn powder!

29
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:47,845
It's corn! Corn!

30
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,578
Corn!

31
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,643
Yes, hello.

32
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:36,223
You know Bam Island on Han River?

33
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,478
How much for the duck boat?

34
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,046
Damn it!

35
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,948
Damn! Why me!

36
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,321
Hello!

37
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,054
Anyone here?

38
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,785
Black bean noodles delivery.

39
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,850
Black bean noodles...

40
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,662
Hey!

41
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:05,350
Ah, some woman sent this.

42
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,156
Regular black bean noodles.

43
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,961
Black bean noodles with onions.

44
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,567
Seafood black bean noodles.

45
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,435
And this is on the house.

46
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:47,421
It's true...

47
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,928
We're supposed to
deliver anywhere.

48
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,397
But this is going way overboard.

49
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:01,140
Enjoy your meal and...

50
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,809
keep the dishes.

51
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,879
Wait!

52
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,878
The woman...

53
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,289
What does she look like?

54
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:26,265
Man, I'd like to see her face, too.

55
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,612
Hey, wait!

56
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,146
God damn it!

57
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,519
I don't care!

58
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:35,026
Deliver it yourself,
eat it, or throw it out!

59
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,363
My legs are all cramped!

60
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,654
Wait!

61
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,591
What's with you two...

62
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,426
That man...

63
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,465
Didn't he say something?

64
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,135
What did he say?

65
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:48,538
You two are really somethin'.

66
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:52,103
You're breaking my heart.

67
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:54,674
He told me to tell you...

68
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,182
a bowl of black bean noodles is...

69
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,153
hope to him.

70
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,523
I'd stay away from him.
And keep the dishes.

71
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,723
Hope.

72
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,328
I haven't heard that
in 100 years.

73
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:14,154
I'm tasting the giant hope
the man sent me.

74
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,344
It is truly the taste of hope.

75
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,015
Truly.

76
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,414
Truly

77
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,770
Are you awake?

78
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,911
Do you need anything?

79
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,818
Then I'll be going, now.

80
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,172
Wait...

81
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,341
I'd like to raise some corn.

82
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,546
What?

83
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,980
Corn.

84
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,315
Corn?

85
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,221
Can you get me the seeds,
pots, and other things?

86
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:13,306
Sure.
I'll get you the corn.

87
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,005
Me, too.

88
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,956
How long do I have to
keep doing this?

89
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,941
Congratulations.

90
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,498
Hello?

91
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,733
How are you?

92
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,399
Fine, thank you.
And you?

93
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,743
Fine, thank you.

94
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,081
Where are you from?

95
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:18,391
Korean? Really?

96
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,586
Oh my god!

97
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:24,755
Me, too! I'm Korean.
From Do-bong-gu.

98
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,129
And... I...

99
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,415
I hope to see you.

100
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,921
Who are you?

101
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,039
What's going on?

102
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,746
Where is it?

103
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,442
Where's the bottle?

104
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,309
This looks familiar.

105
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,903
That's my friend!
Who are you!

106
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,120
This is a fake homepage, people!
I saw the real one!

107
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,384
Crazy bitch! Die!

108
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:43,773
Why...

109
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,137
Why!

110
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,715
Hey!

111
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:59,559
Fierce winds and heavy rainfall
is expected overnight.

112
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,596
Let's turn to the weather
for the details.

113
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:04,664
Reporter HAN?

114
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,395
A typhoon warning is in effect
in the southeast.

115
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:41,531
It's okay! Don't worry!

116
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:45,602
It'll pass in a flash!
Don't worry!

117
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,998
Don't worry!

118
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,350
Everything will be okay.

119
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,787
I can't even have this?

120
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:00,592
It's not much...

121
00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:01,390
Just about to start, sir.
Don't worry. Bye.

122
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,963
Who are you?

123
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,731
What are you doing here?

124
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,638
You're not allowed to be here, sir.

125
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:19,868
Must be homeless, sir.

126
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:29,084
We came to clean...

127
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,097
Stop!

128
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:51,736
Stop right there!

129
00:42:23,476 --> 00:42:24,966
What's going on?

130
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:29,377
Catch him! Get him!

131
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:00,835
This is my land!

132
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:14,225
I have to stay here!

133
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:17,261
Catch him!

134
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,600
Bastard!

135
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:43,686
This is a conservation area.
It's restricted to the public!

136
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:50,062
Let me just stay here, please?

137
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,858
I won't do anything bad.

138
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:01,566
I gotta get the replies.

139
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,439
Put some clothes on him, first.

140
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:49,043
Give it up, mister.

141
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:50,987
Let's go.

142
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:54,683
Come on! Let's go!

143
00:47:46,098 --> 00:47:48,066
Let's just go.

144
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,897
63 Building

145
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:18,423
He's practically Tarzan.

146
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:19,788
Like a savage.

147
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,459
Does this go to the 63 Building?

148
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:07,898
Is something up?

149
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,210
No. Nothing.

150
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:23,202
Attention citizens!

151
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:28,369
This is the Civil Defense Corps.

152
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,508
Attention citizens!
This is the Civil Defense Corps.

153
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:39,452
This is an air-raid drill.

154
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:54,029
Once in spring and in the fall.

155
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,633
That day comes twice a year.

156
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,317
Something is up.

157
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,539
My...

158
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:49,682
...name is...

159
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:54,750
KIM Jung-yeon.

160
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:07,129
Who are you?
