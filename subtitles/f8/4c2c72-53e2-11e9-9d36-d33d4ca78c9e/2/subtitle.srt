1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,799
Conquer! Come out, you old bastard!

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,718
I seek revenge on behalf of
the Unchallenged City!

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,180
Ming! You think
you can upturn Conquer's Clan?

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,933
You are too naive

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,060
Conquer's Clan destroyed my family

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,937
My father was murdered
Unchallenged Sword was stolen

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,397
Even if I, Ming, cannot get revenge

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,484
I must have Conquer explain
his evil deeds

9
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,071
Give me Unchallenged City,
give me my Unchallenged Sword!

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,490
What's your business with them?

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,951
Monks should be charitable and kind

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,953
So I promised Young Master...

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,080
to help investigate
the murder of his family

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,958
I hope you will help,
in the name of Buddha

15
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,670
How dare you!

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,393
Today is my daughter's wedding

17
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,395
I won't

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,147
let any conflict interrupt
tonight's celebration

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:09,278
Conquer's Clan may not be
as influential as Shaolin

20
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,446
But we are the leaders of all

21
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,742
the other clans

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,369
Excuse my directness

23
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,417
Support me and prosper
Or oppose me and die!

24
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,588
Buddha have pity

25
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,301
You have explained your position clearly

26
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,430
Young Master, what do you think?

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,020
My skills are not strong enough,

28
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,689
I cannot even defeat Wind

29
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,193
I am certainly no match for Conquer,

30
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,615
I came to deliver this for my uncle,
Sword Saint

31
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,216
"Our battle should take place
on the autumn solstice

32
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,636
This will settle
our ten-years-old appointment"

33
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,059
I've waited for this for a long time

34
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,689
Everything's fine now!

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,943
A toast, everyone! Music!

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,683
I wish I were the bride

37
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,644
You're such a tomboy
Who will ever marry you?

38
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,820
Wind is one of the favorite disciples
of my Lord

39
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,989
and he will be his son-in-law

40
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,992
So after the ceremony,
he will be twice as close!

41
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,871
Wind, promise me,
you must treat Charity well

42
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,164
Understand?

43
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,166
I will obey your wishes

44
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,044
Let's bow to the ancestors. Kneel...

45
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,004
Hold it!

46
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,310
Cloud

47
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:48,770
Cloud

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,022
Come with me

49
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,197
Striding Cloud, how dare you!

50
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,926
I thought you would never come!

51
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,345
Why did you agree to marry Wind?

52
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,763
You never asked why

53
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,517
I cannot let another man touch you!

54
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,810
I can marry him
and still keep seeing you

55
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,230
Charity

56
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,651
Come back!

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,112
I have obeyed you for 10 years

58
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,366
I'm leaving Conquer's Clan
and taking Charity with me

59
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,830
If you're a man,
go and fight for your wife

60
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,667
Don't let the world laugh at you

61
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,254
Fight for your reputation!

62
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,549
Cloud

63
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:16,984
Cloud

64
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,040
Master! Shut up!

65
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,453
Father!

66
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,788
Look out!

67
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,628
Charity!

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,386
She is already my woman. Go away!

69
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,223
Charity, is it true?

70
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,230
I'm sorry, Wind

71
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,651
Why did you agree to marry me then?

72
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,072
Have you ever loved me?

73
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,534
Yes

74
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,375
It's all right if you don't love me

75
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,505
Love doesn't call for an explanation

76
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,675
You'll always be mine

77
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,821
Charity, I love you

78
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,037
I'll always be with you

79
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,753
Charity...

80
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,598
Master!

81
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,601
I killed my own daughter...

82
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,822
Thanks to the ancestors
Phoenix is finally pregnant

83
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,951
The Lui family line will
have continuation,

84
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,247
and the Xia's family will continue
for generations and prosper!

85
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,418
Father-in-law, bless us

86
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,421
I will take good care of
your descendants

87
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:12,845
Lai

88
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,807
You guard this shrine well

89
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,560
Even though he is preserved by lce Vigor

90
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,273
You must still protect
my late father's body

91
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,274
Yes, sir

92
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,696
Sit down, Phoenix

93
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,125
Who is it?

94
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,129
Striding Cloud wishes to borrow
your lce Vigor

95
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,006
What?

96
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,009
It is
the heirloom treasure of our family,

97
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,677
how dare you take it?

98
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,725
I will accert any condition

99
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,188
only if you agree to lend it to me

100
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,484
Cloud, lce Vigor is buried with
my late father to preserve his body

101
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,197
I am very moved that you would risk

102
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,157
so much for a loved one

103
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,327
But have you thought about

104
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,037
my position

105
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,331
if you took it away?

106
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,170
That is your problem, not mine

107
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,630
Sorry, I cannot oblige

108
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,465
See our guest out!

109
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,824
Phoenix!

110
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,500
Dragon!

111
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,709
Phoenix, are you okay?

112
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,388
I came for the lce Vigor
I do not wish to hurt you

113
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:30,853
Halt!

114
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,981
You may not enter!

115
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,985
Leave if you wish to live!

116
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,306
Striding Cloud,
return Charity's body to me

117
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:14,850
No one can take her away

118
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,477
With your powers?

119
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,024
I did not teach you
the last move of Cloud Palms

120
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:28,322
I will show you today
so you will die in peace

121
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,515
Cloud Palms will only work with liquid,

122
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,935
and here we are in the desert now

123
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,064
I followed you here
before I confronted you

124
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,951
Let's see how much blood you have

125
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:19,957
I will use it to enrich
my Trinity Strength

126
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,150
Charity, wait for me!

127
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,534
Father, look! Someone has fainted!

128
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,954
It's Striding Cloud who stole the bride!

129
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,248
Hurry! Let's bring him inside!

130
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,256
Striding Cloud...

131
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,971
Give me back my daughter!

132
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,392
I must avenge for Father?

133
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,276
You must love that girl alot

134
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:57,155
You're so romantic
You can even love in your dreams

135
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,285
Charity...

136
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,143
Muse, what are you doing?

137
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,897
Nothing. He is still sweating
I'll get some medicine

138
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,321
I've been asking around

139
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,907
After Conquer killed his own daughter

140
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,036
Striding Cloud took the body
and got into a lot of trouble

141
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,456
Conquer did all this to him
at the royal mausoleum

142
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:49,791
There is so much hatred

143
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,919
between Master and pupil

144
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,171
How sad!

145
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,799
He lost his lover
and his arm all in one day

146
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,928
Father, will he die?

147
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,015
So you must be very careful
when picking a husband

148
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,059
Who says I want to get married?

149
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,352
You do. Its written all over your face

150
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,812
You taught me yourself

151
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,358
As herbal doctors,

152
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,651
it is our mission to save
and help those who need us

153
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,486
No matter good or bad,

154
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,947
a life is a life, right?

155
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:23,825
Father! What's wrong with you?

156
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,661
Father...

157
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:32,668
Are you all right?
I won't think of marriage any more...

158
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:33,836
This arm

159
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,255
Ever since I succeeded training
this Fire Beast Arm,

160
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,674
it has been rejecting my body,

161
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,052
as though it doesn't belong to me
I can't control it

162
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,974
Muse, tell my assistants to get ready

163
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,100
for an operation

164
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,142
Hurry!

165
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,819
Since Striding Cloud's arrival,

166
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,446
I've had a feeling that

167
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,284
this arm has found its real master

168
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,745
I am going to give him my Fire Beast Arm

169
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,585
Striding Cloud, think of it this way

170
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,881
We are repaying a debt
from a previous life

171
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,344
Good medicine always tastes bitter
lts good for you

172
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,057
You are...

173
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,351
I am Muse

174
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,103
You have fainted for four days

175
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,691
If my father had not rescued you,
you would have died

176
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,950
My arm... Why?

177
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,787
Like it? I put it on for you

178
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:32,955
You've wakened

179
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,252
It was my arm
Take it as a present from me

180
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,257
We've met before, during the wedding...

181
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,383
Muse

182
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,555
Fire Beast Arm finally found
its rightful owner

183
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,098
Thank you

184
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,432
Don't mention it

185
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,435
Striding Cloud,
your arm is still in recovery

186
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,020
It needs plenty of rest

187
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,148
Muse, let's go... give him some peace

188
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,817
I'm feeding him his medicine

189
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,402
He has his arms now
He can do it himself

190
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,182
Wind

191
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,186
For two months
you've done nothing but drink and sleep

192
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:41,190
If you go on like this,
you will be wasted!

193
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:45,319
I'm wasted anyway

194
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,198
Go with Hawk and Bat

195
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,908
Bring me the Blood Bodhi fruit

196
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,994
It is in Cirrus Cave
where your father was killed

197
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,371
Behave if you know what's good for you
This is an order

198
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:12,930
Cloud...

199
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,353
Cloud...

200
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,064
Cloud...

201
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:22,583
Cloud

202
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:27,588
Cloud, meal time

203
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,429
You still miss her?

204
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,145
Let me tell you

205
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,771
When I saw your lover at Conquer's Clan

206
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,691
wearing that beautiful bridal gown,

207
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,902
I was so envious

208
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:56,617
They call you Muse
because you are easily amused?

209
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:58,327
Certainly not!

210
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,329
I was blessed

211
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,040
by a Muse at birth

212
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,208
Simple as that

213
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,921
Thank you both

214
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:09,922
for rescuing me

215
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,174
Don't mention it

216
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,220
Will you be returning to Conquer's Clan?

217
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,347
I must

218
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,058
To seek revenge

219
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,811
Revenge back and forth with no end
When will all this vengeance end?

220
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,691
In this world some people...

221
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,071
have no friends and no love

222
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,241
I am such a person

223
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,760
Father, I like
the feeling of being carried by you

224
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,329
Mother!

225
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,051
Master Wind

226
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,512
Have some water

227
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,014
Come

228
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,428
What is that on the cliff?

229
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,419
Blood Bodhi fruit!
They must be Blood Bodhi fruit!

230
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,714
His Lordship once said
just one will increase your powers

231
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:02,487
Go away!

232
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:12,456
Come out! Beast! Come out...

233
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,208
Stop shouting

234
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,335
If you keep shouting
the beast may come out

235
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,933
Master Wind, please don't blame us

236
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,061
That day,
all 296 people at Unchallenged City

237
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,229
took this poison

238
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,314
It's colourless, scentless,
flesh-rotting and bone-eating

239
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,941
They died in the hands of Master Cloud

240
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,776
Why are you doing this?

241
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,070
Lord Conquer ordered it, so we must obey

242
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,823
Senseless, it's senseless...

243
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,075
It will be

244
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,368
a great achievement for us

245
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:50,494
If we bring back your head
and the fruits, we'll be rewarded

246
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,192
I'll give you back the fruits

247
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,910
Then we'll call it even. Deal?

248
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:48,839
"With a heart as clear as ice,
the sky may fall and I will not fear"

249
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:52,421
Who is it?

250
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,174
It's me, Jester

251
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:59,428
Congratulations my Lord,

252
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:03,015
you have achieved amazing powers!
World-dominating powers!

253
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,186
What are you saying?

254
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:11,356
This Sword Saint, such arrogance
To challenge my Lord

255
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:14,735
He doesn't know you have achieved
this amazing power

256
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,196
Really, you're fulfilling destiny

257
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,328
Fulfilling destiny?

258
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:27,706
Yes, fulfilling destiny. Oops

259
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,918
Jester

260
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,008
You sweet-talker, that is nonsense!

261
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:43,388
No, I dare not
Every word I say comes from my heart

262
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,353
Go out

263
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,480
Yes

264
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:04,660
Yes, Master

265
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,253
You are the only one
I don't have to worry about

266
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,674
Now that Wind and Cloud have
both disappeared and

267
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:24,805
I must go to battle tomorrow,

268
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,560
I command you to take leadership of the
three halls, and help me rule the world

269
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,856
I only worry about by inability

270
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,044
I have full confidence in you

271
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,592
Frost, it is my life's ambition to
beat Sword Saint

272
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,428
Soon,
the leadership of Conquer's Clan...

273
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,599
will be yours

274
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:09,725
Thank you, Master

275
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,028
In the face of battle,
to preserve our interests...

276
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,990
Conquer's Clan cannot afford
any mistakes

277
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,204
Whoever is disloyal to me must die

278
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,206
Terminate Jester! He's a nuisance!

279
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,773
Have you seen Jester?

280
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,942
No, no

281
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:02,653
Stop!

282
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,948
Please don't kill me...

283
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,407
Lord Conquer is a true villain

284
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:09,076
He is playing tricks on us all

285
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,077
Rubbish!

286
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,788
You betrayed Master. You must die!

287
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,332
He tricked Wind and Cloud
and killed their parents

288
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,835
I'll bring you to a person,
then you'll understand

289
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,671
It is Mud Buddha,
Lord Conquer has imprisoned him

290
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,846
Jester, you look ridiculous...

291
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,974
in those clothes

292
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,144
Let me get change first,
and I'll take you to Mud Buddha

293
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:06,884
Master Frost...

294
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:09,720
So the man who kidnapped him
the other day was Master

295
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,077
I must fight. I must persist...

296
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,084
I must not die now

297
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:17,764
Conquer killed your parents

298
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,602
I purposely gave him

299
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:25,480
yours and Cloud's birth chart

300
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:28,775
so he would let you live

301
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,905
Destiny...

302
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,746
All things go in cycles
Cause, consequences...

303
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:44,625
Everything will have its final judgement

304
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,338
What shall I do?

305
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:56,512
"The Dragon is powerful,

306
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:02,935
but will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm"

307
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,234
Sword Saint has come for the duel

308
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,830
A long-awaited occassion!

309
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:28,710
Although I now rule
the martial arts world,

310
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:33,090
not being able to fight you is
like having a bone stuck in my throat

311
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,844
I must get it out to ease my discomfort

312
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:42,266
I am glad you have preserved
your strength. You still look strong

313
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,562
If I can defeat you today

314
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,148
I will have no regrets

315
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,277
I accept your challenge with
my Unchallenged Sword

316
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,866
And I will have...

317
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,162
Defeated your entire family

318
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,311
Wait here

319
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:35,254
Is he human? Why is he not moving?

320
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,257
Don't

321
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,181
Stay here. I'm going in

322
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,690
Uncle!

323
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,735
Conquer, I'll die with you!

324
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:01,340
I am so useless...

325
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:08,931
Help me seek revenge

326
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,667
Mud Buddha said,
Wind and Cloud must be together

327
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,835
Or it won't be a storm

328
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,127
Cloud!

329
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,260
Blood Bodhi fruit can increase
your powers

330
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,710
Frost, announce to the world,

331
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,171
I have defeated Sword Saint,
my ultimate opponent

332
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,423
I am now truly invincible

333
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,468
You killed the parents of Wind and Cloud

334
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:33,432
You ordered Hawk and Bat to kill Wind,

335
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:35,601
right?

336
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:40,689
So you didn't kill Jester?

337
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,318
Conquer, you cold-blooded murderer!

338
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,907
I was right

339
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,328
Of the three, you are most naive

340
00:49:57,915 --> 00:49:59,708
I refuse to be your successor

341
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,503
You're only using me!

342
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:08,634
Correct. Let it be known to all

343
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:14,640
Better that they owe me, than I owe them,

344
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,226
including you

345
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:23,774
Frost, where are you going?

346
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,653
I'm leaving Conquer's Clan

347
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:37,371
You think you can come
and go as you please?

348
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:51,552
Frost

349
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:59,977
So you two are still alive

350
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:01,812
Conquer

351
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:06,650
Sword Saint's martial arts is
truly powerful

352
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,986
But nothing

353
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,445
compared to my Trinity Strength

354
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:12,447
Ten years ago, I asked you

355
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:15,742
Aren't you afraid I'll avenge my father?

356
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:20,163
If I can take you in,

357
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:23,584
I have planned for such a day

358
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,329
Master Wind

359
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:05,626
Do not use all your force,
do not say all you think

360
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:09,046
If you go too far,
destiny will prematurely end

361
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:26,290
I taught you
all the martial arts you ever knew

362
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:29,585
Remember, I am your Master

363
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:12,336
Cloud is unpredictable, Wind is formless

364
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:16,507
You think you two can defeat me?

365
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:17,925
Let me tell you

366
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,636
This is Sword Grave,

367
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,639
besides swords

368
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,350
it will also be your burial ground

369
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,311
Prepare to die!

370
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,350
I taught you Fists, Palms and Kicks,

371
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,979
but I ultimate weapon is the sword!

372
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,120
"The Dragon is powerful,

373
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:30,998
but will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm"

374
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:39,006
Mud Buddha,
I don't believe in your predictions

375
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:42,301
I only believe in myself

376
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:19,922
I have hidden the sword

377
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:20,923
Even if you find it,

378
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,091
you cannot use it without my blood
or that of my son's

379
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:48,654
Charity...

380
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,822
Charity

381
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:52,074
Father...

382
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,661
don't leave me alone

383
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,079
Father, help me...

384
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,141
I'm suffering!

385
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:20,143
Give me back the lives of my family...

386
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,562
Give me back my reputation...

387
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:23,814
Give me back the lives of my family!

388
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:26,275
Give me back my reputation!

389
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,652
Give me back my reputation!

390
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:38,579
Cloud!

391
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,290
What are you doing?

392
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,127
Get out of my way

393
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:46,420
After all, he raised us

394
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:52,718
Sword Saint, Whispering Prince
Where are you? Help me

395
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:58,682
I am Conqueror of the World!

396
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:06,607
It is said "If you go too far...

397
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:11,904
Destiny will prematurely end"

398
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,620
I am Conqueror of the World

399
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:26,335
I am Conqueror of the World...

400
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,805
I am Conqueror of the World...
