1
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,120
Father,
do you have a name for this sword?

2
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,873
It's called "The Ultimate Sword,"

3
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,458
the best sword I've made in my life!

4
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,880
Which is better -
martial arts or a good sword?

5
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,009
A good sword can...

6
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,762
help a novice

7
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,975
And make an expert really powerful

8
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,478
But most important is
who is using the sword

9
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,607
Cloud, remember:

10
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,193
Kindness is invincible!

11
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,039
Lord Conquer has led Conquer's Clan

12
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:11,210
to the strong position it is today

13
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,922
Mud Buddha, you are praising yourself

14
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,675
You are in charge of the geomancy here,

15
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,511
and if we do well, so will you

16
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,515
I hope so

17
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,102
Jester,
you are Lord Conquer's right hand

18
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,523
Truly a servant of one,
master of thousands

19
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,235
It's a dangerous way of living

20
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,238
We always envy each other

21
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,248
His Lordship has been waiting all day

22
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,555
Greetings, Lord! Greetings, my Lord!

23
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,565
You've come

24
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:20,112
You know me well

25
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,869
How will I do in my duel
with Sword Saint?

26
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,330
My Lord's martial arts skill will find
no match in the world

27
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,041
Neither No Name in the south nor...

28
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,293
Sword Saint in the north

29
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,588
are worthy opponents

30
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,760
Mud Buddha,

31
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,470
you talk like Jester

32
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,433
Lord, I didn't teach him to sweet talk

33
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,897
If I can defeat Sword Saint,

34
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,443
Conquer's Clan will rule the world

35
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,614
But I can tell you, my Lord...

36
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:09,203
You may have to wait ten years
for the duel with Sword Saint

37
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,790
Why do you say that?

38
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,628
The time has not yet come

39
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,966
My Lord, a gift for you

40
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:24,676
What is it?

41
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,932
"When the Wind and Cloud combine,

42
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,645
the Fish with Golden Scales
becomes a Dragon"

43
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,528
These two birth charts

44
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,657
are of the two disciples you will have

45
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,660
One is named Wind

46
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,246
The other is named Cloud

47
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,542
Wind and Cloud?

48
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,257
The wind is formless

49
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:08,971
The cloud is unpredictable

50
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,683
As to...

51
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,269
how to find them,

52
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,981
that depends on your fate

53
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,278
And after I find them?

54
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:30,576
You will be invincible
for the first half of your life

55
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,452
And the last half?

56
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,023
Find Wind and Cloud first

57
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,297
Jester

58
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,175
Yes, my Lord

59
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,014
Use whatever means necessary

60
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,602
I must find Wind and Cloud

61
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,020
Yes, my Lord

62
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,446
This is a Persian treasure,

63
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:11,783
it is called the Ying Yang Magic Box

64
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:16,788
It has 108 Celestial Stems
and Terrestrial Branches

65
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,919
My Lord is so intelligent,

66
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,798
if you can find...

67
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,926
the correct combination

68
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,386
the box will open

69
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:37,643
It holds the answer to
the second half of your life;

70
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,354
I will

71
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,524
then be able to give you an explanation

72
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,819
Do not use force to open this box

73
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,072
If you do...

74
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:54,326
the box will explode

75
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,079
and all will be destroyed

76
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:01,959
Good!

77
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,422
I, Conquer, can certainly open this box

78
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,645
Out of my way! Go away!

79
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:23,856
"By order of Conquer's Clan,

80
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,275
all boys with the listed birth chart

81
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,278
must become disciples of Conquer's Clan"

82
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,292
Master!

83
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,878
Master...

84
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,755
Conquer's Clan seeks boys with
young master's birth chart

85
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:57,055
Do not let them know of Cloud

86
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,348
Yes, sir

87
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,769
Cloud

88
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:04,897
Come here

89
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,759
Wind, did you memorize
the Blizzard Rhyme I taught you?

90
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,512
Don't worry father, I remember

91
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,521
"When river reaches Buddha's knee,
Burning then will Cirrus Cave be"

92
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,398
Father, what does this mean?

93
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,984
This river floods all the time

94
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,988
Legend says,
when the Buddha's knees are flooded,

95
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,075
Cirrus Cave up in the mountains will
catch fire,

96
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,954
and the villages will be flooded too

97
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,665
Wind, I have carried you a long time

98
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,542
Why don't you get down and walk with me

99
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,253
I like the feeling of
being carried by you

100
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,718
Father, will we see mother on this trip?

101
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,980
Who told you, Wind?

102
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,649
I am already ten, no longer a child

103
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:44,288
Promise never to mention
your mother again

104
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,764
All women are trouble

105
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,915
Conquer, I have retired for many years

106
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,336
Why must you force me?

107
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,923
Fire Unicorn in the south,
lce Blizzard in the north

108
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,218
My goal in life is to gather
the World's Ten Greatest Weapons

109
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,095
For you to posses the Blizzard Blade is
a crime punishable by death

110
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,932
I have already buried it in the hills

111
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,647
If you want to fight, we'll use bamboo

112
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,417
But if I win...

113
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,838
I'll choose between Blizzard Blade,
or your wife

114
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,549
If I loose today's duel...

115
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,092
You can have the Fire Unicorn Sword

116
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,845
You must pay for your madness!

117
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,184
Whispering Prince,
you're using bamboo today

118
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,476
It is only the first round

119
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,021
I'll give you two years

120
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,065
Bring Blizzard Blade to me then
at the Cirrus Cave

121
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,611
I'll take your wife for now

122
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,511
Wind, wait here for Father

123
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,598
Father, I hope you'll bring Mother

124
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,831
Its been sometime...

125
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,375
You're alone?

126
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:30,848
Ying

127
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,015
Husband

128
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,726
How have you been?

129
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,020
Very happy

130
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:44,111
Whispering Prince, don't you understand?

131
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,657
Ying wanted to come with me,

132
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,286
I never forced her

133
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,121
Ying!

134
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,665
Didn't you notice?

135
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,878
Ever since your retirement
to the countryside...

136
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,422
I have never smiled

137
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:10,345
I want a man to be celebrated hero

138
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,056
I want your humble visitors...

139
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,893
to adore me

140
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,899
Now I understand...

141
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,781
Only by robbing you of your love

142
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,368
I can make you fight back

143
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,747
I shall force you to use
the Blizzard Blade

144
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,211
I'll tell you a secret

145
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,922
I only used her

146
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,508
to vent my desires

147
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,800
I never loved her

148
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,347
Conquer, you are despicable!

149
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,418
Mother!

150
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:27,256
Wind! Mother, I miss you

151
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,567
We will fight to the death,

152
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,403
but I have one request from you

153
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,281
Speak

154
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,158
I have only one son, Whispering Wind

155
00:17:55,701 --> 00:18:00,163
If I die, please let him live

156
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,166
Yes, I promise you

157
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,033
I have dishonoured you and your father

158
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,909
Mother!

159
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,077
Mother! Don't!

160
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,622
Mother...

161
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,208
Father!

162
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,792
Father...

163
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,806
Father!

164
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,642
Wind, run! Don't worry about me!

165
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,227
No, I won't run away!

166
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,316
Run! Hurry! Father...

167
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,439
What have we Stridings done to you?

168
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,858
Why do you destroy my homestead?

169
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:51,859
It is our Lord's order

170
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,278
Hand over your son
and the Ultimate Sword

171
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,446
Give it to Conquer's Clan
and we will spare you

172
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,282
I'd rather die than surrender!

173
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,452
We'll find the sword

174
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,453
after we kill you all

175
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,414
I have hidden it

176
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:06,456
Even if you find it,

177
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,625
you cannot use it without it touching
my blood or that of my son's

178
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:30,772
There's a child

179
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,025
Is he Striding Sky's son?

180
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,195
Perhaps not, he isn't crying at all

181
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,031
Take the child and all the swords

182
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:39,907
Yes

183
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,262
Where is Father? Where is my father?

184
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,847
Calm down!

185
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,685
My father brought you here

186
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,145
or you would've been eaten by wolves

187
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,274
Curious? This is Conquer's Clan

188
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,569
I'm Charity, daughter of Lord Conquer
He's Frost

189
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,989
You've fainted for two days

190
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,452
Have some tea
I'll take you to eat later

191
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,750
Isn't it too hot?

192
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,884
My Lord's brilliance will

193
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,012
unite Heaven and Earth...

194
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:39,318
These three years,
the Clan has gone far

195
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,322
We are the greatest Clan now

196
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,327
I am naming heirs to
further strengthen us

197
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:50,996
Frost,

198
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,629
Cloud and Wind will be
my closest disciples

199
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,508
With their Frost Fists,
Cloud Palms and Wind Kicks

200
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,968
Conquer's Clan shall dominate
the martial arts world

201
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,930
My Lord's brilliance will

202
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,807
unite Heaven and Earth

203
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,962
"Unable to meet in battle

204
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,090
Duel to death in ten years. Sword Saint"

205
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:48,136
Mud Buddha, you are a true prophet

206
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,477
Why didn't you attack with
your full force?

207
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,314
Master's body is invaluable, I dare not

208
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,900
If I cannot handle your attacks,

209
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,443
then I deserve to die

210
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:50,782
Master Cloud,

211
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,618
His Lordship wishes to see you

212
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,495
and Master Wind

213
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,629
Bring the coloured stones to Charity

214
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:04,588
Yes

215
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,230
Come in

216
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,775
Charity, this is forbidden ground

217
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,527
We are not allowed to go in

218
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,530
To outsiders only,

219
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,240
but I'm Lord Conquer's daughter

220
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,700
This is the Sword Grave,
our sword storage

221
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,787
If not forbidden,
it may still be dangerous

222
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,122
That's why I asked you to go with me

223
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,417
I'll go in myself, cowards

224
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,923
You two go, I'll stand guard

225
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,967
See, you cherish me more

226
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,635
Let's go, Wind

227
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:52,928
Women are trouble

228
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,271
Look! Magic fire!

229
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,649
No, these are just firebugs

230
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,277
I'll take some home

231
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,095
Someone's coming. Let's go

232
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,224
Let's go

233
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,243
"With the unique powers of
Wind and Cloud,

234
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,621
Lord Conquer has obtained supremacy
and expanded his empire

235
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,124
With the strength of his martial arts,

236
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,838
Conquer has overcome all
but one of his rivals - Sword Saint"

237
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:58,095
This prophecy is a gift from Mud Buddha

238
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,140
Together with another verse

239
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,271
I'll be able to find out my fate

240
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:15,445
That other verse is still locked
in this magic box

241
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:21,159
I have been unable to find
the right combination for ten years,

242
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:25,956
and Mud Buddha has disappeared
for ten years

243
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:31,879
Frost, Wind, I have lost my patience

244
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:36,884
Go and find Mud Buddha

245
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,011
Legend says...

246
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,973
in order to find Mud Buddha,
one must first seek the Fire Monkey"

247
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,267
Use this clue in your search

248
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,019
Aren't you coming with us?

249
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,646
I am only a watchdog

250
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,190
Once I step outside these gates

251
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,483
I'll be doomed. Very fragile,

252
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,611
I can't take hardships

253
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:56,653
Jester!

254
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:03,660
Wind, your Wind Kick
lacks practical experience

255
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,997
Therefore, on this journey

256
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,625
be careful and obey Frost

257
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,501
I understand

258
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,211
Cloud,

259
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,506
You have a different mission

260
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,217
I await your orders

261
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,639
Fong in Unchallenged City wishes

262
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,516
to become our ally

263
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:27,935
I told him

264
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:32,523
I wanted his Unchallenged Sword
as a token

265
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,235
It's his birthday,
so go to Unchallenged City

266
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:39,947
I will bring back the Unchallenged Sword

267
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,371
I want more than that...

268
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,375
Bring back Fong's head

269
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,627
Can you do it?

270
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,921
Yes, Master

271
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:04,972
You have achieved 70% of your power
with your Cloud Palms

272
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,642
You can succeed,

273
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,270
with Hawk's and Bat's help

274
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,314
Father, I want to go, too

275
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:18,694
Charity, what is it?

276
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,446
If they can go, why can't I?

277
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:26,952
I see...

278
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,582
Would you like to go with Wind,
or Cloud?

279
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,297
You are going to kill, leave me out

280
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,883
Wind, I'll go with you

281
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,260
We're not going to play

282
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,012
Neither am I

283
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,306
We'll help out the weak and be heroes

284
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,892
These are not the teachings of the Clan

285
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,978
Jester, be quiet

286
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,025
Prepare to leave tomorrow

287
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,902
Yes Yes, Master

288
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,488
Charity, stay

289
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:11,788
Cloud

290
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,919
Have you been to the forbidden
Sword Grave with Charity?

291
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,631
Yes, but please don't tell Master

292
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,377
Chase me, Grandfather!

293
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:07,130
Little Pigtails, don't run!

294
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,281
Old Man, we'll be fighting here
Leave quickly

295
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:39,288
Surround him!

296
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,462
I respect you as a Shaolin monk

297
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,590
Give me the Fire Monkey!

298
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,009
What a pity

299
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,970
No one can turn down

300
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,723
an order from the Unchallenged City

301
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,643
"To find Mud Buddha,
first seek the Fire Monkey"

302
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,647
Why do you want to find Mud Buddha?

303
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,482
It is my father's 60th birthday

304
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,985
I want Mud Buddha to wish him well

305
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,989
and tell him he will live
for a hundred years

306
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:16,783
Life is determined by fate

307
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,745
If Mud Buddha were to tell him

308
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,496
he will die on his birthday,

309
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,290
then what?

310
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:24,625
Nonsense!

311
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,670
Unchallenged City is at its strongest

312
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,298
Together with Conquer's Clan,
Father will rule the martial arts world

313
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:35,761
Soon, even you Shaolin monks will have
to let us have our way

314
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,680
Fire Monkey belongs to
the Shaolin Temple

315
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,934
Mud Buddha stole it,
so he must return it

316
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,811
If you refuse to hand it over,
you might not return to Shaolin!

317
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,419
I am Whispering Wind
Pardon my interference

318
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:10,420
Let's go

319
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,006
They're about to fight. Let's go

320
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,926
Old Man, stay and watch what happens

321
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,678
You don't know what is out there

322
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,388
It may be more dangerous

323
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,391
Who dares to be so arrogant?

324
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,142
What a pity

325
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,436
Wind Kick, Frost Fist

326
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,564
Don't you recognise
the Masters of Conquer's Clan?

327
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,274
I thought you are all one family

328
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,033
Sometimes,
quantity doesn't mean anything

329
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,411
We'll soon...

330
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,288
be one family

331
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,124
Why fight among yourselves?

332
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,750
Don't talk nonsense

333
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,962
Don't associate yourself with us

334
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,298
All of you against one monk?

335
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,716
You can't possibly be good men

336
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,010
You're saying
we take advantage of our numbers?

337
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,193
Frost, have we gone too far?

338
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,362
I don't think so
I've only disabled their powers

339
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:19,615
Buddha have pity!

340
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:27,039
Your Holiness, this is my first quest

341
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:30,334
Please make it easy on me
and lend me Fire Monkey

342
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,211
I promise to return it in a month

343
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,963
I told you it belongs to
the Shaolin Temple

344
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,632
If you must take it,

345
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,343
then how are you
any different from those people?

346
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:44,223
Without Fire Monkey,
we can't find Mud Buddha

347
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,933
What shall I tell my Master?

348
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,518
You too are looking for Mud Buddha?

349
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,230
You have no respect for me!

350
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:55,526
That's right!

351
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,527
Shut up!

352
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:03,242
Your Holiness, please help us
We need Fire Monkey

353
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,368
I'm sorry but I cannot oblige

354
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,248
Then, excuse us

355
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,012
Excuse us

356
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,392
Firey!

357
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,439
You can insult me some more if you want

358
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,984
Now that I have Fire Monkey. I'm leaving

359
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,029
Wind!

360
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:44,575
Forget him

361
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,576
Why?

362
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,452
We only needed the Fire Monkey
in order to find Mud Buddha

363
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,037
Now that he is already here,

364
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,455
why bother?

365
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,628
Sir, please do not disguise anymore

366
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,883
So you recognise me

367
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,178
I know
you're a famous master of disguise

368
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:05,888
To keep calm

369
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:06,972
in the face of such chaos...

370
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,307
you're no ordinary man,

371
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,019
and when the innocent girl

372
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,896
cried out to the monkey,

373
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,190
we knew

374
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:21,278
Grandpa, where are they taking Firey?

375
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:26,992
Don't worry, they won't hurt him

376
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:33,040
I revealed too many secrets
about the future

377
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:38,962
and was punished by heaven with boils
all over my body

378
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:44,593
Only Fire Monkey can suck out the poison

379
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,512
and ease my pain

380
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:51,225
Please bring it back to me

381
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,810
Don't worry, sir. We'll try our best

382
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,105
That's good to know

383
00:39:58,941 --> 00:39:59,942
Let's go

384
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,945
Lord Conquer must be anxious to see me

385
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:06,240
After you

386
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,277
Master Fong, you are a great man

387
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,988
3,000 advisors
Loyal subjects everywhere

388
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,157
You have all good things one can desire

389
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:50,951
On this birthday

390
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,578
your only son Ming has given you

391
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,122
a 3-day banquet,

392
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,332
but why is he not here celebrating?

393
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:58,876
He's out...

394
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:02,713
looking for Mud Buddha

395
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,269
Has Conquer's Clan sent anyone?

396
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:18,729
Not yet, Master

397
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,485
Young Master, mission complete

398
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,197
Master Fong looks very happy

399
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,781
Everyone
from Unchallenged City is there,

400
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:32,034
except his only son Ming

401
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,039
We'll strike at 4 a.m.

402
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:38,457
Yes, sir!

403
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,316
Who is it?

404
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:07,945
Forgive my intrusion

405
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,950
Oh, it's Young Master Striding Cloud!

406
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:16,662
My master orders me to bring back
the Unchallenged Sword

407
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,849
People from Conquer's Clan are so vile!

408
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,981
Master, someone is still alive

409
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,031
Please don't kill me!

410
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,700
Finish the job

411
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,293
How did this happen?

412
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,003
Why? Why?

413
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:08,172
Who murdered our whole clan?

414
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,887
What good are you?

415
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,889
What good is Mud Buddha?

416
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:27,024
Fire Monkey is innocent. Don't punish it

417
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:29,902
Your Holiness

418
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,361
I beg Shaolin to seek justice...

419
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,614
Help me seek revenge, and justice

420
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,283
To kill all of Unchallenged City
in one night...

421
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:40,662
Only Conquer's Clan is powerful
enough to do this

422
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,208
Buddha have pity on us

423
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,342
Wind, what are you thinking about?

424
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,346
My father died here

425
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,599
Master rescued me

426
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:03,227
Legend says...

427
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,812
Blood Bodhi fruits grow in Cirrus Cave

428
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:09,399
They heal all diseases
and increase powers

429
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,237
But no one has successfully gone in...

430
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,822
and returned

431
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,078
They say a Fire Beast guards the fruit

432
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:22,996
Master Wind,

433
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,084
do you know anything about
your father's duel?

434
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,838
So you've heard about this?

435
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:39,263
Master said,
it was swordsman Southern Unicorn

436
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,139
He also died in the cave

437
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,562
Promise me one thing

438
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:48,730
Please tell us

439
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:52,985
Little Pigtails has lost her parents

440
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,987
I'm her only family

441
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,865
I want to help her find a foster home

442
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,994
Do you sense something wrong
about this journey?

443
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,872
When a buddha of mud crosses the river,

444
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:10,252
he cannot guarantee safety for himself

445
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:24,600
Father has been murdered

446
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,602
most brutally...

447
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,438
we are all
that's left of Unchallenged City

448
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:32,191
You must help us!

449
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,902
We have to avenge Unchallenged City
and my father

450
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,033
You must help me seek revenge. Revenge!

451
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:23,700
That couple agreed to adopt
Little Pigtails

452
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:27,538
Master Wind is a kind person

453
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:30,791
If everyone in Conquer's Clan
were like you,

454
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,001
the martial arts world would be at peace

455
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:39,675
How is Conquer's other disciple, Cloud?

456
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,845
Cloud is an unpredictable, moody loner

457
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:46,431
But his martial arts is
the best among us all

458
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:49,434
Exactly as destined

459
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,345
Grandpa!

460
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,184
Come back, Grandpa!

461
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:32,477
Grandpa!

462
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,731
Grandpa!

463
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:07,304
"The Dragon is powerful
but will be stranded

464
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:11,683
when Wind and Cloud become a storm"

465
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:18,065
Years ago, you left without a word

466
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:21,527
Leaving me with this piece of junk

467
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,990
Now that the puzzle is revealed

468
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,953
Explain what it means!

469
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:38,418
"Wind and Cloud will make you,
and break you as well"

470
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,422
What does that mean?

471
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,843
One cannot fight against his destiny

472
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:51,431
My Lord's ten years of good fortune
has passed

473
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:56,854
It is now the turning point of your life

474
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,694
"Wind and Cloud will make you,
and break you as well"

475
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:08,740
Obviously, it means that my life is now
under the control of wind and cloud

476
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:13,036
But does that wind and cloud...

477
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:20,586
mean my disciples
Whispering Wind and Striding Cloud?

478
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:25,632
It is inevitable that
the servant will usurp the master

479
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:30,179
This is destiny. Mortals cannot fight it

480
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,770
Destiny?

481
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,982
I don't believe in destiny or fate

482
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:49,907
My Lord was a great believer until now

483
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,912
Mortals are like that

484
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:59,208
Believing in good fortunes,
but not believing in bad ones

485
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,503
Deceiving themselves!

486
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,216
We are the masters of our own destiny!

487
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:11,512
I hold my destiny in my own hands

488
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,308
I will change my fate!

489
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:42,543
"Cloud"

490
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:52,135
"Wind"

491
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,881
Four famous weapons
of the martial arts world...

492
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:33,177
One blade. Three swords
All priceless treasures

493
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:39,016
Blizzard Blade is buried in Cirrus Cave

494
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,187
The Ultimate Sword has never been found

495
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:47,357
Fire Unicorn Sword
and the Unchallenged Sword

496
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,613
are both mine. I am pleased

497
00:51:56,783 --> 00:52:01,330
Cloud, you didn't disappoint me

498
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,207
You taught me well

499
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,501
Good!

500
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:09,505
Father!

501
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:14,301
Behave like a lady

502
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,345
I heard Cloud had returned

503
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,514
I just wanted to see him

504
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,642
Thank you for your concern

505
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,519
Who's concerned about you?

506
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,355
I'm concerned about what you owe me

507
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:27,523
Did you bring them?

508
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,943
What does Cloud owe you?

509
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:35,239
Father,
your passion is to collect famous swords

510
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:36,365
I'm a collector, too

511
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,534
I am fond of interesting stones

512
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,620
Cloud owes me 19 colourful stones

513
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:49,670
Ridiculous!

514
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,548
My Lord! My Lord!

515
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,552
Masters Frost and Wind have returned

516
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:57,553
Where are they?

517
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,138
They are outside, and dare not enter

518
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:11,859
Get up!

519
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:18,282
You lost Mud Buddha due to inexperience

520
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:20,868
Thank you, Master
Thank you, Master

521
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,454
But Cloud succeeded,

522
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:27,457
and brought back the Unchallenged Sword

523
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,002
I'm going back to my chambers

524
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:42,181
Striding Cloud's mood is
like a wild horse... unpredictable

525
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,892
It's been ten years,

526
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,478
with Fong's death...

527
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:52,191
I'll hear from Sword Saint soon

528
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:55,611
We'll finish our duel from ten years ago

529
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,197
I must intensively train

530
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,324
my Trinity Strength

531
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:03,368
Come here

532
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,377
Before I go into seclusion,

533
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:15,047
I must settle something

534
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,634
Among my three disciples,
you have the kindest heart

535
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,305
Wind, it is my wish that
you marry my daughter

536
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,516
I will arrange for a date

537
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,938
Charity, don't you like Wind?

538
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:34,942
Don't ask me

539
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:38,987
Look after her

540
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:47,079
Master, let's discuss marriage later

541
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:52,417
Your father and I had betrothed you
to each other

542
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,379
I didn't tell you earlier

543
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:57,840
because it wasn't the right time

544
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:03,136
You and Charity have grown up together

545
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:05,264
What a perfect match

546
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,932
If you do not consent

547
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:11,270
I will be greatly disappointed

548
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,858
Congratulations, Wind

549
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:26,952
Skinny, Girlie, let me tell you...

550
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,413
father wants me to marry Wind

551
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:33,750
Well, I do like Wind...

552
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:38,630
but I also like Cloud

553
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,070
Charity, it's me, Wind

554
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,079
Wind

555
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:12,664
I want to talk to you

556
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:19,505
Come in

557
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,924
This is not Sword Grave
You won't be punished

558
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,385
I will be brief

559
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:26,345
Go ahead

560
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:30,807
I remember when Master brought me here,

561
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,060
you were the first to offer me some tea

562
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:36,104
I felt very warm

563
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:39,942
Father said if he hadn't rescued you,

564
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,944
you would've been eaten by wolves

565
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,239
I remember

566
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,784
So when he mentioned about
marriage today,

567
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:50,661
I was very happy

568
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,666
But I know love must
come from both sides

569
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:58,669
I don't know
whether this is Master's wish,

570
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:01,547
Or if it is your own wish?

571
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:11,306
But if this is not what you want,
I won't force you

572
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,176
Does Charity know about this?

573
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:53,015
I'm the one to decide
She has to accept it

574
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:56,894
Your eyes,

575
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,022
they're the same as
when I took you in ten years ago

576
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,028
If you're unhappy about this

577
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,448
you may be excused from attending
the wedding banquet

578
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:21,919
Doctor Yu

579
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,797
You're the most respected person
in our village,

580
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,635
You must help us

581
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,932
You heal us when we are ill

582
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:39,937
You mediate our fights for us

583
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,315
We respect you the most

584
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:48,779
We have had bad harvests,
and Conquer's Clan taxes are high

585
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:52,366
We can barely survive

586
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:55,536
Please help us

587
00:58:56,662 --> 00:59:00,666
I will go and speak with Conquer and

588
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:02,084
explain your hardship

589
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:04,253
Thank you, Doctor Yu

590
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,839
Thank you Please get up...

591
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:17,266
Go home

592
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,644
Muse and I will go within these few days

593
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:24,857
Let's go home

594
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:25,983
Muse

595
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:36,159
Father, your arm is burning again

596
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,872
It does not seem to belong to me,

597
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:45,169
sometimes it hurts so much

598
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:54,178
They say I can heal all diseases

599
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,471
But I cannot heal myself

600
00:59:57,598 --> 01:00:00,350
Father,
are we really going to Conquer's Clan?

601
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,605
Wonderful! I can go see the world

602
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:07,774
I can learn to mingle, and explore

603
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:09,735
What did you say?

604
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,323
Just babbling

605
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,667
Welcome!

606
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,087
Master Frost! Master Frost!

607
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:30,923
Here, try it on

608
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:32,799
Jester, what are you doing?

609
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:35,093
The groom will have to tie this on

610
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,346
Do me a favor, see how it looks

611
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:42,351
You look pale and sick

612
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:44,228
Not as pale as you!

613
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,940
Charity is getting married
Are you depressed?

614
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,108
No. Who said so?

615
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,236
I watched you all grow up

616
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:53,529
I can see through everything

617
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:57,783
If you love someone,
you only wish her to be happy

618
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:00,118
Wind has a kind heart

619
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:03,789
It is good that Charity is marrying him

620
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,918
Congratulations!

621
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:10,963
Such a tremendous event

622
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:13,841
I wouldn't miss it for the world

623
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,301
It's the groom! Congratulations!

624
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,263
I hear
your fiancee is pretty as a flower

625
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:20,430
I'm not the groom

626
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:21,265
I am...

627
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,977
I'm Frost of Conquer's Clan

628
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,271
Welcome, on behalf of my Master

629
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:32,651
So you're the famous Frost

630
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:35,279
Lord Conquer has three disciples

631
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:38,282
Fists, Palms, Kicks

632
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:41,869
Each has a speciality
Too bad they don't use swords

633
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,288
You are so crazy about swords

634
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,458
You must be the one known as Seedy Sword

635
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:49,459
That's right!

636
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,639
Father, look over there

637
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:07,311
I am Doctor Yu from the Lake region,

638
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:08,896
representing 320 villages of 16 towns

639
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,772
I seek a meeting with Lord Conquer

640
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:12,191
Your invitation?

641
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,651
Is there a celebration?

642
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,653
Oh, good!

643
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,989
I have never been to a banquet!

644
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:22,201
Please tell me,
is it a birthday, marriage,

645
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:23,076
or a birth?

646
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:24,620
Muse

647
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,206
There're so many people anyway

648
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,917
One more
or one less wouldn't even matter

649
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:31,585
Please let us go in to take a look

650
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:34,046
What is it?

651
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,923
Jester I am Doctor Yu...

652
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:38,300
Mr. White Face, can you let us in?

653
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,220
What a smell! It stinks!

654
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,804
It's the scent of a woman

655
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,515
Women?

656
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:46,600
We pick herbal medicines
in the mountains

657
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,060
These are the smells of herbs

658
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,229
You pick medicinal herbs?

659
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:53,357
Then you must be Heal-all Doctor Yu
with the Fire Beast Arm?

660
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:54,233
That's right

661
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:56,944
I thank you on behalf of Lord Conquer

662
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,655
Come in, we'll talk after the banquet

663
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:04,076
Look after yourself

664
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,416
Leave us

665
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:12,918
Yes, my Lord

666
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:15,671
Father

667
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:27,558
It's your wedding day today
It makes me miss your mother

668
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,562
You look a lot like her

669
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:35,399
Do I really?

670
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:41,697
She died giving birth to you

671
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:47,995
All these years,
though I've had other women,

672
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,998
the one I love the most...

673
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:55,460
is your mother

674
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:01,758
I always thought
you had a heart of stone

675
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:07,764
Charity...

676
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:13,437
Do you know what I wish?

677
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:17,191
Not for the best martial art

678
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,068
Not to be ruler of the world

679
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:24,072
But to see...

680
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,784
my daughter live a happy life

681
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:33,498
I wish you to marry well

682
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:41,798
Father
