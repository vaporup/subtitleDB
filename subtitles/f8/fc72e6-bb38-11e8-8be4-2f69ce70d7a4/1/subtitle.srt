As the tribal age of darkness

00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,395
and incantation was coming to its end
with the birth of new kingdoms

5
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,420
the kingdom of Shilla, founded by
PARK Hyokkose began to annex

00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,455
nearby tribes with its military
power Auta The Leader of Moon

7
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,330
Tribe PARK Hyokkose
The First Emperor of Shilla

8
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,577
Why do you bear such hatred
to kill my people?

9
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:46,655
How can I forgive those who disgrace
my land with wicked spells

10
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,225
Your land?

11
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,189
We have resided here as long as
that Great Tree had been!

12
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,701
How dare you to claim
this land as yours?

13
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,770
I had given you a chance to
become a servant of my kingdom

14
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,307
but you've refused!

15
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,405
I'll grind your skin and
bones into ashes!

16
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:52,151
As long as this sword is here, you
will not trouble the world again!

THE LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE

18
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,372
896 A.D. - The 9th year under the
reign of Queen Chinsong of Shilla

19
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:41,560
The rebels are everywhere and our
people are crossing the border...

20
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,668
Our country is in distress

21
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,904
They say a hero is born
in troubled times

22
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,243
If you could help us to...
CHUNG Jun-ho

23
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,781
I never heard of a subject choosing
it's own monarch KIM Hyo-jin

00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,215
Do not misunderstand
KIM Hae-ri CHOI Won-seok

25
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,123
I meant people suffer because of
monarch's wrongdoing

26
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,289
Then, you must faithfully
serve Her Majesty

27
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,266
One only sees
what he wishes to see

28
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:32,343
I'm helpless to protect Shilla
alone from all the rebels

29

The Great Emperor of Shilla

30
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:43,525
please grant me the strength to defend
the 1000 year sovereignty of Shilla.

31
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,043

00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,143
Hold your tongue.

46
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,806
You haven't even engaged in a
decent battle, General BANG.

47
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:31,021

was ever given to me. Assistant Director LEE Jin-gu

51
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,426
How will we control the overwhelming
power of the rebels?

52
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:21,435
We have to make sure our people
do not sympathize with them

53
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:28,843
Your Majesty, we should send an envoy
to China and await for their reply.

54
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,915
I'm afraid China will attack Shilla
under the pretext of reinforcements.

55
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,913
You must abolish the aristocratic
system and find men of ability.

56
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,957
I believe your duty is in National
Defense, not in domestic affairs.

57
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,494
You should mind your own duties.

58
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,126
Quiet.

59
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,700
The country is filled with thieves and

60
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,776
the palace is filled with conspiracies
to over throw the throne.

61
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,980
Biharang!

62
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,453
Will you stay and protect
me till the end?

63
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,691
Your Majesty, I'll do my best
as your royal servant.

64
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,607
Biharang.

65
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,347
Your Majesty.

66
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,285
Jaunbie was the name?

67
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,791
Don't get caught up with
a peasant like her.

68
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,242
Master, how have you been?

69
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,609
Your wound seems severe. It
must've been a fierce battle.

70
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,185
I'll be ok. Please don't be
worried about me.

71
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,787
General!

72
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,174
Will you marry me?

73
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,420
About Biharang's girl...

74
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,586
Her father was executed
for helping the rebels.

75
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,032
Your Majesty, how can you trust a
man who refuses marriage proposals

76
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,596
from royal families for
a peasant girl?

77
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,114
I have killed too many to
save my country.

78
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,829
That is your fate.

79
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,436
If you hold on to a passing fate,
it becomes yours.

80
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:45,089
Your Majesty! The rebels have
invaded Mujinju.

81
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,257
Their force is too strong. We
must send Gen. Biharang.

82
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,459
The Capital was recently attacked
by the revolting peasants.

83
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,330
Send Gen. KIM instead to
Mujinju for the back up!

84
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,169
Your Majesty!

85
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,417
Your Majesty, the rebels have
captured Mujinju!

86
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,158
What happened to
the governor of Mujinju?

87
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,593
He was killed mercilessly.

88
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,498
Your Majesty, only Gen. Biharang
can save us from the rebels.

89
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,449
Your Majesty, losing Daeya Fortress
will put Shilla in a great danger.

90
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,785
Allow me to defend Shilla
from the rebels.

91
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,347
I've put you back out in the
battlefield, again.

92
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,620
That is my duty.

93
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,162
Already 9 years have passed.

94
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,103
If there weren't so many battles,

95
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,772
you and I could've been together.

96
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,808
Back then...

97
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,410
I needed Prime Minister Wihong to
protect the throne.

98
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,280
However,

99
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,354
the only one I ever cherished in
my heart was...

100
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,619
Your Majesty.

101
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,595
I heard he was concerned about you
even on his death bed.

102
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,503
Yes, he was.

103
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,050
Biharang,

104
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,625
if the battle becomes too critical,
spare yourself and return to me.

105
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,419
General!

106
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,288
It will protect you.

107
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,587
You must be strong. Love turns
into hatred when it's broken.

108
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,510
- General BANG,
- Yes, sir.

109
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:20,320
Her Majesty shows too much
affection to Gen. Biharang...

110
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,226
General has been seriously
wounded. Come with me now.

111
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,538
Don't blame me for killing you.
I'm only carrying out an order.

112
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,091
Talwi!

113
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,805
Let's get a little taste
before we kill her.

114
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,290
I must be off. Take care of
the rest thoroughly.

115
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,358
There might be an ambush.
You shouldn't go alone.

116
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,452
The sword has vanished.

117
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,283
This place gives me creeps.

118
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,190
Let's get out of here quick.

119
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,294
Jaunbie!

120
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,896
Jaunbie!

121
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,500
Jaunbie!

122
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,404
Jaunbie!

123
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,178
Let's split up and look for her.

124
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,678
Be careful!

125
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,317
Jaunbie!

126
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,133
Jaunbie!

127
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,806
Jaunbie!

128
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,812
Jaunbie!

129
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,070
Jaunbie!

130
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,206
- Jaunbie!
- General!

131
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,674
Jaunbie!

132
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,075
General!

133
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,280
Get off me!

134
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,853
- General! It's no use!
- Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

135
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,198
Though she wanted to be my wife...

136
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,100
she never asked me of anything.

137
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,539
And she never said anything

138
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,579
for she feared she might
hinder my future.

139
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,523
The seal set by Emperor Hyokkose
1000 years ago has been broken.

140
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:13,802
And, now the evil spirit
of Auta is free again.

141
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,301
Auta! Who is he?

142
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,802
Before the time of Shilla, there were
many tribes who shared this land.

143
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,678
Auta was a leader
of one of the tribes.

144
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:38,118
My ancestors were commissioned by
Emperor Hyokkose to guard the seal.

145
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,656
The duty was passed down
to me for thousand years.

146
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,134
And Jaunbie was to succeed me...

147
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,202
General,

148
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,970
on my way home, I saw
officers dressed in black.

149
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,211
One of them had a large
scar on his face.

150
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,380
Aren't they the Royal Guards?

151
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,870
Who dare stops us?

152
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,065
Kill them!

153
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,905
General!

154
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,781
Bitch!

155
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,608
You're not aware of what your
officers have done?

156
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:11,041
How dare you to treat me, the Chief
of the Royal Guards, like a soldier?

157
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,545
Besides, this affair is
none of your concern.

158
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,386
Do you mean Her Majesty
ordered Jaunbie to be killed?

159
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,214
- I did not say that!
- Then, did you?

160
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,023
I know Jaunbie's father was a rebel.

161
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,893
You might fool Her Majesty
with your fake loyalty

162
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,064
but I know your dark intentions.

163
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:35,538
It terribly worries me that you're
in Her Majesty's good graces.

164
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,935
General!

165
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,715
Did you order Jaunbie to be killed?

166
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,251
What are you talking about?

167
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,059
One of your Royal Guards
tried to kill her.

168
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,622
I don't understand.

169
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,665
Your Majesty, you have no
connection with this incident?

170
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,302
Your anger soars to the skies.

171
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,072
- Put down your sword!
- You have or you have not?

172
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,782
How dare you to march in here
with a sword in your hand?

173
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,056
Throw away your sword!

174
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,960
Get her!

175
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,206
Close the gate!

176
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:47,829
That way!

177
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:03,878
Kill her!

178
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,629
Away with you.

179
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,201
So...

180
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,542
did you find out whose doing?

181
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,338
Please punish me for my disloyalty.

182
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,609
I could punish you for treason.

183
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,189
However, I could understand the
circumstances that you're under.

184
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,594
Keep your mind at ease and rise.

185
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:07,930
Your Majesty.

186
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,145
I've thought about you every moment.

187
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,117
Biharang.

188
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,736
Who are you?

189
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,603
Where is Biharang?

190
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,705
Biharang!

191
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,181
Guards!

192
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,217
Guards!

193
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,453
Guards!

194
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,064
Did you not hear me?

195
00:46:56,613 --> 00:47:00,014
Your people do not change
even after 1000 years.

196
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,586
Trying to take away the only
thing that is left!

197
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:21,428
Starting with you, I'll eliminate
every living thing on this land.

198
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,563
The dead does not belong in a living
body! Come out of her at once!

199
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,604
Kill her!

200
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,723
Jaunbie...

201
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,897
She's no longer Jaunbie!

202
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,411
Talwi!

203
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,132
The Great Emperor of Shilla,

204
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,599
with this Sacred Sword, may
the evil spirit be defeated!

205
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,221
Biharang!

206
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,658
Talwi!

207
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,497
Talwi!

208
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:13,987
General!

209
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,603
Jaunbie!

210
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:32,741
Jaunbie!

211
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,481
- What are you doing?
- Put away your sword.

212
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,124
- General, she's the evil spirit!
- Talwi!

213
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,326
She's not Jaunbie.

214
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,459
If we don't kill her now, we
cannot destroy the evil spirit.

215
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,191
She's Jaunbie.

216
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,432
I can tell by the way
she looks at me.

217
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,037
- General!
- Believe me this once.

218
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,374
We don't have much time.

219
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,115
How can she possibly resist the
monstrous power of the evil spirit?

220
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,850
She's over there!

221
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,384
Talwi!

222
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,089
Get her!

223
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,178
Get him!

224
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,657
That deceitful peasant girl must've
approached Biharang

225
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,088
to get to you, Your Majesty.

226
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,792
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

227
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,135
However, since Biharang
protected her,

228
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,102
perhaps, they planned this together.

229
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:50,039
Then they are rebels! We must
order them be caught and be killed.

230
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,581
First, we must find their hideout.
What happened with Talwi?

231
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,653
He's not saying a word.

232
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,785
Your Majesty, since this is a critical
time, we should hold a trial.

233
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,458
A trial?

234
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:28,140
Why don't you talk? You shouldn't
be enduring all these sufferings.

235
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,749
It's not even your fault.

236
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,884
I did not fulfil my duty of
serving my general.

237
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,858
So, kill me.

238
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,466
Master!

239
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:36,594
Master!

240
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:44,377
I can't believe you sucked out the
poison from his wound.

241
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,060
It will protect you.

242
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,183
My promise of protecting
the 1000 year sovereignty

243
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,251
was a futile promise.

244
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,119
I couldn't even protect you...

245
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:39,929
Jaunbie.

246
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,396
General.

247
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,838
I've been having nightmares.

248
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,039
Do not be worried.

249
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,906
You'll feel better when you
get some sleep.

250
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,798
Drink.

251
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,781
I also hope for the safety
of Gen. Biharang.

252
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:41,594
I greatly honour your loyalty to your
general. However,

253
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,630
what if

254
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,166
Jaunbie truly is the evil spirit?

255
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:57,278
What if Biharang has been
bewitched by the evil spirit?

256
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,175
What if all was a devious
plan of the evil spirit?

257
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,451
It could've been its evil plan to
bewitch Biharang from the beginning.

258
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,259
It's sad.

259
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,300
Who would help him
in his time of troubles?

260
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,537
Talwi will lead us. Hurry.

261
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,839
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,488
She just fell asleep.

263
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:29,194
Tonight, a bloody moon that holds
the hatred of 1000 years, will rise.

264
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,035
When the darkness hides the moon,

265
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,306
the evil spirit will regain
its full strength.

266
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,546
Then, even the Sacred Sword
will be powerless.

267
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,653
Then what about Jaunbie?

268
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:54,589
If you could keep her away from the
moon, you might be able to save her.

269
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,360
Since her desire to be
with you is so great.

270
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,630
If I can't keep her away, then what
would happen to her?

271
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,340
She'll be nothing but an empty shell.

272
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:12,539
It would be Jaunbie outside, but
she'll be Auta inside.

273
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,888
We must sacrifice one life
to save millions.

274
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,108
Jaunbie!

275
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,415
I'm scared.

276
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,285
Jaunbie!

277
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,337
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

278
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:33,454
It's too late for me. You must
go and save the General.

279
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,453
He's at the lake.

280
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,584
Hurry!

281
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,163
Let's go!

282
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,955
General Bang has left the palace
to kill the evil spirit.

283
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,863
- Did he bring any men with him?
- Only about 100 men.

284
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:22,393
And Her Majesty followed
him in secrecy.

285
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,851
Lead the way. I'll meet with
Biharang personally.

286
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,716
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,190
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!
You must fight it off!

288
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,478
Jaunbie!

289
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,216
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

290
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,250
Jaunbie!

291
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,421
General...

292
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:26,019
If I can't be who I was again,

293
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,529
I want you to kill me yourself.

294
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,656
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! You must fight!

295
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,052
Jaunbie!

296
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,623
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Please!

297
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,530
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

298
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:18,804
Jaunbie!

299
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,242
Jaunbie!

300
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,122
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

301
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,895
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

302
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,064
Jaunbie!

303
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,511
Your Majesty, I'll go look first.

304
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,039
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

305
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:23,070
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

306
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,672
Jaunbie!

307
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,650
Jaunbie!

308
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:46,258
General...

309
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:47,827
Jaunbie!

310
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,100
Master! Are you ok?

311
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,137
It's all over.

312
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,540
The evil spirit will take over
the Kingdom of Shilla.

313
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,508
- General!
- Biharang!

314
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,887
Here is the mighty general.

315
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,684
Where did you hide her?

316
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,023
I can defeat the evil spirit.

317
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:58,127
Just give me more time.

318
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,669
Draw!

319
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,870
I'll kill anyone

320
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,772
who gets in my way.

321
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,149
Stop!

322
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,667
General Bang! Whose order
were you following

323
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,964
when it was not I who ordered
you to shoot Biharang?

324
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:39,666
Withdraw!

325
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,110
Biharang!

326
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:53,846
Biharang!

327
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,403
Your Majesty, I cannot bear to
watch this with my own eyes.

328
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,102
Destroying your own country for
a shallow passion.

329
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,441
You're no different from
a bitch in heat.

330
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:20,181
How dare you to plot treason!

331
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,746
General Bang!

332
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,498
This is Her Majesty. Put down
your swords.

333
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:46,906
I pity your girl. She should've died
when she was supposed to.

334
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:50,838
It was YOU!

335
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,379
General Bang!

336
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,936
What are you waiting for?
Kill them all!

337
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,117
Your Majesty!

338
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,186
Is there any way we can destroy
the evil spirit?

339
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:25,425
It's hatred is too great
for us to bear.

340
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:29,061
So the 1000 year sovereign of
Shilla must end here?

341
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:36,865
How about the Sacred Sword?

342
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,341
The one that the Great Emperor used
to seal off the evil spirit.

343
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,134
It no longer has any power.

344
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,039
If not the Sacred Sword...

345
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,777
Then, can I do nothing but just
watch my kingdom fall apart?

346
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:12,831
Jaunbie.

347
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:35,418
Jaunbie!

348
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:37,756
It's me!

349
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,758
Please come back.

350
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,427
Please.

351
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,056
I do not know how great
your hatred is,

352
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,094
but I'll take the blame for all.

353
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,864
Let go of Jaunbi.

354
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,833
Take me instead! Take me!

355
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:58,272
General!

356
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:06,445
Talwi!

357
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,382
Talwi! Talwi!

358
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,765
It is not her.

359
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:27,273
Let her rest... in peace...

360
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:29,609
Talwi! Talwi!

361
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,708
Talwi!

362
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:47,220
If it was a sin for a queen of
one country to love a man,

363
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:52,228
then take me instead.

364
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:54,960
My people are innocent.

365
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,796
Stab her heart!

366
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,532
General.

367
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,230
Jaunbie.

368
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:19,301
Thank you.

369
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,166
Biharang!

370
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:20,210
6 month after Queen Chinsong left
the throne to her nephew Yoh,

371
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:23,246
she died in The North Palace.
38 years later,

372
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,953
the thousand year old
history of Shilla came to an end.
