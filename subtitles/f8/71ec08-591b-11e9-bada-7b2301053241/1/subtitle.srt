00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,077
[Man] It only happens
once a year, and then they die.

2
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,083
It's like a mating ritual or something.

3
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,150
Isn't that romantic?

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:06,290
[Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, it is.

5
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,104
- [Woman] Chris!
- Dude, what the fuck?

6
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,117
- [Woman 2] That's so not cool.
- [Woman 1] God! You scared me.

7
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,618
- Sorry.
- What happened?

8
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,655
- Shit. They're gone.
- You hit a deer or something?

9
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,986
- They're usually right here.
- Sit down.

10
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,959
- The party's that way.
- The party's this way.

11
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,087
- Danny.
- Come on, it's prom night.

[Danny] Yeah!

Class of '03, kiss my ass!

16
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,475
Now look.

17
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,508
My God. They're so beautiful.

18
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,683
Look, look. You can grab the light.

20
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,137
- Jesus!
- It's not funny.

21
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,671
- You can turn the lights back on.
- Come on.

22
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,273
- They were so beautiful.
- Told you, right?

23
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,809
- Please. You're freaking me out.
- There's more up there.

24
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,082
- Now!
- Hang on.

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,647
- Turn on the goddamn lights!
- Chris...

26
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,056
All right.

28
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,690
<i>[Chris] I wake up.</i>

29
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,069
<i>Turn off the alarm.</i>

30
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,743

We're just doing one day, OK?
No big deal.

49
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,995
And time.

50
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,332
It's OK, chief. It's not a test.

- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,835
That's a nice hug.

56
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,674
Want anything?

57
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,478
[Man] Hi.

58
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,750
- What are you having?
- Hot chocolate.

59
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,815
- I'll have that. Thanks.
- OK.

60
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,056
- Any problems this week?
- Nope.

61
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,099
Swearing? Crying?

62
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,532
- Sequencing or memory issues?
- No.

63
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,900
Taking your meds?

64
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,338
- So all's good.
- Why? What's Lewis say?

65
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,844
You're the only one who can talk about
what's going on with you.

66
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,744
Well, in that case, I'm great.

67
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,805
There you go.

68
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,010
- Careful. It's hot.
- I know.

69
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,515
Have you spoken to Mr. Tuttle yet?

70
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,753
- No. I will.
- When?

71
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,819
- You were a model before.
- Chris...

72
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,027
I was just wondering how you go from
being a model to being a case manager.

73
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,561
After my head injury I realized there
were more people in the world than me.

74
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,869
Wanna go to a movie with me sometime?

75
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,071
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on. It's just a movie.

76
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,613
We should talk about the women
in your life.

77
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,777
- You mean besides you?
- Yeah. Is there anybody?

78
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,146
Think you should do something
about that?

79
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,193
I think about fucking you all the time.

80
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,394
I don't think they heard that
over by the door.

81
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,764
- I didn't mean it like that. I meant...
- I know what you meant.

82
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,167
Would you have said that
before your injury?

83
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,400
So now you're gonna bring up
the frontal lobe bullshit?

84
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,877
Disinhibition. That might be getting
in the way of your meeting someone.

85
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,314
Asking a stranger for sex isn't
the best way to start a relationship.

86
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,748
- Not a good one.
- You're not a stranger.

87
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,050
- I have a relationship with you.
- I'm paid to work with you.

88
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,286
- Why are you here?
- You tell me.

89
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,660
I know why I'm here.

90
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,531
I'm here to help you get what you want.
What you really want.

91
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,935
But you've gotta know
what that is first.

92
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,664
I just wanna be who I was.

[Man 2] Hello, 1-800-Flowers.

104
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:20,180
Ma'am, if I can send them to my own
mother, anyone can send them to anybody.

105
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,188
And it just so happens to be
our featured special. Uh-huh.

106
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:29,125
Let's see. It's got roses and lilies
and snapdragons and fuji mums.

107
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,155
Australiums, which smell awesome,
unlike tulips, which don't smell at all.

108
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,896
<i>[Chris] Lewis, I can't find
the motherfucking can opener!</i>

109
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,428
They should last
about a week or two. That's right.

110
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,533
Terrific. And your name?

111
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,942
Kathy. Is that with a C or a K?

112
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,107
K. Kathy with a K.
That's a beautiful name, Kathy.

113
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,790
Chris?

114
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,867
I don't smell dinner.

115
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,100
Chris?

116
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,992
I'm sorry, Lewis.

117
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,175
- Feel better?
- Yeah, thanks.

118
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,442
Chop some lettuce, cucumber, whatever
else you might want for your salad.

119
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,753
- Let's talk about your afternoon.
- We had to write again.

120
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,881
Oh, yeah? Let me guess.
Topic A, "Why am I all fucked up?"

121
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,415
Or topic B,
"Living with being all fucked up."

122
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:14,433
Reggie had us list a typical day,
and I kept getting stuck on "I wake up."

123
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,460
- I couldn't think of just a list.
- Well, don't think of it as a list.

124
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,098
Think of it as a story instead.

125
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,637
A story like what?

126
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,044
Like, you know,
"Once upon a time I woke up,

127
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,084
took a piss, beat off in the shower..."

128
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,450
- How is that gonna help me?
- I don't know.

129
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,752
Stories are what help us
make sense of the world.

130
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,554
- I can't tell stories.
- Use one you already know.

131
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,686
<i>OK. How about War and fucking Peace?</i>

132
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,630
That's a story.
I'd start a little simpler, though.

133
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,759
<i>How about Goldilocks
and the Three fucking Bears?</i>

134
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,826
Where's the cucumber?

135
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,937
<i>- Come on. Let's hear it.
- You want me to tell you Goldilocks?</i>

136
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,002
Entertain me.

137
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,484
OK. Once upon a time, there was
a little girl named Goldilocks.

138
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,713
- And then?
- And then...

139
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,757
I don't know, man.
She got eaten by a wolf.

140
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,088
Fucking hit by a truck. This is stupid.

141
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,257
Start at the end. Can't tell a story
if you don't know where it's going.

142
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,459
<i>And lose the wolf.
That's Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

143
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,506
The three bears find Goldilocks
asleep in their beds.

144
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,236
And then, um, she takes off.

145
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,144
Exactly. All right, now, that's the end.
What happened before that?

146
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:41,119
Um, one goes, "Someone's been sleeping
in my bed, and she's still there."

147
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,350
And before that it was,
"Someone is sitting in my chair."

148
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,415
Yeah, and then the bear kid's chair's
all jacked up.

149
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,519
Then it goes all the way back
to her walking in the door.

150
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,362
- First she walks in the forest.
- You sequence just fine.

151
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:59,530
You just gotta start at the end,
work backwards. Write that down.

152
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,974
- Hi, Mrs. Lange.
- Hi, Chris.

153
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,173
- He's in a good mood.
- Oh, OK.

154
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,012
- Good night.
- Good night.

155
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,424
The harvest checks go out
in a week or so.

156
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,430
That means we're going to be very busy
the next few weeks.

157
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,765
Which is why I want you to write down

158
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,102
"bank extra clean"
in your little notebook.

159
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,164
Good night.

160
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,976
Mr. Tuttle?

161
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,414
I'd like to apply to the executive
training program in Wichita,

162
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,478
but before I can, I have to have worked
100 hours as a teller at the branch.

163
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,183
- Take that up with Mrs. Lange.
- I have already.

164
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,022
We've been practicing.
She gave me some money.

165
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,085
She what?

166
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,154
See?

167
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,632
You said you'd think about
giving me some hours at a window.

168
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,229
You have to be able
to keep track of the debits.

169
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,639
A good teller is primarily
a good counter.

170
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,303
A teller keeps track of money
all day long,

171
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,712
taking care to keep the corners on bills
facing the same way.

172
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,774
At the end...

173
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,681
Um... The end...

174
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,950
Ends...

175
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
At the end... At the end of the day,

176
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,493
the teller balances the cash
against the payout tickets.

177
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,831
A good teller can go for years
without being out of balance.

178
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,394
Mrs. Lange has never been
out of balance yet.

179
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,339
But the real key
is a friendly personality.

180
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,868
The motto of a teller is,
"Be friendly and accurate."

181
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,710
- "But mostly be accurate."
- Very good, Chris.

182
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,684
Mrs. Lange also says the women's
bathroom fixture needs a new bulb.

183
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,744
Good night.

184
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,931
<i>[Announcer] He'll scoop the puck
into the right corner.</i>

185
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,063
<i>Hartigan will center it
to the far boards.</i>

186
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,906
<i>Defense pushed it back to the line
to Lidstrom into the corner for Lang.</i>

187
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:56,744
<i>Lang floats it back to Lidstrom,
skating on the blue line with it.</i>

188
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:02,447
<i>Now fires a rising shot. Kicked aside.
But a goal pass by Pascal Leclaire.</i>

189
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,957
<i>[Raises volume] Trevor Letowski
carries it out to center ice.</i>

190
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:11,190
<i>A glove save. Now the puck bounces
away from Lidstrom out to center.</i>

191
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,663
<i>In pursuit Manny Malhotra.</i>

192
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,166
<i>Detroit played better
in the first period.</i>

193
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,066
<i>Malhotra is all over Williams,</i>

194
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,368
<i>forcing the Red Wings to have
a power play in their own zone.</i>

195
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,876
<i>Here comes Lidstrom
over the Columbus line.</i>

196
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,605
<i>Drop pass. Samuelson with a shot.</i>

197
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,449
Passed to Danny Stevens.
Stevens back to Pratt.

198
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,047
<i>Lidstrom right down the center.</i>

199
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,120
Fakes it left.

200
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,028
Pratt fakes a shot on the right
and dekes out the goalie.

201
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,960
- [Horn blaring]
- [Crowd cheering]

202
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,701
<i>I think Mark...</i>

203
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,546
<i>Game is tied...</i>

204
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,083
<i>And there's Holmstrom,
Johnny-on-the-spot, to fire it in...</i>

205
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,990
You cannot be serious.

206
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,794
That is pathetic.

207
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,938
That's Chris Pratt.

208
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,617
Put that fucking thing out.

209
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,500
<i>[# 78 Saab: No Illusions]</i>

210
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,571
- Can I get you something?
- Yeah, an O'Doul's, please.

211
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,310
Yep.

212
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,022
This lady calls me over and she's, like,
"How many Dorothys live in Kansas?"

213
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,120
Hey.

214
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,723
Can you break a fifty?
Like, tens and fives?

215
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,236
Damn. And I thought I was good-Iooking.

216
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,806
- You having a good time?
- So far.

217
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,278
Well, that's all that matters, right?

218
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,338
Enjoy yourself.

219
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,085
Hey, Chris Pratt, right?

220
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,386
Gary Spargo. We know each other.

221
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,359
I was a couple of years ahead
in your sister's class.

222
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,761
We went out a couple of times,
but never took.

223
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,231
How's she doing, anyway? Alison, right?

224
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,293
Yeah, she's good, man.
She's married. She has a baby.

225
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,737
<i>- Just my luck.
- [phone ringing]</i>

226
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,537
- Well, it was nice seeing you, anyway.
- Yeah.

227
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,602
- You say hello to Alison for me.
- OK.

228
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,945
- Yeah. Where are you?
- It's 2.50, chief.

229
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,816
Ten, twenty, thirty, five, forty...

230
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,082
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

231
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,090
- Sorry, how much?
- 2.50.

232
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,992
That's not my problem.
I guess I'll see you later. OK, bye.

233
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,758
- Do you need any change with that?
- No, keep it.

234
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,824
- Thanks, chief.
- Whoa. Excuse me, uh... T.J.

235
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,396
You must be one hell of a bartender,
$17 tip for a $3 beer.

236
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,499
- What can I say?
- You can say, "It's on the house."

237
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,704
- It's not a problem.
- No, no, no, no.

238
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,875
He insists. Don't you, chief?

239
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,975
Yeah. Whatever.

240
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,620
Prick. Shit, I apologize
for that guy, Chris.

241
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,624
[Chris] No, it's OK.

242
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,686
You know, I find myself apologizing
for people pretty often these days.

243
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:12,437
I heard something happened to you.
So, what was it? Motorcycle accident?

244
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,132
If you don't mind me asking.
I'm just curious.

245
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,801
It was a car accident.
I was driving at night

246
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:22,540
and I hit a combine that was stalled
in the middle of the road, old Route 24.

247
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,606
Well, how does a thing like that happen?

248
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,618
- I had the lights off.
- Really?

249
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,851
They say I got thrown 90 feet.

250
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,653
Wait, I'm sorry. "They" say?

251
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,819
Well, no, I can't remember any of it.

252
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,159
Well, thank God for that.

253
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,995
I remember, uh, right before it
and right after it

254
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,731
and one moment where I thought
the medevac was gonna land on top of me.

255
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,796
Anybody die?

256
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,133
Yeah, two friends.

257
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,940
- You do any time?
- No.

258
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,107
But you're doing your time right now,
though, right?

259
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,118
So, you drink near beer and what else?

260
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,054
It's like I can pick up a glass
with this hand,

261
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,683
can't always drink from it.

262
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,819
I fall asleep a lot, just nod off
in the middle of things.

263
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,126
- Yeah, me, too.
- [Chuckles] Oh, yeah?

264
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:18,966
Yeah. Well, I call tomatoes "lemons."
I know that's wrong.

265
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:23,064
And sometimes certain colors
have certain smells.

266
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,371
- That's weird.
- [Inhaler hisses]

267
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,077
Well, we all got our problems, right?

268
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:35,950
There's an expression: "God closes
a door, but he opens a window."

269
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,819
Or he closes the window
and he opens the door.

270
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,619
My point is...

271
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,095
...sometimes something good
comes from an accident, you know?

272
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,655
Sometimes you're out there and you...

273
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,561
Man, she really wears that sweater,
doesn't she?

274
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,763
Fuck.

275
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,712
Anyway, it was a pleasure, Chris.

276
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,113
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

277
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,225
<i>[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up.</i>

278
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,497
<i>I took a shower with soap.</i>

279
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,843
<i>I had breakfast.
I didn't read the paper.</i>

280
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,605
<i>I put on my coat.</i>

281
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,143
<i>I had Thanksgiving dinner
with my family.</i>

282
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,764
[Chris] Coming around to you.

283
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,860
- Got your key?
- Yeah, I got my key.

284
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,303
- I smell money.
- Shut up.

285
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,482
Barb, did you make any of this?

286
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,451
- No, I'm afraid not.
- You used the thin ones, right?

287
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,923
- Not the thick nighttime ones?
- Yes, Alison, I used the thin ones.

288
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,459
You look great.
Lots of color in your cheeks.

289
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,156
- Not sure about this coat, though.
- Where's that from? Tenth grade?

290
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,928
- Well, I like this coat.
- I bumped into Marilyn Hess last week.

291
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,970
She had Charlotte with her.
Wasn't she in your class?

292
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,940
She was in my class.
Conrad was in Chris's.

293
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,102
Charlotte said for you to call her.
She looks fantastic.

294
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,772
- Lost quite a bit of weight.
- I love mushrooms.

295
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,840
What do you call a mushroom who goes
into the bar, buys everybody a drink?

296
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,944
- I don't know. What?
- A fungi.

297
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,183
This is all very good.
The relish in particular is nice.

298
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,026
- Not too tart, not too sweet.
- It was my grandmother's recipe.

299
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:36,056
Any other old family recipes?
We can use them for the restaurant.

300
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,262
- Restaurant?
- Chris didn't tell you?

301
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,328
No. He didn't tell us.

302
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,432
What exactly would you do
at a restaurant, Chris?

303
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:51,441
- Well, I'd help Lewis.
- We found a space, but it needs work.

304
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,041
- [Barbara] Where?
- Waverly, near Overland.

305
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,815
- Where is that?
- Southside. It's a gas station.

306
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,254
A gas station? Really?

307
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,090
We'd keep the door open during summer
for an al fresco kind of thing.

308
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,959
If it's a gas station,
you'd have to do some work...

309
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,864
We're just fucking talking about it, OK?

310
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,563
Excuse me.

311
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,546
- There are some steps.
- Oh.

312
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,456
Well, then, you better carry me.

313
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,517
Really?

314
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,100
- [Knock on door]
- Chris?

315
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,761
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

316
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,830
We gotta go. If I don't get her
down soon, she'll never sleep.

317
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,106
You should come by sometime.
We'll hang out.

318
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,446
And Dad's waiting down in the war room.

319
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,247
Hey, uh, you remember a Gary Spargo?

320
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,413
- Who?
- Gary Spargo.

321
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,980
He said he went out with you
a couple of times.

322
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,925
Well, he probably did.

323
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,954
- You look good. It's great to see you.
- Thanks.

324
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,967
Alison, right?

325
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,801
Say goodbye to Uncle Chris.
All right, we'll see you later.

326
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,907
In the last three years, we opened two
Jaguar stores and one Land Rover store.

327
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,312
<i>So we're all about Ford now. But a
PorschelAudi franchise, that'd be tight.</i>

328
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,817
What do you do
for the company, Cameron?

329
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,910
As little as possible.

330
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,319
Boy, you got me on the run here.

331
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,620
- There's a comforting sound.
- This new?

332
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,456
It was a gift from Charlie.
Whitehall, my partner.

333
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,986
Yeah, I know who Charlie Whitehall is.

334
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,159
- It's a nice gun.
- It's your move.

335
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,726
Check, by the way.

336
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,899
What'd you do?

337
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,708
- Sure you wanna do that?
- I think so.

338
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,306
You're gonna lose your queen, right?

339
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,874
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take her.

340
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,351
Check. In fact, checkmate.

341
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,996
- I didn't see that.
- I got lucky.

342
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,660
- Good game, Dad.
- We got time for another quick one.

343
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,794
I think we should go. Lewis, wanna go?

344
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,701
Would you rather I let you win?

345
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,438
Dad, I can't play chess anymore.

346
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,812
- Well, it's good seeing you.
- Good seeing you.

348
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,878
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

349
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,757
Can I say something?
You won't get upset?

350
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,819
[Chris] What?

351
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,029
I don't think
you should go home anymore.

352
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,771
[Knocking]

353
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,905
- Jesus, Ted, you snuck up on me.
- I'm supposed to sneak up on you.

354
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,043
They didn't have no more jellies,
so I got you a custard.

355
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,111
- Thanks. You got a cold, Ted?
- [Sneezes]

356
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:21,386
No wonder I don't got pneumonia, given
the house is cold enough to hang meat.

357
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,448
How come?

358
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,961
Sherry won't have the heat on
after nine.

359
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,496
Because of the baby.

360
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,828
We don't refer to it
as "the baby" no more.

361
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,233
- We don't?
- Sherry calls it "the little engine."

362
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,635
- It makes her hot all the time.
- Right.

363
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,800
Doctor told her she's got
three times more blood in her

364
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,844
and that's why she can't cool off.

365
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,142
Kid's not even born yet,
I'm already awake all night.

366
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,708
You're lucky you don't ever
have to worry about that stuff.

367
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,812
I gotta go.
Remember, lock the back door.

368
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,516
I will.

369
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,784
- You left your door open again.
- Oh, shit.

<i>[# Black Rebel Motorcycle Club:

371
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,239
I thought I was good-Iooking.

372
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,799
- Excuse me?
- I thought I was good-Iooking.

373
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,203
Well, maybe you were.

374
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,985
- Chris Pratt?
- Yeah.

375
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,049
My friend would like to buy you a drink.

376
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,826
I used to dance at Wet Willy's.
You know that place in Raytown?

377
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,062
It got closed down
on account of debts,

378
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:43,233
so right now I'm working with Maura
at the chamber of commerce.

379
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,835
I'm answering phones.
What do you do?

380
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,345
Oh, I, um...

381
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,406
- Sorry, I forgot your name.
- Again?

382
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,754
It's Luvlee. L-U-V-L-E-E.

383
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,816
Luvlee.

384

Now you'll remember me.

385
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,997
Anything about Kansas City,
I can tell you.

386
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:12,025
- Yeah? Like what?
- Did you know Teflon was invented here?

387
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,697
And Eskimo Pies.
And McDonald's Happy Meals.

You guys are so interesting.

390
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:25,178
Why don't we go somewhere quiet where
we can hear what you two have to say?

391
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,218
- Why don't we do that?
- You wanna come?

394
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,066
That's better.
I've seen you play hockey, you know.

395
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,076
Me and Alice Watts used to
watch you play all the time.

396
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,873
I don't remember you.

397
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,109
I saw you play the night you beat
the Raytown Cougars

398
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,207
for the state championships.

399
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,982
It was your birthday.
Do you remember that?

400
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,491
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a good game.
- Yeah, it was.

401
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,586
You got your second five-minute major
right at the end of the game.

402
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,928
Next game you would have
sat on the bench.

403
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,026
But it was the last game of the season,
and you knew that it didn't matter.

404
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,834
So what do you do? You go and slash
the hell out of some shitty player

405
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,898
at the end of a game you already won.

406

<i>And, still, the whole crowd sings
Happy Birthday to you.</i>

407
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:36,351
Me and Alice Watts were, like, "Damn, it
must be pretty cool to be Chris Pratt."

408
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,415
Don't mind me.

409
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,873
And then I heard what happened to you
and Nina and Danny and...

410
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,482
What was the name of the pretty girl?

411
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,548
- Kelly.
- Kelly, that's right.

412
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,496
And everyone was talking about how you,

413
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:24,160
you know, you woke up this other guy.

414
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,564
I remember thinking,
"God, we're the same age.

415
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,630
That could be me that it happened to."

416
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,768
Anyways...

417
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,872
- Are you OK?
- I wanna see you naked.

418
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:46,420
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. I'm flattered.

419
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,290
- Oh, you got cold hands.
- Sorry. [chuckles]

420
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,037
I see something still works.

421
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:11,377
- You don't have to do this.
- I know. I want to.

[Gary] How does a titan like Robert
Pratt feel about you living here?

423

[Chris] He's never seen it.

424
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,163
Really?

Tomorrow a bunch of us are hanging
at this farm we're borrowing,

426
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,980

Yeah, well,

You're better than this.

- Chris?
- Yeah.

- Doc Watson's got nothing on me, man.
- Well, good night.

- No.
- No, no, stop. Don't move.

- [Sighs]

Son of a bitch, you got laid.

439
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,664
- I don't really wanna talk about it.
- Oh, but you are, my friend, you are.

440
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,331
Come here.

441
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:19,900
So, tell me... did you get a hummer?

442
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,969
- Jesus, Lewis.
- All right. At least tell me her name.

443
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,244
- Luvlee something.
- Lovely? That's a name?

444
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:30,378
Yes. L-U-V-L-E-E.

445
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:35,517

Luvlee something look like, huh?

446
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,218
She's nice.

450
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,738
- Lemons. That's what it is.
- What what is?

451
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,971
- That's her last name.
- Luvlee Lemons? That's her name?

452
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,914
Well, it's her stage name.
She's a performer. Or she was.

453
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,350
And by stage, I'm assuming
you mean the kind with a pole?

454
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,888
- What do you mean?
- Let's move on.

455
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,948
- Where'd you meet her?
- Gary introduced me to her.

- Gary Spargo.

- Do I know this guy?
- I don't think so.

458
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,827
- I just met him down at the local.
- Huh.

459
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:23,402
- Well, I better get some sleep.
- Yeah. Yeah, you better.

- I'm Chris.
- Yeah, yeah. Aaron Cork.

466
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,893
Got a good grip. Come on in.
We've been waiting on you.

467
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,228
- Is turkey supposed to be rare?
- I don't think so.

468
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,236
I totally undercooked it. I've gotta
put it back in. You have to help me.

469
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,636
Hey. You made it.

470
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,107
Tortilla salad, pierogies, egg rolls.
We made too much food.

471

- There's nine of us.
- There's seven. You, me, Cork, Marty...

472

Never mind.

Go on. They're waiting for you.

but you won't let me rub your shoulders.

with your sexuality.

Hey, Chris. How you doing?

480
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,897
- Here's the Corker. Avoid that guy.
- Too late. We're old pals.

481
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:09,309
This is Marty. Marty is the guy
you wanna teach you how to surf.

482
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,339
- He's the only boy in Kansas knows how.
- I went to Framington, man.

483
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,544
We played you guys in Division A.

484
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,713
- I didn't really do sports.
- Gare, we gotta jam.

485
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,188
Too bad.

486
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,189
How many of these things
you gonna need?

487
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,059
- I'm gonna take all of them. Thanks.
- Cool.

488
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,656
Good seeing you guys.

489
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,066
Marty, watch out. It's heavy.

490
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,902
- Hey, sit down. Sit down.
- This your farm?

491
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:40,433
My Uncle Bone found it
and kind of negotiated with the owner.

492
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,342
- Wanna try some wine?
- I can't.

493
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,313
Come on. Take it.

494
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,907
- Marty?
- Yes.

495
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,646
Nice. One for me.

496
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,518
And toast.

497
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,492
How about, uh... Fuck it. Family, right?

498
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,926
- Hey, yeah. Cheers, man.
- Family's good.

499
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,588
Family.

500
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,599
- Welcome.
- Who are all these people?

501
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,500
- Whose place is this?
- Friend of a friend. Bone?

502
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,733
- Dinner is served.
- It's about time.

503
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,798
- Can we get some water?
- Food.

504
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,107
- Why the hell we eating burritos?
- Get your own water.

505
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,977
- Want some gravy?
- What's wrong?

506
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,984
Nothing.
I just remembered why I came here.

507
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:27,251
- [Chattering]
- [Music playing]

508
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,261
I'm just saying...

509
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,572
[Gary] Check this out.

510
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,413
[Maura]... some old farmhouse.

511
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,717
I don't know where it is.

512
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,723
No, that's water.

513
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,621
Mommy's doing dishes.

514
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,290
Mommy's cleaning up
after a bunch of pigs.

515
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,357
I'll see you in three weeks.

516
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:16,566
Tell Grandma to put it on the calendar
this time. I love you, too.

517
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,835
<i>[Gunfire on TV]</i>

518
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,333
Hey, Gare.

519
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,744
Hey, man. Why don't you come on down?

520
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,276
Couldn't sleep, huh?

521
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,347
Well, that's the thing about good wine.
Doesn't make you sleepy.

522
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,883
But, then, it doesn't give you
a hangover either, so...

523
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,362
Unless your brain's all fucked up.

524
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,525
- You played for Framington, right?
- No, man.

525
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,762
Let me just clean up some of this mess.

526
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,896
[Groans]

527
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,170
What's this?

528
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:56,577
This? This is a project I've been
working on for very many months.

529
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:01,380
Probably not ready
for anyone to see yet, but such is life.

530
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,387
- These all banks?
- Mm-hmm. That's right, Chris.

531
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:08,357
They're all banks.

532
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,689
Why are you taking pictures of banks?

533
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,787
- Because I'm gonna rob one of them.
- [Both chuckling]

534
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,957
Well, we're gonna rob one of them.

535
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,900
Some nice little farm bank
in the ass-end of nowhere

536
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,769
where they get
all that winter harvest cash.

537
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,502
You know what I'm talking about?

538
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,535
- You wanna steal from farmers?
- No, Chris.

539
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:34,107
I'm gonna steal from the corporate
fuckers who rape the farmers.

540
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,244
Agribusiness fat cats
who give the American farmer

541
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,881
enough to grow his crop
but not enough to live.

542
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,484
- Fucking tragedy is what it is.
- Totally tragic.

543
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,588
So we gotta find a bank
in the middle of a lot of big farms

544
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,930
where one time a year,
i.e., right now,

545
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,492
they're gonna fill that vault with cash

546
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,701
so that Farmer John can pay
Juan or Ramon to pick his crops.

547
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,206
There's this quiet, empty place

548
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,873
with no security to speak of,

549
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,078
and this quiet, empty place
no one really knows exists.

550
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,548
I mean, isn't that why you drive an hour
and a half each way to work there?

551
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,451
What is this?

552
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:24,061
Chris, I will totally understand if
you feel betrayed, but I need your help.

553
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,694
You want me to rob the bank.

554
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,069
- I can't do that.
- Why not, huh? Because it's wrong?

555
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,009
I don't know, but if I had... If I had
my life ripped out from underneath me

556
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,207
the way you had your life
ripped out from underneath you,

557
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,616
I don't think I'd give even half a rat's
ass about what was right or wrong.

558
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,382
I'd just fucking want
my old life back, you know?

559
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,222
Look at this shit.
Mopping floors, man.

560
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,626
Don't you want your old life back?

561
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,494
- You can't give that to me.
- No, I can't.

562
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,296
But I can give you something
maybe even better.

563
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,735
I can give you the power.

564
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,568
- Power?
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,973
Power.

566
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,603
Why don't you sit down?
I'll tell you about it.

567
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,110
Please?

568
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:16,949
My old man used to say to me, probably
the only thing we ever really agreed on,

569
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,751
whoever has the money has the power.

570
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,155
You might wanna jot that down
in your book.

571
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,956
It's something
you're gonna need to remember.

572
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,328
Do you have the power right now
in your life, Chris? Huh?

573
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,799
- Do you?
- I don't know.

574
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:35,396
How many janitors you know
have any kind of power to speak of?

575
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,005
Here's a question.

576
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,443
Who pays for your life?

577
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,175
You go to the ATM,
what, two, three times a week?

578
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,740
- Three.
- Three times. Wow.

579
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,254
Where does that money come from?
You drive a car.

580
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,347
Who pays for that?
Who pays for the insurance?

581
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,485
Given your track history,
it must be more than the rent,

582
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,462
which gets paid on the first
of every month by who?

583
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,192
- Daddy.
- Bingo.

584
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,326
Your old man,
he'll pay money to take care of you,

585
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,463
but he won't give you enough money
to take care of yourself. Why not?

586
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,135
He doesn't think that you can,
so he just doles out enough money

587
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,668
so that you have to depend on him.

588
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,547
You're as stuck as the farmers, Chris.
You star in your own tragedy.

589
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,017
My father would give me money
if I asked.

590
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:27,251
Hey, hey, hey.
That's... That's bullshit.

591
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,619
I'm sorry. Let's call him up.

592
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,354
Call him up, ask him.

593
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,925
Ask him for ten grand
and see what he says.

594
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:43,336
Hell, ask him for one grand
and see what he says.

595
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:48,369
Tell him you wanna start a business.

596
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,915
You can't.

597
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:58,250
I know. I mean, you know,
I went to prison for my sins, Chris,

598
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,722
so I don't have to carry them
around with me.

599
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:05,091
But you, your old man picked up the tab,

600
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,689
so now you drive out
Old Farm Road 24 once a week

601
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,224
to the spot just to remind yourself,
keep it fresh in your head,

602
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:16,398
just what a piece of shit
you think you are.

603
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,033
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

604
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,978
Outside of some old blind guy
dressed like Larry Flynt,

605
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,039
I'm the best friend you got right now,
and I mean that.

606
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,110
You were Chris Pratt. I was three years
ahead of you and I looked up to you.

607
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,419
You were fucking beautiful.

608
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,856
But then...

609
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:43,963
Well, now... I'm gonna help you.

610
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,835
- How?
- I'll say it again.

611
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,897
Maybe you'll write it down this time.

612
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,668
Whoever has the money has the power.

613
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,951
Chris? Where are you going?
Are you leaving?

614
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,826
Come on, sweetie.

615
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,458
[Lewis] We figure it's 30,000
to convert to a restaurant,

616
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,330
another ten or so to get us up on
our feet, plus or minus a few thousand.

617
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,426
Show him the menu, kid.

618
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,204
Is there a separate dinner menu?

619
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,177
We're just gonna be open
for breakfast and lunch.

620
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,738
- That way we have our nights free.
- I see.

621
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,011
OK, we have the Abbie, the Huey.

622
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,919
- Who are these sandwiches named after?
- People I've admired.

623
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,584
- We could name one after you.
- I don't think that's necessary.

624
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,151
- Sure, sure. Why not?
- Well, that's very kind, but...

625
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,460
What's your first name?

626
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,898
- Reuben.
- What's your middle name?

627
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,062
- Lewis...
- 30,000 seems a little low, boys.

628
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:32,370
- This place is a gas station now?
- Yeah, but you make that work for you.

629
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:37,379
Keep the gas station theme, maybe
you park a VW bus at one of the pumps,

630
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,711
paint the name of the place on the side.

631
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:44,243
Yeah, the name of the place.
Uh... Yes. Lew's...

632
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,552
Lew's Your Lunch.
See, I'm Lewis, Lew.

633
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,787
The place is just gonna be open
for breakfast and...

634
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,692
It's very clever.

635
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,460
- But we don't have to call it that.
- Yeah, I got lots of ideas.

636
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:01,163
Aside from that Reuben hiccup,
I think it went pretty well.

637
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,675
I've got a good feeling about it.
Our man Hearn was jazzed.

638
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:10,441
I don't know if you noticed. I think
he was pretty excited, don't you think?

639
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,107
Chris?

640
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,744
- Chris?
- I'm right here, Lewis.

641
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,653
- I thought you left me.
- I didn't leave you.

642
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,460
Come on. I'll drive you back to work.

643
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:29,522
[Reggie] Who can tell me
our three organizational strategies?

644
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,326
- Ritual.

00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,170
<i>And... repetition.</i>

<i>- [Chris] Shit.

Hey.

649
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:19,038
If you ever wanna stay late,
we could practice counting or...

650
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:22,244
Technically, I don't know
that I'm pussy-whipped per se,

651
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,685
- but she's got me on a goddamned pager.
- [Beeps]

I don't know. Oh!

00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,156
Hey, missed a spot.

655
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,596
Right there.

656
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,428

00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,188
<i>- Chris? What time is it?
- I don't know.</i>

660
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,889
- Is he all right?
- Tell her I'm all right.

661
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,763
<i>- He's fine. You all right? You sure?
- Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.</i>

662
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,701
I just wanted to know
if I could borrow $10,000.

663
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,671
- What?
- I need to borrow $10,000.

664
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,231
- What for?
- I just need it.

665
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,177
<i>- It's three o'clock in the morning...
- OK, then, $ 1,000.</i>

666
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:27,774
<i>- Could I borrow $1,000?
- Is this for that stupid restaurant?</i>

667
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,910
- No.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

668
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:33,149
No, Dad, I'm not in trouble.
I just wanted to call you...

669
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,283
<i>Because if you are,
I wanna help out in any way I can.</i>

670
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,693
I just think you should come over and
we should talk about it face to face.

671
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,289
I have an idea.
I wanted to start a business.

672
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,928
With $1,000? Exactly what sort of
business could you start with $1,000?

673
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:53,067
Well, I was thinking I could start
a skate-sharpening business.

674
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,738
You know, over at the...
over at the rink by the library.

675
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,577
And then later
I could even sell hockey equipment.

676
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,640
<i>- Look, Chris...
- You're saying no.</i>

677
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,710
<i>- Yes.
- Did you say yes?</i>

678
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:09,350
- No, you can't have the goddamn money.
- Robert.

679
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,657
- Look, Chris...
- Dad, that's fine. I understand.

680
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,432
<i>- Hey, buddy, can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.</i>

681
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,491
- Do you wanna come home?
- What?

682
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,470
You don't have to be afraid to ask.
The door is always open for you here.

683
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,530
I gotta go, Dad.

684
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,637
<i>[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up.</i>

685
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,180
<i>I took a shower with soap.</i>

686
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:42,619
<i>I skipped breakfast
so that I could follow an armored car.</i>

687
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,056
<i>I cased the Noel Town bank.</i>

688
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,406
<i>I rented an acetylene tank
for the cutting torch.</i>

689
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,713
<i>[Tires screeching]</i>

690
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:17,382
<i>Cork and I went car shopping.</i>

691
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,828
<i>And then I took pictures of the vault.</i>

692
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,200
[Knocking]

693
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,279
- Ted.
- Freezing out there.

694
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,839
- What are you taking pictures of?
- Nothing.

695
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,578
I just, uh...

696
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,754
I just wanted to show my parents
where I work, that's all.

697
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,315
Give me the camera, Chris.

698
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,692
Go stand over there.

699
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,660
I'm sure your parents would like
to see you in the picture.

700
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,262
I know mine would.

701
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,868
My dad one time took a video of me
giving this guy a speeding ticket.

702
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,935
[Chuckles] That's my dad.

703
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,978
Why don't you put your hand
on the handle there? Yeah.

704
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,281
Yeah, that's great, that's great.
Say "Go Mustangs!"

705
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,452
Vault looks like an antique
Hogue and Langehammer.

706
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,687
The lock's a 1922 Moss Hamilton.

707
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,559
Dual custody with
a three-movement S&G time lock,

708
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,727
another S&G mounted vertically down,
whatever that means.

709
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,792
I say we just cut through the side.

710
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,533
Vault's so old, it's not gonna be
wired, probably got blind spots.

711
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,270
Jackhammer the cement, torch the skin.

712
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,972
Town's so dead
no one's gonna hear anything.

713
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,277
- Cameras?
- I'm working on that.

714
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,716
Chris, my number's in there.
Call the minute the money comes.

715
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,244
- We go in there Friday.
- That's my job? Just to call you?

716
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:57,020
No. On the night, your job will be
to watch out for Deputy Doughnut.

717
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,824
He drives by, never at the same time,
so there's no way to plan for him.

718
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,958
- That's it?
- That's it? Dude, that's a lot.

719
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:09,597
That's the most important job of all.
You're the lookout.

720
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,954
Hi. I'd like to exchange this, please.

721
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:30,449
- Yeah, this is good.
- Excellent choice, sir.

722
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,432
- [Luvlee laughs]
- [Chris] Shh!

723
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,593
You're gonna wake up Lewis.

724
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:45,065
[Luvlee] I've never seen a blind person
up close before.

725
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,876
- What...?
- Oh, that.

726
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,820
They did that so I could breathe.
I was in a coma for ten days.

727
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,187
Ouch.

728
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,056
Do you remember?

729
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,495
I just remember I opened my eyes,

730
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:12,934
I saw my dad sitting there,
and I go, "I love you, Boomer."

731
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,061
And then he starts crying.

732
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:19,370
- You call your dad Boomer?
- No, that's the name of my first dog.

733
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:26,079
Yeah. He was a hunting dog.
He was a Chesapeake Bay retriever.

734
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,709
The only one in the world
that couldn't swim.

735
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,686
- You used to shoot birds?
- Ducks, geese, and deer.

736
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,019
With my dad and my idiot brother.

737
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,926
- And you liked doing that?
- No. But I was good at it.

738
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,591
What a surprise.

739
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,030
I'm gonna kiss it better.

740
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,128
Luvlee, I presume.
I recognize the perfume.

741
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,655
Can I offer you some pie?
It's not homemade, but it's decent.

742
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:18,860
No, thank you.

743
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,870
Probably gotta watch your figure,
your line of work.

744
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,237
Nice name, by the way. Luvlee Lemons.

745
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:29,301
I don't dance anymore.
I was never very good at it.

746
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:37,884
Please tell me you're not waving
your hand in front of my face.

747
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,923
Sorry. Have you been blind
your whole life?

748
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,618
- Most of it, yeah.
- How'd it happen?

749
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,356
- I looked at the sun too long.
- Wow. You hear about that...

750
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,126
Let me ask you a question.
What's your real name?

751
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,897
- Why? Are you gonna Google me?
- I did, what would I find?

752
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,963
- Probably nothing.
- And what happens if I Google Gary?

753
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,668
How'd you meet Chris?

754
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,302
Center put us together
a few years ago.

755
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,108
- Now he's your best friend?
- He's a good friend.

756
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,445
Maybe your only friend, huh?

757
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,576
That thing I said about the sun?

758
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:13,144
That's a lie. Total bullshit.
I was about your age.

759
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,784
Some buddies and me wanted to make
money, so we started a meth lab.

760
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,023
- You blew yourself up?
- Do I look like I blew myself up?

761
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:23,964
No, I didn't blow myself up.

762
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:28,231
This was a while back,
before meth was fashionable,

763
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,465
so unfortunately it wasn't yet known

764
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,065
that if you work
in an unventilated room,

765
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,474
the fumes can
and, in fact, do blind you.

766
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,536
It probably could have been avoided

767
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:43,109
if I had just stopped and bothered
to ask a simple question:

768
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,211
What am I doing here?

769
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:50,624
That is a sad story.
I'm sorry... if it's true.

770
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:55,562
Tell me, what are you all cooking,
sweetheart? Why are you here?

771
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,692
The same reason you are. Chris Pratt.

772
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:03,000
Sweet. Of course,
not as sweet as meeting in a bar.

773
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,508
- Or giving somebody a cell phone.
- Gary wants to help Chris.

774
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,806
- I'll bet he does.
- Do you know Gary?

775
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,869
I've known lots of Garys.

776
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,006
- A few Luvlees, too.
- Meaning?

777
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,313
Meaning something tells me
that you really don't believe

778
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,719
you're going to be invited
to the next Pratt Thanksgiving.

779
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,883
I could be.

780
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,690
Sometimes I wake up and think I can see
until I walk into a door.

781
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:32,124
The Luvlee Lemons of this world
do not end up with Chris Pratt.

782
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,229
Thank you.

783
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,398
- Asshole.
- Sad but true.

784
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,842
But that brings me back
to that original question, Luvlee.

785
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:47,440
So tonight, in the dark,
I'm gonna help you out and ask it again.

786
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:51,543
What are you doing here?

787
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,129
<i>[Phone rings]</i>

788
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,326
<i>- [Gary] Yeah.
- [Chris] The money's here.</i>

789
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,928
<i>[Gary] That's good news.
We go tomorrow.</i>

790
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,439
[Honking]

791
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,117
Sorry I'm late.
I had to run down to the hospital.

792
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,423
Sherry thought
she was going into labor.

793
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:36,329
It was these weird fake contractions.

794
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:40,529
I don't really understand. Anyway,
I wanted to stop by on our way home.

795
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,604
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
- Cool. See you tomorrow night.

796
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,700
Hey, Ted.

797
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,912
You don't always have to come by
and check up on the bank.

798
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,780
You think I come by here
to check up on the bank?

799
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,117
I come by here to check up on you,
make sure you're OK.

800
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:04,592
Yeah, well... if I need a doughnut,
I can get my own.

801
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,256
I sure as shit don't need you
feeling sorry for me.

802
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,027
- You know.
- I know.

803
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,192
This whole Earl of Sandwich thing
is revisionist bullshit.

804
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,595
Nobody invented the sandwich
any more than mashed potatoes.

805
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,260
- Want me to read you the menu?
- Why? I order the same damn thing.

806
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:57,033
- So you know what you want?
- What I always have. Teriyaki burger.

807
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,803
I'll tell you what, Chris,
we have our place, no menus.

808
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,539
Server comes up to the table,
brings ice water,

809
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,911
tells you what's cooking that day.

810
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:09,543
That'll be great.
Especially for our blind customers.

811
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,952
- I'm sorry, sightless.
- OK, what can I get you guys?

812
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:16,150
For starters,
I'll take the name of your perfume.

813
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,591
- It's Obsession.
- Consider me obsessed.

814
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,994
- The teriyaki burger.
- Medium well, extra teri on the side.

815
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,395
And two Cokes.

816
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,401
Tell me, gorgeous,
is it hot in here or is it just you?

817
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,404
- You two are trouble, I can tell.
- Who, us? No.

you know, they all look alike.

986
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:32,470
There's only one
that you'll remember, right?

987
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,605
Bone, he buried it. He's buried it.

988
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:43,310
Well, you know, let's go and dig it up.
Come on. Come on.

989
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:16,083
You know, there was a three-
or four-day period in this whole thing,

990
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:19,551
I just thought we could,
you know, leave you behind.

991
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:26,088
I thought if it all went well,
you could go back to your life.

992
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:31,395
Such as it was.

993
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,321
[Strained panting]

994
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,732
Throw it up. Now.

995
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,715
Bring up the other one.

996
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,217
It's getting warmer, huh?

997
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,244
You have to come over here now.
Come on.

998
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,033
[Shotgun cocking]

999
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,485
[Lewis] Am I dead?

1000
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,284
[Panting]

1001
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,624
I must be. No one's talking to me.

1002
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,691
- You're not dead.
- Oh! Praise Jesus.

1003
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:49,759
Stay put.

1004
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,712
[Strained breathing]

1005
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,315
Did you really forget?

1006
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,859
[Wheezing]

1007
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,037
<i>[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up</i>

1008
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:31,477
<i>and I robbed the Noel Town Bank.</i>

1009
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,946
<i>I returned the money
and confessed my part,</i>

1010
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,347
<i>but in the end the FBI
decided that someone like me</i>

1011
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:39,978
<i>could never pull off
something like that.</i>

1012
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,046
<i>Marty cut the phone line
instead of the video feed,</i>

1013
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:46,616
<i>so the whole thing
was caught on the bank cameras.</i>

1014
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:58,532
<i>I still go to class, and they tell me my
sequencing is getting better, and I...</i>

1015
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:01,234
<i>Oh, wait. The restaurant.</i>

1016
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,437
<i>Mr. Tuttle gave us the loan.</i>

1017
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,207
You gave me a dollar too much.

1018
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,942
<i>He comes in once in a while for lunch.</i>

1019
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,386
<i>I started skating again.</i>

1020
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:23,624
<i>I'm not as good as I used to be,
but I'm OK.</i>

1021
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:33,699
<i>What happened that night on old Route 24
is a part of me now.</i>

1022
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:39,041
<i>I just hope that one day
Kelly will be ready to see me again</i>

1023
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:43,345
<i>and I can finally tell her what
I've only been able to say in my dreams.</i>

1024
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:48,520
<i>Until then all I can do is wake up,</i>

1025
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:51,080
<i>take a shower with soap,</i>

1026
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,285
<i>and try to forgive myself.</i>

1027
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:57,730
<i>And if I can do that,
then maybe others will forgive me, too.</i>

1028
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:03,470
<i>I don't know if that will happen.</i>

1029
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:06,870
<i>I guess I'll just have to
work backwards from there.</i>
