1
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:22,771
Now, remember, if your loop is
large, your rug is loose.

2
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:24,764
Let's all repeat that, shall we?

3
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:29,085
If your loop is large, your rug is loose.

4
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,368
Good. Now let's give it a try.

5
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:38,131
Make a loop, pull it through,
cross over and pull it out.

6
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:41,603
Tighten those loops, Mr Lefkowitz.

7
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:56,406
This rest-home.
You wouldn't believe the place.

8
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,087
"Lights on!" "Lights off!"

9
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,607
Rules, rules, rules.

10
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:04,082
They don't even let you
keep a hotplate.

11
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,649
I shouldn't complain.
Today was an exciting day.

12
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,884
I learned how to hook a rug.

13
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:19,206
A man who, at one time, had the entire
garment district right here.

14
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,967
That's how I spend my days.

15
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,364
It isn't fair.

16
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:37,125
You work all your life, and you pay
taxes, you're a good citizen.

17
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,363
And what are you left with?

18
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:41,648
A tight rug.

19
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,807
I miss you, Rose.

20
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:53,812
My glass-bottom boat is about to give
you a treat, so hold on to your lanyards.

21
00:01:53,893 --> 00:02:00,332
What you have before you, ladies and
gentlemen, is the climax of today's adventure.

22
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:04,884
The famous Lost Treasure of
the Florida Keys.

23
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,721
Amazing, isn't it?

24
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:14,284
Oh, good people, it's been here since the days
of Ponce de Leon and Vasco da Gama.

25
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:18,412
- Even Moby Dick.
- What a rip-off.

26
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,331
If there are no questions,
we'll head back to port,

27
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:28,886
where our gift kiosk carries an attractive line
of postcards, T-shirts and other treasures.

28
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,043
Full steam ahead, matey!

29
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:36,004
Shiver me timbers!

30
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:54,722
<i>Stop! What the hell are you doin'?
Them's my French fries.</i>

31
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,122
<i>Oh, Mamma!</i>

32
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:01,930
- Hi, honey. I'm home.
- Hi, Mom.

33
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,481
- How's the term paper coming?
- Fine.

34
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:11,963
David, I hope that's not the TV I hear.

35
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,044
No, Mom.

36
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,171
<i>David?</i>

37
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:48,485
- Who's there?
- It's your grandpa. I gotta talk to you.

38
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:52,122
<i>- Grandpa!
- Your grandma and I are coming to see you.</i>

39
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:55,762
<i>- Really?
- Our friends have unfinished business to do.</i>

40
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:58,651
<i>It was a chance
for your grandma and I to grab a ride.</i>

41
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,362
<i>You have to talk to your mother
because she won't be ready for this.</i>

42
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:04,603
What do I say? She's gonna freak.

43
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:07,890
<i>Just tell her the truth. How about that?</i>

44
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:11,170
<i>- Look, I'll see you soon, son.
- Great!</i>

45
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,645
I know how much you love Grandpa and
Grandma and wish they were here with us,

46
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,008
so it's only normal to fantasize.

47
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:34,042
- But it's important to know it's only a fantasy.
- But it's not a fantasy.

48
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,330
Maybe it would help
if you talked to somebody about this.

49
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:42,407
Mom, I don't need to see a shrink. They're
not dead. They really did go to another planet.

50
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:46,964
- David, your grandparents are not in space.

51
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:50,204
They're not in the television
and they're not coming back.

52
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,410
They were lost at sea. You know that.

53
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,246
They've been dead for five years.

54
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,842
Hello, darling.

55
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,490
Oh...

56
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:13,004
Just a minute!

57
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,088
Well, aren't you gonna invite us in?

58
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:25,643
Oh, for crying out loud!

59
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,928
Joe! Joe!

60
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,685
Alma!

61
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,570
Bess! How are ya?

62
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,929
Art! Come in, Art!
It's so wonderful to see you.

63
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:37,811
- It's great to see you, boy.
- What's to see?

64
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:43,365
I'm a broken-down old schlep with one foot
in the grave. If I was a horse, they'd shoot me.

65
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,570
The same old Bernie.

66
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:51,932
You haven't aged a day. You probably think
I'm ajerk for not going with you.

67
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,686
Oh, Bernie, we never thought that.

68
00:06:54,773 --> 00:07:00,530
Good, because I never regretted it.
I never once regretted not going with you.

69
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,763
What's that? A little remodelling?

70
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:07,766
Oh, the maintenance here is...
You wouldn't believe it...

71
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,845
I ought to sue. I think it's...

72
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:14,642
By the way, you owe me rent.

73
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,926
It's all yours. All your things.

74
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:28,087
They tried to throw them out after you left,
but I told them "Over my dead body."

75
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:33,327
- I guess they figured that wouldn't be long.
- Bernie, you're a sentimental fool.

76
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:39,886
Well, I'm glad you got here in time because
I've been thinking about a garage sale.

77
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:43,045
<i>How have you really been?</i>

78
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:46,330
The truth? Not too good.

79
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:49,928
But now maybe things are looking up.

80
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,481
I think it's gonna be like old times.

81
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:55,971
I think.

82
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,248
Huh?

83
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:02,963
I feel terrible.
We let him think we were staying.

84
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,692
Do you want to be the one
to burst his bubble?

85
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:10,972
So what do we do?
Let him think we're staying here for good?

86
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:14,966
- We're gonna have to tell him sooner or later.
- Hold it.

87
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,408
I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

88
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:21,168
But not until I think he can handle it. Right?

89
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,209
Good morning, my little Antarean butterfly.

90
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:35,082
- Smells like I'll gain 5lbs this morning.
- At least.

91
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:38,245
- How you feel?
- Finer than frog hair.

92
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:44,291
- Where is everybody?
- The first group went through.

93
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,843
Here, have some coffee.
I made a fresh pot.

94
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:55,963
- How's Susie this morning?
- All things considered, holding up very well.

95
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:58,362
It's good to be back, isn't it?

96
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,250
Yeah.

97
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:10,812
- Still got the moves, don't I, kid?
- I didn't marry you for your money!

98
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,690
Well, I'll be goddamned.

99
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,722
- What is it?
- Here.

100
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,044
I'll be right back.

101
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,444
Look at this!

102
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,804
Is this beautiful?

103
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,208
You are beautiful.

104
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,571
- You have incredible eyes. You a collector?
- No.

105
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,769
Oh, a shrewd one at that.

106
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,242
Well, I will not insult you by haggling.

107
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:12,090
This Davy Jones treasure chest - a beauty,
isn't it? - I can give it to you for $19.95.

108
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:14,243
For that piece ofjunk?

109
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,723
You wife doesn't appreciate
fine antiques the way you do.

110
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:22,728
Listen, you take the box and I'll throw in
the barnacle salt-and-pepper shakers for free.

111
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,804
- Sold.
- Ha-ha!

112
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,087
Lovely.

113
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,453
Shaun, uh...

114
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,411
Take care of those folks, will you?

115
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:11,252
Hello, Jack.

116
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,404
I don't believe it.

117
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,044
What are you doin' here?

118
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:25,242
Don't tell me. You searched the entire galaxy,
couldn't find anyone as terrific as me?

119
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,722
The cocoons are in danger, Jack.

120
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:33,012
The sensors that we left on the bottom
of the ocean floor indicate seismic activity.

121
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,129
We've come to take our friends away.

122
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:39,889
We've got four days to rescue them
before our ship returns to take us home.

123
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:41,964
Seismic activity? That's heavy.

124
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,965
I was in an earthquake,
so I know it's very intense.

125
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:47,044
Well, aren't you glad to see me?

126
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:51,331
Isn't it a custom here to hug a friend
when you haven't seen her in a long time?

127
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:54,052
Yeah... Yeah, of course.

128
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,006
Hey, Romeo!

129
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:05,282
D'you think you could tear yourself away long
enough to ring up my clamshell castanets?

130
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:39,446
"O my luve is like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June:"

131
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:45,722
"O my luve is like a melodie
That is sweetly play'd in tune."

132
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,005
Oh, Arthur, darling, it's perfect.

133
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,563
- D'you want me to fix us breakfast?
- No time. Gotta meet the boys and get Bernie.

134
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,682
- Poor Bernie.
- Oh, nonsense.

135
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:02,049
We'll get him out of that hospital
and get his blood pumping again.

136
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,124
- That's Joe.

137
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,410
- Will you miss me?
- I already do.

138
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,444
Goodbye, Mrs Selwyn.

139
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:19,725
- How'd ya sleep?
- Best night's sleep I've had in years.

140
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,930
- How about Bess?
- She slept like a baby.

141
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,767
- What about you two?
- Alma didn't sleep a wink.

142
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,413
- You're kidding?
- No.

143
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,290
Neither did I.

144
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,568
Oh, you dog, you!

145
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,644
You smell that?

146
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,724
Yeah, incense.

147
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,202
Maybe a Hindu runs the place.

148
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,444
Back here.

149
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,846
Come on back, whoever you are.

150
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,323
Believe it or not, I'm open for business!

151
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:07,533
Hiya, fellas. What can I do for you?

152
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,127
- Mrs Feinberg?
- Call me Ruby.

153
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:15,446
Ever try this? It delivers oxygen-enriched
blood to the pleasure centres of the brain.

154
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:20,732
It's terrific. Will you give me a hand? I'm new
at this. It's tough getting out of this cookie.

155
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:24,283
Here we go, OK? Come on, don't be shy.

156
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,968
Now, put me right side up. Right side up.

157
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:31,728
Easy! Take it easy, fellas. Easy. Easy.

158
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:35,408
That is great. That's it. That's it.

159
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:39,884
OK, now, you grab an ankle
and you grab an ankle.

160
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,884
There's the left one. Terrific.

161
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:45,204
That is it.

162
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,090
Great.

163
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:52,122
Oh, boy, that's terrific.
I feel sensational. Thanks a lot.

164
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,443
Nice little place you got here... uh, Ruby.

165
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,889
D'you hear that, Sidney?
It's a nice little place I got here.

166
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,771
Sidney was my husband.
This dump was his dream.

167
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,368
Unfortunately, the son of a bitch died
and left me to live it.

168
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:09,766
- That's tough.
- Nah, it's not so bad. I just like to yak.

169
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,526
Now, tell me. You two on vacation or what?

170
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:14,046
- We, uh...
- Well...

171
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,806
...came down to see old friends.
- Oh.

172
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:20,169
Your night clerk told us to talk to you
about staying the week.

173
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,041
Sure thing. No problem.
This is not exactly my busy season.

174
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,203
- Great.

175
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,891
There's Ben. We better get cracking.

176
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:32,965
- See you round, Ruby.
- Count on it.

177
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:40,642
Oh, hey! Will you get a load of this sunshine?
I feel like a teenager.

178
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,405
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

179
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,087
- Last one to the car buys dinner.
- Hey, yeah!

180
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:48,370
- Come on, slowpoke!
- You got a head start.

181
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:50,648
Where are you, boy?

182
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,612
Yahoo!

183
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:01,287
Hey, not bad, Superman!

184
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:11,045
We'll have to stop at a pharmacy.
If I don't have zinc oxide, I'll burn to a crisp.

185
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,010
So we'll stop at a pharmacy.

186
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:16,881
- Did you bring juice? I'll get dehydrated.
- We'll getjuice.

187
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,533
- Bernie, where you going?
- None of your business.

188
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:23,526
- You should be in your rug-hooking class.
- Take your hands off him.

189
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:26,081
- Or what?
- Or you'll be sorry.

190
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:30,086
- I said let him go!
- Out of my way, you old coot.

191
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,561
Easy, Rambo.

192
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:38,565
- What do you say we blow this joint?
- Yes.

193
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,688
After you.

194
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,689
Hey, hey!

195
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,606
- Look at that.
- Come on!

196
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:01,083
- Here we go.
- Last one in's a pantywaist!

197
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:04,245
Last one in ain't got a hair on his ass!

198
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,724
Here we go!

199
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,004
Where is everybody?

200
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,569
- How's the water?
- Great. It was just great.

201
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:56,410
A beautiful beach, a sunny day and
good friends... what more can a man ask for?

202
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,042
Can I have some of that, please?

203
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,806
Wonderful. Would you look at them move?

204
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:09,365
Gentlemen, I'd say all that those ladies
are lacking is a little mature male company.

205
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,762
- Yeah.
- How about that?

206
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:16,131
I think you're right.
Come on, Bernie. Come and dip your wick.

207
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,204
Come on!

208
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:54,085
Joe, I've gotta go. I've got an appointment.

209
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:57,210
An appointment?
We're playing a game here, Bernie.

210
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:59,284
It's important.

211
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,727
OK, Bernie. I'll get the guys.

212
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,804
Art. Ben.

213
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,244
- How's this feel?
- Perfect.

214
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,770
You're a good friend, Jack.
I knew we could count on you to help us out.

215
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:35,528
It's no sweat. You're my favourite Martian.

216
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:40,532
Well, I guess we're ready
and we'll be back in about an hour's time.

217
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,092
Yeah. OK.

218
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,969
- "My favourite Martian." That's good.
- See, he gets it.

219
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:23,765
"St Petersburg Oceanographic Institute."
They got a cocoon.

220
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,604
Holy shit.

221
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:34,166
OK, David, one more swing.
I know you can do it, buddy. Come on.

222
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,049
Hit it, man. Come on, David, one more time.

223
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,567
Oh, man, too bad.

224
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:45,363
- Next.
- That's OK, David. It's only batting practice.

225
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:48,525
Come on, Tom, you're up. Take a cut.

226
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,924
Screwed up again, guy.

227
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:32,362
No matter how many times I see that,
it's still impressive.

228
00:23:56,933 --> 00:24:02,132
What's the mystery? You were analysing the
effects of quakes on fish and find a meteorite.

229
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:07,367
When a meteor enters the atmosphere, the
pressure will leave characteristic markings.

230
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:11,765
This baby doesn't have 'em.
Whatever it is, it didn't fall from the sky.

231
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:15,766
It's weird-looking.
It's kind of like a dinosaur egg.

232
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:21,043
What do you think, Sara?
You subscribe to the dinosaur-egg theory?

233
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,524
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

234
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,453
It's a life form.

235
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:49,723
I'm gonna get a hot dog
and an ice-cold beer. How about you?

236
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:52,805
- Sure, I'll have a beer.
- You get a milk shake.

237
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,565
In you go.

238
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:59,124
- Hey, look, it's Wade Boggs.
- How's it hanging, doofus?

239
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,568
Yeah, that guy can't hit worth shit.

240
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:04,042
Wanna let me in on that?

241
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:12,370
I read somewhere, I don't know where,
maybe Ted Williams.

242
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:19,484
It said the hardest thing in sports to do
is hit a round ball with a round bat.

243
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:25,284
What you gotta do is learn how to hit the ball
with some degree of control.

244
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,490
You go over by the bucket
and I'm gonna hit some of these.

245
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:32,361
Now, watch. I'm gonna try
to see the ball hit the bat.

246
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:40,163
Boom. See? And you don't
have to swing hard. Give me a ball.

247
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:45,772
- OK.
- Now you. OK, come over here.

248
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:49,448
Now, think. Try and see the ball hit the bat.

249
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,482
All right, now you're cooking. All right.

250
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:58,087
Let's go, let's go, let's go. A little pep.

251
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,572
That's the one.

252
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:14,482
- You ought to have your head examined.
- It was just a little baseball... Here, over here.

253
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,690
Just a little ball game. No big deal.

254
00:26:17,773 --> 00:26:20,446
This is Earth, Ben, not Antarea.

255
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:25,004
- As long as we're here, we keep getting older.
- I know.

256
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:31,083
But with this kind of fringe benefit,
maybe it's worth it.

257
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:38,849
Hey, what's going on?

258
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:44,929
Well, it's been so long since you needed me
for anything like this, I guess I missed it.

259
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,723
Yeah. I missed it, too.

260
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,564
I know.

261
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,282
It's not your fault.

262
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:30,401
How could you know an earthquake would
knock a cocoon out of its hiding place, huh?

263
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:34,691
I'm responsible for him. They're
counting on me to bring him back home.

264
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:38,766
And I'm going to need a blueprint
of the institute so I can plan his rescue.

265
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:41,572
Well, I'll help you. I'll do whatever you want.

266
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:45,362
But I got into trouble last time,
so you cannot steal any more old people.

267
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:49,651
- We're not doing that.
- All right, fine. Let's just go bust him out.

268
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:54,249
It's not that easy. We can't free him without
the risk of drawing attention to ourselves.

269
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,405
We'll go back in three days,
then rendezvous with the ship.

270
00:27:57,493 --> 00:28:00,291
Three days!

271
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:06,642
You're crazy! Kitty, in three days they'll cut it
open and perform grotesque experiments...

272
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:09,008
I'm sorry... I didn't mean...

273
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:11,243
I'm sorry.

274
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,324
I'm... I'm...

275
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,247
We're going to get him back.

276
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:49,612
Look at this. Slick as a whistle.

277
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,968
You're not so bad yourself.

278
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:58,482
Joe, I'm in heaven. Isn't this wonderful?

279
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:01,406
You're the one who didn't wanna come back.

280
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:05,771
- You glad I twisted your arm?
- I think I was afraid it wouldn't be the same.

281
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:07,844
But it's better.

282
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:14,206
- Look. What are we gonna do about him?

283
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:19,208
- I asked him to dance.
- Forget it. Bernie hasn't cut a rug in 30 years.

284
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:22,569
Joe, maybe we should
go and keep him company.

285
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:27,249
I see something
that'll get his juices flowing.

286
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:49,331
One more of these
and I am no longer responsible.

287
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,722
- Waiter! Waiter!
- Oh!

288
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:54,968
You are my kind of group.

289
00:29:55,053 --> 00:30:00,047
Most people our age are a pain in the ass.

290
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,649
Most people our age are dead.

291
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,724
Oh, Bernie.

292
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:09,202
Where did he get to be so funny?

293
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:14,003
- Yeah, Bernie, how'd you get to be so funny?
- I always thought Bernie was funny.

294
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:16,368
- Me, too.
- You have?

295
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:20,241
Oh, you don't think I'm funny, Joe?
Watch this. I'll show you funny.

296
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,530
Presenting Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy.

297
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:43,442
This is an eagle who just found out
his teenage daughter's pregnant.

298
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:56,412
You know what? You are adorable.

299
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:05,451
What's... Are you all right?
What's the matter? It was just a little kiss.

300
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm a married man.

301
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:12,366
Oh, pardon me. I'm so sorry.

302
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,251
- Your friends told me you were available.
- What?!

303
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,484
- Bernie, we just thought...
- You just thought what, Joe?

304
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:22,486
That I've forgotten about Rose?
That her memory means nothing to me?

305
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:26,088
Well, I got news for you. It means everything.

306
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:31,645
Now, don't break up your little party
on my account. I'll get a cab.

307
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:37,404
He's a fun guy. A barrel of laughs.

308
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,484
Thanks for the intro.

309
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:42,963
- I'm sorry, Ruby.
- Yeah, forget it.

310
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:45,613
Like I said...

311
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:46,887
we had some laughs.

312
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:51,046
Ruby, underneath it all
he really is a wonderful guy.

313
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,930
Yeah, yeah.

314
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,004
Thanks for the drink.

315
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:04,851
Pay attention to the teacher.
Behave yourself.

316
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:07,288
Michael, stop pushing.

317
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,129
Kelly, why'd you fall from there?
I told you so many times.

318
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,044
Sh, it's not gonna hurt.

319
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:22,328
Hi. Is it bad?

320
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:27,328
I don't think so, but I'd like to have someone
look at it. She banged her head pretty hard.

321
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:31,486
Oh, poor little girl. Now, that's a bad bump.

322
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,041
Let me see if I can take it away.

323
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,132
I got it! Let's throw it away.

324
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:40,363
Wow. You've got the touch.

325
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:47,211
The first-aid station's over there. Would you
mind watching the kids for a few minutes?

326
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:51,047
- OK. You go take care of her.
- Oh, thanks.

327
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,203
Just blow this if they attack.

328
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,810
All right, children. Gather round.

329
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:16,363
Well, well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

330
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:25,210
- Your pals said to tell you they'd be a bit late.
- Fine. I'll wait outside.

331
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:27,682
Don't be silly. Take the load off your feet.

332
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:33,248
I don't bite, you know.

333
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:37,806
- I'll just stand here, by the door.
- OK, suit yourself.

334
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:43,164
Listen, um...

335
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:49,206
I'm sorry about last night, OK?

336
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,444
- Forget about it.
- No, I don't think so.

337
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,922
I don't like loose ends.

338
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,926
Maybe we could, um, smooth things out.

339
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,565
Over a cocktail?

340
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:07,441
That's not necessary.
I accept your apology.

341
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,769
- You're afraid of me, aren't you?
- I certainly am not.

342
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:16,242
OK. Then there's no problem.

343
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:21,606
Pick you up at seven.

344
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:30,964
So finally, after the longest trip
you could ever imagine,

345
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:35,649
their spaceship landed and
it was time for them to see their new home.

346
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:41,842
The spaceship's door slowly opened
and there before them was the magic planet...

347
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:45,892
the most beautiful sight
any of them had ever seen.

348
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:53,049
The sky was gold, and shining down on them
were three pale, pale pink moons.

349
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:58,048
So they stepped outside, and guess what?

350
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:01,045
- What?
- They floated.

351
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,409
That's right!
They could fly like birds.

352
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:08,202
So they all joined hands and,
with their new friends leading the way,

353
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:14,129
they flew off to a silver city
shimmering in the distance.

354
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:19,128
- Can we go there?
- Hold on, now. It's very far.

355
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:23,525
And, besides, if you left here
think of all the things you'd miss.

356
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:27,162
- Do they have ice cream?
- No.

357
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:31,166
- Santa Claus go there?
- I'm afraid it's too far for Santa to make it.

358
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,892
Then how come the people went there?

359
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:40,970
Well, on that planet no one ever gets sick,
no one ever gets old and no one ever dies.

360
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:46,127
So if you're in love with someone,
you never have to lose them.

361
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:51,287
What happens if
you fall in love with ice cream?

362
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:53,364
You're in trouble!

363
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:59,573
- I like that one!
- You do?

364
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:04,322
Here we go, fellas. Stake your claim.

365
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:09,441
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is that a hot dog, or what?
- State of the art.

366
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:13,321
- You know what they put in those things?
- I do. Thanks for reminding me.

367
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,405
Have a bite, Bernie.
They say the chilli kills the bugs.

368
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:19,405
Very funny. Give me gas for a week.

369
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:25,806
You know, Bernie? You'd fit in the Guinness
Book of World Records for complainers.

370
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,885
- Hey, come on!
- Sorry. You wanna throw our ball back?

371
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:33,489
- We look like your servants? Get it yourself.
- Hey, we said we're sorry.

372
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:38,089
- Don't give us any shit. Just give me the ball.
- Don't do it, Joe. Look at the mess they made.

373
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,607
- If I was you, I'd keep quiet, pops.
- Oh, yeah?

374
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:42,888
Hold it a minute!

375
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,963
Let's be gentlemen about this.

376
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:49,409
I say we settle this with a little four on four.

377
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:50,812
- Great idea.

378
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:52,372
- Get real.
- Are you nuts?

379
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:59,609
I'll tell you what I think. I bet $10 we can
make 11 baskets before you hotshots can.

380
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:02,765
- My money's on the table. Come on.
- Oh, right.

381
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,003
Like taking money from a dying man.

382
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:08,051
- You dudes got yourself a game.
- Good.

383
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:21,322
Whoo! In your face, grandpa.

384
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:25,406
- Ben, over here.
- Get him. Watch him, watch him.

385
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,484
Art! Art!

386
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,005
I got him. I got him.

387
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:36,448
Just like downtown.

388
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,331
OK, no more charity. Now we're gonna play.

389
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:43,329
- Over here, man.
- Defence. Watch the defence.

390
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,649
I got him. I got him.

391
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,369
Fellas, let's not give up.

392
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:56,049
- Joe, what's the score?
- 7-1, for God's sake.

393
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:03,487
Art, shoot!

394
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,927
8-2! We're catching up.

395
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:09,607
- Guard your man!
- Guard your... Where? What?

396
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,684
Guard who, Joe? Who?

397
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:15,726
Hey, hey, watch it. Here we go.

398
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:20,484
Hey, that's 9-2. You guys give up?

399
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:22,564
No! Do you?

400
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:29,609
- Time out. Time out. Come on.
- What's the matter? You pooped?

401
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:31,968
Fellas? Fellas?

402
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:36,648
OK, I think it's time
we showed 'em what we learned.

403
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,566
- You're damn right. Art?
- I couldn't agree more.

404
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:40,847
Let's go.

405
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,405
Now, boys. Now.

406
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:47,051
Watch him. Come on, man, cover.
Get him.

407
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:49,124
Go, Art. Go!

408
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,163
Come on, take him.

409
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:54,402
Oh!

410
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,330
Great, Joe! Great.

411
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,766
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

412
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:04,844
Go, Ben. Go!

413
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,202
- What's the score?
- 10-5. Guard your man.

414
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:14,330
Which one is my... I say, which one is my...

415
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,284
Watch it.

416
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:22,443
Cover him.

417
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:25,286
- Get him!
- Attaboy!

418
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,887
Are you my man?

419
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,885
9-10, your favour. Getting nervous?

420
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:01,047
Aaaargh-agh!

421
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:04,807
Art!

422
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:13,410
Hallelujah!

423
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,483
10-10. Next basket wins.

424
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:25,366
All right, all right.
I'm free. Over here, over here.

425
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:27,045
Bernie! Bernie!

426
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:43,247
Bernie, go for it!

427
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:48,082
In your face, junior.

428
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:52,451
Bernie, you're the greatest!
You're the greatest!

429
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,807
Oh... Oh...

430
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,202
That is to die.

431
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:09,003
- It sure is. The price tag alone'd kill you.
- Maybe you should try it on.

432
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:12,529
Are you kidding?
I've never shopped in a store like this.

433
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:16,572
Me either. Where would any of us
wear a get-up like that?

434
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:18,644
In our dreams.

435
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,484
That settles it.

436
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:34,122
Oh, it's terrific.

437
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:40,564
Ta-da!

438
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,164
It's gorgeous.

439
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:55,924
Aaargh!

440
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,528
I don't believe it!

441
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:19,292
Oh! Wow!

442
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,206
Bess, that's naughty.

443
00:42:22,293 --> 00:42:25,888
Oh, that's so sexy. I think it suits you.

444
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:32,046
Oh, Bess? Oh.

445
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,569
- Jean, get some water.
- Are you all right?

446
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,404
How about some hot coffee?

447
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:56,168
I just can't understand what could be wrong.

448
00:42:58,093 --> 00:43:00,163
She was in perfect health.

449
00:43:00,253 --> 00:43:03,848
And the minute we get back... this happens.

450
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:09,766
There isn't any justice.
If there were, it'd be me in there, not her.

451
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,766
- Now, don't be ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

452
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:16,208
You don't know her, Joe.

453
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,284
Not the way I do.

454
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:25,527
She's the most generous,
loving and giving person I've ever met.

455
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:32,410
She's the only one that's ever really loved me.

456
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:38,165
I'd trade places with her in a heartbeat...

457
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,244
if I could.

458
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:05,605
OK. Just a few more inches, Bob.

459
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,287
You're doing very well.

460
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:24,325
- All right. That's fine.

461
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,802
Doug, Ray, let's lift it off.

462
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,604
Carefully! Carefully.

463
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,410
Don't be afraid.

464
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:19,404
You guys OK?

465
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:29,092
What are we doing, gang?

466
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,971
They've opened the cocoon, Jack.

467
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:36,046
- Is he gonna be all right?
- For a short time.

468
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:42,208
But if he doesn't get an infusion
of life force soon, he'll weaken quickly.

469
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,164
Mr Selwyn?

470
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:53,732
- That's me, Doctor. How is she?
- She's fine, considering her age

471
00:45:53,813 --> 00:45:58,011
and the fact that she's six weeks' pregnant.

472
00:45:58,093 --> 00:46:01,130
- Well, you smutty old devil.
- Pregnant?

473
00:46:01,213 --> 00:46:05,445
Very impressive, Mr Selwyn.
This one's definitely going in the books.

474
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:08,605
- Congratulations.
- Pregnant? Pregnant?

475
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:11,412
- Don't you go near him!
- She's pregnant. Pregnant?

476
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:13,290
Uh-huh.

477
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:24,850
- Safe.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

478
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,852
Hold it a second. Let me clean the plate.

479
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:35,128
Right, here we go. Let's play ball.

480
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:40,643
- Strike!
- Come on, kid. Be a hitter.

481
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:43,930
Come on, Davy.
Davy, you can do it.

482
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:46,604
Strike two!

483
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,686
You can do it. Let's play ball.
Come on, Davy.

484
00:46:55,773 --> 00:46:59,812
- Strike three! You're outta here.

485
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,924
Well...

486
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,884
How you doin'?

487
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:17,650
Fine, considering I'm the worst player
in the whole league.

488
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:22,289
That don't sound like the fella
I saw hit the ball yesterday.

489
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:26,366
I told you. It's different when I'm with you...
you want me to hit it.

490
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:30,685
And you think your pals
don't want you to hit it. Is that it?

491
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,446
I'm just no good at stuff. I always mess up.

492
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:36,882
You know, that could be true.

493
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,804
I don't know.

494
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:46,531
But I know you're not the only kid
that ever felt scared or anxious,

495
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,843
or couldn't hit a baseball.

496
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:53,927
You see, when I was a kid playing baseball,
a little younger than you,

497
00:47:54,013 --> 00:47:58,484
they always sent me to right field...
that's where they send the duds.

498
00:47:58,573 --> 00:48:02,566
Then when I got up to bat there was
no way in the world I could ever hit that ball.

499
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:08,410
- But you can do it now.
- Sure, but I've had a whole life to work on it.

500
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:11,371
You can hit too. I've seen you.

501
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,967
You see...

502
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:19,685
it looks to me like you're listening
to a lot of people tell you you can't do it,

503
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:25,245
when maybe what you should be doing
is listening to yourself say that you can.

504
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,449
And I want you to remember something.

505
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:33,847
I love you, and all I want for you
is the very best that life has to offer,

506
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:38,290
but, see, you're gonna
have to go get it yourself.

507
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,772
Yeah.

508
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,607
Now think about that, will you?

509
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,010
OK.

510
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:50,364
Thanks, Grandpa.

511
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,884
Mr Finley?

512
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:07,126
Won't you have a seat, Mr Finley?

513
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,528
We'll talk about this.

514
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:15,084
We don't really need to talk, Doctor.
Just tell me what's wrong.

515
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:21,089
You had leukaemia a few years back,
but it went into complete remission, right?

516
00:49:21,173 --> 00:49:23,368
Right.

517
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:26,445
- I've got it again, haven't I?
- Yes.

518
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,808
I'd like to get you started on chemo.

519
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:34,563
How long have I got, Doctor?

520
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:41,923
The disease is unpredictable. It may spread
quickly or it may go into periodic remission.

521
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,652
Six months, six years.

522
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,566
I honestly don't know.

523
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,884
Great.

524
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:57,846
- I'll take over for a while.
- OK.

525
00:50:18,693 --> 00:50:20,684
If only you could talk.

526
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:42,084
Did you do that?

527
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:10,891
- Is he doing what I think he's doing?
- I think so.

528
00:51:10,973 --> 00:51:12,770
- Call Dr Baron.
- Right.

529
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,404
Relax.

530
00:51:57,853 --> 00:52:00,890
Contraction ends.

531
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:04,761
Now take a deep, cleansing breath.

532
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:10,367
Oh, that's my little mommy.

533
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:25,571
Hi.

534
00:52:25,653 --> 00:52:29,885
Thank goodness. I was just about
to organise a search party.

535
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:32,248
I have so much to tell you.

536
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:35,491
Me, too.

537
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:38,326
Sorry I'm late. The market was jammed.

538
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:43,248
This has been the most incredible day.
First Bess, and then guess what?

539
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:47,770
I met a woman who runs
a preschool for foster children.

540
00:52:47,853 --> 00:52:51,892
She just called and offered me ajob.
Isn't that something?

541
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:55,283
In all my life no one's ever offered me ajob.

542
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,843
She said she was impressed
by the way I handled the children.

543
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:02,369
- So what did you tell her?
- I said I'd have to talk to you.

544
00:53:02,453 --> 00:53:04,728
I'm going back tomorrow just to help out.

545
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:08,089
How can you take ajob
when we're leaving in two days' time?

546
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:14,487
Joe, for heaven's sake, I was just pleased
to get the offer. I didn't say I was taking it.

547
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:18,122
Then why didn't you
turn her down on the spot?

548
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:20,044
I don't know.

549
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:23,523
I suppose I just wanted
the fantasy to last a little longer.

550
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:26,002
I'll tell her tomorrow.

551
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:27,685
What's your news?

552
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:30,884
What?

553
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:36,529
Those groceries are a lot more expensive
than they used to be.

554
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:42,611
Thank you for coming.
We're going to start the demonstration now.

555
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:44,684
Sara, please?

556
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:53,888
- See?

557
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:06,803
All right!

558
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:19,570
You can't fool him, you see?

559
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,964
Oh... Yes.

560
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:41,887
We're gonna make arrangements
to move him to a secure location.

561
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:45,568
- I want to keep this very quiet.
- Fine.

562
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:48,611
- Good work. Job well done.
- Thank you.

563
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:53,050
Congratulations. I am very impressed
with you and your facility.

564
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:57,570
My reports to the Joint Chiefs
will reflect that.

565
00:54:57,653 --> 00:55:02,807
All I'm saying is we've no idea how a drastic
change in environment might affect him.

566
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:07,921
He's losing his strength, and a dead alien
won't do you or the military any good.

567
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:14,486
Sara, I know you're fond of him, but don't let
emotions overrule your scientific judgment.

568
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:18,885
You're not giving him to MIT
or the Smithsonian, but to the Air Force!

569
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:22,249
To the government.
There's a national security issue.

570
00:55:48,652 --> 00:55:50,449
There you are.

571
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:54,127
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey.

572
00:55:54,212 --> 00:56:00,890
I got you a little something. Sort of
a "get your mind off your problems" present.

573
00:56:05,372 --> 00:56:07,840
Thank you. I really love it.

574
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:12,289
Me, too. I can't understand why
we're not selling more of them though.

575
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:14,408
You're a good friend, Jack.

576
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:17,370
Friend? Friend, friend, friend, friend.

577
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:21,730
Kitty, we are more than friends.
We shared ourselves and everything.

578
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,406
Would you like it
if we shared ourselves again?

579
00:56:24,492 --> 00:56:28,565
Like it? I would love it.
I've been dreaming about it for five years.

580
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,643
Then let's go back to your cabin.

581
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:33,644
Huh? Whoa, ho, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

582
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:39,602
You Antareans may have the market cornered
in sharing, but know nothing about romance.

583
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:44,447
Kitty, I'm the kind of guy,
I need to have a nice dinner, you know?

584
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:47,683
A little music, a little candlelight.

585
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:52,288
I charmingly convince you
to ask me back to your cabin for a nightcap.

586
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:55,408
And then...

587
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:58,370
we share our brains out.

588
00:57:08,252 --> 00:57:10,243
Hop in.

589
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:29,242
How can you stand this racket?

590
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:32,529
What are you talking about?
This is a terrific joint.

591
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:36,366
I haven't heard a word of English
since we walked into the place.

592
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:40,889
You know something? When you want to,
you do a great impression of an old fart.

593
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,405
Oh, thanks!

594
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,926
Oh, thank you very much.

595
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,730
Oh, whoo-whoo!

596
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:49,167
I can't wait.

597
00:57:49,252 --> 00:57:51,129
Mmm!

598
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:56,366
- What is this?
- It's Cuban punch. And it's delicious.

599
00:57:56,732 --> 00:58:01,931
Go ahead, Bernie. You'll probably hate it,
but go ahead. Force yourself.

600
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:12,724
Uh-huh.

601
00:58:19,572 --> 00:58:23,690
Bernie... Bernie... Oh, my God.
You are a real nutcase.

602
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:26,650
That's 151-proof rum!

603
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:33,404
Maybe I was thirsty.

604
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,881
Waitress! Oh, waitress!

605
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:42,203
This way.

606
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:48,731
I tell you, this place must be great...
I have no idea what we just ordered.

607
00:58:48,812 --> 00:58:52,361
Is this a ritual commonly practised
before people share themselves?

608
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:56,491
Oh, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
See, this is romantic.

609
00:58:56,572 --> 00:59:01,441
You got champagne, ambience, you know.
Gets you in the mood.

610
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:03,968
Mm, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

611
00:59:04,052 --> 00:59:07,124
<i>- Voila. Bon appetit.
- Gracias!</i>

612
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,851
- What is this, Jack?
- Uh...

613
00:59:09,932 --> 00:59:13,811
This is, um... Oh, this is bon appetit.
This is French food.

614
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:19,728
See, it's terrifique. See, they don't
say "terrific", they say "terrifique".

615
00:59:21,612 --> 00:59:23,603
You OK?

616
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:29,722
- Jack?
- Hm?

617
00:59:29,812 --> 00:59:34,249
I want to rub this bon appetit
over every inch of your body.

618
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,803
- Really?
- Yes.

619
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,883
Well, let's do it. Let's do it.
We'll get an order to go.

620
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:49,770
Uh, garcon? Uh, senor?

621
00:59:53,852 --> 00:59:57,049
What did I say? I said something funny?

622
01:00:01,612 --> 01:00:05,764
Oops. I guess that bite
got away from you, huh, honey?

623
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:11,449
- What's the big idea?
- I'm really enjoying this bon appetit, Jack.

624
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:18,204
You're having an extraterrestrial
reaction to this.

625
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:22,808
- Don't be silly. I feel wonderful.
- I think maybe the best thing would be...

626
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,405
- No, Jack.
- Kitty, please.

627
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:26,960
- No.
- Kitty, listen to me. You gotta trust me.

628
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:29,327
No. Jack! Jack!

629
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:31,209
Argh!

630
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:37,286
Honey, what's the rush?
Don't you want your entree?

631
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:38,885
Oh, my God!

632
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:43,250
No, Jack.
I want to share myself with you right now.

633
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:46,449
Oh... Oh...

634
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:52,289
Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea
in front of all these nice people.

635
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:54,602
Whoa, hold it, Kitty. Don't do it.

636
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,525
Not here. Not here.
Kitty, please! Heads up!

637
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,089
Kitty!

638
01:01:12,532 --> 01:01:15,410
Must be something she ate. Huh.

639
01:01:18,492 --> 01:01:20,483
Incoming!

640
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,604
Keep the change!

641
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:14,210
- I figured out something about you.
- Yeah? What?

642
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:20,367
Once a person gets past that tight-ass routine
of yours, you're not a bad guy.

643
01:02:21,732 --> 01:02:25,930
No! And I'll tell you something else,
Lefkowitz,

644
01:02:26,012 --> 01:02:28,367
you make me laugh.

645
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:30,443
Imitation of an owl.

646
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:42,006
I think you're very pretty.

647
01:02:43,212 --> 01:02:45,203
You do?

648
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:49,129
Thanks.

649
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:27,090
- Rose!
- Bernie?

650
01:03:27,172 --> 01:03:28,969
Rosie.

651
01:03:31,052 --> 01:03:32,485
Hey, Bernie.

652
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:38,811
- What's the matter? You sick?
- This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come.

653
01:03:38,892 --> 01:03:42,805
- Jesus Christ. What are you talking about?
- I can't do this to Rose.

654
01:03:42,892 --> 01:03:45,360
- I think we better go now.
- Bullshit!

655
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:47,443
Bernie, bullshit!

656
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:53,327
Your wife is just an excuse, d'you know that?
An excuse so you don't have to go on living.

657
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:57,690
Well, guess what, buster?
Life goes on.

658
01:03:57,772 --> 01:04:00,605
And if you had any,
if you'll pardon my French, balls,

659
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:03,206
you'd face up to the fact that she's dead.

660
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:06,682
Rose is dead, Bernie, and you're not!

661
01:04:18,532 --> 01:04:20,523
Are you all right?

662
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:24,363
Um, I, uh...

663
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:29,611
I was going through
one of Susan's photo albums today,

664
01:04:29,692 --> 01:04:36,882
and there were some photos of David on
his fourteenth birthday at a New Year's party.

665
01:04:40,212 --> 01:04:44,490
It's five years of his growing up
that we've missed.

666
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:51,641
This is our family. My life doesn't have
any meaning without them.

667
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:55,407
Ben, I want us to stay here.

668
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:58,086
I want us all to be together.

669
01:04:59,252 --> 01:05:03,564
Look, I know you're worried,
about the boy and his mother.

670
01:05:03,652 --> 01:05:05,643
I'm worried, too.

671
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:13,844
Look around, honey. I mean, everybody
we know, except for Bernie, is sick or dying.

672
01:05:13,932 --> 01:05:16,446
They're dropping like flies.

673
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:21,088
Honey, I don't wanna
watch that happen to you.

674
01:05:21,172 --> 01:05:24,005
I don't want it to happen to me.

675
01:05:24,092 --> 01:05:26,367
And we can beat it, you know?

676
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:29,642
But it's not right.

677
01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:32,565
People shouldn't outlive their children.

678
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:36,327
D'you want the truth?

679
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:43,003
I'm scared to death.

680
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:47,770
Don't you think I know that?

681
01:05:47,852 --> 01:05:51,447
I'm scared, too, but not of dying.

682
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,330
I'm scared of living without you.

683
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,530
But I don't want to leave here.

684
01:06:14,332 --> 01:06:16,323
Morning.

685
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:19,082
- How's it going?
- Good.

686
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:22,528
We can get in and out of the institute
without being discovered.

687
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,603
Great. Great.

688
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:32,130
That was some date last night, huh?

689
01:06:32,212 --> 01:06:34,806
How are you feeling?

690
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:37,201
Foolish.

691
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:42,491
I should have known better than to eat
something when I didn't know what it was.

692
01:06:42,572 --> 01:06:45,803
But thank you for taking care of me.

693
01:06:45,892 --> 01:06:49,282
- So where did you sleep?
- Are you kidding? Sleep?

694
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,682
I was up all night
waiting for the cops to show up.

695
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:54,967
Well, I guess we made a clean getaway.

696
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:58,328
I'm sorry, Jack. Is there any way
that I could make it up to you?

697
01:06:58,412 --> 01:07:01,085
Come on, come on, Kitty.

698
01:07:01,172 --> 01:07:06,246
Compared to some of my dates,
last night was a raging success.

699
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:12,608
I don't know. Sometimes I think
maybe I'll be one of those guys

700
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:17,368
who never finds anyone,
lives on TV dinners, talks to his dog,

701
01:07:17,452 --> 01:07:21,081
which is OK cos I kind of like dogs.

702
01:07:21,732 --> 01:07:26,567
Jack, I'd like to show you something, but in
order to see it you'll have to close your eyes.

703
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:31,042
- This isn't gonna be anything kinky, is it?
- No, I don't think so.

704
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:32,929
OK.

705
01:07:54,172 --> 01:07:56,288
Oh, oh, wow.

706
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,169
Sh.

707
01:09:43,372 --> 01:09:47,923
Vital signs are dropping fast.
Respiration rate's down. Looks bad.

708
01:09:48,012 --> 01:09:51,891
I think that dog and pony show wore him out.
What do you think?

709
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:55,931
I think that in a couple of days
it'll be out of our hands.

710
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:58,003
That's what I think.

711
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:10,569
- How do you know it'll work?
- It has to work. He wasn't revived properly.

712
01:10:10,652 --> 01:10:13,405
If we don't get him back now,
he won't survive.

713
01:10:13,492 --> 01:10:15,483
We need your help.

714
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:19,691
I don't know... Thanks.

715
01:10:19,772 --> 01:10:24,641
Breaking into that place sounds kind of risky,
especially now that the military's involved.

716
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:26,927
Joe's right. What if we get caught?

717
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:30,721
Will you listen to us?
We're back less than a week,

718
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:34,168
and already we sound like
a bunch of frightened old geezers.

719
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:36,846
Have we forgotten what they've given us?

720
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:41,767
We owe them everything, and if one of
their friends need help, I'll damn well give it.

721
01:10:41,852 --> 01:10:44,446
You can count me in.

722
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:49,163
Well, we're in.

723
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:54,447
- OK. Count us in, too.
- Good.

724
01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:57,808
Once we get our friend back,
we'll go to the rendezvous point.

725
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:02,283
The ship will meet us at midnight.
If you have unfinished business, do it today.

726
01:11:02,372 --> 01:11:04,124
Joe.

727
01:11:05,452 --> 01:11:08,728
- Why don't you tell me, Joe?
- Bernie...

728
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:11,280
- We were going to...
- Don't you "Bernie" me.

729
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:14,250
You can all go straight to hell.

730
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,007
Bernie!

731
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:21,208
Goddamn it, Bernie, wait a minute.

732
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:26,685
When were you going to tell me, Joe? Or were
you going to let me find out after you'd gone?

733
01:11:26,772 --> 01:11:31,687
I didn't have the heart to tell you we were
only staying a while. I was trying to help you.

734
01:11:31,772 --> 01:11:35,765
Help me! You just yanked the rug
right out from under me.

735
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:40,243
Do me a favour, go be a good
Samaritan somewhere else.

736
01:11:41,572 --> 01:11:47,044
You know, Bernie, you're the most miserable,
self-centred complainer I've ever met.

737
01:11:47,132 --> 01:11:52,331
Other people are in pain and afraid, and
if you'd open your eyes you might see that.

738
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:56,530
As far as I'm concerned, you can feel sorry
for yourself until hell freezes over.

739
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,400
You don't deserve to have friends like us.

740
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:13,010
Here, here it is.
Now you throw it. Throw it fast.

741
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:17,085
That's the way. That's the way.
Throw it to Mary.

742
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:22,922
That's a good throw.

743
01:12:25,852 --> 01:12:27,843
Yeah, that's the way.

744
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,043
Catch it.

745
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:41,682
Anthony!

746
01:12:42,412 --> 01:12:44,607
- Anthony!
- Oh, no.

747
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:48,566
Anthony!

748
01:12:52,692 --> 01:12:55,331
- Oh, God, no!

749
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,802
Someone, please call an ambulance.

750
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:10,369
Joe.

751
01:13:11,612 --> 01:13:13,603
Hello, Bernie.

752
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,731
I went looking for you at the motel.

753
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:23,090
Ruby told me. I couldn't find the others.
How is she?

754
01:13:24,092 --> 01:13:26,083
Doesn't look good.

755
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:32,527
Really something the way things work out.

756
01:13:32,612 --> 01:13:36,969
She was so happy to be back here,
and then this happens.

757
01:13:37,052 --> 01:13:39,043
Did you ever tell her?

758
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:43,363
- Tell her what?
- That you're sick again.

759
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,487
I've known you over 30 years, Joe.

760
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:54,362
After you blew up this afternoon,
I figured it out.

761
01:13:58,012 --> 01:14:00,401
Will you get better if you go back?

762
01:14:00,492 --> 01:14:02,608
I got better before.

763
01:14:02,692 --> 01:14:05,365
You don't get sick there.

764
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:10,210
- Mr Finley?
- That's me.

765
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:15,483
Your wife's vital signs are stable
at the moment, but she's comatose.

766
01:14:15,572 --> 01:14:19,724
I don't expect her to last the night.

767
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,803
I'm sorry.

768
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,564
- Can I see her?
- Yes, of course.

769
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:24,960
Honey, can you hear me?

770
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:23,284
Joe.

771
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,400
Hello, my darling.

772
01:17:28,052 --> 01:17:31,010
What happened? I can't remember...

773
01:17:31,092 --> 01:17:33,481
You were in an accident.

774
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:35,802
But you're gonna be fine.

775
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:40,410
I dreamed I...

776
01:17:40,492 --> 01:17:44,087
Something was pulling me
farther and farther away.

777
01:17:45,052 --> 01:17:50,922
And then you came and held me
and wouldn't let me go.

778
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:01,242
My God, Joe.

779
01:18:01,332 --> 01:18:04,005
What's happened?

780
01:18:04,772 --> 01:18:09,402
- What have you done?
- I gave you a present.

781
01:18:09,492 --> 01:18:11,289
Something you needed.

782
01:18:12,492 --> 01:18:17,486
You know, a lot of my life
I've been a selfish son of a bitch.

783
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:18,766
Oh...

784
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:26,568
I haven't always taken care of you
the way I should have.

785
01:18:27,932 --> 01:18:30,127
But I always loved you.

786
01:18:30,212 --> 01:18:32,646
I know that, Joe.

787
01:18:32,732 --> 01:18:34,723
I've always known that.

788
01:18:36,372 --> 01:18:38,283
Joe...

789
01:18:38,372 --> 01:18:40,522
I can't be without you.

790
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:45,208
Sure you can.
I want you to take thatjob.

791
01:18:47,492 --> 01:18:49,483
And anyway...

792
01:18:51,252 --> 01:18:53,049
my time's run out.

793
01:18:53,172 --> 01:18:55,163
Oh, Joe.

794
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,363
I am so tired.

795
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:05,408
I am...

796
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:08,484
so damn tired.

797
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:15,687
Then rest, darling.

798
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:21,561
Go ahead and rest.

799
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:43,009
Well...

800
01:19:43,852 --> 01:19:46,047
that's the end of an era.

801
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:49,407
Won't be the same now.

802
01:19:50,372 --> 01:19:53,603
We never should've come back.

803
01:19:53,692 --> 01:19:57,970
If we'd stayed put,
this never would have happened.

804
01:19:58,092 --> 01:20:01,402
Aw, you can't second-guess fate.

805
01:20:01,492 --> 01:20:07,362
You gotta take it the way it comes,
then try and figure out how to deal with it.

806
01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:13,000
Joe would have liked this.
He loved the beach.

807
01:20:13,132 --> 01:20:15,168
He didn't give a shit about the beach.

808
01:20:15,252 --> 01:20:21,043
It's them smooth-legged girls in them
dental-floss bikinis... that's what he liked!

809
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:25,405
I'm gonna miss that old son of a bitch.

810
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,289
Yeah.

811
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,403
Me too, pal.

812
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:33,723
Me too.

813
01:20:58,412 --> 01:21:00,403
She's finally asleep.

814
01:21:29,772 --> 01:21:31,683
Ohh...

815
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:02,722
Art, honey, can you give me a hand?

816
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,807
I'll be right there.

817
01:22:11,852 --> 01:22:14,047
I think we overdid this.

818
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:17,729
Half of these things won't fit.

819
01:22:17,812 --> 01:22:20,690
I've been thinking.

820
01:22:20,772 --> 01:22:23,809
Could we be making a mistake?

821
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:28,841
I mean, are we doing right... by our child?

822
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:34,490
Is it fair to take him that far away?

823
01:22:35,812 --> 01:22:38,645
I know it won't matter when he's young, but...

824
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:41,371
what about when he grows up?

825
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:45,127
Think of what he'll be missing.

826
01:22:45,212 --> 01:22:49,251
All those experiences we took for granted,

827
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:51,323
he won't have.

828
01:22:52,892 --> 01:22:57,841
Art, do you really think
I hadn't thought about that?

829
01:22:57,932 --> 01:23:03,404
For all the snowflakes and sunsets
and rainbows he won't see,

830
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:07,041
think of what he will have,
think of what he'll gain.

831
01:23:07,132 --> 01:23:09,726
A world with no illness,

832
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:13,043
no poverty, no wars.

833
01:23:13,132 --> 01:23:15,930
Besides, if we stay here,

834
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:20,050
our child might not be born.

835
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:26,530
We'd never live long enough
to see him grow up.

836
01:23:38,092 --> 01:23:40,083
Well, it's time we head out.

837
01:23:40,172 --> 01:23:42,163
Be a good boy.

838
01:23:47,492 --> 01:23:52,202
- Take good care of your mother.
- Wait a minute, Grandpa.

839
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,283
Thanks.

840
01:24:14,212 --> 01:24:16,203
- Have a safe trip.
- Bye-bye now.

841
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:18,010
Bye, Ruby.

842
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:22,882
Oh, we can'tjust leave you here like this.
Please, won't you come with us?

843
01:24:22,972 --> 01:24:28,410
I belong here. I'm going to take thatjob
with the children. It's what I want.

844
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:33,282
- You'll be all alone.
- What am I, chopped liver? She'll be fine.

845
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:36,802
We're gonna miss you...

846
01:24:36,892 --> 01:24:38,928
more than you know.

847
01:24:40,012 --> 01:24:42,082
- Goodbye, Bernie.
- Bye, Art.

848
01:24:42,772 --> 01:24:46,845
- I hate these long goodbyes, so bye, my girl.
- Bye-bye.

849
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:51,289
- Bernie, I'm glad I got to see you.
- Me too, Ben.

850
01:24:51,372 --> 01:24:54,170
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mary.

851
01:25:02,332 --> 01:25:04,323
Bye, Bernie. Bye.

852
01:25:05,452 --> 01:25:07,443
- Goodbye, Alma.
- Bye.

853
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:20,043
Be careful, Jack.

854
01:26:15,492 --> 01:26:18,962
- Goin' to get something to eat.
- Bring me back a burger.

855
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:01,203
I'm so sorry.

856
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:20,611
Down by six, right?

857
01:29:58,652 --> 01:30:00,643
Come on.

858
01:30:02,172 --> 01:30:05,244
You take the passenger side.

859
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:56,612
Good evening, Doc.
You're working kinda late.

860
01:30:56,692 --> 01:31:00,731
Yeah, well, I had a couple of things
I had to finish up.

861
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:04,089
You have a good evening.

862
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:55,324
- Power failure!
- Rebecca, get Engineering.

863
01:31:55,412 --> 01:31:57,972
- Right.

864
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,564
Damn!

865
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:04,843
That was weird.

866
01:32:06,732 --> 01:32:09,883
- Oh, my God. Rebecca, get Dr Baron!
- Right.

867
01:32:12,332 --> 01:32:15,927
- He's not in here.
- Phil!

868
01:32:16,012 --> 01:32:18,970
- Phil!
- Where the hell would he go?

869
01:32:20,092 --> 01:32:22,731
- This way.
- Yeah, let's check it out.

870
01:32:22,812 --> 01:32:26,361
- Have you seen anything?
- This way, this way.

871
01:32:41,252 --> 01:32:42,446
Phil.

872
01:32:43,692 --> 01:32:46,331
- Don't run.
- Sara, make sure the building is sealed.

873
01:32:46,412 --> 01:32:48,880
- Don't forget the sea door by the tanks.
- Right.

874
01:32:48,972 --> 01:32:51,042
Be careful. Don't frighten him.

875
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:58,768
There's someone in the building.
Check out the west wing.

876
01:33:13,892 --> 01:33:16,565
Let's go back to the lab.

877
01:33:18,892 --> 01:33:22,202
- Nothing down that way, sir.
- All right... all right.

878
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:26,808
We split up here. Everyone takes a door and
stays put. Nothing gets out of this building.

879
01:33:26,892 --> 01:33:29,167
Doug. Rebecca.

880
01:33:29,252 --> 01:33:31,607
You, come with me. Come on.

881
01:33:31,692 --> 01:33:34,081
I'll check the central core.

882
01:33:38,252 --> 01:33:41,562
OK. OK. We better move.

883
01:34:11,972 --> 01:34:13,564
Grandpa!

884
01:34:13,652 --> 01:34:16,769
David? Good.
Come on, you can help me.

885
01:34:24,812 --> 01:34:27,372
We're gonna have to do this, son.
Take a hold.

886
01:34:28,332 --> 01:34:30,323
Let's get it open.

887
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:34,002
Lean in.

888
01:34:38,492 --> 01:34:40,960
All right. Push, David. Push.

889
01:34:44,452 --> 01:34:46,249
Aagh!

890
01:34:47,972 --> 01:34:49,963
I got it, Gramps!

891
01:35:04,172 --> 01:35:06,481
Stop!

892
01:35:07,732 --> 01:35:09,529
What are you doing?

893
01:35:10,892 --> 01:35:13,247
Well, you see, he's my friend.

894
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,448
And we're gonna take him home.

895
01:35:16,012 --> 01:35:17,809
OK?

896
01:35:38,372 --> 01:35:40,567
Here they come.

897
01:35:59,692 --> 01:36:01,922
Did you see anyone, ma'am?

898
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:03,604
No.

899
01:36:15,732 --> 01:36:18,610
- Ahoy!
- Hello. Welcome back.

900
01:36:30,892 --> 01:36:32,883
There we go.

901
01:36:34,492 --> 01:36:37,882
All right, sir. There you go.

902
01:36:46,052 --> 01:36:49,249
- There you go, my boy.
- Hello, darling.

903
01:36:49,332 --> 01:36:52,005
- David, what are you doing here?
- Grandma.

904
01:36:52,092 --> 01:36:55,767
Are you all right? Are you both all right?
What happened?

905
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:59,925
Now, Mother, he was a lot of help to me
and without him, I wouldn't be here.

906
01:37:00,012 --> 01:37:05,484
- Yeah. I did all right, didn't I, Grandpa?
- I'll say! Hitting a baseball'll be a cinch now.

907
01:37:05,572 --> 01:37:07,722
I wish you'd be here to see it.

908
01:37:10,732 --> 01:37:12,962
We will be.

909
01:37:13,052 --> 01:37:14,690
What?

910
01:37:14,772 --> 01:37:18,481
- Well, hell, that's what you want, isn't it?
- Oh, Ben!

911
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:22,360
Oh, thank you, my darling. Thank you.

912
01:38:04,132 --> 01:38:06,327
Walter!

913
01:38:07,572 --> 01:38:11,042
- Good to see you, Jack.
- You make one hell of an entrance.

914
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:13,805
Thank you.

915
01:38:13,892 --> 01:38:17,726
- You've done well.
- He's weak, but he'll survive.

916
01:38:22,052 --> 01:38:24,202
Well, I see the gang's all here.

917
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:28,046
- Not the whole gang.
- I know.

918
01:38:28,132 --> 01:38:31,249
I'm sorry about Joe. He was a good man.

919
01:38:31,332 --> 01:38:34,324
And a good friend to all of us.

920
01:38:35,612 --> 01:38:39,321
Well, Ben, are you sure
you won't come with us?

921
01:38:39,412 --> 01:38:41,972
Real sure.

922
01:38:42,052 --> 01:38:44,407
I tell you.

923
01:38:44,492 --> 01:38:49,361
See, Walter, a man's
not supposed to outlive his children.

924
01:38:53,732 --> 01:38:57,964
And besides, I may see you
some other time, some other place.

925
01:38:58,052 --> 01:39:00,771
That may be true, Ben.

926
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,650
Well, I think it's time to leave.

927
01:39:07,652 --> 01:39:10,644
You've no idea how we'll miss you.

928
01:39:11,452 --> 01:39:14,125
You'll make a wonderful mother.

929
01:39:14,932 --> 01:39:18,129
You'll make a wonderful grandmother.

930
01:39:19,932 --> 01:39:22,924
You won't forget us, will you?

931
01:39:23,012 --> 01:39:25,003
Forget you? Ha!

932
01:39:26,412 --> 01:39:28,403
No, we won't forget you.

933
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:35,923
Now, you better get goin'.
You'll miss your connection in Baltimore!

934
01:39:40,412 --> 01:39:44,087
I thought you only cried
when somebody died.

935
01:39:46,092 --> 01:39:48,890
Or when your friends are leaving.

936
01:39:57,652 --> 01:39:59,643
Yeah!

937
01:40:00,772 --> 01:40:02,763
I see what you mean.

938
01:40:03,532 --> 01:40:05,523
Goodbye, Ben.

939
01:40:12,932 --> 01:40:16,129
Well... Oh, hey, come here.

940
01:40:18,092 --> 01:40:21,528
I got something here that means a lot to me.

941
01:40:21,612 --> 01:40:23,409
I want you to have it, Kitty.

942
01:40:23,492 --> 01:40:26,370
It's my high-school graduation photo.

943
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:30,081
I got it framed so you can
put it on the TV or something.

944
01:40:30,172 --> 01:40:32,970
Thank you. I really love it, Jack.

945
01:40:34,732 --> 01:40:36,723
I'll miss you, Kitty.

946
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:43,731
- I'll miss you too, Jack.
- I'm sorry. Kitty, it's time.

947
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:24,727
Excuse me?

948
01:43:25,252 --> 01:43:29,165
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but
I ran out of gas and you were the only light.

949
01:43:29,252 --> 01:43:32,085
Do you know a place nearby
where I can get gasoline?

950
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:34,163
I'll be right with you.

951
01:43:36,452 --> 01:43:40,161
Yeah, there's an all-nighter
about a mile down the road.

952
01:43:40,252 --> 01:43:42,368
I can give you a lift, if you want.

953
01:43:42,452 --> 01:43:46,240
- Sure you wouldn't mind?
- Oh, no. No problem.

954
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:51,925
- Kinda late to be out, huh?
- Yeah. Well, I'm just on my way from work.

955
01:43:52,012 --> 01:43:53,650
At this hour?!

956
01:43:53,732 --> 01:43:56,451
I wouldn't want yourjob.

957
01:43:56,532 --> 01:43:58,921
Neither would I. I just quit.

958
01:44:03,892 --> 01:44:07,931
- Why are you looking at me that way?
- Honestly, this is no line, I swear,

959
01:44:08,012 --> 01:44:10,401
but I think I know you from somewhere.

960
01:44:10,492 --> 01:44:12,608
- No, I don't think so.
- You sure?

961
01:44:12,692 --> 01:44:15,490
- Yeah.
- You look so familiar.

962
01:44:15,572 --> 01:44:18,644
No, I never forget a face.

963
01:44:18,732 --> 01:44:21,121
I'm sure I'd remember yours.

964
01:44:22,092 --> 01:44:25,926
- My name's Jack. Jack Bonner.
- Sara. Nice to meet you, Jack.

965
01:44:26,012 --> 01:44:28,003
Pleasure.

966
01:44:29,172 --> 01:44:33,085
- It's chilly, isn't it?
- Yeah. Well, you know, down... Oh!

967
01:44:33,172 --> 01:44:35,163
Where's my manners?

968
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:40,090
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

969
01:44:51,132 --> 01:44:53,487
- Ever been in a glass-bottom boat?
- No.

970
01:44:53,572 --> 01:44:56,040
- Wanna go on one?
- Yeah, I've always wanted to.

971
01:44:56,132 --> 01:44:57,531
- Really?
- Yeah.

972
01:44:57,612 --> 01:44:59,204
- Well, I got one.
- Really?

973
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:04,491
Yeah. Well, the bank owns it, but you're
looking at a captain of a glass-bottom boat.
