<i># Our love affair</i>

2
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:40,203
<i># Is a wondrous thing</i>

3
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:44,127
<i># That we'll rejoice</i>

00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:49,004

00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:53,970
<i># Our love was born</i>

6
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:58,649
<i># With our first embrace</i>

7
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:03,331
<i># And a page was torn</i>

8
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:08,489

00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,202
<i># Our love affair</i>

00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:18,123

00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:22,491

00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:36,963
<i># With a fervent prayer</i>

00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:41,126

<i># To remember</i>

19
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:07,728
While the New York Stock Exchange
showed signs of restlessness,

20
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,885
there was little or no uneasiness
on the part of optimists.

21
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:12,964
Here's good news for you bachelors.

22
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:16,125
Competition for pretty girls
will definitely be easier

23
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:20,365
now that Nickie Ferrante, the big
dame hunter, is going out of circulation.

24
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:23,365
It'll be wedding bells for him at long last.

25
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,728
Mr Ferrante is sailing today from Europe,

26
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,203
and Miss Lois Clarke
will be waiting for him in New York -

27
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,844
Lois and her lovely
600 million bucks. What a deal!

28
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:38,290
Not only all that lettuce,
but a beautiful tomato too. Wow!

29
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>Eccovi una notizia straordinaria,</i>

30
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,450
<i>Nickie Ferrante, il maestro</i>
<i>dell'arte dell'amore,,,,</i>

31
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,526
<i>,, e la signorina Lois Clarke,</i>

32
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:53,050
<i>,, dell'immensa ricchezza</i>
<i>di 600 milioni di dollari,,,</i>

33
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,564
<i>600 milioni di dollari!</i>

34
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:59,045
<i>E in lire italiane, quanti bilioni sarebbero?</i>

35
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:01,092
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

36
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,450
Here's rather a choice little titbit.

37
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:13,368
Nickie Ferrante sails tonight
to enter into matrimony

38
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,684
with one of America's industrial nobility.

39
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:20,162
Rock and gravel, I believe.

40
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:22,244
It's a Miss Lois...

41
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,485
Clarke.

42
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,564
Yes.

43
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:30,044
Well.

44
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:40,568
Well... there you have it.

45
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,444
Signor Ferrante?

46
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,724
Is he on board?

47
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,684
Boy. Here I am.

48
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:12,044
Signor Ferrante?
I have a telephone call for you from Paris.

49
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,284
Mr Ferrante, would you autograph
this picture, please?

50
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,807
I'm wanted on the telephone. Thank you.

51
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:24,451
Hello. Yes, this is Ferrante.

52
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,171
Who's calling?

53
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,721
- Put her on.
- You beast.

54
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:32,006
<i>Hello, Gabriella,</i>

55
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:36,003
- Don't you talk to me.
- Well, then, why did you call me?

56
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:40,206
How could you speak of love to me,
say the things you did,

57
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,363
and you about to be married.

58
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:45,445
Do you remember your words
when I gave you the cigarette case?

59
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,604
Of course, dear. I said...

60
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,651
I said...

61
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,770
Hello! Can you hear me?
I believe we're disconnected.

62
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:56,045
- We are not disconnected.
- Operator!

63
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,604
Oh, this is a shame.

64
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:01,287
<i>Hypocrite! I have in my hand a knife,</i>

65
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,328
<i>And I wish it were in your back,</i>

66
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:09,323
<i>Menteur! Lâche! Dégoûtant!</i>
<i>Tu n'as pas honte?</i>

67
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,762
Well, Mr Ferrante!
My name's Hathaway. Ned Hathaway.

68
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,208
- Really?
- Welcome aboard.

69
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:25,128
I was wondering if you'd care to join my wife
and my sister and me in a game of bridge?

70
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,568
I'm sorry, Mr Hathaway, but I cheat.

71
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,324
It's an addiction.

72
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:44,369
I beg your pardon.
I think you have my cigarette case.

73
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:52,771
I might as well confess. I am ajewel thief.

74
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,769
- I don't believe it.
- I was returning it to the purser.

75
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,282
I found it in the...

76
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,685
Just a moment. How do I know it's yours?

77
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,607
Well. There's an inscription
to me on the inside.

78
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,244
"To Nicolo..."

79
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,727
Don't tell me you're the famous...

80
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:21,284
Oh, I have read so much
about you in <i>Life</i> and <i>Look</i> and...

81
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,568
Possibly <i>Good Housekeeping?</i>

82
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:26,565
- Now, may I have my case?
- Just a moment.

83
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:35,171
This is frightfully intimate. I know
just enough French to be embarrassed.

84
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:39,132
Could you refine it a little
and tell me in effect what it says?

85
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,204
Well, in effect, it says...

86
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:49,172
"In memory of three unforgettable nights
aboard <i>La Gabriella,"Which</i> is her yacht.

87
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,404
I guess that's you all right.

88
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:57,248
Tell me, did you write the song
"I'll Never Smile Again"?

89
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:00,011
No.

90
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:04,132
But I'm thinking of writing one
called "Moon over <i>La Gabriella",</i>

91
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,928
Do you think it will ever
take the place of night baseball?

92
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,924
Please wait.

93
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,451
I'm in trouble.

94
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,889
I could have told you -
playing around yachts. The poor thing.

95
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,045
- I must talk with someone.
- I'm not very good at that.

96
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:39,048
- I talk a lot. I've tried to break the habit...
- But you have such an honest face.

97
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,683
- I have?
- I can trust you, can't I?

98
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,609
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Good. Come with me.

99
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:48,208
The captain has an honest face too.
Why not tell him your troubles?

100
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,807
- Shall we go to your cabin or mine?
- No. Mine.

101
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,930
- Mine's just around the corner.
- Mine's here.

102
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,884
It's not that I'm prudish.

103
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,248
But my mother told me never to enter
a man's room in months ending in "r".

104
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,324
She did?

105
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:12,372
Oh, well. Your mother's not
only beautiful, she's clever too.

106
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,481
- What is your name?
- Terry McKay.

107
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,091
Terry McKay, and I'm travelling alone.

108
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:22,529
- Was that what was troubling you?
- Yes.

109
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,604
- May I?
- You may.

110
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,604
Thank you.

111
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,644
I think you can leave it here.

112
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:38,125
You know, this couldn't be nicer.
You saved my life.

113
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,603
I was bored to death. I hadn't seen
one attractive woman on board.

114
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:46,687
Isn't that terrible? I was alarmed. I thought
"Don't beautiful women travel any more?"

115
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:50,209
Then I saw you, and I was saved... I hope.

116
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:58,206
Tell me. Have you been getting
results with a line like that?

117
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,488
Or would I be surprised?

118
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,768
If you were surprised, I'd be surprised.

119
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,844
That sounds like a nasty crack.

120
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,243
- I could make a few too, if I wanted to.
- I'm sure you could.

121
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,927
- All right. I think I will.
- I'm listening.

122
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:14,688
Does your fiancée know
the lady of the yacht, Gabriella?

123
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,527
Certainly. She's her best friend.

124
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:20,444
Chummy little group.

125
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:26,487
You know, this ship is going much too fast.

126
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:30,690
We ought to take advantage of every moment.

127
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:35,289
Don't you think that life should be gay
and bright and bubbly, like champagne?

128
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,841
- I like pink champagne.
- That's the kind I mean.

129
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:42,688
Is there any reason why this trip
shouldn't be pink champagne?

130
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,764
What?

131
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,804
Oh, dear.

132
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,647
- He wouldn't like it?
- No.

133
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,212
- Husband?
- No.

134
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,284
- He still wouldn't like it?
- No.

135
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:04,491
Why isn't he travelling with you?

136
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:07,246
Because he had to go
to Texas on a big merger.

137
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:12,449
He thought it'd be a good idea if I took
a trip while he consummated this big deal,

138
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,728
because I have no head for business.

139
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:17,964
It's beyond me how
the more money a corporation loses,

140
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,568
the more it makes,
because of the carry-overs with the write-offs.

141
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:26,124
The big secret seems to be to merge a sick
corporation with a big, fat healthy one,

142
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,773
- and then everybody gets well.
- Silly, isn't it?

143
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:34,371
He doesn't think I'm dumb, but he doesn't
think I'm very bright. About things like that.

144
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:37,286
- It isn't necessary, is it?
- Thank you.

145
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,364
That's all right.

146
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,089
- So he trusts you?
- Implicitly.

147
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:48,122
- No mistakes? No errors?
- Five faithful years.

148
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,881
Sounds awful, doesn't it? But it's true.

149
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,964
Yes. Well, there you are.

150
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,884
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

151
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,491
I don't...

152
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,009
You could light it from that inscription,
couldn't you?

153
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,482
I like that. I must stay tuned into you.

154
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,209
He's a very lucky fellow.
Must be a remarkable man.

155
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:17,323
Well, you can imagine how attractive he is
when I can resist so charming a person as...

156
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,529
Yes, yes. I understand.

157
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,648
Well, it was nice, wasn't it?

158
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:27,731
Oh, well. Well, there's still
deck tennis, shuffleboard, bingo.

159
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:33,608
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed?
- Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

160
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,446
- Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry.
- That's all right. Don't apologise.

161
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,603
I do hope it won't affect your ego!

162
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:42,811
No, please, don't think anything of it.
I'll just take my ego for a walk.

163
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,847
- Unless you'd care to...
- Have dinner with you?

164
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,924
I'd love to.

165
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,124
Here comes my friend Ferrante now.

166
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:01,764
Mr Ferrante, I'd like to have you meet
my sister, Miss Hathaway, and my wife...

167
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:14,521
And when you were little, what did
your nurse read to you at bedtime?

168
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:17,207
- Let me think...
- The memoirs of Casanova?

169
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,966
Every night. And then we'd turn out the light.

170
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,283
- "We"?
- I was only so big.

171
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,969
You must have had a happy childhood.

172
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,281
Ah, yes.

173
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,767
- And women...
- Oh, women.

174
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:32,731
- You've known quite a few, haven't you?
- I don't know.

175
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:36,726
- Perhaps "few" is the wrong word.
- Let's say it's not precise.

176
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:41,967
I beg pardon, Signor Ferrante. Shall
I reserve this table for you every night?

177
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,604
- Why not?
- Thank you.

178
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:50,208
- Now, where were we?
- I suppose they were all in love with you.

179
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:53,365
- I doubt it.
- But you haven't had much respect for them.

180
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,763
- On the contrary.
- You've always been fair in yourjudgments.

181
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:00,284
I've been more than fair. I idealise them.

182
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,409
Every woman I meet, I put up there.

183
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,371
Of course, the longer I know her,
and the better I know her...

184
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,683
It's hard to keep them up there, isn't it?

185
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,963
Pretty soon, the pedestal wobbles

186
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,044
and then topples.

187
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,564
<i>C'est la vie,</i> Et cetera.

188
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:18,333
Now, come on. Let's talk about you.

189
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,449
No. Not tonight.

190
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,008
We'll talk about me some other time.

191
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:27,927
- We've nothing planned for tomorrow.
- Oh, I have.

192
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:31,323
Oh, no. We'll talk about <i>me</i> tomorrow.

193
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,842
It turned out beautifully, didn't it?
It's really warm.

194
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,924
Thank you.

195
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:51,209
Now, where were we? You were
going to tell me where you were born.

196
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,330
- That's right. Well...
- Mr Ferrante? Telegram.

197
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,804
Thank you.

198
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,884
Excuse me, Miss McKay.

199
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,770
- Miss McKay?
- Yes?

200
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:03,083
I have one for you too.

201
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,164
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

202
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,964
Excuse me, Mr Ferrante.

203
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,450
- From him?
- From her?

204
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:30,004
Well, where were <i>we?</i>

205
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,725
Well, I was about to tell you where I was born.

206
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:36,202
And I was born in Boston.

207
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,409
I can hardly wait for you to grow up.

208
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,724
Be patient. I grew up... quickly.

209
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:47,129
I went to New York, and I got ajob singing in
a nightclub from ten to three in the morning.

210
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:52,367
The manager used to chase me round the
office until four, then... I went home.

211
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,444
- Did he ever...
- Oh, no.

212
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:58,721
Well, then one evening... <i>he</i> came along.

213
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,804
Oh, this is the fellow.

214
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:06,128
And he said "You don't
belong in a place like this."

215
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,292
- Really?
- And I said "I don't?"

216
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,969
And then... what?

217
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:18,408
- What what?
- I thought you said something.

218
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:22,884
- No, I didn't say anything.
- I'm sorry. But you're right, you know.

219
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,965
He said I belonged in
a penthouse on Park Avenue,

220
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,886
with a breathtaking view of the East River.

221
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:36,529
- An ideal place for you to improve yourself.
- Yes. So I studied hard.

222
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,808
- Singing?
- And music

223
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,532
and art. Literature.

224
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:44,525
So that one day you'd make
a perfectly charming wife.

225
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,763
Yes, that was the general idea.

226
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,686
- Anything wrong with that?
- No, no, nothing.

227
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,570
That's what I thought.

228
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:57,326
Well, that sort of brings us up to date.

229
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:00,368
Now my life is an open book.

230
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,569
That's only one page.

231
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,644
That's the only page.

232
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,049
I beg your pardon.

233
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,964
Thank you.

234
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:17,123
- No, no. Bad.
- Wait a minute.

235
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:21,043
- That's an interesting camera. May I see that?
- Oh, yes.

236
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,124
It's new, isn't it?

237
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,604
Please! Stop!

238
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,923
That's unfortunate, isn't it?

239
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,004
That was not very nice.

240
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:34,532
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I know.

241
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:38,731
You know, it's obviously no good
either of us being seen together.

242
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:43,250
Right or wrong, people will talk, and so...
I guess it had better be goodbye.

243
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,324
- That seems a pity.
- Goodbye.

244
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,283
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

245
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,204
- Of you?
- Yes.

246
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:51,612
No.

247
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:56,721
You know, we have several days to go
on this voyage, and I can't stand monotony.

248
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,725
Well, you can always take
long walks in the sunshine.

249
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,804
What'll I do if it rains?

250
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:06,362
No. It's no good.

251
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:10,162
- You mean it's particularly no good for you.
- Yes.

252
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:15,687
Being seen with you is news, and
I don't want to get my picture in the papers.

253
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:20,290
So, I'll go my way

254
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,682
and you go yours.

255
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,525
Help!

256
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,243
Here. Let me... You're heavy.

257
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,008
- Are you in trouble?
- Yes. Give me a hand, will you? He's heavy.

258
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,402
Come on, chum.

259
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,165
Now, let go.

260
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:50,565
- Try it the other way round, Dad.
- Thank you. You're a great help.

261
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,769
Well, how'd you come to do that?

262
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,606
I got tangled up.

263
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,287
Couldn't get down?

264
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:02,963
- You're quite a fellow.
- You're quite a fellow yourself.

265
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:06,602
- Yes? Why?
- Everybody on the ship's talkin' about ya.

266
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:10,288
- No kidding. What are they saying?
- I don't know.

267
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:14,605
Every time they start talkin' about you,
they make me leave the room.

268
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,173
- I don't get it.
- You take over.

269
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,892
You want to watch it, chum.
You might hurt yourself.

270
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,248
When I was little, I fell and broke my leg.

271
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,324
How is it now?

272
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:34,965
- Well, it's all right, I guess.
- Well, what are you crabbing about?

273
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:37,044
I'm not crab...

274
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,485
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,604
Champagne cocktail, please.

276
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:47,043
- Have you any cigarettes?
- The smoke-room steward, sir.

277
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,363
- Have you got pink champagne?
- Of course.

278
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,444
Let me try a little.

279
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,370
Good evening.

280
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:02,126
Could I have a champagne cocktail, please?

281
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,047
- Do you have pink champagne?
- Of course.

282
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,164
Thank you.

283
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,370
Hello.

284
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,523
I changed my table to a table for one.

285
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:46,564
So did I.

286
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:51,727
Now isn't that a shame, after that delightful
dinner we had together last night?

287
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:58,448
- Do you speak Gaelic?
- Fluently.

288
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,842
How do you say "Let's get out of here"?

289
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,484
Well, well, well!

290
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:15,647
Well!

291
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,364
Well, well, well. That's good, isn't it?

292
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,401
This is what's known as fooling the world.

293
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:13,281
- What'd you say?
- This is called fooling the world.

294
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,285
I can't hear what you're saying.

295
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:20,651
Who do you think you're hiding from?
Everybody's staring at us. It's awful.

296
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:28,730
- This is awful. I'm going to leave.
- No, no. Let me.

297
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,770
Sit down.

298
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:42,722
- Pardon, sir. That's the lady's purse.
- I know. I was just...

299
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,883
No, wait a minute. The last one...

300
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:23,009
Oh, my, it's a small pool, isn't it?

301
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:27,052
- You've got my cigarette case.
- Well, not on me.

302
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:31,282
We've got a five-hour stopover
in Villefranche.

303
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:35,207
- Yes. Are you going ashore?
- Yes. I'm calling on a lady.

304
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,121
- In every port, huh?
- This happens to be my grandmother.

305
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,204
- Don't you believe me?
- No!

306
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,490
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes, I'd like to meet her.

307
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,564
Well, you've got a date.

308
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,484
- Surprised?
- All right.

309
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:11,532
- A present for your little old grandmother?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

310
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,285
Isn't it beautiful down there?

311
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:19,206
- Yes, but do you want to hear an old joke?
- What?

312
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,285
- If it's so beautiful down there, why...
- Bring me up here?

313
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,483
That's an old joke all right.

314
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:27,451
You're quite sure your grandmother
isn't an old joke?

315
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,524
Oh, I do wish you'd trust me.

316
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,682
What a divine place.

317
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:05,048
It's perfect. I'm beginning
to think you <i>have</i> a grandmother.

318
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,409
That's surprising.
I'll try to find her and prove it.

319
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:25,284
She's not there.

320
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:34,161
Look. She must be in the chapel.

321
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,124
How are you, fella?

322
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:55,526
What is it about this place? Something
about it makes you want to whisper.

323
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,605
It's so peaceful here. It's like another world.

324
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:02,446
Well, it is. It's my grandmother's world.

325
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,728
Do tell me more about her.

326
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:08,601
My grandfather was in the diplomatic service.
They travelled the world.

327
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,968
When he retired, they came here to live.

328
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,647
He's buried there behind the chapel.

329
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,724
She stayed on to be near him.

330
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:20,045
She must be waiting, I think impatiently,
for the day she will join him.

331
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:48,529
<i>Mais pourquoi tu ne m'as pas prévenue?</i>

332
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,683
<i>J'ai voulu te faire une surprise!</i>

333
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:58,322
- <i>C'est vrai que tu vas te marier?</i>
- <i>Oui, ça en a bien I'air,</i>

334
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:02,732
- <i>Et toi, Tu rajeunis tous les jours!</i>
- <i>Blagueur!</i>

335
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,812
- Is this the girl?
- No.

336
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,562
Darling, this is Terry McKay.

337
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:23,291
How do you do?

338
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,126
Janou thought you were the girl
I'm going to marry.

339
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,892
<i>Elle est charmante, Elle me plaît beaucoup,</i>

340
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:33,045
<i>Pardon,</i> I was only saying
I like you very much.

341
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,567
Thank you. I'm glad.

342
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:39,324
Well, if you will excuse me, I must sit down.

343
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,727
I am longer at my prayers nowadays.

344
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:46,607
Oh, my knees!

345
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,684
They're as old as I am.

346
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:53,248
You have the most beautiful place here.

347
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,322
Thank you.

348
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:59,328
- I think I could stay here for ever.
- <i>Oh, non!</i> You are too young for that.

349
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:02,325
It is a good place to sit and remember,

350
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:06,603
but you have still to create your memories.

351
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,569
And the chapel seems so charming.

352
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:14,962
- Would you like to go in?
- Oh, may I?

353
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,044
- <i>Je vous en prie,</i>
- Thank you.

354
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:20,804
Oh, Nicolo!

355
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:28,809
And you, Nicolo. How long is it
since you have been in a chapel?

356
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,246
Well, I...

357
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,972
- Not since you were an altar boy.
- I know.

358
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,284
- Go in. It won't hurt you.
- All right.

359
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:38,443
- I will prepare the tea.
- Let me help you.

360
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,524
<i>Non, non, non, Vas-y,</i>

361
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,606
<i>Marius! Devinez qui est arrivé,</i>

362
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:37,332
- <i>Et qui est arrivé, madame?</i>
- <i>Regardez,</i>

363
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:41,130
<i>Oh, monsieur Nicolas!</i>

364
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,124
<i>Je suis content!</i>

365
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,884
<i>II y a la grand-mère,</i>

366
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,448
- This is Marie.
- Well, hello!

367
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,366
- <i>C'est la dernière?</i>
- <i>Oui, c'est la plus jeune,</i>

368
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:02,444
- <i>Combien maintenant?</i>
- <i>Sept,</i>

369
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,127
<i>Depuis que vous êtes parti, ça fait trois,</i>

370
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,965
This is my friend Marius.

371
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:11,806
Marius has had three children
since I last saw him.

372
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,090
Marius says France needs men.

373
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,169
So he has seven daughters.

374
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:21,649
- Come to see the rest of my family.
- Yes, go along.

375
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:25,248
- Sure?
- I should like a tête-à-tête with Miss McKay.

376
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,324
Janou, please be kind.

377
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,884
I won't betray you.

378
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:34,483
- Can I help you?
- Thank you, my dear.

379
00:30:35,493 --> 00:30:40,886
I am glad you are not, like so many young
people nowadays, above a little housework.

380
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:46,172
There were ten of us in our family. We all had
to do our share, or go to bed without supper.

381
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,289
Oh, what a magnificent room.

382
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:51,604
Oh, yes. My husband was a great collector.

383
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,284
He loved beautiful things.

384
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,001
Me too.

385
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:59,210
I should have a housekeeper,
but I have outlived two.

386
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:02,285
And I'm too old to start
breaking in another one.

387
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:08,885
Besides, I don't mind telling you -
I had planned only to live till I was 80.

388
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:14,445
Now I am 82. If I'm not going to die,
I must start saving money for my old age.

389
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:17,204
You're very wise.

390
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:22,732
- You like it?
- Yes. It's charming.

391
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,204
- Nickie?
- Yes. He did that a long time ago.

392
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,648
But it's very good!

393
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,724
He is very talented.

394
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:39,890
Forgive me. You see,
I had no means of knowing.

395
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,525
Unfortunately, he's also very critical.

396
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:48,206
The artist in him would create.
The critic would destroy.

397
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:52,127
- As a result, he has done nothing since.
- What a pity.

398
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:55,728
Besides, he's been too busy
"living", as they call it.

399
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,643
- May I?
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

400
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,844
There.

401
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,287
It has been such a tremendous
excitement for me, this visit.

402
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,804
I am trying to appear calm.

403
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,811
- Don't you think I do pretty well?
- You do wonderfully well.

404
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:20,728
- There we are.
- Thank you.

405
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,683
I love Nicolo so much.

406
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:30,053
When he was a small boy,
he charmed us all with his piano playing.

407
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,124
Then he studied painting.

408
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:36,129
And the worst of it is
he's so good at everything.

409
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:38,283
Ajack of all talents?

410
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,968
Everything comes too easily to him.

411
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:46,046
He's always attracted by
the art he isn't practising,

412
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,523
the place he hasn't been,
the girl he hasn't met.

413
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:52,923
Perhaps <i>I shouldn't have met him.

414
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:57,202
No, my dear. You are different.

415
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:03,523
I don't mind confessing to you -
I have been worried about him.

416
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,442
- Sometimes I'm frightened.
- Why?

417
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:15,086
That life will present a bill to Nicolo one day,
and he will find it hard to pay.

418
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:23,844
But when I see you with him, I feel better.

419
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,730
Me? You do?

420
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:29,804
Yes, you.

421
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:34,085
I wish I could share your confidence.

422
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:39,443
You will have it when you need it.
That is your character.

423
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:46,731
There is nothing wrong with Nicolo
that a good woman couldn't make right.

424
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,726
I saw Marius's entire family.
Seven daughters!

425
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:02,772
- I had a nice talk with his wife.
- You should have had a nice talk with him.

426
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:04,844
And don't sit on my hat.

427
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:10,490
Tell me, what have you two
been talking about?

428
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,127
- You'd be surprised.
- I'll bet I would.

429
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:16,205
And I'll bet that Janou did all the talking.

430
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:19,490
She told me that when you were a boy
and didn't get your own way,

431
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:22,371
you'd lie on the floor and kick,
and get red in the face.

432
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:23,932
Really?

433
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,322
You should have winked the other eye.

434
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,564
- What did you say?
- I said you didn't do that any more.

435
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:32,366
No.

436
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:36,886
Now, when you don't get your own way,
you just get embarrassed.

437
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,324
Want some tea?

438
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:46,246
Remind me not to explain that to you later.

439
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:49,009
Yes, I want some tea.

440
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:51,084
Janou, I have a gift for you.

441
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,689
Come and see it.

442
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,890
- I am too old for gifts.
- No one's too old for gifts.

443
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:02,687
- You shouldn't spend your money recklessly.
- It didn't cost much. Let me help you.

444
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:21,046
- How did you do it?
- I did it from memory.

445
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,124
Thank you.

446
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,443
It is André! My husband.

447
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:32,963
It's so real. So like him.

448
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,764
What a remarkable face.

449
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:40,050
- Did you do that from memory?
- Yes.

450
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,283
Do you like it?

451
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,284
It's wonderful.

452
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:49,208
You know, I painted that a long time ago,
but I hesitated about giving it to you.

453
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:54,764
I told you he has talent.

454
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,887
- Well, now. For you.
- For me? Thank you.

455
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,924
Thank you.

456
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:13,803
For me.

457
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,292
Well, now.

458
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,728
I should like to propose a little toast.

459
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,487
I don't quite know how to phrase it.

460
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,525
Well, would it have something
to do with his happy marriage?

461
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:34,604
Shall we say:

462
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:39,289
may your voyage home be a pleasant one.

463
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,729
Thank you.

464
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:04,446
Well, now. I'm afraid
we must be leaving soon.

465
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,684
It has been a good day.

466
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:13,852
Before we go, you must play the piano for us.

467
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,886
- Come along.
- Please do.

468
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:20,646
- Look at my hands.
- No excuses. Come along.

469
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:27,249
Janou was a concert pianist.

470
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,051
Was.

471
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,727
Remember, I was asked to do this.

472
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:07,773
<i># Ce bel amour</i>

473
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:12,165
<i># Qui ne peut mourir</i>

474
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:16,805
<i># Sera pour nous</i>

475
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:21,444
<i># Un doux souvenir</i>

476
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:25,488
<i># Promesse ardente</i>

477
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,452
<i># Du premier baiser</i>

478
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:34,762
<i># Qui nous lie tous deux</i>

479
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:40,246
<i># Pour I'éternité</i>

480
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:45,893
<i># D'un bel amour</i>

481
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:50,325
<i># Toujours grandissant</i>

482
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:54,442
<i># Qui défiera</i>

00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:59,683
<i># Les épreuves du temps</i>

00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:05,447
<i># Trouvons la joie</i>

485
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:09,128
<i># Reste dans mes bras</i>

486
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,843
I don't like boat whistles.

487
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:44,964
Don't you think you should
put this round your shoulders?

488
00:40:45,053 --> 00:40:47,044
Thank you, my dear.

489
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,528
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- You like it?

490
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,251
Yes, I do.

491
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,972
One day, I will send it to you.

492
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,645
Oh, no.

493
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:59,724
I would like to.

494
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:12,803
This is as far as I go.

495
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:16,203
This is the boundary of my small world.

496
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:24,284
It's a perfect world.

497
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,523
Thank you for letting me trespass.

498
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,410
Goodbye.

499
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,484
Bless you.

500
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,689
Well, <i>au revoir,</i> dear Janou.

501
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:40,728
I'll come back to see you very soon,
and I'll write often.

502
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,804
- Please do.
- I will.

503
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:52,610
- Happy thoughts, darling.
- <i>Adieu, mon petit,</i>

504
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:16,204
Goodbye.

505
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:45,605
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I called your cabin sev...

506
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:48,523
You've been crying.

507
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,124
Beauty does that to me.

508
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:58,285
Nickie, I...

509
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,807
I want to thank you for...

510
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:04,806
the loveliest and the most
memorable day I've ever known.

511
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:07,726
You were very sweet
to my little grandmother.

512
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:12,532
- I'm going to write to her.
- That'll be nice.

513
00:43:16,813 --> 00:43:18,804
Let's walk.

514
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:11,810
No more tears.

515
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:14,407
I told you. That's what beauty does to me.

516
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:27,927
We're heading into a rough sea, Nickie.

517
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:31,572
I know. We changed our course today.

518
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:36,524
Shall I see you to your cabin?

519
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:39,802
I don't think so.

520
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,884
Good night.

521
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:17,444
Just a moment.

522
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:26,528
- Why did you come here? It's dangerous.
- We've got a lot to talk about.

523
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:30,652
I am aware of that, but to be seen
together could be disastrous for us both.

524
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:33,930
We have some fast thinking to do.
We've created a problem.

525
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:38,609
Yes, I know, so let's not
complicate it any more.

526
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:43,489
Being a woman, I'm more cautious and I can
think more clearly when you're not around.

527
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:47,282
So you go think in your room,
and I'll think in mine...

528
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:49,967
- All right.
- While we miss each other.

529
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:55,046
That was very sweet. What you just said.

530
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:16,286
- Top o' the mornin' to you.
- And the rest of the day to you. Listen...

531
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,728
- Keep moving.
- Oh, dear.

532
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:20,804
Wait a minute. Don't go away.

533
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:25,328
- Have you come to any conclusions yet?
- No. Keep moving.

534
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,132
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

535
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:32,286
- Why don't you telephone more often?
- I'll try, but you know...

536
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:36,412
- Were you going to say something?
- No, I wasn't going to say anything.

537
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:40,442
Couldn't we at least eat together?
In your room or my room?

538
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:43,445
No. The news'd be all round the ship
before we'd had our salad.

539
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:45,842
I know. The crew talks too, you know.

540
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:50,245
- Go the other way. You're making me dizzy.
- It'd be better for me also.

541
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:53,844
Wait a minute. Darling!

542
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:55,924
Listen, darling, I...

543
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:59,004
That's odd.

544
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:06,807
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Is Miss McKay dining?

545
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:10,363
- Yes, sir. Would you care to join her?
- No, she prefers to dine alone.

546
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,444
She's almost finished.

547
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,886
- Order the bouillabaisse. It's superb.
- <i>Merci mille fois,</i>

548
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,964
- <i>Pas de quoi,</i>
- Oh, shut up.

549
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,769
Come in.

550
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:47,809
- Hello there!
- Oh, hello, Mr Hathaway.

551
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:50,043
Miss McKay.

552
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,249
Where's Ferrante?

553
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,289
How should I know?

554
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,604
Come now! A little bird
told me he might be in here.

555
00:47:57,693 --> 00:48:01,447
Really! Don't you think you're being rude?
I haven't seen Mr Ferrante...

556
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,524
Hello, Terry.

557
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:08,530
- It occurred to me you might like this book.
- I've read it.

558
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:13,409
I haven't seen you for days.
I thought you must have got off.

559
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:15,802
Why, no. We haven't docked anywhere.

560
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:23,609
Well, in case I don't see you again,
Miss McKay, happy landing.

561
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:27,686
Thank you, Mr Ferrante.
Don't think it hasn't been absolute...

562
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:31,846
Now, slow down. I'm wondering
if you two would do me a big favour.

563
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:35,050
- What's that?
- Would you kindly autograph these?

564
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,527
My wife, my sister and I
each bought a different one.

565
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:45,444
- You bought them?
- From whom?

566
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:49,811
The ship's photographer. He has
a big display up on the promenade deck.

567
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,884
He's doin' a wholesale business.

568
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:56,202
Mr Hathaway, we'll have to think
about it. Now, where can I find you?

569
00:48:56,293 --> 00:49:00,730
Well, I'll either be in the cocktail lounge
or, of course, the dining room.

570
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,644
Yes, of course.

571
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:13,570
- I don't mind that one. It's pretty good.
- Do be serious.

572
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:18,363
This is dreadful! And after all the pains
we took deceiving everybody.

573
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:20,762
Yes. I'm particularly sorry for you.

574
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:26,807
You know, I'm not as sorry as I thought I'd be.

575
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:31,968
- It was rather silly, hiding like fugitives.
- Yes, I know.

576
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,602
So, to coin a new cliché,
shall we join the others?

577
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,124
Well, all right.

578
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,408
Well, why not? What have we got to lose?

579
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:43,326
It's the last night. Let's make the most of it.

580
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:56,282
Hi, Hathaway.

581
00:49:56,373 --> 00:50:01,128
Do me another favour. Let's swap partners.
It's the last night out. Everybody does it.

582
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:05,092
They do? How nice.
Well, in your case, we'll make an exception.

583
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:13,284
I don't get that guy.

584
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:16,682
<i># Day by day I'm growing fonder

585
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:20,127
<i># Of those tender things you do

586
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:21,931
Nice crossing.

587
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,004
Hello.

588
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:28,409
- Let's get some air.
- Come on. I'll show you the rudder.

589
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,484
I'll get my coat.

590
00:50:32,573 --> 00:50:35,690
<i># May sometimes try to lure me

591
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:46,691

<i># You make it easy to be true

595
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:04,482
Why can't we go on doing this for ever?

596
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:10,082
- I had a talk with the captain. It won't work.
- It won't?

597
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:12,482
He said he can't turn the ship around.

598
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:17,610
He was nice about it, but he said most of
the people want to get home. Isn't that silly?

599
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:19,763
Well, I can understand his problem.

600
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:23,050
Cruising around in the ocean
with just the two of us.

601
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:33,204
<i># You make it easy to be true

602
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:46,210

<i># For auld lang syne

606
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:10,162
If you say "A penny for your thoughts"
I'll jump overboard.

607
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:14,804
Well.

608
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:17,284
Tomorrow morning: New York.

609
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:20,484
Yes.

610
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:23,524
Will he be waiting?

611
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,528
Will she?

612
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,210
Oh, yes.

613
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,284
What makes life so difficult?

614
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:47,249
People?

615
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:53,244
Are you in love with him?

616
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,884
I'm not now.

617
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:04,203
You know, I've never done
a day's work in my whole life.

618
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:06,682
I know. I've been thinking about that.

619
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:11,443
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say anything.

620
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:13,524
- Yes, you did.
- What?

621
00:53:15,253 --> 00:53:18,689
You said I was very fond of expensive things,

622
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:22,402
furs and diamonds and stuff like that.

623
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:25,132
- Did I say that?
- Pink champagne.

624
00:53:26,053 --> 00:53:29,045
That's the kind of life
we've both been used to.

625
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:31,727
It might be a little difficult to...

626
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,249
Do you <i>like</i> beer?

627
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:38,084
Different.

628
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:41,731
My father drank beer. In the morning.

629
00:53:42,413 --> 00:53:44,404
He was a beer drinker?

630
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,883
Later in the day, he drank anything.

631
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:57,723
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

632
00:54:00,413 --> 00:54:02,483
We've already missed the spring.

633
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,210
Yes. This is probably my last chance.

634
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,444
Mine too.

635
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,364
It's now or never.

636
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:16,209
Never is a frightening word.

637
00:54:17,573 --> 00:54:20,531
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

638
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:26,690
- And just because you haven't...
- Worked? Doesn't mean to say I couldn't.

639
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:28,809
No, of course not.

640
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:30,884
Suppose I...

641
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:33,931
It'll take some time,
say six months, to find out if...

642
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:36,129
- lf? If what?
- Well, just suppose...

643
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:38,204
- Now, be realistic.
- All right.

644
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:43,172
If I worked hard enough
and long enough, say for six months,

645
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,324
where would you be?

646
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,483
What are you trying to say, Nickie?

647
00:54:50,973 --> 00:54:55,205
I just want to be...
worthy of asking you to marry me.

648
00:54:57,693 --> 00:55:00,207
Nickie, that's just about the nicest...

649
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:04,369
Your voice cracked.

650
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,967
- That's because I...
- Yes, I know.

651
00:55:09,693 --> 00:55:11,684
I'm going to turn in now.

652
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:17,572
Do some more rolling and tossing
and thinking about it.

653
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:21,043
Let me tell you in the morning.

654
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:25,524
It's going to be a long night.

655
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:29,444
For me too.

656
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:38,809
Marriage is a very serious step
for a girl like me.

657
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:40,884
Yes, I know.

658
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:51,131
- Do you like children?
- Yes, I do.

659
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:16,923
- I was so worried that...
- I didn't even have time to get dressed.

660
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:21,052
- I didn't get to sleep until five!
- I didn't sleep at all.

661
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:26,969
Now, listen carefully. If everything goes right,
and I mean for both of us, in six months...

662
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:29,009
Here. I started to write it out.

663
00:56:29,093 --> 00:56:31,288
Should I read it now?

664
00:56:31,373 --> 00:56:33,045
"Darling." That's me?

665
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:37,445
"You have a date, my beloved. July 1st
at 5 o'clock." But you don't say where.

666
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:41,242
- You name the place and I'll obey.
- I don't know. I can't think.

667
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,449
The top of the Empire State Building?

668
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:48,448
Oh, yes! That's perfect. It's the nearest
thing to heaven we have in New York.

669
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:51,206
The 102nd floor. Don't forget
to take the elevator.

670
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:53,284
No, I won't.

671
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:58,806
- If things don't work out...
- Don't talk like that.

672
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:05,129
- Hold the thought.
- Take care.

673
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:10,725
Nickie, darling!

674
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:14,812
I'm so glad to see you.

675
00:59:14,894 --> 00:59:19,331
- I'm glad to see you. Was it a good trip?
- Not too bad. Rough in spots, but pleasant.

676
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:21,405
Hold it for a picture, please.

677
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:26,527
- May I have one too, please?
- Yes. How's this?

678
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:30,845
May I have another one, please?

679
00:59:32,094 --> 00:59:34,050
That's fine. Thank you.

680
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:38,412
Excuse me, I have an important appointment.

681
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:45,285
It's wonderful to have you back.

682
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,569
It's wonderful to <i>be</i> back, Ken.

683
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:50,645
Darling, the car's around here.

684
00:59:59,214 --> 01:00:01,728
- What's the matter? Shall we get going?
- Yes.

685
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:03,725
- The car's out here.
- Good.

686
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:18,729
There's something we must discuss.
Let's go in here where we can be alone.

687
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:23,092
- What in the world is all this?
- Didn't I mention it?

688
01:00:23,174 --> 01:00:25,244
The TV people wanted me for an interview.

689
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:28,883
I said yes, if they give a donation
to my favourite charity.

690
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:32,609
- Do you mind? It's for a good cause.
- I wish you'd let me know.

691
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:36,289
I know you! If I'd told you,
I'd never have got you off the ship.

692
01:00:36,374 --> 01:00:40,413
- Camera one, take close shots.
- Nickie, this is Mr Lewis, who'll interview us.

693
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:42,883
- Mr Fulton Q Lewis.
- Robert.

694
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:46,762
- Robert Fulton, how do you do?
- No, Robert Q Lewis. Everybody does that.

695
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:50,642
You're a little late, Mr Ferrante,
and we've gotta go on the air.

696
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:55,444
Just sit yourselves right down here.
I'm going to ask a few questions, and then...

697
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:58,844
What about his face? Shiny.

698
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:01,971
Would you mind a little make-up?
Harry, just blot it.

699
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,363
- I'm sorry. It'll be over soon.
- I hope so.

700
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:08,766
Incidentally, that white shirt.
How about that? Glares.

701
01:01:08,854 --> 01:01:11,732
- You don't happen to have a blue shirt?
- No, not with me.

702
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:13,964
Well, look, don't worry. We'll manage.

703
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:16,807
What I'm going to do is ask a few questions

704
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:21,126
about how you met,
what your plans are and things like that.

705
01:01:21,214 --> 01:01:23,125
Make yourselves comfortable.

706
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:25,125
Five seconds, Mr Lewis.

707
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,287
One thing. Watch the camera.
When the red light is on, you're on.

708
01:01:29,374 --> 01:01:31,365
Yeah? Well, it's on.

709
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:36,567
Oh, hello there. Welcome to
another <i>House to House</i> programme,

710
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:40,566
<i>brought to you</i>
<i>by the Benton baby-food company,</i>

711
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:44,090
<i>Remember, Benton's builds better babies,</i>

712
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:47,692
<i>Today our cameras are in</i>
<i>the home of Miss Lois Clarke,</i>

713
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:50,334
<i>heiress to one of</i>
<i>America's greatest fortunes,</i>

714
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:55,324
<i>In just a moment, we'll meet Miss Clarke</i>
<i>and her fiancé, Mr Nickie Ferrante,</i>

715
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:58,765
<i>and talk to them about</i>
<i>their wonderful romance,</i>

716
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:02,210
<i>which has gotten headlines</i>
<i>in papers all over the country,</i>

717
01:02:02,294 --> 01:02:07,573
<i>a romance which has captured the</i>
<i>imagination of the whole world, But first,,,</i>

718
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,645
Do you think they're in love?

719
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:12,725
I wouldn't know, Gladys.

720
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:14,930
I can't wait to see that Nickie Ferrante.

721
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:20,725
I don't know what the 64 million dollar
question was, but he's got the answer.

722
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:24,765
Point killer.

723
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:29,285
Terry, darling.

724
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:42,605
Remind me to ask you later
why your kisses don't seem quite the same.

725
01:02:42,694 --> 01:02:45,447
Maybe you're just out of practice... I hope.

726
01:02:46,614 --> 01:02:49,003
We don't need that darn thing on, do we?

727
01:02:55,254 --> 01:02:59,133
You haven't changed yet.
I thought I gave you plenty of time to...

728
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:02,729
Ken, we have so much to talk about.

729
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:05,612
I can just think better in this outfit.

730
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:11,206
You know, darling, I hoped
the trip would be good for you, but...

731
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:13,649
I'm afraid you don't look so well.

732
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:16,407
What's the matter? Was it a rough crossing?

733
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,724
Yes. It was a little.

734
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:25,007
You know, Ken, that programme
might have been amusing.

735
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:28,530
Lois Clarke and Nickie Ferrante
were about to come on.

736
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:33,969
- I'm not interested, but if it'll entertain you...
- Yes, it will.

737
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:36,045
OK.

738
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:42,844
<i>You must have had some</i>
<i>wonderful experiences in Europe,</i>

739
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:44,845
<i>Yes,</i>

740
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:47,402
<i>Would you care to expand that statement?</i>

741
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,724
<i>No,</i>

742
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:55,369
I forgot Ferrante was on
the same boat with you, wasn't he?

743
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:58,368
- Yes, he was.
- Did you meet him?

744
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:03,005
Was he charming?

745
01:04:05,894 --> 01:04:07,885
Fascinating?

746
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:13,165
Irresistible?

747
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:16,684
I'm sorry.

748
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:19,368
It wasn't like me. I withdraw that remark.

749
01:04:21,254 --> 01:04:26,726
<i>Well, tell me, Mr Ferrante, is this</i>
<i>your first experience with connubial bliss?</i>

750
01:04:26,814 --> 01:04:29,374
<i>Would you mind rephrasing the question?</i>

751
01:04:30,654 --> 01:04:34,329
<i>He means, is this your first</i>
<i>experience with marriage?</i>

752
01:04:34,414 --> 01:04:36,450
<i>Yes,</i>

753
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:42,530
<i>Good, Do you intend to support</i>
<i>your wife in the manner to which,,,</i>

754
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:44,812
<i>Yes,</i>

755
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:47,806
- That's very funny.
- <i>Doing what?</i>

756
01:04:47,894 --> 01:04:50,692
<i>I'm going to begin to paint again,</i>

757
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:54,611
<i>That's how I intend to support my wife,</i>

758
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:59,485
<i>That's certainly going to</i>
<i>take an awful lot of paint,</i>

759
01:05:02,494 --> 01:05:05,327
<i>You already have a house</i>
<i>full of masterpieces,</i>

760
01:05:05,414 --> 01:05:08,133
<i>Yes, we have, I didn't realise you were going,,,</i>

761
01:05:08,214 --> 01:05:11,331
- <i>I'm still going to paint,</i>
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

762
01:05:11,414 --> 01:05:15,566
- <i>I just thought you'd given all that up,</i>
- <i>I know, but I shouldn't have,</i>

763
01:05:15,654 --> 01:05:20,091
- <i>Well, I'm sure Nickie has all kinds of plans,</i>
- <i>Yes, I have,</i>

764
01:05:20,174 --> 01:05:23,564
<i>Well, good,</i>
<i>When are you going to be married?</i>

765
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,885
- <i>We're going to be married as soon as,,,</i>
- <i>Just a moment, dear,</i>

766
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:29,090
<i>In six months,</i>

767
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:33,204
"Six months"! I'll bet
she never gets him to the altar.

768
01:05:37,254 --> 01:05:39,370
<i>Six months? Well, good,</i>

769
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:42,764
<i>Thank you so much, Miss Clarke,</i>
<i>and you too, Mr Ferrante,</i>

770
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:45,649
<i>Well, folks, that winds up our interview,,,</i>

771
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,725
Terry.

772
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:52,534
I'd like to ask that question again.

773
01:05:54,134 --> 01:05:56,443
Did you find Ferrante irresistible?

774
01:06:10,654 --> 01:06:12,884
Oh, Ken, I'm sorry.

775
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:17,484
You don't plan these things.
They just happen.

776
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:21,002
Darling, itjust doesn't make sense.

777
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:23,050
I know. I know it doesn't.

778
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:26,524
- You've got to be realistic.
- About love?

779
01:06:27,414 --> 01:06:32,010
- You know what everyone says about him.
- Yes, I know.

780
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:34,449
What are you going to do?

781
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,883
I don't know, Ken.

782
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:42,968
I think I'll go back to Boston
and try and get ajob or something,

783
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:45,125
singing again, until he can...

784
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,489
Until he what?

785
01:06:47,574 --> 01:06:50,293
Darling, he'll never be able to support you.

786
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:52,808
Terry, listen to me. I want to marry you.

787
01:06:53,694 --> 01:06:55,571
I should have asked you long ago.

788
01:06:55,654 --> 01:06:59,806
It's my fault, but it's not too late, is it?
It can't be too late.

789
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:02,684
Terry, look at me.

790
01:07:02,774 --> 01:07:04,765
Can't you see I'm in love?

791
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:10,525
So am I.

792
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:42,250
Do you think you can sell it?

793
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:44,564
Of course I'll try.

794
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:48,363
- You did this without a model?
- Yeah, I couldn't afford one.

795
01:07:49,574 --> 01:07:52,372
What is it? Something
wrong with my memory?

796
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:54,445
It's getting a trifle dim.

797
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:56,811
No!

798
01:07:56,894 --> 01:08:00,125
- And this?
- That's from memory. That was my lunch.

799
01:08:03,374 --> 01:08:06,207
- You know it's a woman?
- Yes.

800
01:08:06,294 --> 01:08:08,888
You mean you wouldn't care
to be seen with her?

801
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:13,206
I doubt it. You know, Nickie,
if you would let me tell people -

802
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:18,129
by people, I mean women - who painted
this, I could sell it and plenty more.

803
01:08:18,214 --> 01:08:20,648
No, no. The old Ferrante is dead.

804
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:24,568
But signing "Rossi" don't mean a thing.
If you use your own name...

805
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:28,329
The old Ferrante is dead
and the new Rossi is starving.

806
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:31,805
What do you expect in three months?

807
01:08:31,894 --> 01:08:35,170
Remember, the brush obeys your hand.

808
01:08:35,814 --> 01:08:38,886
It doesn't know you are accustomed
to getting your own way.

809
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:42,762
You are spoiled.
But the brush doesn't know this.

810
01:08:43,294 --> 01:08:45,250
He cannot humour you.

811
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:48,367
I know. But I was hoping
you'd sell something.

812
01:08:48,454 --> 01:08:52,527
I want the thrill of earning that first dollar.
Oh, well. I'll have to get ajob.

813
01:08:52,614 --> 01:08:55,367
What? And give up painting?

814
01:08:55,454 --> 01:09:00,050
I'm not giving up. It's the only thing I know.
But I've got to earn a lot of money - quickly.

815
01:09:00,134 --> 01:09:02,887
Of course! In the meantime,
I'll buy you lunch.

816
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:04,965
You can repay me when you're famous.

817
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:08,524
That's the first encouraging thing you've said.

818
01:09:08,614 --> 01:09:15,133
Isn't that extraordinary? Wouldn't you
think that's the one thing I could remember?

819
01:09:16,854 --> 01:09:18,845
Oh, well.

833
01:10:35,574 --> 01:10:37,883
I got $200 for her.

834
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,725
Your first dollar.

835
01:10:42,494 --> 01:10:47,284
- What's the matter with you?
- My friend, I'm a happy man. I am a painter.

836
01:10:47,374 --> 01:10:51,970
So what? I've been a painter
for years, but I ain't happy.

837
01:10:59,974 --> 01:11:02,010
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

838
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:05,928
This is my last night, so I would
love to sing a song for you

839
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:08,005
that is very close to my heart.

840
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:17,847
<i># Our love affair

841
01:11:17,934 --> 01:11:22,530

842
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:31,488

846
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:56,289

847
01:11:56,374 --> 01:12:00,890

858
01:13:07,814 --> 01:13:10,806
- Did you fasten your seat belt?
- It's fastened.

859
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:13,203
There's the Empire State Building.

860
01:13:13,294 --> 01:13:15,285
Thank you.

861
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:28,448
Miss McKay, my dear -
my favourite customer. Welcome back.

862
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,843
- Thank you.
- Miss Webb, look who's back.

863
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:35,530
We were just saying "Whatever happened
to Miss McKay?" and here you are.

864
01:13:36,654 --> 01:13:40,772
- How nice you're looking.
- Yes, I know. I didn't get it here.

865
01:13:40,854 --> 01:13:43,812
- Where you been these past months?
- In Boston.

866
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:47,011
- We've missed you.
- Thank you. I've missed you too, Miss...

867
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:49,085
- Lane.
- Yes, Miss Lane.

868
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,734
I want something very, very special for...

869
01:13:51,814 --> 01:13:54,806
Miss Webb will be happy
to take care of you, Miss McKay.

870
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:57,806
Excuse me, I have something
to do in the office.

871
01:13:57,894 --> 01:14:01,204
Of course, I'd be most happy
to take care of you.

872
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:07,124
- Now, what did you have in mind?
- Something irresistible, inexpensive,

873
01:14:07,214 --> 01:14:11,048
- and pink.
- But of course. We have it.

874
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:14,285
The most beautiful.
I've been hiding itjust for you.

875
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:19,733
Give Miss McKay anything she wants,
but keep talking to her until I get there.

876
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:24,685
- That's all we wanted to know.
- Fine. Were you worried about her credit?

877
01:14:25,534 --> 01:14:27,525
I'm surprised at you! Goodbye.

878
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:34,892
- This is adorable.
- It's a little short, isn't it?

879
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:36,692
- With these.
- Oh, no.

880
01:14:36,774 --> 01:14:39,447
But, look. This is a must.

881
01:14:39,534 --> 01:14:43,322
Yes, it's lovely, but I just
want the little item I decided on.

882
01:14:43,974 --> 01:14:47,125
- All right, we'll send it.
- I'll have to let you know where,

883
01:14:47,214 --> 01:14:49,444
because I'm not quite sure.

884
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:52,890
- I believe that's right.
- No charge?

885
01:14:52,974 --> 01:14:54,453
No.

886
01:14:56,134 --> 01:14:58,728
I know, I know, but... no.

887
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:02,683
- Ken!
- Terry, how are you?

888
01:15:02,774 --> 01:15:05,527
What are you doing here?
How did you know I...

889
01:15:06,814 --> 01:15:09,044
I see. Nice doing business with you.

890
01:15:10,734 --> 01:15:13,043
Forgive me, Ken. I'm terribly late.

891
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:15,887
- What time is it?
- It's five minutes to five.

892
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:20,573
- It's been good seeing you, Ken.
- And you. There's so much to talk about.

893
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:23,487
- Sorry. I'm in such a hurry.
- Can't we have a cocktail?

894
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:26,008
- I really am in a hurry.
- I've so much to say to you.

895
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:30,963
Why don't you give me a call some... You
can't do that either, cos I'm getting marr...

896
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:34,046
- You're getting married?
- Yes, I am and I'm very late.

897
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,204
- What time was it?
- Four minutes to five.

898
01:15:36,294 --> 01:15:38,285
Goodbye, Ken.

899
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:43,287
I really hope you find happiness,
and if you're ever in need of anything,

900
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:46,491
like someone to love,
don't hesitate to call me.

901
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:48,644
No. No, I won't.

902
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:51,043
- Goodbye, Ken.
- Goodbye. Good luck.

903
01:15:55,854 --> 01:16:01,053
What a state I'm in! I thought the Empire
State Building was this way, and it's that way.

904
01:16:08,014 --> 01:16:10,574
I think I'll get out here cos I'm in a hurry.

905
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:13,566
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- What's the rush, lady?

906
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:18,205
I'm going to be married. I want you to be
the first to congratulate me. Thank you.

907
01:16:18,294 --> 01:16:20,364
Marriage is somethin' to rush to?

908
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:38,365
102nd floor.

909
01:16:46,214 --> 01:16:48,205
- Going down?
- No, thank you.

910
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:04,925
Tower.

911
01:17:13,214 --> 01:17:15,523
- Going down?
- No. What time have you?

912
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:17,605
Ten after five.

913
01:17:43,574 --> 01:17:47,613
I know what I'm doing. I want my own way.

914
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:49,924
Turn the boat around.

915
01:17:50,014 --> 01:17:52,289
I want to turn the boat around.

916
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:56,887
Nickie, help me turn the boat around.

917
01:17:58,414 --> 01:18:03,442
Well, you're so much stronger than I am.
I can't do it alone. I can't.

918
01:18:05,254 --> 01:18:08,849
- You must be quiet now.
- But I need him.

919
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,445
Oh, Nickie, I need you.

920
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:16,210
Help me! Help me turn the boat around.

921
01:18:17,814 --> 01:18:20,533
I must...

922
01:18:50,654 --> 01:18:52,645
Going down?

923
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:04,009
Her X-rays aren't encouraging.
It's hard to say if she'll walk again.

924
01:19:04,094 --> 01:19:06,085
We won't know for a long while.

925
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,165
That's bad.

926
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:12,684
I guess you've gathered I'm not
the man she was screaming about.

927
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:15,049
She was on her way to marry him.

928
01:19:15,134 --> 01:19:17,364
- Does he know of her condition?
- No.

929
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:25,007
She said, until you know what you say
you won't know for a while,

930
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,085
she'd rather he didn't know.

931
01:19:27,174 --> 01:19:29,290
She seems nice.

932
01:19:29,374 --> 01:19:31,365
I think so.

933
01:19:32,454 --> 01:19:34,445
She wants to see you.

934
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:36,525
Go ahead. I'll be in shortly.

935
01:19:41,054 --> 01:19:43,648
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Terry.

936
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:47,090
I told her I didn't know whether
or not she'd be with us today.

937
01:19:47,174 --> 01:19:49,165
Fooled you, Father.

938
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:53,284
Ken, I told Father McGrath about us.

939
01:19:56,694 --> 01:19:59,845
He's going to find me ajob.
Aren't you, Father?

940
01:19:59,934 --> 01:20:05,611
- You'd better get well first, Terry.
- He's right. Then I'll try and find something.

941
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:08,165
Take it easy.

942
01:24:11,374 --> 01:24:13,046
- Miss McKay.
- Yes?

943
01:24:13,134 --> 01:24:16,410
I wanna thank you for what
you're doin' for my son, Tyrone.

944
01:24:16,494 --> 01:24:18,883
Now he won't grow up to be a mug like me.

945
01:24:18,974 --> 01:24:21,124
You're too modest, Mr Bugsy.

946
01:24:21,214 --> 01:24:25,366
No, I ain't. I'm so stupid, I ain't even ignorant.

947
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:30,845
- Thanks again.
- Thank Father McGrath. He got me the job.

948
01:24:30,934 --> 01:24:32,925
Thanks, Father.

949
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:42,287
All eyes on me, please. As you know, poor
Molly has the measles, so I'll sing her part.

950
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:44,524
Now, are we ready?

951
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,205
Well, <i>now</i> we're ready.

952
01:24:51,974 --> 01:24:54,329
Watch me closely. We mustn't goof today.

953
01:28:22,174 --> 01:28:23,687
Well!

954
01:28:24,374 --> 01:28:26,365
Come in.

955
01:28:27,614 --> 01:28:31,402
Nickie! I'm so happy to see you. Come in.

956
01:28:31,894 --> 01:28:34,727
- How's my severest critic?
- Oh, well, we'll see.

957
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:38,329
I see you've got them all arranged.
Let me hear the worst.

958
01:28:38,574 --> 01:28:41,884
Six months' work.
You haven't wasted your time, Nickie.

959
01:28:41,974 --> 01:28:45,284
Thank you. You should have seen
the 50 I dropped over the cliff.

960
01:28:45,374 --> 01:28:49,208
- Maybe you should have dropped this one.
- I'm inclined to agree with you.

961
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:53,731
You know, I can read your state of mind
when you painted this.

962
01:28:53,814 --> 01:28:56,692
You were very sorry for yourself
when you painted this one.

963
01:28:56,774 --> 01:28:58,765
That one was painted in August.

964
01:29:00,414 --> 01:29:03,645
You were angry here.
You were getting over your broken heart.

965
01:29:03,734 --> 01:29:06,373
Broken heart? That stuff's not for me.

966
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:08,968
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Let's get down this end.

967
01:29:09,054 --> 01:29:11,443
I'm coming to that. I'm coming to that.

968
01:29:14,574 --> 01:29:17,884
Here, Nickie, you became a painter.

969
01:29:18,574 --> 01:29:21,964
Thank you. I'm not exactly
ashamed of that one myself.

970
01:29:22,054 --> 01:29:25,046
I had a great deal to say -
and I painted it instead.

971
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:29,730
Your being away, alone, for a long time
has given you that grasp of...

972
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:33,806
I'll get it. Remember where you were.
I want to hear more.

973
01:29:33,894 --> 01:29:36,966
Hello. Courbet's Paint and Varnish Store.

974
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:40,965
Nickie? I read you arrived today.

975
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:44,570
Lois! How nice.
How did you know I was here?

976
01:29:44,974 --> 01:29:47,932
I called your hotel.
They said you were on this number.

977
01:29:48,014 --> 01:29:53,611
Nickie, I've been thinking about you morning,
noon and night, and in-between times too.

978
01:29:54,334 --> 01:29:56,643
I was wondering if maybe you could...

979
01:29:58,134 --> 01:29:59,647
Well...

980
01:29:59,774 --> 01:30:04,370
No, I like the idea all right - it's a nice offer.
But I can't make it this afternoon.

981
01:30:05,094 --> 01:30:08,564
Well, if you can't do that... I wish you would.

982
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:15,044
Thanks anyway.
Nicest thing that's happened today.

983
01:30:16,094 --> 01:30:18,324
But you could make the show tonight.

984
01:30:18,974 --> 01:30:22,489
I'll leave a ticket at the box office anyway.
Do try to make it.

985
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:24,485
And, Nickie...

986
01:30:24,574 --> 01:30:28,362
Whatever you do, don't plan
anything for <i>after</i> the show, huh?

987
01:30:56,294 --> 01:30:59,172
- I love our seats.
- What?

988
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:01,245
I said "I love our seats."

989
01:31:26,494 --> 01:31:29,133
- We enjoyed it very much.
- Thank you for asking us.

990
01:31:29,214 --> 01:31:33,253
It was a pleasure. If you don't mind,
Mr Ferrante will see me home.

991
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:35,765
Good night.

992
01:31:38,974 --> 01:31:43,286
- Where would you like to go?
- Suppose you decide. This is your evening.

993
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:46,605
I've been away so long,
I have no idea where people go.

994
01:31:46,694 --> 01:31:48,685
My coat.

995
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:01,566
Hello.

996
01:32:20,614 --> 01:32:22,969
Terry. Please let me tell him.

997
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:25,045
No.

998
01:32:25,454 --> 01:32:28,366
- I'll go get him.
- No, no, please.

999
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:33,684
It's pretty rough.

1000
01:32:33,774 --> 01:32:37,562
The first time you're able to get out,
you have to run into him.

1001
01:32:38,534 --> 01:32:41,731
And all I could say was..."Hello."

1002
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:48,973
Well, the show's over.

1003
01:32:49,054 --> 01:32:51,045
The boy got the girl. Shall we go?

1004
01:32:55,894 --> 01:32:57,885
I'll only be a minute.

1005
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:21,485
Good night, Lois, and thank you.

1006
01:33:21,574 --> 01:33:25,613
Taking you to a show tonight
wasn't a very good idea, was it?

1007
01:33:25,694 --> 01:33:29,403
- Merry Christmas, Lois.
- Merry Christmas, Nickie, and...

1008
01:33:30,094 --> 01:33:32,085
<i>auf Wiedersehen,</i>

1009
01:34:02,414 --> 01:34:07,488
I think it's terrible to have to take you home
just when everyone else is going out.

1010
01:34:10,174 --> 01:34:12,369
<i>C'est la vie,</i> Et cetera.

1011
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:16,933
Terry, let me ask you again.

1012
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:19,005
Why won't you let me help you?

1013
01:34:19,094 --> 01:34:22,245
All right, then, I will tell you again.

1014
01:34:22,334 --> 01:34:26,213
If you paid for my getting well,
he wouldn't like it, so I wouldn't like it.

1015
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:29,730
Then if you did get me well
and I went to him, <i>you</i> wouldn't like it.

1016
01:34:29,814 --> 01:34:32,965
- But certainly he ought to know.
- No! If he found out,

1017
01:34:33,054 --> 01:34:36,888
he'd insist upon doing it himself -
if he had the money, which I doubt.

1018
01:34:36,974 --> 01:34:40,569
And then, if I didn't get well... that'd be awful.

1019
01:34:40,654 --> 01:34:46,126
No. Unless I can walk to him, and when I say
"walk" I mean "run", he'll never know.

1020
01:34:46,214 --> 01:34:49,809
Well, I'm fine. I've got my job
and I'm on a budget.

1021
01:34:49,894 --> 01:34:53,728
And if things come out right,
and then maybe if I'm a very good girl,

1022
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:57,090
I'll get what I want <i>next</i> Christmas. Follow?

1023
01:35:20,534 --> 01:35:22,490
Merry Christmas.

1024
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:24,565
How are you feeling, Miss McKay?

1025
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:28,333
Children, I have bad news for you.

1026
01:35:29,174 --> 01:35:31,734
Doctor won't let me go with you.

1027
01:35:33,134 --> 01:35:35,807
Doctor, I could be back in a couple of hours.

1028
01:35:35,894 --> 01:35:38,124
This is the Christmas benefit.

1029
01:35:38,214 --> 01:35:41,286
This is their first public appearance.
This is my team.

1030
01:35:41,534 --> 01:35:44,844
- She's our coach, Doc.
- Norman! "Doctor."

1031
01:35:46,294 --> 01:35:48,285
She's our coach, Doctor.

1032
01:35:49,534 --> 01:35:52,287
If it wasn't good for her,
would you want her to go?

1033
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:54,490
No.

1034
01:35:54,574 --> 01:35:57,964
Well, look. Why don't you
try it without me, hm?

1035
01:35:58,054 --> 01:36:01,364
Come on. The only thing
that would bother you would be the start.

1036
01:36:01,454 --> 01:36:03,729
- Miss McKay?
- Yes, Tyrone?

1037
01:36:04,494 --> 01:36:08,851
We'll be thinking about you while we sing,
hoping that you'll be around real soon.

1038
01:36:08,934 --> 01:36:10,925
Thank you, Tyrone.

1039
01:36:13,414 --> 01:36:16,884
Wait a minute. Where's Sally?
Isn't she with us today?

1040
01:36:16,974 --> 01:36:21,092
- We took her off. She sings too loud.
- She's a show-off.

1041
01:36:21,174 --> 01:36:25,929
Sally thought it was ajoke,
and she wanted so badly to go on the stage.

1042
01:36:27,534 --> 01:36:29,525
Come here, darling.

1043
01:36:29,694 --> 01:36:31,685
You go up on the stage with the others.

1044
01:36:31,774 --> 01:36:36,450
I'll put you back on the team, but you must
promise not to drown out the other children.

1045
01:36:36,534 --> 01:36:38,126
All right, Miss McKay.

1046
01:36:38,534 --> 01:36:40,331
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

1047
01:36:40,414 --> 01:36:42,405
All right.

1048
01:38:08,534 --> 01:38:13,369
- You're going to do all right without me.
- All right, children. We must go now.

1049
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:18,243
- Merry Christmas.
- God bless you.

1050
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:20,325
Be good, now.

1051
01:38:25,374 --> 01:38:29,367
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, darling.

1052
01:38:33,214 --> 01:38:35,648
This isn't going to be
much of a Christmas for you.

1053
01:38:35,734 --> 01:38:38,612
- I'll be all right.
- There we are.

1054
01:38:38,694 --> 01:38:40,650
- Could just hand me my...
- Yes, surely.

1055
01:38:40,734 --> 01:38:42,725
Thank you so much.

1056
01:38:43,534 --> 01:38:47,288
You're welcome to have turkey
with my husband and me.

1057
01:38:47,374 --> 01:38:51,253
- You save a drumstick for me for later.
- All right, I will.

1058
01:38:51,334 --> 01:38:54,053
And if there's anything else
you want, just holler.

1059
01:38:54,134 --> 01:38:57,206
Thank you so much. I will.
It's very sweet of you.

1060
01:38:57,294 --> 01:39:00,570
- Merry Christmas.
- And a Merry Christmas to you too.

1061
01:39:01,774 --> 01:39:04,129
Does Miss McKay...

1062
01:39:14,694 --> 01:39:16,685
Hello, Terry.

1063
01:39:19,094 --> 01:39:21,562
It's... good to see you.

1064
01:39:22,454 --> 01:39:24,445
It's good to see you too.

1065
01:39:25,414 --> 01:39:29,885
- You feeling all right?
- Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm just resting.

1066
01:39:29,974 --> 01:39:31,965
Good.

1067
01:39:32,734 --> 01:39:35,726
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, hasn't it?

1068
01:39:38,094 --> 01:39:40,449
Well, it is good to see you.

1069
01:39:40,534 --> 01:39:42,650
You said that.

1070
01:39:42,734 --> 01:39:45,123
- May I...
- Oh, yes. Please do sit down.

1071
01:39:48,214 --> 01:39:52,446
- I'll only be a minute. Sure you don't mind?
- No, of course not.

1072
01:39:54,454 --> 01:39:57,093
Oh, is this the breathtaking view?

1073
01:39:58,214 --> 01:40:00,853
Well, the altitude bothered me.

1074
01:40:08,854 --> 01:40:11,652
Well, I'll bet you're wondering how I got here.

1075
01:40:12,414 --> 01:40:14,405
Well, yes. Yes, I am.

1076
01:40:16,254 --> 01:40:20,725
I was looking through a telephone book
for a man named McBride

1077
01:40:20,814 --> 01:40:23,886
and I came across the name "T McKay".

1078
01:40:23,974 --> 01:40:28,604
I said to myself "Could that
possibly be Terry McKay, my old friend?"

1079
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:32,453
- And it was.
- Yes.

1080
01:40:33,374 --> 01:40:38,402
And then I said to myself "Well, now,
I haven't been very nice to Miss McKay."

1081
01:40:38,494 --> 01:40:44,126
"After all, I had an appointment
with her one day, and I didn't keep it."

1082
01:40:46,094 --> 01:40:48,050
You didn't keep...

1083
01:40:48,134 --> 01:40:50,250
No.

1084
01:40:52,654 --> 01:40:57,011
So I said to myself -
I talk to myself quite a lot these days -

1085
01:40:57,094 --> 01:41:00,928
I said "That's not a very nice way
to treat an old friend like Miss McKay."

1086
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:03,209
"I must apologise to Miss McKay."

1087
01:41:03,294 --> 01:41:07,924
Don't you agree, when someone doesn't
keep an appointment, they should apologise?

1088
01:41:08,014 --> 01:41:11,006
Yes. I think you're absolutely right.

1089
01:41:12,494 --> 01:41:18,524
I think the least people could do
is to say they're sorry, or... something.

1090
01:41:20,134 --> 01:41:22,125
So here I am.

1091
01:41:23,134 --> 01:41:26,285
- That's very sweet.
- I thought so.

1092
01:41:28,734 --> 01:41:32,773
I've often wondered about you.
And how you were.

1093
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:34,845
Did you really?

1094
01:41:35,534 --> 01:41:38,048
Yes, really.

1095
01:41:38,654 --> 01:41:41,168
Well, I've often thought about you too.

1096
01:41:42,134 --> 01:41:45,285
Then you weren't angry
because I wasn't there?

1097
01:41:45,374 --> 01:41:47,524
I mean, you must have been at first.

1098
01:41:48,694 --> 01:41:50,685
Well...

1099
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:52,805
Yes, I was.

1100
01:41:53,534 --> 01:41:56,094
At first I was furious.

1101
01:41:56,174 --> 01:41:59,291
I said "He can't do this to me.
Who does he think he is?"

1102
01:42:00,374 --> 01:42:03,286
How long did you wait?
I mean, did you wait long?

1103
01:42:05,014 --> 01:42:07,209
Well, let's... well, yes.

1104
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:09,683
Yes, I waited until about...

1105
01:42:09,774 --> 01:42:11,844
Midnight.

1106
01:42:14,414 --> 01:42:16,882
And then what did you do?

1107
01:42:16,974 --> 01:42:19,534
Well, then I got really mad.

1108
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:24,805
- You can imagine, standing up there on the...
- Yes, in a thunderstorm.

1109
01:42:26,534 --> 01:42:28,570
In a thunderstorm?

1110
01:42:30,574 --> 01:42:33,452
Then what did you say to yourself?

1111
01:42:33,534 --> 01:42:36,810
Then I said "I'll go on home and get tight."

1112
01:42:36,894 --> 01:42:39,203
- But you didn't do that.
- Didn't I?

1113
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:44,448
No. Well, maybe just a little one,

1114
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:46,525
every hour, for about a month.

1115
01:42:47,374 --> 01:42:50,207
- Can you blame me?
- I should say not.

1116
01:42:50,774 --> 01:42:53,925
The least I could have done
was to have sent you a note.

1117
01:42:54,014 --> 01:42:58,087
Perhaps, by the time you thought of it,
you didn't know where to reach me?

1118
01:42:58,174 --> 01:43:01,769
But you swore that if you ever
saw me again, you'd ask.

1119
01:43:01,854 --> 01:43:04,049
No.

1120
01:43:04,134 --> 01:43:07,843
I remember we said that if
we could make it, we'd be there.

1121
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:13,683
And if one of us didn't show up,
it would be for a darn good reason.

1122
01:43:14,614 --> 01:43:18,163
- Did we say that?
- Yes, that is exactly what we said.

1123
01:43:18,254 --> 01:43:22,850
- Well, like what, for instance?
- So, there will be no more questions asked,

1124
01:43:22,934 --> 01:43:24,925
I hope?

1125
01:43:27,934 --> 01:43:30,050
Would you like a cigarette?

1126
01:43:30,134 --> 01:43:32,125
Thank you.

1127
01:43:32,214 --> 01:43:34,205
Thank <i>you,</i> Nickie.

1128
01:43:37,854 --> 01:43:41,642
Isn't that wonderful?
I walked all the way here just to...

1129
01:43:43,094 --> 01:43:47,053
And now I'm not even supposed
to ask you why you weren't there.

1130
01:43:48,774 --> 01:43:50,924
Isn't it strange?

1131
01:43:51,014 --> 01:43:53,926
We used to read each other's thoughts.

1132
01:43:54,014 --> 01:43:56,005
It's not the same, is it?

1133
01:43:56,614 --> 01:43:58,605
Not quite.

1134
01:43:59,414 --> 01:44:03,646
- It doesn't seem...
- I know.

1135
01:44:03,734 --> 01:44:06,487
I don't know what happens
to me whenever I...

1136
01:44:08,494 --> 01:44:10,485
No wedding ring, I see.

1137
01:44:11,734 --> 01:44:13,531
No.

1138
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,447
- I thought at the...
- Last night, the show?

1139
01:44:17,054 --> 01:44:19,773
No, no. He was just...

1140
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:22,845
No.

1141
01:44:24,214 --> 01:44:27,365
I didn't mean to offend you.

1142
01:44:27,454 --> 01:44:30,252
How's everything with you, Nickie?

1143
01:44:30,334 --> 01:44:33,132
Oh, you can ask questions!

1144
01:44:35,294 --> 01:44:38,843
I thought everything was fine
until I saw you last night.

1145
01:44:38,934 --> 01:44:43,883
Then I knew there must be <i>something</i>
between us, even if it's only an ocean.

1146
01:44:43,974 --> 01:44:45,965
So I bought myself a ticket.

1147
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:50,088
Oh, you're sailing?

1148
01:44:50,894 --> 01:44:53,203
Tonight.

1149
01:44:54,734 --> 01:44:57,726
- And you're happy, aren't you?
- Yes.

1150
01:44:58,734 --> 01:45:00,804
- And you?
- I don't know.

1151
01:45:00,934 --> 01:45:03,767
I'm worried about the future,
and what people will think.

1152
01:45:03,854 --> 01:45:09,212
They'll say "There's the mad painter. What's
the matter with him? He doesn't like women."

1153
01:45:09,294 --> 01:45:12,809
- Why would people say that?
- Because he sails the seven seas,

1154
01:45:12,894 --> 01:45:18,207
and to every woman he meets, he says
"Where will you be in six months?"

1155
01:45:18,294 --> 01:45:20,285
- And they're there?
- Everywhere.

1156
01:45:20,374 --> 01:45:25,368
Tops of pyramids, domes of cathedrals, the
Eiffel Tower. He tries to keep them up high.

1157
01:45:25,454 --> 01:45:28,366
He keeps them waiting.

1158
01:45:28,454 --> 01:45:30,445
And where is he all this time?

1159
01:45:33,294 --> 01:45:35,728
Waiting.

1160
01:45:35,814 --> 01:45:37,964
But you can't go on like that.

1161
01:45:38,734 --> 01:45:43,489
It isn't right for you.
I wish I could say you were wrong.

1162
01:45:43,574 --> 01:45:46,372
I was once.

1163
01:45:47,814 --> 01:45:51,363
- How would you like to change the subject?
- Yes, I'd love to.

1164
01:45:51,454 --> 01:45:54,810
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

1165
01:45:56,734 --> 01:46:01,649
Six months ago, who'd have thought
we'd be spending Christmas together?

1166
01:46:01,734 --> 01:46:03,725
I brought you a present.

1167
01:46:06,454 --> 01:46:10,413
Thank you. I'm sorry I don't have one for you.

1168
01:46:10,494 --> 01:46:13,566
I didn't think I'd be seeing you.

1169
01:46:13,654 --> 01:46:18,887
That's all right, I didn't expect one.
That isn't really a Christmas present.

1170
01:46:28,054 --> 01:46:30,284
Oh, that's why my letters came back.

1171
01:46:38,174 --> 01:46:42,486
I would have sent it to you,
but I didn't know your address until today.

1172
01:46:45,054 --> 01:46:47,693
She wanted you to have it, remember?

1173
01:46:49,974 --> 01:46:53,284
So... that's the reason I...

1174
01:47:04,854 --> 01:47:06,845
Goodbye, Terry.

1175
01:47:08,494 --> 01:47:10,485
Goodbye, Nickie.

1176
01:47:30,734 --> 01:47:33,373
You know, I painted you
like that, with the shawl.

1177
01:47:33,454 --> 01:47:37,333
I wish you could have seen it.
Courbet said it was one of my best.

1178
01:47:38,294 --> 01:47:44,210
I didn't think I could ever part with it, but
there was no reason to keep it any longer.

1179
01:47:44,294 --> 01:47:48,082
I couldn't take money for it
because, well, you know...

1180
01:47:48,174 --> 01:47:53,806
So Courbet told me a young woman
came into the gallery and... she liked it.

1181
01:47:54,054 --> 01:47:58,764
She saw in it what I'd hoped you'd see, so...
I told Courbet to give it to her.

1182
01:47:59,854 --> 01:48:04,405
Because he said she didn't have
any money, and not only that, she was...

1183
01:48:07,134 --> 01:48:09,125
She was...

1184
01:48:10,854 --> 01:48:13,493
Anyway, I told him to give it to her.

1185
01:48:13,574 --> 01:48:16,088
Courbet said she wanted it so badly and...

1186
01:48:16,174 --> 01:48:19,644
So I told him to give it to her.
It's the Christmas season and all that.

1187
01:48:19,734 --> 01:48:22,123
And you know me, holly in my heart.

1188
01:48:54,334 --> 01:48:56,484
Darling, don't look at me like that.

1189
01:49:00,854 --> 01:49:02,890
Why didn't you tell me?

1190
01:49:02,974 --> 01:49:06,933
If it had to happen to one of us,
why did it have to be you?

1191
01:49:11,614 --> 01:49:13,605
It was nobody's fault but my own.

1192
01:49:16,094 --> 01:49:18,085
I was looking up.

1193
01:49:19,054 --> 01:49:21,204
It was the nearest thing to heaven.

1194
01:49:23,134 --> 01:49:25,125
You were there.

1195
01:49:26,334 --> 01:49:28,325
Oh, darling.

1196
01:49:28,454 --> 01:49:31,014
Don't worry, darling.

1197
01:49:31,094 --> 01:49:33,972
If you can paint, I can walk.

1198
01:49:34,374 --> 01:49:37,286
Anything can happen, don't you think?

1199
01:49:37,374 --> 01:49:39,729
Yes, darling.
