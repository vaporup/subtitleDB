00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,176
You're losing your fear.

179
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,896
Fear?

180
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,770
[Doc] That you disappeared.

181
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,192
You didn't. You only died.

182
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:02,579
A woman...who lost her children
just four years ago.

183
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:06,368
Every day in the Lord's Prayer.

184
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,509
Celia...come on. Whoa.

185
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,574
Shhhhh...

186
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,624
This one is a present...for me.

187
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:24,088
It's our Double D-anniversary.

188
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,516
Kind of our special day.

189
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:30,604
It's her version of our place.

190
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,395
- Your place?
- Where we first met.

191
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:38,949
Where we were
going to retire, I guess.

192
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:43,031
Live out our lives.
Be old farts together.

193
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,790
Right there.

194
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:49,040
That's our dream house.

195
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,251
That one's me, I guess.

196
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:58,258
The blurry one is Annie.
Looks a little familiar, Doc.

197
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:02,180
[Laughs]

198
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,057
The funeral is over. Why is
this going on past the funeral?

199
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,845
[Annie] 'Dear Diary,

200
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:20,807
'l'm writing because
my shrink is crazier than me.

201
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:23,571
'He thinks you're therapy.

00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:27,439
'lf two babies can

00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,287
'what'll I do with this?

204
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,529
'He's so stupid.

00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,661
'He thinks he pulled me

00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:37,996
'when it was only Christy.

207
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:40,247
'Always. Only Chris.'

208
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:41,836
Jesus...

209
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:44,631
'l was looking through
his postcards.

210
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,929
'Paintings were his obsession.

211

'He used art to love me,
to help me.

00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:54,351
'To keep us always together.

00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:01,357
I'm here, babe.

214
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,776
I still exist.

215
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,197
You're thinking of me.

216
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,865
Keep thinking of me.

217
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,832
Come on, with me.

218
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,797
You were always with me.

219
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:19,795
The people who finished each
other's sentences. Remember us?

220
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,303
I still exist.

221
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:28,314
I still exist!

222
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:34,068
(l still exist.)

223
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,363
Just write it down.

224
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,784
Write it down.

225
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,373
[Chris] "This is Chris."

226
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,250
"This...is...Chris."

227
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:00,518
"I...

228
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:04,232
"still...

"exist."

230
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,958
Read it.

231
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:23,791
READ it.

232
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:58,793
[Chris]
Christ, when does it end?

233
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:02,292
[Chris]
Christ, when does it end?

234
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,954
[Doc] There's no rules, Chris.

235
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,339
It ends when you want.

236
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:11,297
- Where were you?
- Someplace else.

237
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,848
You think I'm a figment
of your imagination?

238
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:17,637
She's real. You're real.
It's all real.

239
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:21,184
That's the point
if there is one.

240
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,443
It's over when you stop
wanting to hurt her.

241
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,594
Forever...

242
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,861
Don't worry, baby...

243
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:59,901
I'm not leaving you alone.

244
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:02,198
I'm not going anywhere.

245
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,161
[Screams hysterically]

246
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,429
Goodbye, babe.

247
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,008
[Birds singing]

248
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,109
[Barking]

249
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:55,254
Katie, it's you !

250
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,912
You're young again!

251
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,964
Come here, Katie! [Laughs]

252
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:06,596
Katie, Katie!

253
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:13,313
Come on, hey!

254
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:19,150
Boy, I screwed up.
I'm in dog heaven.

255
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:32,921
A place where we all go
can't be bad, can it, girl?

256
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,370
Maybe I'm not
in your heaven after all!

257
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,122
Maybe you're in mine!

258
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:07,337
[Katie barks]

259
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,932
Annie!

260
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:51,057
[Doc]
What the hell have you done?

261
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,856
That's not how
you use a stethoscope!

262
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:55,523
Albert Lewis?

263
00:27:55,613 --> 00:28:00,407
Last time you saw me
I was 63, on a cardiac ward!

264
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:03,532
You thought I was old
and decrepit, huh?

265
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:06,411
Talking about "Ah, can't go on!"

266
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:10,667
Who wants to be 63
throughout eternity?

267
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:14,970
- Look at you on the water!
- Well, hello! Come on...

268
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:18,055
walk along, feel the beat!

269
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:21,261
Dancing on water!
Smooth as ever!

270
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,554
And that was you...

271
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,351
just now, when...when I died.

272
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:33,741
I thought you recognised me,
because you called me "Doc".

273
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,827
Me being your favourite doc.

274
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:42,254
Could you lend me a hand? I'm
up to my ass in problems again.

275
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:45,588
Oh, Chris...

276
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,586
Come here.

277
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,216
You are still kinda ugly.

278
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:57,186
You taught me a lot, Chief.
Nice place you got here.

279
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,941
No, no.
Nice place you got here.

280
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:04,153
- Me?
- Sure, you're making all this.

281
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:08,568
We're insecure at first,
so we need safety and comfort.

282
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,659
We all paint our surroundings,
but you use real paint!

283
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:16,450
There's so much here
she didn't paint.

284
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,338
Like that bird.

285
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,669
Annie gave you a start,
like holding onto handrails.

286
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,590
You're creating a world.

287
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,345
From your imagination,
from anything you want.

288
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:35,602
- Why doesn't it move?
- It will when you want it to.

289
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,740
Oh-hoh! You go, boy!

290
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:47,783
- Can I make it dive?
- You're the painter!

291
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:50,544
[Doc] It's your world!

292
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:55,337
[Doc] Look at it go!

293
00:29:56,675 --> 00:30:00,128
- How about turquoise wings?
- Turquoise!

294
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:03,593
[Chris]
And a little mauve, all right!

295
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:22,739
- I didn't do that.
- No, I did.

296
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:25,917
When we're together
it's like dual controls.

297
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:30,712
- Can I make elephants fly?
- Didn't Annie paint a house?

298
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:39,888
Yeah, it's our dream house.

299
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:44,689
[Doc] Just a stroll
across the water.

300
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,102
Let's take the shortcut.

301
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:54,990
- Nice shortcut.
- It's easy, look at me!

302
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,208
- I'm gonna drown.
- You're already dead.

303
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:02,128
Am l...am I really here?

304
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:07,290
What do you mean by "you"?
Your arm or your leg?

305
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,544
- Partly.
- Really?

306
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,506
- And if you lost your limbs?
- I'd still be me.

307
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:17,351
- What is the "me"?
- My brain, I suppose.

308
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,941
Your brain?
Your brain is a body part.

309
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:25,191
Like your fingernail
or your heart. Why is that you?

310
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:29,363
Because "I" am a voice
in my head.

311
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,412
The part that thinks, feels.

312
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:34,168
That is aware that I exist.

313
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:44,092
[Doc] So if you're aware
you exist...then you do.

314
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,386
That's why you're still here.

315
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:04,620
[Doc] No windows. What aren't
you ready to see, I wonder?

316
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,704
Drink it. Think it's
coffee and it will be.

317
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,706
OK.

318
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,467
It's coffee...

319
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,710
Paint!

320
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,215
Acrylic.

321
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:24,352
- [Doc] Why is it so hard?
- What?

322
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:27,853
Your brain is meat.
It rots and disappears.

323
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:31,062
You thought that's all
there was to you?

324
00:32:33,238 --> 00:32:36,524
Like you're in your house now.

325
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:39,988
You're IN your house,
you AREN'T your house.

326
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:43,664
The house falls down,
you walk away.

327
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,829
But I rebuilt, huh?

328
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:48,591
You see your body
because you like seeing one.

329
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:52,625
We're seeing
what we choose to see.

330
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,176
Let me show you something.

331
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:20,705
Ha!

332
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:30,384
[Chris] It's real.
Where is the paint?

333
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:35,221
[Doc] You don't need it any
more. This is your world now.

334
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,311
Thought is real.

335
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:44,988
Physical is the illusion.
Ironic, huh?

336
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:51,615
- Where's God in all this?
- He's up there.

337
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:55,753
Somewhere...
Shouting down that he loves us.

338
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,172
Wondering why we can't hear him.
You think?

339
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,804
Drink your coffee.

340
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:08,261
- Needs milk.
- Don't push your luck.

341
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:22,726
'What do you think, Christy?

342
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:25,052
'What do you think, Christy?

343
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,645
'Right here.

344
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,358
'Like this? You think?

345
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,920
'They say we live
in our minds anyway.

346
00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:00,682
'Having you with me,
like this, keeps me happy.

347
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,563
'Why do I believe
you can hear me?

348
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:09,857
'Why do I think
you can see this?'

349
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:18,872
[Chris] What's that purple tree?
I never saw that.

350
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:23,209
Let's look. Think you can
get there in eight seconds?

351
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,001
Eight seconds? Over there?

352
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:30,382
Yeah, I just need
a little incentive.

353
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:52,624
Yeah... I can fly...

354
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,118
- No!
- Can't I do what I want?

355
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:59,378
I think you'd be more
comfortable keeping it real.

356
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:02,920
Think of running fast,
like the Road Runner, OK?

357
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:11,473
I can handle this.

358
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:16,858
Adios, muchacho.

359
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:20,441
Oh... Wait ! Chris !

360
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,945
Annie!!

361
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,878
I bet you're thinking
"Oh, shit!" now!

362
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:33,248
Aaaaahhhh!

363
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:51,018
- Yeah!
- Go, boy!

364
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,366
Go, Chris, go!

365
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,488
Albert!

366
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:30,112
Albert!

367
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:42,923
It's completely new. The canvas
was blank when I was alive.

368
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:47,920
How can I see
this drawing after I'm dead?

369
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:51,680
For an expert
you look pretty surprised.

370
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,769
- You two. A long courtship?
- No, actually.

371
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:59,358
- From the first moment...
- Soulmates.

372
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,146
It's extremely rare,
but it exists.

373
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:07,370
Like twin souls.
Tuned in to each other.

374
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:10,326
Apparently, even in death.

375
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:14,498
You're reaching each other
through her painting.

376
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:18,123
It's nothing
I've ever seen.

377
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,637
'You can't see it, can you?

378
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,556
'And you never will.'

379
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:09,526
I love you!

380
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:58,367
[Chris]
Whose footprints are these?

381
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:00,825
Don't ask,
you put 'em here.

382
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,215
Annie...

383
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,714
- Annie!
- [Doc] Chris!

384
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:29,071
Fantasy is not what you need.

385
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:33,285
No, you're right. I need Annie.

386
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,824
- That'll change in time.
- Oh, come on, Einstein!

387
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:44,997
Time's not on my watch any more!
Time does not exist here!

388
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:48,959
Wherever it went, it won't
make me need Annie less.

389
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:54,141
You'll feel differently,
and so will she.

390
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:57,928
Man... You don't know us.

391
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:01,608
Wish I did.

392
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:10,073
[Chris] Marie...

393
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:12,203
Marie!

394
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:22,127
Look, it's Tigger!
It's my daughter's!

395
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,222
Katie tore it up once, and...

396
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,261
She's here, right?

397
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,976
Where is she?

398
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,776
"Here" is big enough
for all to have their universe.

399
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:45,910
That's not why you
haven't seen them yet, is it?

400
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:50,329
What does that mean, Buddha?

401
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:53,256
I wanna see my children, Albert!

402
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,762
When you do, you will.

403
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,157
Does that hurt?

404
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,442
Mm-mm.

405
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:19,736
That?

406
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,242
Mm-hm.

407
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,289
How about that?

408
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:26,793
I'm gonna keep doing this
till you tickle.

409
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:33,838
You've got a fever.
It's going down, though.

410
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:36,849
Don't you have to go somewhere?

411
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:40,096
Wanna play chess?

412
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:45,477
I could teach you.

413
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,402
Would you teach me that?

414
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,768
Excuse me.

415
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:26,243
Albert has to work.
He asked me to meet with you.

416
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:29,412
Will that be all right?

417
00:43:29,497 --> 00:43:32,831
Leona...
That's a very beautiful name.

418
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,373
He said you've been isolated.

419
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:40,090
Do you wanna see others?
Perhaps a city?

420
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:43,214
I would,
but travel makes me nauseous.

421
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,314
Close your eyes.

422
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:55,894
I didn't mean forever.

423
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,451
[Laughs] What do you think?

424
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:11,870
I'm a little under-dressed.

425
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:13,508
You look fine.

426
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:17,923
Till now you've been painting
your world. This is mine.

427
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:23,519
In our city across the river
we have to have a common vision.

428
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:39,995
So, there's work.

429
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:41,078
Mm-hm.

430
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,662
I like that.

431
00:44:42,753 --> 00:44:46,666
Albert is sort of a missionary.

432
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:50,090
- He saves lost souls.
- Like me.

433
00:44:50,177 --> 00:44:55,136
Hardly. They are the ones
who can't get here.

434
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,017
You mean, from hell?

435
00:44:57,102 --> 00:45:00,437
In a way.
It's not what you think.

436
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:04,023
My work is with animals.

437
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,986
Katie is an old friend.

438
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:10,535
'Dearest Christy.

439
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,490
'l don't know how
this day unravelled.

440
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:19,038
'l was proud of how I held
together through this afternoon.

441
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:23,507
'But, coming home,
I began to lose it.

442
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:26,381
'lf I had walked out that night,

443
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:29,140
'you wouldn't have been
in the tunnel.

444
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:34,301
'A whole family lost
in car crashes.

445
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:36,474
'Enough to make a person
buy a bike.'

446
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:43,154
[Chris] Where are they going?

447
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:47,828
- To help others be reborn.
- Really? Reincarnation?

448
00:45:56,304 --> 00:45:59,260
Albert says to cheer you up.

449
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:03,848
- You have difficulty...
- ..losing my wife, yeah.

450
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:09,943
- And your children?
- They died years ago.

451
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:12,816
That's why I'm worried
about my wife.

452
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,818
They died
in a terrible collision.

453
00:46:16,913 --> 00:46:20,164
The nanny was driving.
It wasn't her fault.

454
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,873
And your wife?

455
00:46:22,962 --> 00:46:26,794
My daughter
had asked her to drive.

456
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:29,885
[Children's laughter]

457
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:46,065
It was a trucker's fault.

458
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:49,774
But my wife believed
that if she'd been driving,

459
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:52,990
her protective instincts
would have...

460
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,838
Are you OK?

461
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:16,432
Come on, Katie!

462
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,001
[Leona] Where were you just now?

463
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:36,255
Your mind's been wandering
all afternoon.

464
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,880
Thinking of someone.

465
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:44,843
Your wife must have loved
her children very much.

466
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:46,478
Very much.

467
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:52,767
But you don't have to break
in half to love somebody.

468
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:56,811
Tell me a memory of your own.

469
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,661
Say, with your daughter.

470
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:22,393
Hey...
That's somebody else's art.

471
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,731
What's the difference?
You weren't looking anyway.

472
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,906
Your move.

473
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,488
Is this where we go when we die?

474
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:45,878
It's a dream, baby.
It's beautiful,

475
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:50,428
- but you know, dreams...
- ..l know, aren't real.

476
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,979
- It's after midnight.
- I haven't won yet.

477
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,768
- It's your first time.
- No, I like that.

478
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:06,697
Means you're not cheating.
And when I win, I really win.

479
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:09,109
I wanna play till I do.

480
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:13,036
- Unless you wanna stop.
- No. Let's play till you win.

481
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,337
'She died three months later.'

482
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,461
We played every night.

483
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:27,016
It meant the world to me.

484
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:30,765
She never won.

485
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:01,760
I didn't look like this
in the body, you know.

486
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:07,479
We flew to Singapore once.
And...

487
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:11,894
..my daddy smiled at
the flight attendant who...

488
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:17,407
Iooked like this
and wore this name tag.

489
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:23,869
He said Asian women are so...

490
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:29,754
Iovely...and graceful...

491
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:33,341
- and intelligent.
- He didn't mean only.

492
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,756
I know.
It was something he said.

493
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:40,678
And I thought, when I grow up,
I wanna be that.

494
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:45,769
You still play chess?

495
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:57,908
I think I waited for my partner.

496
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:44,426
'l swear that California
is the strangest place.

497
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:46,422
'They push you into it

498
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:50,383
'so you can do it before
your shrink commits you.

499
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:53,812
'Thoughtful legislation there.

00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:56,354
'Mine is suspicious.

501
00:51:56,443 --> 00:51:58,602
'Another week,
he might commit me.

502
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:00,654
'For my own safety.

503
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,617
'l had the husband
I was meant to have.

'Two spectacular children.

'And the truth is, simply...

00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,342
'that it's over.

'Just this one loose end

'l didn't get to say goodbye.

510
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:41,619
'l don't get to say goodbye.

511
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,158
'But I'll tell you what -

00:52:46,253 --> 00:52:49,586
'across whatever
distance there is,

00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,257
'l send you my love.'

514
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:09,606
Hey.

515
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:14,447
- Where were you?
- Far away.

516
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:19,366
I got called back.
I was working.

517
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,461
There are no words
to thank you.

518
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:24,585
For finding Marie.

519
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:27,758
[Sighs]

520
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,052
- Is she OK?
- She's fine.

521
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:32,595
You'll see her soon.

522
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:37,145
She sends her love.
Especially now.

523
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:49,194
We'll go through
something very hard right now.

524
00:53:49,287 --> 00:53:52,076
I'm with you. You're not alone.

525
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:56,584
Annie is dead.

526
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:02,965
She killed herself.

527
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:11,266
It's nothing I ever expected.

528
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,109
Like I said, you don't know us.

529
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:21,572
Is that an occupational hazard
of soulmates?

530
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,365
One's not much
without the other?

531
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:29,414
But she's OK.

532
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:32,207
Because her pain is over.

533
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:35,252
- You don't understand.
- She won't cling like me.

534
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:38,428
- When do I see her?
- Never.

535
00:54:41,266 --> 00:54:45,265
You'll never see her.
Suicides go somewhere else.

536
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:49,187
- Why are you punishing her?
- It's not punishment.

537
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:52,776
- She's suffered enough.
- There are no judges or crimes.

538
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:55,616
Everybody's equal.
That's the way things work!

539
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,618
And suicides go to hell?

540
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:02,406
No goddamn judgment in that!

541
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,577
You wanna fight?

542
00:55:06,254 --> 00:55:09,624
You can hide from it
or understand it.

543
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:14,261
"Hell" is for those
who don't know they're dead.

544
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:18,976
They can't realise what
they've done or what's happened.

545
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:22,430
- Too self-absorbed that they...
- Self-absorbed?!

546
00:55:22,523 --> 00:55:25,359
That doesn't apply
to Annie, all right?

547
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:30,397
No, it doesn't.
Suicides are different.

548
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:34,989
They don't go to hell because
they're immoral or selfish.

549
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:40,122
There's a natural order
to our journey.

550
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,668
Annie has violated that.

551
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,426
She won't face it.

552
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,506
She won't realise,
accept what she's done.

553
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,305
She will spend eternity
playing that out.

554
00:55:53,394 --> 00:55:58,223
- You still say she's in hell.
- Everybody's hell is different.

555
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,104
Real hell
is your life gone wrong.

556
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:24,346
I'm her soul mate.
I can find her.

557
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:36,685
- You don't understand how...
- It's not about understanding!

558
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,236
It's about not giving up.

559
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:44,529
You said there are no rules.
And the tree?

560
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:49,617
You were pretty surprised then.
Hey, if there are no rules,

561
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:52,582
how can you say
ALL suicides are the same?

562
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:55,129
- I can't, I can't.
- OK.

563
00:56:55,218 --> 00:56:58,339
- Or she doesn't know she's dead?
- I can't.

564
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:02,679
No one has ever seen
a suicide brought back!

565
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:05,688
Stick around, Chief.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

566
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,936
OK. You deserve your chance.
We'll find a tracker.

567
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:39,374
Hey!

568
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,678
This the guy
who doesn't give up?

569
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,680
Anyone tell you too much
persistence can get stupid?

570
00:58:53,772 --> 00:58:57,060
- Constantly.
- I hear the same thing.

571
00:58:57,153 --> 00:59:00,320
I also hear I read too slow.

572
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:05,484
I don't need glasses. Eyes being
a figment of my imagination.

573
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:09,080
You'll hear a lot
of smart stuff here.

574
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,709
It's usually right.

575
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:13,416
- Don't let it screw you up.
- I won't.

576
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:17,586
Your wife love you as strong?

577
00:59:25,185 --> 00:59:27,178
We'll find her.

578
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:30,272
But when you find her...

579
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,811
nothing will make her
recognise you.

580
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:37,239
Nothing will break her denial.

581
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:39,283
It's stronger than her love.

582
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:43,035
In fact, reinforced by her love.

583
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:46,707
You can say everything
you long to say.

584
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,632
Including goodbye.

585
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:53,300
Even if she can't understand it.

586
00:59:53,387 --> 00:59:57,432
You'll have the satisfaction
that you didn't give up.

587
00:59:59,102 --> 01:00:01,141
That has to be enough.

588
01:00:01,228 --> 01:00:04,266
Get me there.
I decide what's enough.

589
01:00:06,985 --> 01:00:08,730
When do we leave?

590
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:12,399
Close your eyes.

591
01:00:23,464 --> 01:00:27,464
- [Chris] Albert's a sweet kid.
- [Tracker] He is that.

592
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:30,840
There's a tenderness
I never knew in life.

593
01:00:30,933 --> 01:00:33,684
I didn't know him
when he was young.

594
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:37,185
Were you proud of your own kids?

595
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:40,854
Of course.

596
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:44,278
That's an easy bullshit answer.

597
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:48,034
Think about it.

598
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:52,698
I said "Of course."

599
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:54,701
I like this sore point.

600
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:57,711
It's juice, juice is strong.
It connects.

601
01:00:57,796 --> 01:01:01,666
Makes you
a better receiver for Annie.

602
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:08,141
She's the transmitter,
sending thoughts of you.

603
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:37,170
- What did you do when alive?
- You mean the last time?

604
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:42,554
We can be reborn.
But only if we choose to.

605
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:47,602
- I did the same work...
- You were a shrink!

606
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:50,361
Fairly perceptive.

607
01:01:56,452 --> 01:01:59,987
- Oh, my God.
- You expected physical danger?

608
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:08,207
What could it do, kill you?

609
01:02:08,298 --> 01:02:12,083
No, in hell,
there's real danger.

610
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:15,133
Of losing your mind.

611
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:19,257
[Screaming]

612
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,389
[Annie] Because
he's drowning, that's why.

613
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:05,567
- He's 13 years old!
- I know.

614
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:08,447
He needs to hang out
with his friends.

615
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:14,292
Veg out in front of the TV,
read a fucking book he likes!

616
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:17,794
- He doesn't wanna let me down?
- No, it's worse...

617
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:21,298
He's so into you, he feels
he's letting himself down.

618
01:03:21,386 --> 01:03:24,257
He thinks he's shit.

619
01:03:24,348 --> 01:03:26,056
How sick is that?

620
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:35,853
How can you take me
out of school?

621
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,022
How can you?

622
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,906
This is my life!

623
01:03:39,992 --> 01:03:42,662
Don't you think
I can make it?

624
01:03:42,746 --> 01:03:46,993
- If I really dig in...
- You have to show me more!

625
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:50,085
Come on! You're blowing it, lan!

626
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,916
I'm not you!

627
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:20,518
[Moaning]

628
01:04:59,443 --> 01:05:03,276
[Chris] Shipwrecks...
What is this place?

629
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:05,025
[Tracker]
The gateway to hell.

630
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:12,655
How are we doing?
Picking up any signals?

631
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:16,369
Actually...not a ripple.

632
01:05:16,463 --> 01:05:19,964
That's because
I was thinking of somebody else.

633
01:05:26,768 --> 01:05:31,726
It's a slap in the face
when you see kids taking a test

634
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:34,141
and they're breezing through it.

635
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:37,652
And for you
it just...kinda goes.

636
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,981
Every day I see...

637
01:05:40,075 --> 01:05:43,909
how I'm not as good
as you and everyone else.

638
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,575
But that doesn't mean I give up.

639
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,421
[Doc] Hey!

640
01:06:36,018 --> 01:06:39,967
[Doc] "Cerberus" - the guardian.

641
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:56,613
How do you feel?

642
01:06:56,709 --> 01:07:01,088
More than I want you
in and out of school,

643
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:04,626
I want to know
how you feel at night.

644
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:08,888
Real scared.

645
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:13,141
I know I believe in you.

646
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:17,728
If I was going through
fucking hell,

647
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:21,946
I'd only want one person
in the goddamn world with me.

648
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,461
[Choir sings]

649
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,678
There's a man...

650
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:46,893
Ian never got to know.

651
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:53,150
The man...
he was growing up to be.

652
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,699
He's a good-looking,
clear-eyed young fella...

653
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,863
..about 25.

654
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,491
I can see him.

655
01:08:10,046 --> 01:08:14,425
He's the type of guy
men want to be around.

656
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:17,002
Because he has integrity,
you know?

657
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:22,801
He has character.
You can't fake that.

658
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:30,780
And he's a guy
women want to be around, too.

659
01:08:33,368 --> 01:08:35,609
Because there's
tenderness in him.

660
01:08:36,955 --> 01:08:39,197
Respect...

661
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,283
Loyalty...

662
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:43,036
Courage...

663
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,050
And women respond to that.

664
01:08:50,638 --> 01:08:53,722
Makes him a terrific husband.

665
01:08:55,227 --> 01:08:59,141
I see him as a father.

666
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:01,723
That's where he really shines.

667
01:09:05,656 --> 01:09:10,533
See, when he looks
in his kid's eyes -

668
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:16,542
and the kid knows
that his dad really sees him -

669
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:19,414
he sees who he is.

670
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:25,130
Then that child knows
that he is an amazing person.

671
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:29,054
He's quite a guy...

672
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:32,143
..that I'll never get to meet.

673
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:37,187
'l wish I had.'

674
01:09:40,573 --> 01:09:42,317
[Doc] Let's do it!

675
01:09:45,955 --> 01:09:49,454
[Doc]
Come on, she could be in there!

676
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:52,997
[Violent shouting]

677
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:07,136
No!

678
01:10:08,564 --> 01:10:11,234
No! Don't!

679
01:10:11,317 --> 01:10:14,853
Don't... Don't do this!

680
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:17,154
Your mother's not in there, lan!

681
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,832
Your mom is not in there, son.

682
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,974
There's not another man
I'd go through hell with.

683
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,986
Elevator to hell. Going up.

684
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:58,287
- Come on.
- So long. Wish us luck.

685
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:01,708
- [Doc] I'm coming.
- I'm not giving you a choice.

686
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:04,204
[Chris] What are you saying?

687
01:11:04,298 --> 01:11:06,920
Since you suspected
Albert was your son,

688
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:10,296
- you lost your wife's signal.
- I'll concentrate harder!

689
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:13,059
You're all mouth and no chops!

690
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:16,013
All you're good for
is she loves you.

691
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:19,520
- Your boy is a distraction.
- Damn shrinks!

692
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:23,606
- You love shoving people around!
- We're going. His last chance.

693
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,605
He's never been in such a place.

694
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:30,113
You haven't. It's better
watching one than two.

695
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:33,159
- You want him clear?
- Screw him, lan!

696
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:36,286
He doesn't know us!
He's not family!

697
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,166
No! I'm not leaving him!

698
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,672
If he never sees her?

699
01:11:44,764 --> 01:11:46,970
Never says goodbye?

700
01:11:48,977 --> 01:11:51,647
[Chris] We do it without him.
Let's go!

701
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:54,897
Dad! No! Listen to me.

702
01:11:57,861 --> 01:12:01,908
When you get there,
don't listen to him.

703
01:12:01,992 --> 01:12:05,362
You find her...

704
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:07,911
and you bring her back.

705
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:11,334
You can do it.

706
01:12:11,419 --> 01:12:14,255
I believe in you.

707
01:12:24,646 --> 01:12:27,849
D'you ever think
why I chose to be Albert?

708
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:31,690
He was the only guy
you ever listened to.

709
01:12:31,778 --> 01:12:35,562
Listen to me now!
Think about Mom!

710
01:12:35,657 --> 01:12:39,406
Think about what happened
when we died!

711
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:44,490
Think about what you said
to her to bring her back!

712
01:13:28,888 --> 01:13:30,514
'Think about Mom.'

713
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:38,313
'Think about when we died.'

714
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:47,275
[Annie]
I'm teaching myself to smoke.

715
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:53,072
The doctors call it
an affirmation of life.

716
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:00,504
Well, it beats the statue thing.

717
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:08,183
You said "divorce".
You got my attention.

718
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,850
I think that
we're too different...

719
01:14:14,944 --> 01:14:18,148
..to stay together.

720
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:20,991
I mean...

721
01:14:23,121 --> 01:14:26,372
Well, for one thing,
why aren't you in here?

722
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:31,251
Why didn't you go crazy?

723
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:34,956
Your children died.

724
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,673
I remember.

725
01:14:37,763 --> 01:14:41,844
I remember the silence
in the house.

726
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:45,468
I thought I was supposed
to be strong.

727
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:52,023
- For me?
- For me. For us.

728
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,949
Just on general principles.

729
01:14:55,033 --> 01:15:00,492
I loved them, Annie.
But they're gone.

730
01:15:04,169 --> 01:15:06,044
You've got a choice.

731
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,254
Life either goes on...

732
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,962
or not.

733
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:15,139
And you choose life.

734
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:23,106
Sometimes,
when you win, you lose.

735
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,997
[Heads talking]

736
01:15:40,048 --> 01:15:42,966
[Man] This hasn't been
a good day.

737
01:15:45,263 --> 01:15:48,181
C'mon. It's our private deck.

738
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:57,182
[Woman] I never took more
than 30 percent from clients.

739
01:15:57,276 --> 01:15:59,898
This must be it.

740
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:03,572
- [Woman] Mister! I'm here!
- [Man] I'm coming!

741
01:16:06,955 --> 01:16:09,032
[Man]
Watch where you're stepping!

742
01:16:09,124 --> 01:16:11,413
Sorry! Excuse me!

743
01:16:15,173 --> 01:16:17,332
[Man] Anybody got a cure?

744
01:16:17,426 --> 01:16:21,128
- No, man!
- Excuse me.

745
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:26,388
Sorry.

746
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:30,393
- Welcome. Welcome, son.
- Papa?

747
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:33,852
- Son.
- Papa?

748
01:16:33,945 --> 01:16:38,489
- You're close. Welcome.
- No.

749
01:16:38,576 --> 01:16:42,955
- Welcome, welcome.
- You're not my dad, sorry.

750
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,085
It's all right. They never come.

751
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:50,586
Don't worry.
It's only a matter of time.

752
01:17:01,354 --> 01:17:03,098
[Laughter]

753
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:06,440
You don't think
it looks like a dog?

754
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:09,149
You always take the easy ones.

755
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:12,939
That one looks like
a 24-piece dining set.

756
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:15,241
With a soup tureen.

757
01:17:15,328 --> 01:17:17,037
Or a bunny rabbit.

758
01:17:17,122 --> 01:17:20,538
A very complex bunny rabbit.

759
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:24,120
Or a Rubenesque breast.

760
01:17:24,214 --> 01:17:27,963
You always think
they're breasts.

761
01:17:28,052 --> 01:17:29,760
All kinds of breasts.

762
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:32,883
I love them. Yours.

763
01:17:32,975 --> 01:17:38,515
- We'll be late for the dance!
- What's the rush?

764
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:42,856
I know what you're doing.

765
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:48,154
This is all just a stall.
I know why you don't wanna go.

766
01:17:48,244 --> 01:17:53,155
- Busted.
- Why don't you dance just once?

767
01:17:54,751 --> 01:17:59,164
- Other husbands are as clumsy.
- Oh, thank you.

768
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:08,720
It's just that when everybody's
dancing I feel like I'm alone...

769
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:11,645
..in a sea of faces.

770
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:19,145
[Silent]

771
01:18:21,742 --> 01:18:23,153
Ahhh!

772
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:01,074
Angel Falls...

773
01:19:01,164 --> 01:19:03,454
[Whistles]

774
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:06,115
It's a little expensive, yeah.

775
01:19:06,211 --> 01:19:11,170
But it's our first Double D.
Shouldn't it be incredible?

776
01:19:13,637 --> 01:19:17,682
I've never seen
anything like it.

777
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:22,096
That's my role.
To bring adventure to your life.

778
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:29,481
You...taught me...

779
01:19:29,573 --> 01:19:34,035
the only thing
I should always remember.

780
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,576
Which is?

781
01:19:38,752 --> 01:19:41,039
I forgot.

782
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:49,297
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...

783
01:19:50,724 --> 01:19:52,965
It was, never give up.

784
01:19:55,646 --> 01:19:58,268
Never give up.

785
01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:03,401
Never.

786
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:12,997
[Tracker] She's here.

787
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:19,381
You found her.
Impressive.

788
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:22,504
That jolt of fear for her.
It connected.

789
01:20:22,596 --> 01:20:26,215
[Chris]
My God, is that our house?

790
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:49,079
- It's like our home.
- Don't think that.

791
01:20:49,169 --> 01:20:52,870
[Tracker] It's an illusion.

792
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:56,381
The whole place...her illusion.

793
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,427
Suicides can get tortured,

794
01:20:58,514 --> 01:21:00,755
committed to
punishing themselves.

795
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:02,843
Don't push her that way.

796
01:21:02,936 --> 01:21:04,764
You want to see her.

797
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:08,188
Tell her what's in your heart.
And then go.

798
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:11,775
- No pressure.
- Wait!

799
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:16,690
I knew you'd find her.
You're a competitor.

800
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:20,368
How d'you know
the first thing about me?

801
01:21:20,456 --> 01:21:24,324
You called your son Albert.
Who is that?

802
01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:27,789
First doctor I interned under.

803
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:31,880
He was like a father to me.

804
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,640
His words were gold.
A brilliant mind.

805
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:38,010
What did he practice
before turning to pediatrics?

806
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:44,766
- Child psychia...
- ..psychiatry.

807
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:48,396
And he was always...
a slow reader.

808
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:54,410
But these...used to be rimless.

809
01:21:54,497 --> 01:22:00,121
And the rest of me...
used to be black.

810
01:22:10,851 --> 01:22:14,766
You know why we chose to look
different? Me, the children?

811
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:17,809
Package doesn't count?
One's as good as...

812
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,855
No. The old roles of authority.

813
01:22:20,946 --> 01:22:23,438
Who's the teacher,
who's the father...

814
01:22:23,532 --> 01:22:29,073
gets in the way of who
we really are...to each other.

815
01:22:29,164 --> 01:22:34,206
I've waited for years for
a chance to watch out for you.

816
01:22:34,294 --> 01:22:37,960
And I'm watching
out for you now.

817
01:22:38,049 --> 01:22:40,623
But this isn't like
the rest of hell.

818
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,884
You've got no defence
against Annie.

819
01:22:44,975 --> 01:22:49,437
If losing yourself or
being swallowed by hell itself

820
01:22:49,522 --> 01:22:54,065
could save her,
I'd be there cheering you on.

821
01:22:55,487 --> 01:22:58,608
You've got
your children back now.

822
01:22:58,699 --> 01:23:00,609
They need you.

823
01:23:00,702 --> 01:23:05,698
Three minutes... Any more,
you could lose your mind.

824
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:08,163
[Chris]
How can you lose your mind?

825
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:10,410
[Tracker]
Once her reality becomes yours,

826
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:14,170
there's really no way back.

827
01:23:30,248 --> 01:23:32,287
[Ian] 'Think about Mom.'

828
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,962
'What you said
to bring her back.'

829
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:52,680
Hello?
Your door's open. [Echoes]

830
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:31,019
Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

831
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:38,318
- Who...who are you?
- I'm your neighbour.

832
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:41,747
I bought the Gorman's place
two months ago.

833
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:43,792
I just moved in.

834
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:47,462
I never heard
they sold their place.

835
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:52,045
You're Annie Nielsen, right?

836
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:54,759
They told me a lot about you.

837
01:24:54,849 --> 01:24:57,138
Like what? What did they say?

838
01:24:57,227 --> 01:25:00,312
That you're
a very talented artist and...

839
01:25:00,397 --> 01:25:03,483
work for a museum, right? And...

840
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:05,277
you're a widow.

841
01:25:06,447 --> 01:25:08,819
Mrs Gorman admires your roses...

842
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:12,572
very much.

843
01:25:12,661 --> 01:25:15,782
They were so handsome.

844
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:20,996
But now there's no water
pressure in the neighbourhood.

845
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:26,962
There's no electricity
and no gas.

846
01:25:27,054 --> 01:25:30,305
There are other things
missing, too.

847
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:33,927
Like clean clothes
and books I want to read.

848
01:25:34,021 --> 01:25:35,397
And, um...

849
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:40,394
some of my favourite
paintings I have to work on.

850
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:45,282
Aahh!

851
01:25:46,618 --> 01:25:50,285
- What is it?
- They're everywhere now!

852
01:25:52,168 --> 01:25:54,207
I got it!

853
01:25:56,381 --> 01:25:58,006
It's gone.

854
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,184
Thank you.

855
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:10,687
You're welcome.

856
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:13,147
You say your paintings
are missing.

857
01:26:13,235 --> 01:26:16,902
Some of my most precious panels.

858
01:26:16,989 --> 01:26:18,946
The ones that remind me.

859
01:26:26,834 --> 01:26:30,085
Remind me of my husband
and my children.

860
01:26:30,172 --> 01:26:34,252
That's why I never leave.

861
01:26:34,343 --> 01:26:37,344
Because they might return?

862
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:42,769
I hope that's true
with all my heart.

863
01:26:42,854 --> 01:26:45,393
It's not, you know.

864
01:26:45,482 --> 01:26:50,192
When you're dead, you disappear.

865
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:56,949
My wife committed suicide
after our children died.

866
01:26:57,037 --> 01:26:59,161
After l...

867
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:03,329
She was the loveliest person.

868
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,377
Don't you think that's sad?

869
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:08,751
- Don't you have to leave?
- No.

870
01:27:08,844 --> 01:27:13,221
- But if you want me to go...
- I do.

871
01:27:13,307 --> 01:27:17,304
The last day I saw my wife
it was our anniversary.

872
01:27:17,394 --> 01:27:19,721
- Aren't you leaving?
- In a minute.

873
01:27:19,814 --> 01:27:23,729
I was sticking around in case
there was another problem.

874
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,063
It wasn't a wedding anniversary.

875
01:27:26,155 --> 01:27:29,822
It was a very
special kind of day...

876
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:35,119
..no one else knows about.

877
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,634
[Annie humming]

878
01:27:49,683 --> 01:27:52,389
[Chris] I need to talk to you.

879
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:55,434
And you don't have to respond.

880
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,868
This is a one-way ticket...
for me.

881
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,827
My hanging around here
is not helping you.

882
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:14,126
And it's killing me.

883
01:28:14,214 --> 01:28:17,251
Today is kind of a D-Day.

884
01:28:18,636 --> 01:28:22,088
"D" for decision, I guess.

885
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:27,051
About divorce.

886
01:28:28,397 --> 01:28:30,888
That'd be two D's,
wouldn't it?

887
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:38,939
I stand corrected.

888
01:28:44,123 --> 01:28:48,372
Look what happens when you
don't say anything for a month.

889
01:28:50,007 --> 01:28:52,083
Cindy called.

890
01:28:52,176 --> 01:28:54,749
She said
everything is waiting for you.

891
01:28:56,763 --> 01:29:02,140
The artists and curators will
see you when you're better.

892
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:05,231
And I told her...

893
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:10,394
it was the museum
and one of those meetings

894
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:13,407
that kept you
from driving that day.

895
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:20,542
And if you went back,
it'd mean you weren't sorry,

896
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:25,373
you weren't wrong and you'd
be betraying your children.

897
01:29:25,466 --> 01:29:29,166
She called you crazy
and I called her a bitch!

898
01:29:29,261 --> 01:29:33,556
And I hung up!
That didn't go very well!

899
01:29:37,897 --> 01:29:41,102
What's true in our minds
is true.

900
01:29:41,193 --> 01:29:44,562
Whether some people
know it or not.

901
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:50,362
That's when I realised
I'm part of the problem.

902
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:54,238
Not because I remind you.

903
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:57,785
But because I couldn't join you.

904
01:29:57,879 --> 01:30:01,463
So I left you alone.

905
01:30:07,391 --> 01:30:09,300
Don't give up, OK?

906
01:30:22,449 --> 01:30:23,992
OK.

907
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,244
OK.

908
01:30:28,374 --> 01:30:30,331
It's OK.

909
01:30:47,773 --> 01:30:49,647
[Annie] So you reconciled.

910
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,062
That's very romantic.

911
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:58,567
She still killed herself.

912
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:03,699
- She gave up.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

913
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:06,365
- Her husband thought so.
- He was a coward!

914
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:10,246
Being strong, not giving up...

915
01:31:10,342 --> 01:31:12,916
that was his place to hide.

916
01:31:13,011 --> 01:31:16,012
He pushed away the pain so hard,

917
01:31:16,099 --> 01:31:20,393
he disconnected himself from
the person he loved the most.

918
01:31:22,731 --> 01:31:26,730
Sometimes,
when you win, you lose.

919
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:36,070
When he saw
his children again...

920
01:31:36,164 --> 01:31:38,572
I thought
your children were dead.

921
01:31:40,087 --> 01:31:43,337
You can see the dead.
In your dreams.

922
01:31:43,422 --> 01:31:46,294
If you want to.

923
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:52,093
I wanna see Christy.

924
01:31:53,601 --> 01:31:56,306
I can show you.
It's not hard.

925
01:31:56,396 --> 01:32:00,312
All you have to do...
it's like painting a picture.

926
01:32:00,402 --> 01:32:02,644
We do it together.

927
01:32:02,738 --> 01:32:06,985
Just close your eyes. (Please.)

928
01:32:07,075 --> 01:32:09,864
(Don't be afraid.)

929
01:32:12,165 --> 01:32:15,038
Remember where you were married?

930
01:32:21,385 --> 01:32:23,673
Christy!

931
01:32:23,762 --> 01:32:25,304
Christy...

932
01:32:26,765 --> 01:32:30,848
Who else would you
be marrying in your dreams?

933
01:32:32,774 --> 01:32:35,313
[Annie] I missed you.

934
01:32:36,445 --> 01:32:38,320
Annie...

935
01:32:38,406 --> 01:32:41,157
This is real.

936
01:32:44,204 --> 01:32:46,410
The man in the garden.

937
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:52,335
It's me.

938
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:56,879
No!

939
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,428
No!

940
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:02,007
Whoever you are,

941
01:33:02,099 --> 01:33:06,313
did you think
you could take him from me?

942
01:33:19,455 --> 01:33:21,661
I'm sorry, babe.

943
01:33:21,748 --> 01:33:24,419
There's some things
I have to say.

944
01:33:24,503 --> 01:33:28,121
I've only got
a few moments left.

945
01:33:29,843 --> 01:33:33,840
I'm sorry for all the things
I'll never give you.

946
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:38,142
I'll never buy you another
meatball sub with extra sauce.

947
01:33:38,227 --> 01:33:41,560
And always the big one.

948
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:44,270
I'll never make you smile.

949
01:33:46,738 --> 01:33:49,654
I just wanted us
to be old together.

950
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:55,116
Two old farts laughing at each
other as our bodies fell apart.

951
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:57,198
Together at the end.

952
01:33:57,291 --> 01:34:00,542
By that lake in your painting.

953
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:03,714
That was our heaven, see?

954
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,470
There's lots of things to miss.

955
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:11,221
Books...naps...

956
01:34:11,308 --> 01:34:15,224
kisses...and fights.

957
01:34:15,314 --> 01:34:19,147
Oh, God, we had
some great ones!

958
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:21,904
(Thank you for those.)

959
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:26,324
Thank you for every kindness.

960
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:30,403
Thank you for our children.

961
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:33,251
For the first time I saw them.

962
01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:39,839
Thank you for being someone
I was always proud to be with.

963
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:43,837
For your guts,

964
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:45,389
for your sweetness.

965
01:34:45,474 --> 01:34:47,801
For how you always looked,

966
01:34:47,893 --> 01:34:50,932
for how I always wanted
to touch you.

967
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:55,568
God, you were my life.

968
01:34:57,489 --> 01:35:01,653
I apologise for every time
I failed you.

969
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:04,496
Especially this one.

970
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:31,062
- Didn't you think I'd make it?
- You were in there a while.

971
01:35:31,149 --> 01:35:35,099
Took me a while to realise
you were right.

972
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:38,565
Nothing you can do
could help her.

973
01:35:38,657 --> 01:35:40,816
This trip was for you.

974
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:46,241
- Did you come close...
- ..to losing it?

975
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:48,373
Oh, yeah.

976
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:51,711
Pushed it right to the edge.

977
01:35:51,797 --> 01:35:55,083
That's why
I had to come out now.

978
01:35:55,177 --> 01:35:57,466
I'm giving up.

979
01:36:00,016 --> 01:36:02,009
Not the way you think.

980
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:07,852
Go home, Al.

981
01:36:09,194 --> 01:36:12,694
Will you tell my children
I love them?

982
01:36:13,908 --> 01:36:16,447
And I won't leave their mother.

983
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:22,826
(Thanks.)

984
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:30,961
Where are we headed?

985
01:36:33,348 --> 01:36:39,055
In one minute I won't know you
any better than you'll know me.

986
01:36:39,147 --> 01:36:42,847
But we'll be together.

987
01:36:42,942 --> 01:36:45,149
Where we belong.

988
01:36:47,031 --> 01:36:51,611
Good people go to hell because
they can't forgive themselves.

989
01:36:51,703 --> 01:36:53,862
I know I can't.

990
01:36:53,956 --> 01:36:56,875
But I can forgive you.

991
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,294
For killing my children?

992
01:37:01,506 --> 01:37:04,211
And my sweet husband?

993
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:06,709
(No.)

994
01:37:06,804 --> 01:37:11,017
For being so wonderful, a guy
would choose hell over heaven,

995
01:37:11,102 --> 01:37:13,723
just to hang around you.

996
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,232
Not because I remind you...

997
01:37:21,322 --> 01:37:24,408
but because I couldn't join you.

998
01:37:24,492 --> 01:37:28,028
Sorry I left you alone.

999
01:37:29,874 --> 01:37:32,911
Don't give up, OK?

1000
01:37:51,568 --> 01:37:54,141
Christy?

1001
01:37:58,783 --> 01:38:01,192
Christy.

1002
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:06,534
What happened to this place?

1003
01:38:10,172 --> 01:38:13,210
It's cold.

1004
01:38:25,607 --> 01:38:27,564
Christy?

1005
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:30,736
God, no! No, no, no, no!

1006
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:33,396
Don't give up!
Don't give up! Christy!

1007
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:36,826
Don't give up!
Don't, don't give up!

1008
01:38:36,912 --> 01:38:38,740
Christy!

1009
01:38:42,044 --> 01:38:44,582
[Fading] Stay with me,
don't give up...

1010
01:39:05,863 --> 01:39:06,729
[Annie] Christy!

1011
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,992
Hey!

1012
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:50,363
Remember me?

1013
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:03,596
Sometimes, when you lose...

1014
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:05,260
you win.

1015
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,118
How did we get here?

1016
01:41:05,881 --> 01:41:09,666
Travel here
is like everything else.

1017
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:12,133
It's in your mind.

1018
01:41:13,432 --> 01:41:16,387
You only have to
close your eyes.

1019
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:20,097
If you know
where you're going...

1020
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:23,607
Looks like we did.

1021
01:41:25,154 --> 01:41:27,064
Where you were...

1022
01:41:28,826 --> 01:41:31,828
I tried everything.
Nothing worked.

1023
01:41:33,664 --> 01:41:35,742
Until...

1024
01:41:35,835 --> 01:41:38,538
you tried trailing me.

1025
01:41:43,301 --> 01:41:47,216
What some folks
call impossible...

1026
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:50,806
is what
they haven't seen before.

1027
01:42:31,734 --> 01:42:33,228
Excuse me, lady.

1028
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:38,690
Ready for that surprise
I promised?

1029
01:42:38,784 --> 01:42:40,327
Yeah.

1030
01:42:45,376 --> 01:42:47,001
That's not the surprise!

1031
01:42:47,085 --> 01:42:48,628
Mommy?

1032
01:43:37,605 --> 01:43:40,275
[Annie] I want us
to grow old together.

1033
01:43:40,357 --> 01:43:41,935
Can we do that here?

1034
01:43:42,026 --> 01:43:43,355
Mm-hm.

1035
01:43:43,446 --> 01:43:47,860
I want it all.
As long as it's with you.

1036
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:50,620
It will be.

1037
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:57,286
But what about going back?

1038
01:43:57,379 --> 01:43:59,834
Being reborn?

1039
01:43:59,924 --> 01:44:03,969
That's the one thing
we can't have here.

1040
01:44:04,053 --> 01:44:07,507
Finding each other
all over again.

1041
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:09,178
Falling in love.

1042
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:14,647
Make different choices.

1043
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:21,814
- Try again.
- Yeah.

1044
01:44:21,907 --> 01:44:24,031
Avoid sharp objects.

1045
01:44:26,664 --> 01:44:29,499
Don't worry about the kids.
They'll be here.

1046
01:44:29,584 --> 01:44:33,119
They want us to go.

1047
01:44:33,213 --> 01:44:36,380
A human life
is just a heartbeat here.

1048
01:44:36,467 --> 01:44:40,051
And we'll all be together.
Forever.

1049
01:44:43,602 --> 01:44:45,594
How will I find you?

1050
01:44:45,687 --> 01:44:49,554
I found you in hell.
I'll find you in Jersey.

1051
01:45:53,017 --> 01:45:57,017
'When I was young... I met this
beautiful girl by a lake.'

1052
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:00,019
# We follow the river

1053
01:46:00,019 --> 01:46:02,475
# We follow the river

1054
01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:05,895
# Down into the stream

1055
01:46:06,653 --> 01:46:11,566
# That's where my dream began

1056
01:46:13,202 --> 01:46:16,405
# I left my worries

1057
01:46:16,496 --> 01:46:19,369
# To the people who stare

1058
01:46:19,835 --> 01:46:25,292
# And dreamed without a care

1059
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:32,346
# That I'd always be beside you

1060
01:46:33,226 --> 01:46:38,352
# To watch the day and night

1061
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:45,779
# And we'll listen
to the sunrise

1062
01:46:46,493 --> 01:46:51,867
# And feel its glowing light

1063
01:46:53,292 --> 01:46:58,418
# And peace will come inside

1064
01:46:59,675 --> 01:47:05,844
# So quiet

1065
01:47:20,116 --> 01:47:22,868
# Wherever we're going

1066
01:47:23,704 --> 01:47:26,111
# I don't know

1067
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:32,788
# For a million years
our love keeps growin'

1068
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,544
# The mystery deepens

1069
01:47:37,178 --> 01:47:39,752
# Day by day

1070
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:46,101
# But trust my love
and hear me say

1071
01:47:46,188 --> 01:47:51,860
# That I'll always be beside you

1072
01:47:53,238 --> 01:47:58,281
# To watch the day and night

1073
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:06,160
# And we'll listen
to the sunrise

1074
01:48:06,839 --> 01:48:11,965
# And feel it's glowing light

1075
01:48:13,221 --> 01:48:18,512
# And peace will come inside

1076
01:48:19,645 --> 01:48:24,807
# So quiet

1077
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:58,020
# Peace will come inside

1078
01:48:59,443 --> 01:49:04,486
# So quiet

1079
01:49:05,826 --> 01:49:11,532
# Yes, I'll always be beside you

1080
01:49:12,792 --> 01:49:17,835
# To watch the day and night

1081
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:25,547
# And we'll listen
to the sunrise

1082
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:31,225
# And feel its glowing light

1083
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:37,562
# And peace will come inside

1084
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:44,197
# So quiet

1085
01:49:45,665 --> 01:49:50,708
# Yes, peace will come inside

1086
01:49:52,048 --> 01:49:58,468
# So quiet #
