1
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,213
Goodbye. Enjoy your stay.

2
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>The foundation for whom I work</i>
<i>supports a botanist...</i>

3
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,114
<i>named Robert Campbell, once of some note.</i>

4
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,952
<i>But on separating from his wife</i>
<i>and long-time research partner...</i>

5
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,455
<i>he'd withdrawn his station</i>
<i>deeper into the bush.</i>

6
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,168
<i>And until last month's message,</i>
<i>no one had heard from him in three years.</i>

7
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,256
<i>He asked for an assistant</i>
<i>and a gas chromatograph...</i>

8
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,134
<i>and pointedly refused to say why.</i>

9
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,179
I'm surprised they sent a woman.

10
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,307
For Dr. Campbell.

11
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,227
Please don't lose it.

12
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,689
Wait a minute. Aren't you coming with me?

13
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,985
I'm afraid he was adamant about that.
Tanaki will guide you from here.

14
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,379
Come on, you, go.

15
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,720
Come on.

16
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,717
Careful.

17
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,268
Are we here?

18
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,827
Okay, ready? Here you go.

19
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
Indian?

20
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,769
Oh, boy.

21
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,151
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who are you?

22
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,195
I asked you first.

23
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,448
- You're Dr. Campbell, right?
- I know who the hell I am.

24
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,743
- I'm asking who you are.
- Crane.

25
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,829
No, toucan.

26
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,999
- No, that's my name.
- Toucan?

27
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,211
- How odd.
- Crane. Dr. Rae Crane.

28
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,881
I do wish you'd make up your mind.

29
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,052
Maybe it's best we talk
in the morning, Doctor.

30
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,971
This is from Ornega.

31
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,599
How about a place to sleep?

32
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,310
Ornega?

33
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,105
Are you from Aston?

34
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,235
- He sent you?
- I tell you. They sent a girl.

35
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,362
- They sent a girl?
- Yes.

36
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,991
- I'm not a girl.
- The hell you're not.

37
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,369
- I'm your research assistant.
- The hell you are.

38
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,748
- Where's your mask?
- I don't have one. I just got here.

39
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,126
No one comes in here
without a surgical mask.

40
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,130
God knows what bugs you're carrying.
Jahausa, get her a mask.

41
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:29,343
- Relax. This is as close as we get, Tonto!
- Not for me, you hussy!

42
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,136
- For the indians.
- Hussy?

43
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,974
One outsider with a common cold
can decimate an entire tribe.

44
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,270
- And what about your shots?
- What about a place to sleep, God damn it?

45
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,105
To sleep?

46
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,068
Sleep.

47
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,073
Yes, of course, please forgive me.

48
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,077
There's no need for you to leave
till tomorrow.

49
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,374
I must tell you how grateful I am.
I've been waiting for these.

50
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,835
They get lost in the forest, you see?

51
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:10,008
The forest is so vast
and they're just so very small.

52
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,971
Dr. Campbell?

53
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,077
No, Palala. Back to the boat.

54
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,418
You had no right to unpack that equipment.
Where are you going?

55
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,963
- No.
- That's all right. He's loading the boat.

56
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,882
- No boat.
- Palala, only those boxes are staying.

57
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,511
Come on, up.

58
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,306
Luggage down. Come on, put it down.

59
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,561
Would you do me a favor
and ask him to put my luggage down?

60
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,444
Sorry, I forget women
like to carry their own now.

61
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,739
I think I should introduce myself.

62
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,826
You're the so-called research
assistant from Aston.

63
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,455
- You don't remember last night?
- Do I appear senile?

64
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,583
Drunk.

65
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,919
- Intoxicated, yes.
- There's a difference?

66
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,756
The Peach Palm Festival
is a religious ceremony.

67
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,635
Are those bags too heavy?
Shall I call Palala back?

68
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,389
No. I'm not getting on a boat. No boat.

69
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,811
It's the only available transport,
and you certainly can't remain here.

70
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,982
- Why? Because I'm not a man?
- Because you're not one of three men.

71
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,154
I requested Dr. Alan Sealove.
If he was unavailable, Dr. Gregory Hoffman.

72
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,450
I'm published more extensively
than Dr. Sealove.

73
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,454
I hold degrees from CCNY,
Berkeley, and Cambridge.

74
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,624
I'm the recipient...

75
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,336
of the Thurman Award in '82 and '86.

76
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,924
The first and only time it's ever been given
to the same person twice.

77
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,052
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

78
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,096
- Do those boots come with a manual?
- No.

79
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,141
I thought of snakes.

80
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,938
When was the last time
you did field research?

81
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,856
Or when was the first time?

82
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,402
I did a month in La Salva.

83
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,905
A whole month?

84
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,921
You didn't need me.

85
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,300
- You needed a caddie.
- Palala will carry your bags to the boat.

86
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:26,223
You send me back on the basis of
my gender, that's called sex discrimination.

87
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,936
Look, I understand your reservations.
I heard about your wife.

88
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,481
My wife? Good God, she left me.

89
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,860
I wish you'd follow her example.
Are we finished?

90
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,612
- You have a boat to catch.
- No boat.

91
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,908
- I want a meal and a bath.
- This isn't a hotel.

92
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,662
- I'll leave when I'm damn well ready.
- I know, after a meal and a bath.

93
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,416
I'm not a 19-year-old grad student
working up a resume.

94
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,919
And I don't expect to be treated as if I were.

95
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,965
I'm hungry, I'm tired...

96
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,469
and I've been in these clothes
for more than one dance.

97
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,057
Palala will see that you get some breakfast.

98
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,018
I said, and a bath.

99
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,773
Unbutton your shirt.

100
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,400
Excuse me?

101
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,779
Do you want to bathe in their water supply?
You'll take a medical first.

102
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,574
Sit down. Here.

103
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,752
- Is he gonna watch?
- Don't you want a nurse present?

104
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,837
- I'll risk it.
- I won't.

105
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,174
Deep breath.

106
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:47,137
Now I understand why you've been
so secretive about your research here.

107
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,974
You found the cure
for the common hangover.

108
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,400
Look up.

109
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,152
Left.

110
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,570
Right.

111
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,159
- Open your mouth.
- There's nothing wrong...

112
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,536
Say "ah.' '"

113
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,958
Let me see your <i>carnet.</i>

114
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,377
- My what?
- It's in your passport.

115
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,712
Your vaccine card.

116
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,883
This is completely unnecessary.

117
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:29,680
The principal cause of death
among aboriginals is imported disease.

118
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,980
What do you see?

119
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,817
I thought we did the eye examination.

120
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,320
Come on, you won two Thurman Awards,
show off.

121
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,156
What am I analyzing?

122
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,410
Did you run a base line?

123
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,162
No.

124
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,126
Next time run a base line
to calibrate the machine.

125
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,379
There's a glucose solution
specifically for that.

126
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,132
Is that the substance you're analyzing?

127
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,383
Yes.

128
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:15,267
- What is it, a plant extract?
- Full marks. Continue.

129
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,436
Okay.

130
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,400
We're looking at...

131
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,320
49 compound.

132
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,291
Okay, what we've got here is...

133
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,794
Where was I? Okay, 49 compound.

134
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,379
No.

135
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:50,844
Nearly all of these are identifiable.
In short, nothing new.

136
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,181
Is this why you wanted the chromatograph?

137
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,768
You said "nearly all identifiable.' '"

138
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,228
Yeah.

139
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,397
Just this one, Peak 37.

140
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,612
Looks like an acid derivative.
Although those side...

141
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,200
You must have thought
you were onto something.

142
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,786
- I'm sorry.
- Can it be synthesized?

143
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,542
This one's mother nature's kitchen.
End of story.

144
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,627
Why?

145
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,214
- What is it you think you've got?
- I don't think.

146
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,926
- I know.
- Share it.

147
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,011
What's the problem?

148
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:37,182
Even as a child, I didn't like to share.
It was deep-seated, I suppose.

149
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:41,520
What is it, a secret?
I'll cross my heart and spit on the floor.

150
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,189
You said breakfast and a bath.

151
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,697
You saving it for Sealove?
Don't, he's not coming.

152
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,537
Then I'll settle for Robinson.

153
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,292
You were lucky you got me
and last year's chromatograph.

154
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,462
I give up.

155
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:13,177
I believe our deal was
bath, breakfast, and boat.

156
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,221
I didn't come here to make deals.

157
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,349
Then why did you come here?

158
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,060
I'll leave the chromatograph
for the time being.

159
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,729
I'm asking you a question.

160
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,190
You have no idea, have you?

161
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,485
Aston's considering pulling your funds
and shipping you out.

162
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,571
I'm your judge and jury.

163
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,782
- Winslow would never permit that.
- Winslow!

164
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,911
Winslow retired last year.

165
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,749
If you hadn't cut off incoming,
you would have known that.

166
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,627
- Who replaced him?
- Me.

167
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,548
You don't send progress reports.

168
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,552
You move your damn station
wherever and whenever you like.

169
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,847
You don't send in a record of expenses!

170
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,978
And you don't respond
to requests for information.

171
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,440
So here I am!

172
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:32,005
- Put this on. I want to show you something.
- I've seen it.

173
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,507
Put in on!

174
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,050
Please.

175
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,972
Follow me.

176
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,527
This is Kalana...

177
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,739
wife of Jahausa, mother of Imana.

178
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,633
Palpate her throat.

179
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,345
I'm not a medic.

180
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:25,642
Good God, woman, must everything
be a full-scale debate with you? Just do it.

181
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,320
Feel anything?

182
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,155
Nothing.

183
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,909
Six months ago, she came to see me.
Couple of lumps on her throat.

184
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,079
I sent her down river with
a Franciscan missionary to the hospital.

185
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,374
Then she made her own way back.
It took her a month.

186
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,336
And the nodes were almost double the size.

187
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,675
Two injections of that sample
you just tested...

188
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,012
and the lumps disappeared within a week.

189
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,515
No boosters, no side effects.

190
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,267
That's just swell.

191
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,187
What am I supposed to report
to the Foundation?

192
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,940
Dr. Campbell showed me a cured patient...

193
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:18,153
who claims a history of undiagnosed,
undocumented lumps in her throat?

194
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,365
- You're untiring.
- Here it is.

195
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,367
- You're untiring.
- Here it is.

196
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,538
Her scan report.
She brought it back from Manikovi.

197
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,081
That's delightful.

198
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,417
I'll bring it with me. If you'll contact...

199
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,921
Stage 2, anterior and posterior lymphomas.

200
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,174
Here. Check her biopsy report.

201
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,135
What for? It could be anybody's.

202
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,181
- Okay.
- You think I'm lying?

203
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,268
You're a man
who's allowed his personal problems...

204
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,938
to get in the way of his clinical judgment.
That's what I think.

205
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,274
Stay here.

206
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,943
Stay here.

207
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,573
He talks to me like a dog.
500,000 scientists in this world...

208
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,868
and I end up with Dr. Mengele
with a ponytail.

209
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,455
Now what? Good God!

210
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,423
Feel that?

211
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,050
What is it?

212
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,804
- A supraclavicular node. Malignant.
- How do you know?

213
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,890
I gave it to him.

214
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,642
Transplanted tissue, I gave it to them all.

215
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:34,146
You will biopsy the lot. I insist.

216
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,857
That is your control group.

217
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,652
And this lucky bugger
gets an injection by nightfall...

218
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,156
and tomorrow, in the morning,
you will examine him.

219
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,036
Come on, I'm not proposing marriage.

220
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,206
I'm asking you to biopsy a family of rodents.

221
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,833
Spend 12 hours in a perfectly
luxurious hammock.

222
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:58,253
You don't have to think about that, just nod.

223
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:32,973
No ball.

224
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,292
What was in the tin?

225
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,506
The boys, you were giving them
something from the tin.

226
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,424
Candy coated ants.

227
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,595
Do you want some?
The tin is inside on the table.

228
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,764
I'll pass.

229
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,724
What about you?

230
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,643
What is it?

231
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,397
- Freeze dried ice cream.
- I'll pass.

232
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,941
Come on, the astronauts eat it.

233
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,201
It doesn't taste like ice cream.

234
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,663
When was the last time
you had a double dip?

235
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,583
The palate remembers.

236
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,627
That woman, Kalana?

237
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,672
She called you something.

238
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,553
What's it mean?

239
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,308
Medicine Man, that's me.

240
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,478
- Don't they have one of their own?
- What?

241
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,856
Medicine Man.

242
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:51,195
I gave Alka-Seltzer to a kid with a bellyache.

243
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,697
You did what?

244
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,784
Alka-Seltzer. It cured him with one belch.

245
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,914
But it was the plop and the fizz
that really dazzled them.

246
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,875
The Medicine Man
was understandably pissed off.

247
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,794
I had taken his stick.

248
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:09,838
Stick?

249
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,634
Yeah, his self-respect. His place.

250
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,179
He just took off.

251
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,017
My intentions were well meant.

252
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:29,316
You take the hammock,
I'll sleep in the greenhouse.

253
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:34,905
- If I need anything, I'll let you know.
- You will?

254
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,867
Good. Thank you.

255
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,663
Dr. Campbell?

256
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,791
Already?

257
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,212
My name is Dr. Crane, Rae Crane.

258
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,050
Just in case
you need to address me directly.

259
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,429
I thought I'd just call you Brooklyn.

260
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,807
I'm from the Bronx.

261
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,852
Oh, well, Bronx.

262
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,146
It doesn't quite roll off the tongue, does it?

263
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,066
Good night.

264
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:45,976
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm covering my ass.

265
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:51,982
I don't want you accusing me of
playing switcheroo with your control group.

266
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:57,112
I get it, Peach Palm Festival, day two.

267
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:02,242
No festival, just a bedtime story.

268
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,998
You're staring at me.

269
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,042
Pyjamas.

270
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,670
I haven't seen pyjamas in...

271
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,007
a long time.

272
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,681
Jesus!

273
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,185
What is it now?

274
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,271
God.

275
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,608
It's all right. That's Henry.

276
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,445
He keeps the place free of rats.
Come on, old dear.

277
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:42,950
Look, I'll sleep with lizards
and I'll sleep with guinea pigs...

278
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,453
I understand.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere.

279
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,705
Come on, old dear.

280
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,669
- Sweet dreams.
- Go to hell.

281
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,713
Probably.

282
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:13,605
No.

283
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,274
You?

284
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,157
Why do you think that?

285
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,209
- That's very funny.
- Dr. Campbell?

286
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,518
Imana.

287
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,314
Get stuffed, both of you.

288
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,954
Jesus, Campbell.

289
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,081
I know.

290
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:15,584
You know?

291
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,509
You've found a cure for cancer,
and all you can say is I know?

292
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:42,861
- What is it?
- Bromeliad. The flower.

293
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,822
How'd you find it?

294
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,575
Get dressed.

295
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,036
Okay.

296
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,418
I came here six years ago. Why?

297
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,713
A freak tribe, no cancer.

298
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:07,177
- What about the woman you showed me?
- No, Jahausa married outside the tribe.

299
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,763
Kalana is an Exoti.

300
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,975
- Then it's genetic.
- No. It's environmental.

301
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,978
The tribes have always inter-married.

302
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,981
But as far as I can tell...

303
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:22,985
the bromeliad doesn't grow anywhere
except here.

304
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,029
So the Exoti don't use it.

305
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,909
Kalana still doesn't put it in the food.
She says it tastes bad.

306
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,912
So they eat this flower?

307
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,789
They ingest it.

308
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:37,624
Snuff.

309
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:42,296
And sometimes chewing tobacco.
It's in most of their food.

310
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,799
It grows wild, 100 feet up in the canopy.

311
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,384
Ten storeys up?

312
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,513
On the top shelf
of the pharmacological superstore.

313
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,308
It lives off a tree.

314
00:32:56,018 --> 00:33:00,147
I've seen the old Medicine Man up there
gathering for his juju kit...

315
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,276
and there it was.

316
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,114
There's only one fly in the serum.

317
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,619
I can't reproduce it.

318
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,250
What do you mean?

319
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,337
None of the new samples work.

320
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:26,381
I have very little of the original serum left.

321
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,260
That's what I mean when I say
I can't reproduce it.

322
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,596
Wait a minute, I don't understand.

323
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,057
What don't you understand?

324
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:40,437
I found a cure for the fucking plague
of the 20th century and now I've lost it!

325
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,065
Haven't you ever lost anything, Dr. Bronx?

326
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,901
You purse, your car keys?
It's rather like that.

327
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,070
Now you have it, now you don't!

328
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,406
- Your notes are gone?
- I have my notes.

329
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,033
I followed my notes.

330
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,995
- Your notes must be wrong.
- They're not.

331
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,790
Then explain it.

332
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,378
I can't.

333
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:08,882
Okay.

334
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:14,805
The first thing I do when I get to LA
is I get Dr. Crouse.

335
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:19,226
- His people can set up a real lab here.
- There's nothing wrong with this lab.

336
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,812
- We've got everything we need.
- Look...

337
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,314
this is major league.

338
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,149
You need help.

339
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:29,152
I promise you will get full credit.

340
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:34,491
Do you think I give a damn
about the immortal textbook quote?

341
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,494
Dare I insult you with a history lesson?

342
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,206
Better still, how about subtraction?

343
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,376
Nine million indians in the Amazon...

344
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:48,672
white men bring measles,
flu, polio, and chicken pox.

345
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,466
Now you've got 2,00,000 indians.

346
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,887
Without using your fingers,
just how many did we shove in the hole?

347
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,640
It's not like they'll be unvaccinated.
These people would work for Aston.

348
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:02,352
All precautions would be taken.
You don't remember Mocara.

349
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:04,229
Do you?

350
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,900
You're too young.

351
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:13,989
Some overeager son of a bitch
found a great little painkiller in the jungle.

352
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,034
Fifteen cents to make a $5 bottle.

353
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,204
Aston was on to it like a fly to dung.

354
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,457
All very scientific, all precautions taken.

355
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,795
Swine flu killed the entire village.

356
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,006
Much regret, so sorry.

357
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,511
The eager beaver still ended up
with his 10 cents on the dollar...

358
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,722
This isn't a painkiller.
This is the cure for cancer.

359
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:42,226
These people don't need
a cure for cancer, ask them!

360
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,561
There's a road coming into the area.

361
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,773
You're finished. Aston can stop that!

362
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:52,152
Aston will need the road. They'll ensure
that it leads right up to my palapa.

363
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:55,280
- How can I go...
- How can you go when I need you here?

364
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:56,865
What?

365
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,825
No.

366
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:03,705
I'm a damn good bio-chemist.
I'm not a field researcher.

367
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:07,084
I haven't done this work for years.
I'm not qualified.

368
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,379
I know, too many foundation fund raisers.

369
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,339
Too many sub-committees.

370
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,259
Take two guinea pigs
and call me in the morning.

371
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,427
When you're old and grey...

372
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:21,265
you'll put lilies on my grave
and wish you could thank me.

373
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:25,644
Yeah, well, I'll thank you now,
but I'm still leaving.

374
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:29,982
How?

375
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,527
Campbell?

376
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,446
- I'm not your prisoner.
- No...

377
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,657
you're my research assistant.

378
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:42,870
You're not afraid of heights,
are you, Bronx?

379
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,814
Right foot up.

380
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:22,868
There we go.

381
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,459
You give the counterweight a good yank...

382
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,420
and up you go.

383
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,423
Come on.

384
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,343
I want you to see.

385
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,406
Come on.

386
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,455
All right.

387
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,708
Dr. Bronx?

388
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,089
Left leg first.

389
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,926
And now the right.

390
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,566
All right?

391
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,532
Come on.

392
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,950
Oh, God!

393
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,744
Think of Neil Armstrong.

394
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,301
All right.

395
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,805
I'll give you one week.

396
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:33,016
Did you hear me?

397
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:38,272
They're not in abundance.
If you find one, pop it in the bag.

398
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:45,195
- Are you gonna tell me what they look like?
- Yes.

399
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,948
Like this.

400
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:53,495
Whatever this flower needs to fertilize,
it gets it up here.

401
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,750
Whether it's an enzyme
being transported by...

402
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,669
an insect for the pollen...

403
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,463
or God knows what leaking out of a tree.

404
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,216
It could be anything. It could be everything.

405
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,636
That's the beauty of this system.
You can't beat it.

406
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,265
You can only wipe it out.

407
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,585
Is that the road?

408
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,049
You see the river?

409
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,928
No one can remember it ever being this low.

410
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,433
- What about all the rain?
- Every year it rains less.

411
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,353
Less rainforest means less rain.

412
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:45,274
The indians have asked me
to pray for a deluge.

413
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,737
Do you pray, Bronx?

414
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:56,493
There's so much smoke.
I didn't know the road was so close.

415
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:59,705
Yes, well, death is inevitable, Dr. Bronx.

416
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:03,834
But it's considered bad form
to discuss it over a man's sickbed.

417
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:07,337
Yeah, well, closing your eyes
won't make it disappear.

418
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,340
Neither will talk. Let's go.

419
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:38,327
- You're a lunatic.
- I'll show you a shortcut!

420
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,085
God!

421
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,631
- When was it made?
- What?

422
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,926
The eighth sample, when was it made?

423
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,803
Data sheets, green notebook, top left.

424
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:00,849
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No, I quit.

425
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,686
Good God, why? They've been missing
from the last three shipments.

426
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,814
I suspect Jahausa's got something
to do with it.

427
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,987
Your other left.

428
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:19,910
Last one.

429
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,838
Okay, look.

430
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,550
Here's the original extract,
the one that works.

431
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:38,053
Here's the eight subsequent ones
that don't work.

432
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,473
You notice anything?

433
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,851
I'll give you a hint.

434
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,771
It's missing from every failed sample.

435
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,482
Peak 37.

436
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:53,777
Did you vary the solution?

437
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:00,576
Do you think the bromeliad
changes chemistry during its life cycle?

438
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,995
It's not impossible.

439
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:07,249
But all these samples are dated
within two weeks of each other.

440
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:11,336
Maybe the first batch was contaminated.

441
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,839
Maybe Peak 37 is a fungus.

442
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,093
I screened every sample,
including the first one.

443
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,431
Yeah, maybe you used a dirty test tube.
Who knows?

444
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,976
There's gotta be 1,000 variations
on this plant extract.

445
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,271
And we've gotta make
and test every single one of them.

446
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:32,107
I tell you, we need help.

447
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:37,905
We're looking at too many possibilities.

448
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,159
Isn't that what science is all about?
Eliminating possibilities?

449
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,311
You said you needed help.

450
00:46:55,524 --> 00:47:00,279
Jahausa, can you tell them
that I need them to break it from the root?

451
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,783
How are we doing?

452
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,542
Tell her if she breaks the leaves it's easier.

453
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,715
Imana, what are you doing?
You're in my way.

454
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,561
Are you breaking them from the roots?

455
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,773
It's Kalana.

456
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:00,399
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

457
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:18,792
He wants to know if you have a date
for the prom, euphemistically speaking.

458
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,090
Why are they staring at me?

459
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:28,677
They've never seen a virgin of your maturity.

460
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,889
I had to give them some excuse.

461
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,309
You should have said
she's engaged to be married.

462
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,145
Really? It's to be Mrs. Bronx?

463
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:42,774
- It will be, next winter.
- I don't approve of long engagements.

464
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,320
We would have married earlier,
but it wasn't convenient.

465
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:48,572
A marriage of convenience.

466
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:52,326
You probably know him,
or at least his family.

467
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:54,912
Tom Falon?

468
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,207
Tommy Falon!

469
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:00,876
Good God, he's about 95 years old.

470
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,545
You'll inherit before the honeymoon's over.

471
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:06,006
I take my hat off to you, girl.

472
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,759
His son.

473
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:13,847
His son? No, I don't know the son,
but I can well imagine.

474
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,934
Good stock. Good contributor.

475
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,311
Met at a fundraiser, did we?

476
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,605
What's the difference where I met him?

477
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,399
Don't get your knickers in a twist,
Mrs. Bronx.

478
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:29,279
Just remember,
breeding is no substitute for intelligence.

479
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:32,032
It's often the death of it.

480
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,496
Do you have an unlimited supply
of that stuff?

481
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:43,794
The saliva speeds up
the fermentation process.

482
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,549
- Pass.
- You might as well.

483
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:51,510
We can't test this lot for another 72 hours.

484
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:55,264
It'll go by just as fast
if we're testing the local fungus.

485
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:58,350
I told you, I screened every sample.

486
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:05,274
- There is another possibility.
- Which is?

487
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,277
A six-pack of peach Pernod...

488
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,697
and you were drunker than a skunk
when you did the test.

489
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,324
Pernod. The "d" is silent.

490
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,203
If you're gonna hang around with
the Falons, you'd better get it right.

491
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:19,621
Pernod.

492
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:23,333
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Shall I write it down for you?

493
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,010
What if the missing step
isn't here in the lab?

494
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:37,472
Your Medicine Man, the first day
you saw him collect the bromeliads.

495
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:39,766
What if he did something?

496
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,853
Something you instinctively copied
that first time...

497
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,938
and haven't done since?

498
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,357
What if it's in the harvesting?

499
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,319
I counted at least three what ifs.

500
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:54,698
You don't start an investigation
with "once upon a time"...

501
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:58,410
- What are you going to investigate?
- Not what, who!

502
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:02,414
Your merry men must know
where the Medicine Man is.

503
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,250
We should go and question him.

504
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:10,672
As you yourself pointed out,
you're scarcely a qualified field researcher.

505
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:22,142
And as you've pointed out,
research is a process of elimination!

506
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,062
Don't you presume to tell me
how to follow up.

507
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:26,897
Question the Medicine Man.

508
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,608
Don't you think
I questioned the son of a bitch?

509
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:50,838
Play somewhere else!

510
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,464
Relax!

511
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:58,303
- They know not to urinate in the water.
- That's not my concern.

512
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:01,640
It should be.
Urine attracts the spiky canderoo.

513
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:05,352
It's a relatively tiny fish
that enters any available orifice.

514
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:09,690
Can't you blow a whistle?
Maybe they'd like to fetch some golf balls.

515
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,901
The spikes are angled backwards
and have to be surgically removed.

516
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,611
It's a hell of a procedure.

517
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:17,865
- I came to apologize.
- Are you serious?

518
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,617
- I lost my temper.
- About the spikes?

519
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:22,578
No, about the Medicine Man.

520
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:26,790
- Damn it, Campbell, the spiky canderoo?
- Good God, where?

521
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,884
I must admit, I've never actually seen
one this far up river.

522
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,803
It's not a bad idea to keep your knickers on.

523
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,516
All gone. Satisfied?

524
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:50,272
I didn't mean to jump down your throat
this afternoon.

525
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,986
Then I accept your apology. Let's forget it.

526
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,241
The Medicine Man,
he wouldn't answer my questions.

527
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:05,162
Until I got up to leave,
and then he spoke one word:

528
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,541
- "Mocara.' '
- The swine flu epidemic?

529
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,169
You told me.

530
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,593
He was afraid, you see, because in Mocara...

531
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:24,181
their medicine man
had shared forbidden juju magic...

532
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:26,266
with the eager beaver...

533
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,311
and swine flu...

534
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,232
was the Gods' punishment
for that indiscretion.

535
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,817
All right, he wouldn't talk.

536
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,904
- He might talk to me.
- A woman?

537
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,198
Look, what do you wanna do?

538
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,868
Sit on your hands for three days
and pray for Peak 37?

539
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:50,832
We could take Jahausa. He could plead
our case. You could say you're sorry.

540
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,962
I don't think he knows it was me.

541
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,676
I meant sorry for the Alka-Seltzer.

542
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,015
I thought you meant Mocara.

543
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:52,329
Same story as Imana.

544
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,751
Supraclavicular node, non-tender.

545
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:01,255
Adherent to the surrounding tissues.

546
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:07,719
- How big would you say?
- One centimeter.

547
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,515
I'll give it to you.

548
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,027
You can't, and you know it.

549
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,822
It's so close to his windpipe,
he'll choke to death...

550
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,448
before the cancer kills him.

551
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:33,161
- It's not a weed, it's a tumor. It can wait.
- It's not a tumor, it's a child.

552
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:35,414
The child can wait, too.

553
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:39,960
You use up the last bit of
the working serum and we have nothing.

554
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:43,005
- You can't use the last of it.
- We know the molecule.

555
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:47,885
A picture. A ghost in a machine.
For Christ's sake, Campbell, use your head!

556
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:51,471
The boy won't die in the next 48 hours.

557
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,018
If one of those beakers sprouts Peak 37...

558
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:59,688
you can give samples away for Christmas,
I'll help you wrap.

559
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,358
Suppose the new serums don't work?

560
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:09,907
You said yourself you found the cure
for the plague of this century.

561
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,577
It belongs to the human race,
not to one sick kid.

562
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:26,965
Come on, give me that syringe.
It'll be my sleepless night.

563
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,536
Jahausa's taken his son
to the Medicine Man.

564
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,455
When she woke up this morning,
they were both gone.

565
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,500
- She wants me to bring them back.
- Medicine Man?

566
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,877
Kalana, where's the Medicine Man?

567
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:07,464
- What is she saying?
- That Jahausa's is a fool.

568
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,674
For taking him there.

569
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,260
Who can show us
where the Medicine Man is?

570
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:12,344
Palala.

571
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:16,682
- Palala can show us.
- Can't hear you.

572
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,308
Get out of there!

573
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:21,186
If we leave now,
we can catch up to Jahausa!

574
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,521
Can't hear you!

575
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:26,316
You got some history, fine. It's history.

576
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:29,862
Will you drag it around
for the rest of your life?

577
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,531
If that man has the answers, we need them.

578
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:35,492
- I can't hear...
- Can you hear me now?

579
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,834
- What is it?
- Headache.

580
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:28,795
Keep your eyes down,
the focus won't change...

581
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,464
you won't get a headache.

582
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:34,468
- You might have mentioned it earlier.
- I'm sorry, I thought I did.

583
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,894
No, I've got something better.

584
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,604
- No, give it.
- No.

585
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:53,028
- What is it?
- Yoco tree.

586
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,697
The bark is 3% pure caffeine.

587
01:00:55,822 --> 01:01:00,202
Cures headaches, fatigue, aches, pains,
neuritis, neuralgia.

588
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:03,455
Drink it. It'll keep you on your feet
till dinnertime.

589
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,332
- Pass.
- Drink it.

590
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,000
- Pass!
- Drink it.

591
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:12,214
Or Palala will force you on your back,
while I pour it down your gullet.

592
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:15,384
- Isn't that right, Palala?
- Gullet.

593
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:17,553
Go ahead.

594
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:32,150
- What's the name of this bark?
- It's called Yoco.

595
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:36,405
Yoco. You know, this would knock
Maxwell House right off the shelf.

596
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:40,200
If the narcs wouldn't stop me at the border.

597
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,463
This isn't a hallucinogen, is it?

598
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,303
- Which peak is his?
- None of the above.

599
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,347
The old man lives at the base of the gorge.

600
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,851
Downhill. Yeah.

601
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:13,150
We gotta talk about marketing this stuff.

602
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:20,407
Of course, you'd have to add sugar.

603
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,492
Your version tastes like shit.

604
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:26,413
Man, they don't spit in this one, do they?

605
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,334
- Spit, no. But...
- Okay, don't tell me.

606
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:34,171
Yocaf!

607
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:36,757
Yospresso!

608
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,596
Have you broken it down yet?

609
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:46,099
Look at that!

610
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:49,728
If I were the Medicine Man,
I would have taken that penthouse.

611
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,647
Why does he live at the bottom?

612
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,191
To get away from the constant gabbing,
most likely.

613
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,318
Sorry for disturbing you.

614
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,198
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

615
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,409
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

616
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,791
That Yocola sounds too much
like a kids' drink.

617
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,253
I'm more interested in the mass market in...

618
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:19,216
Okay, I'm more interested in the
mass marketing of this drink for the adults...

619
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:22,094
like a continental suave thing.

620
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:25,222
Is it difficult...

621
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,517
to process that Yoco bark?

622
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:37,693
Bronx?

623
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,253
- Where are you?
- I'm all right.

624
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:01,508
Don't play silly buggers. Where are you?

625
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,260
I'm all right.

626
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,263
I'm all right.

627
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:08,140
I'm okay.

628
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,602
Stay where you are.

629
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:21,612
I'm gonna lower a harness.

630
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,201
You've been to the circus?

631
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,079
This is a piece of cake
compared to the triple.

632
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:33,415
You can tell your kids
you worked without a net.

633
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:37,169
Except, they're not gonna believe you.
All right, here we go.

634
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:43,300
Use your left hand.
You can reach the harness.

635
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:47,971
Now, come on, reach back for the harness!

636
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,771
It's all right. Don't cry.

637
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:01,693
I promise you, when this is over,
you can cry all you want...

638
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:03,654
and I won't say a word.

639
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:06,281
Now come on. Reach for the harness.

640
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:08,450
No, I can't do it.

641
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:14,957
Change of plan.

642
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,501
Mohammed goes to the mountain.

643
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:24,842
The triple is easier.

644
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,014
All right, here I come.

645
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:45,362
- All right? Okay?
- No!

646
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,906
It's okay. Just let go.

647
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,287
- I can't do it, Campbell.
- You don't have to.

648
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:56,498
We'll both go down together.
It's a hell of a short cut.

649
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,292
God!

650
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:02,337
If I wanted to kill both of us,
I could have found easier ways, no?

651
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:05,007
Well, come on. Let go.

652
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,968
Come on! Let go!

653
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:11,305
Rae, let go!

654
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:13,891
Come on!

655
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,226
- Move!
- Okay.

656
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:28,447
You're okay. Just come down.

657
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:30,699
Come on.

658
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:33,827
There you go.

659
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:40,876
- Come on.
- I think I hate you.

660
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,296
Faster, let it go. Come on.

661
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:46,965
- I can't look.
- Come on.

662
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:50,385
- I can't look.
- Don't look. Work your hands.

663
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,767
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

664
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,393
What happened?

665
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:02,648
- Just calm down.
- What're you doing?

666
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,149
What do we do now?

667
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,485
This is a rescue?

668
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,157
What's the matter with you?
What am I supposed to do, call 911?

669
01:07:12,282 --> 01:07:13,617
You idiot!

670
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:17,246
- Calm down.
- Do something!

671
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:20,999
- Give me your hand.
- This isn't a rescue. This is a suicide pact.

672
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,043
- You idiot!
- Calm down!

673
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:25,546
Give me your hand.

674
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,466
What for? What, are you crazy?

675
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:45,732
Well done.

676
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:02,791
Don't cry. You were marvelous. Really.

677
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,043
The best I've ever seen.

678
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:08,088
And I've been to the circus
a great many times.

679
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:11,300
You were spectacular. Really.

680
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:14,636
Don't cry.

681
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:19,057
You promised I could cry all I want.

682
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:24,354
Yes, I did. Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

683
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,486
Fortunately, Palala salvaged your haversack.

684
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:37,868
Careful, that's Peach Pernod.

685
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,961
- I lost it up there, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

686
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:51,173
I'm trying to thank you.

687
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,969
That was a good job. Enough said.

688
01:08:56,887 --> 01:08:58,263
Go easy on it.

689
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,143
Why? I'm not driving.

690
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:07,898
Or walking, apparently.

691
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,406
- Now I know why you like this stuff.
- What?

692
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,243
Don't make me laugh.

693
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,455
Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

694
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,671
Hold on.

695
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,552
That burns.

696
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:39,054
- I know.
- What is it?

697
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:41,723
It's magic.

698
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,226
Magic, yeah.

699
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:47,062
<i>That old black magic</i>

700
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:49,064
<i>has got me in its spell</i>

701
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,653
<i>Old black magic that you weave so well</i>

702
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:55,988
I know. Terrifying...

703
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,408
<i>Icy fingers up and down your spine</i>

704
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:01,243
Down my spine?

705
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:13,297
<i>I'm in a spin, loving the spin I'm in</i>

706
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,884
- All right, bed time.
- Come on, sing it, Campbell.

707
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,720
Really big finish. Come on, sing us a bar.

708
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:27,686
<i>I should stay away, but what can I do?</i>

709
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,564
<i>I hear your name</i>

710
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:33,817
<i>I’m in a flame</i>

711
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,778
Come on, sing it.

712
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,323
Get some sleep, Rae.

713
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:41,533
Don't!

714
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:44,203
What?

715
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:47,039
Don't call me by my given name.

716
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,374
Don't you like it?

717
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:54,880
Yeah, I like it.

718
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:05,450
Campbell?

719
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:07,953
Are you ready for visitors?

720
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,335
The Medicine Man?

721
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,754
He's in the neighborhood.

722
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,174
How do you know?

723
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,426
Call it a hunch.

724
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:32,352
- We might be in the wrong gorge.
- Somehow, I doubt that.

725
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:37,482
I mean, are you sure
Palala knows where he lives?

726
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:41,904
What if he doesn't? What do we do then?

727
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:56,627
I thought I was dreaming.

728
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:03,425
Campbell, I thought...

729
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,816
Okay, what's going on?

730
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:23,153
It seems there's going to be a fight.

731
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,364
Between you and him?

732
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:31,453
He's 3 feet tall, for Christ's sake.

733
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:35,457
- You wanted to pick his brains.
- Well, not off the sidewalk.

734
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:41,964
Ever mouth off to the Dean
and then need a grant?

735
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:48,303
- This is an eat crow, kiss ass contest?
- Exactly.

736
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:51,640
Remember what I told you
about taking his stick?

737
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:56,478
- I think this is about giving it back.
- So he's gotta win?

738
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:01,984
Okay. Bend over, take three whacks,
and let's cut to the info.

739
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:05,112
It doesn't quite work that way.

740
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,157
- The tricky part is...
- Is what?

741
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,703
Not getting my skull cracked in the process.

742
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,935
Tell him his mother eats army boots.

743
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:54,286
- This is what happens when cousins marry!
- For Christ's sake!

744
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:59,791
- I was helping.
- Well, don't!

745
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:08,175
- I don't need a bloody interpreter.
- I do.

746
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:14,389
- Don't push your luck, runt!
- Campbell.

747
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,360
Yeah, nice kiss.

748
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,730
What'd he say?

749
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,697
What'd he say?

750
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:39,933
Back to square one.

751
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:44,980
Where did I go wrong?
Eating crow, or the kissing ass department?

752
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,611
It wasn't a total loss.

753
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:07,145
My, my, isn't it all bright and shiny?

754
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:11,316
I cleaned up a little, that's all.

755
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:20,117
These first four extracts
will be ready to test by 7:00.

756
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:23,161
I'll set my alarm clock for 6:30.

757
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,749
Incidentally, the blue doesn't come off.

758
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:31,503
Get drunk somewhere else.

759
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:36,508
Hey, I live here.
Get sanctimonious somewhere else.

760
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:41,638
I tried to get drunk at Jahausa's,
as a matter of fact.

761
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:46,602
But I soon tired
of hearing him pray over his only son.

762
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,938
So I said to myself,
"Why not visit Dr. Bronx..."

763
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:53,066
"and her tabernacle of empirical evidence?"

764
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:59,281
- I'm not a monster, Campbell.
- No, you're not a monster.

765
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:04,161
And if I have, in any way,
labeled you monstrous...

766
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:09,333
by gesture or manner,
I sincerely beg your pardon.

767
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:14,880
I'd like to go to sleep now.
I have an early morning.

768
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:18,550
I wouldn't bother setting that alarm,
Monster Bronx.

769
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,930
He won't make it through the night.

770
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,183
You don't know that.

771
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:30,896
I picture you at Imana's age...

772
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:36,860
sitting in bed, awake,
arms crossed, whispering:

773
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:40,030
"I don't believe in ghosts.' '"

774
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:47,454
Where was I, when you were 6 years of age
and armed against the dark?

775
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:51,166
Probably hiding, like you are now.

776
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:56,046
In the jungle, or in the bottle?
To which hideout are you referring?

777
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,258
Does it matter?

778
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:06,640
It's not as difficult as you might think,
watching someone die.

779
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:12,062
After 70 or 80 men, women, infants...

780
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:15,858
you begin to feel quite numb.

781
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:22,865
When I left Jahausa's hut,
I was coming here to get the magic serum.

782
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:27,786
Save myself, of course, not the boy...

783
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:32,416
which makes me the monster.

784
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,085
You at least would save the world.

785
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:40,883
And the world is not one choking boy,
in the middle of a disappearing forest.

786
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:44,052
Even though it seems that way,
here in the dark...

787
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:46,972
against which you are so well armed...

788
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:51,602
and I've only this.

789
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:58,275
Enough. Give me that bottle.

790
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:01,945
You're not a murderer.
That's not why she left you.

791
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:06,241
What the hell do you know about it?
She left me...

792
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:15,042
because I wouldn't allow her to forgive me.

793
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,795
She very much wanted to, you see.

794
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:24,468
But I couldn't forgive myself.

795
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:27,679
Until I do, no one...

796
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:30,849
no one's allowed.

797
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:45,531
We've been invited to a prayer meeting.
I'll make your excuses.

798
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:47,963
Kalana!

799
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:53,969
Yes, he's okay. He'll be fine.

800
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:56,972
What's going on? Why is everyone running?

801
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:29,129
Time's up.

802
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:02,204
A miracle without proof is only a miracle.

803
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:06,917
- It does not stop bulldozers.
- Look, Ornega, I injected him myself.

804
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:08,377
I'm not doubting it.

805
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:12,172
This bromeliad, I've never seen it
growing anywhere else.

806
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:14,591
We can't transplant it to the lab.

807
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:17,469
Christ, I couldn't bring it down
100 feet from origin.

808
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:20,347
Now you move your roads through here,
and we've lost it.

809
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:22,724
Come on, Roberto, it's not my road.

810
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,978
We need time. We're testing new samples.

811
01:26:26,937 --> 01:26:31,400
<i>Seٌor</i> Reyes has already been instructed
to move the villagers.

812
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:36,738
If a test is successful in, say,
the next 24 hours...

813
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:40,909
The bulldozers are running
night and day now.

814
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:18,739
I'm gonna retest.

815
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:22,492
It didn't work, Rae. It's not here.

816
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,705
You promised me a week,
you gave me a week.

817
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:30,000
Pack your bags, Rae,
before the road gets here.

818
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:33,921
You're always throwing me out.

819
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:36,423
It's for your own good.

820
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:42,221
- What do you know about it?
- Quite a bit.

821
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,516
You don't smoke, do you?

822
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:50,020
There's gotta be
a cigarette around here, somewhere.

823
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,993
Is this supposed to be me?

824
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:10,332
Supposed to be?
I think it's a very good likeness.

825
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,545
Well, take it if you want.

826
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:17,798
No, I'd rather you kept it.

827
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:24,596
Well, I certainly flattered you a bit
by idealizing your forehead...

828
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:28,642
but a man in love
wouldn't notice the disparity.

829
01:28:30,686 --> 01:28:32,271
A man in love?

830
01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:36,692
Tommy Falon the younger. Give it to him.

831
01:28:38,652 --> 01:28:42,489
I'm sure he sees your forehead
exactly as I've drawn it...

832
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:45,242
and he probably never noticed...

833
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:48,662
that your left ear
is lower than your right ear.

834
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:52,249
And when he's smitten,
those are the details that...

835
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,628
What are you running?

836
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:58,547
Base line.

837
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:02,384
- What are you using?
- Sugar solution.

838
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:07,764
The same solution you've used each time?

839
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:11,435
No, I ran out. Why?

840
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:15,856
Where'd you get the sugar?

841
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:51,493
Campbell? It's a damn poor time
for having an iron man contest!

842
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,110
Have you ever lost anything, Ornega?

843
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:56,488
Your car keys, your wallet?

844
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:01,952
It wasn't the bromeliads, it was the ants.

845
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:05,038
You're certain?

846
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:08,792
I seem to have left the evidence
in my other suit.

847
01:35:12,462 --> 01:35:13,839
Campbell?

848
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,116
Roberto?

849
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:52,794
It's me, Miguel.

850
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:58,926
We can go, whenever you are ready.

851
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:02,012
No, I know what I'm looking for now.

852
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:06,308
If those little orange bastards
exist somewhere else, I'll find them.

853
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:08,185
Look at yourself.

854
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,687
It's time out, my friend.

855
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:14,024
Six years and all your equipment.

856
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:18,362
- Aston isn't going to...
- Aston will replace all of it...

857
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:22,282
and provide him with a research assistant,
per his request.

858
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:27,746
Dr. Sealove, if I remember,
was your first choice.

859
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:31,416
Thank you.

860
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:36,672
You're welcome.

861
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:44,388
If you're ready, we should go.

862
01:36:58,485 --> 01:36:59,903
Good luck.

863
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:03,824
Good luck to you.

864
01:37:11,164 --> 01:37:12,958
You'll be in touch?

865
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:26,889
They won't relocate
where the government has indicated.

866
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,641
Sooner or later...

867
01:37:30,309 --> 01:37:34,438
they'll have no place left,
then they'll go where they're told.

868
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:38,859
He says the Medicine Man
has found a place upriver.

869
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,237
Medicine Man? You mean Campbell?

870
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:45,199
No, that small one, over by the trees.

871
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:52,831
Give me a minute.

872
01:38:38,335 --> 01:38:39,336
All right.

873
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:43,173
I'll tell him.

874
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:00,023
He said this was your stick.

875
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:04,862
He said it's all right now,
he's found a good place.

876
01:39:05,988 --> 01:39:09,283
And if you behave yourself,
you can go with them.

877
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:14,413
He said he'll teach you big magic.

878
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:22,129
He said he's never met
a man like you before.

879
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:27,676
And maybe, he never will again.

880
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:38,729
I'm gonna need an addition, too.

881
01:39:38,854 --> 01:39:43,150
A new chromatograph,
more scopes, callipers...

882
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:46,278
I'll make sure you get everything you need.

883
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:50,199
When I reach the city,
I'll contact Dr. Sealove.

884
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,786
I've reconsidered.

885
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:59,291
Dr. Sealove is my second choice now.

886
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:06,548
Come on, Bronx.

887
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:08,926
You think Tom Falon's
gonna walk down the aisle...

888
01:40:09,051 --> 01:40:13,180
with a woman who has something blue
as a tattoo on her forehead?

889
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,434
I want joint publication.

890
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:21,813
You can have whatever you want.

891
01:40:26,944 --> 01:40:28,695
What do you want?

892
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,494
A meal and a bath.

893
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:42,960
Unbutton your shirt.

894
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:57,349
<i>Dearest Tom, we're pushing upriver</i>
<i>in search of those ants.</i>

895
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:02,521
<i>And with some luck, we'll get to them</i>
<i>before the lumber companies do.</i>

896
01:41:05,023 --> 01:41:07,109
<i>And about our marriage...</i>

897
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:16,076
<i>I’m not so sure I'm ready for it yet.</i>

898
01:41:26,545 --> 01:41:28,255
<i>Life is strange.</i>

899
01:41:30,424 --> 01:41:32,134
<i>But down here...</i>

900
01:41:33,844 --> 01:41:35,304
<i>it seems...</i>

901
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:38,932
<i>so very precious.</i>

902
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:42,227
I'm coming!
