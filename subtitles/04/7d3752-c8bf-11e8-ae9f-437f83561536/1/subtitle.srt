00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,218
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

483
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,549
I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

484
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,036
Madame Selena.

485
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,512
And you've found her, lucky boy.

486
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,116
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

487
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,396
I always see your truck parked around.

488
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,991
Oh, yeah. I get a lot of repeat business.
People like my work.

489
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,413
Yes, I'm sure they do.

490
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,297
Wet your whistle?

491
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,970
Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact,
don't mind if I do.

492
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,610
So, where's the one at?

493
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,539
- It dropped dead.
- Where at exactly? Out back?

494
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,339
You know, I thought we might get
to know each other a little more...

495
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,335
...before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

496
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,013
Well, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

497
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,974
- I mean, I do my work, I go home.
- To your wife?

498
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,651
No. At the present moment in time
I'm enjoying a single status in my life.

499
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,088
Cheers.

500
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,896
- Bottoms up, huh?
- Bottoms up.

501
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,390
I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

502
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,438
What I want are some
houseplants inside here.

503
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,833
Something that goes well
with the house.

504
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,211
- This is a house?
- Of course it's a house.

505
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,378
There's the bedroom over there.

506
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,773
I think it's getting dark in here.

507
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,450
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna grow in this dump?

508
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,128
I don't know.

509
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,618
Shade plants.

510
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,898
To us.

511
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,097
And to the seeds we'll plant together.

512
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:11,135
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

513
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,618
You probably killed him, you know.

514
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,194
Sleep well.

515
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,515
And when you wake,
drown in my eyes and be all mine.

516
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,757
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's Witnesses again...

517
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,351
I'll get it.

518
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,953
Oh, hello, Nigel. It's you.

519
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,531
Nice suit.

520
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,574
- Subtle.
- I want to see Selena.

521
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,930
She's indisposed at the moment.

522
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,612
Whoever it is, we don't want any.

523
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:03,134
It's Nigel, and he's not going away
until he talks to you.

524
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,973
- What the devil do you want?
- I want to make a very serious proposal.

525
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,250
In that outfit?

526
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,315
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off...

527
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,950
...from those little beasts at Midvale
and I intend to let my hair down.

528
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:14,255
That ball will not operate at its fullest
until you internalize your power, Selena.

529
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,339
Some mosaic invocations.

530
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,393
- Some what?
- Come again?

531
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,437
Exactly. That's my point.

532
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,598
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

533
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,758
Because we own the matches.

534
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,675
I, of all people, know a hustle
when I hear one. Goodbye, Nigel.

535
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,440
- It was nice talking to you, Nigel.
- No, it wasn't.

536
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,952
- I hate to seem pushy, my fairest-
- A word of advice, Nigel.

537
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,271
If I had your skin problems,
I'd stop bothering people...

538
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,093
...put a bag over my head,
and go live under a bridge!

539
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,419
There's nothing wrong with my skin.

540
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,733
That bitch.

541
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,859
You know, some people.

542
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,774
Where is he?

543
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,292
Where is he?!

544
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,460
Where is he?

545
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,094
Whoever he sees first
he'll love with all his heart.

546
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,411
What? For a day tops, right? He was
too young for you anyway, you know.

547
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,153
No, I do not know. Where is he?

548
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,356
Hey, I know that guy.

549
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,915
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

550
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,429
This is a mirror.

551
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,636
So, how come
we could ever see him in it?

552
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,389
That was magic, damn it. The power.

553
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,148
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

554
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,075
I can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it the first time.

555
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,352
Maybe you should let that thing
out of its box, you know.

556
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,276
Maybe it's more powerful
if you let it out of its box.

557
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,833
- The box.
- The box.

558
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,439
- Where is it?
- The box?

559
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,110
It's underneath the rug
where you left it. Go ahead.

560
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,552
It's stuck.

561
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,835
This is not my day.

562
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,476
It's stuck? How could it be stuck?

563
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,557
It's growing.

564
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,752
How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.

565
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,049
Too bad there's no sound.

566
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,371
How come there's no sound?

567
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,294
Get off the road, turkey!

568
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,930
Hey, dummy, you wanna die?

569
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,294
Stupid. You wanna kill yourself?

570
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,096
Anyway, she saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.

571
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,172
I told her to take him for every cent.
Clean him out.

572
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,274
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

573
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,516
Here you go, everybody.

574
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,019
- Who wants onion rings?
- Yeah. Here.

575
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,454
- Thanks.
- Some french fries?

576
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:43,135
- French fries are mine.
- Chicken for myself. Thank you.

577
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,858
- Thanks.
- Side order of tomatoes?

578
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,053
- Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.
- I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

579
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,013
- Who wanted root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.

580
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,569
Oh, there's Linda.

581
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,538
Hey, Linda!

582
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,332
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

583
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,453
- That's Clark Kent's cousin?
- Who's Clark Kent?

584
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,872
Is that Linda?

585
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,959
- Guess what.
- What?

586
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,416
There's this all-night party tonight
at Eddie's. He's the guy with the tattoo.

587
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,854
His folks are out of town.

588
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,251
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

589
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,079
So you wanna come?

590
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,555
I don't know.
I'm not signed out for an overnight.

591
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,188
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

592
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,475
Mrs. Murphy's drunk as a skunk by now,
totally on another planet.

593
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,096
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

594
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,899
But that's why it'll be fun. Okay?

595
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,410
Okay.

596
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,973
Get off the road, buddy.

597
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,136
Hey, stupid.

598
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,337
- Look at that dingleberry.
- What's a dingleberry?

599
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,636
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get out of the street!

600
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,878
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

601
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,895
He's probably on drugs. And he's gonna
get creamed if he's not too careful.

602
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,133
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- I'm Kara.

603
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,568
- Who?
- Who?

604
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:05,690
I'm concerned, well, that if
we don't do something-

605
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,509
Yeah. You go out there and
try to help a guy like that...

606
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,990
...and he's probably got a gun or a knife,
you know. It's not too safe.

607
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,456
Hey, I'm starving. Let's eat.

608
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,497
Come on, Linda.

609
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,310
Power of Shadow

610
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,511
Bring him to me

611
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,772
Look at that.

612
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,233
- You've never seen a tattoo, Linda?
- Look!

613
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,431
- What's that?
- There's somebody hanging out of it.

614
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,716
Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.

615
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,416
Oh, my God. It's a runaway.

616
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,796
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- What's she doing?

617
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,428
Lucy, be careful. Lucy!

618
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,279
- Come on.
- Lucy!

619
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,299
God, where's the pump?

620
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,536
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

621
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,988
Are you okay?

622
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,433
It's gasoline! It's gasoline!

623
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,433
A storm dragon?

624
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,633
A supergirl.

625
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,794
Oh, my God.

626
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,309
Don't. Don't look at her.

627
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,058
You're gonna be all right.
There's no broken bones.

628
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,516
I love you.

629
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,512
What did he say? What did he say?

630
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,592
Looked like "I love you" to me.

631
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,270
No! No!

632
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,791
You love me?

633
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,017
With all my heart forever.

634
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,414
A bird of free and careless wing
Was I through many a smiling spring.

635
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,013
The cold repulse, the look askance,
The lightning of love's angry glance.

636
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,376
Let me behold you.

637
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,857
I have to go.

638
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,973
I have to go.

639
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,530
- Everything's under control.
- Lucy?

640
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,331
Just go on back to your homes.

641
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,893
Lucy.

642
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,776
Thank God.

643
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,488
- You all right?
- I think so.

644
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,579
I hit my head.

645
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,333
Nigel must know her.

646
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,532
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

647
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,049
No. I don't think that at all.

648
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,969
She just happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time, right?

649
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,856
Materializing in a bulldozer, huh?

650
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,132
She's a wimpy little thing. I don't even
know why you care what she does.

651
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,332
Because nobody gets in my way.

652
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:47,294
Why don't you just leave this kid alone
and worry about the other one that flies.

653
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,675
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

654
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,917
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

655
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,710
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

656
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,729
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

657
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,330
The naming of names
is not necessary.

658
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,837
Let us concentrate on her face...

659
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,271
...and my Shadow will do the rest.

660
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,953
Your what?

661
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,640
Power of Shadow, take shape

662
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,674
Look like a vicious dark star

663
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,895
Seek out
That wretched young creature

664
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,651
And destroy her wherever she

665
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,248
Are

666
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,969
Oh, God, that's awful.
That's never gonna work.

667
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,257
Oh, my God.

668
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,491
Next time...

669
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,972
...remind me to do this outside.

670
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,497
Leave this place and do no harm.

671
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,779
There she is again.

672
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,898
What did she say?

673
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,279
No, this is not possible.
This is not right.

674
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,993
Where's the wimp?

675
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,275
I think he can take care of her.

676
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,958
See? What did I tell you?

677
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,639
She quit, right?

678
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,789
Wrong.

679
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,514
Every time! Every time!

680
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,190
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

681
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,236
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

682
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,316
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you. Find out.

683
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,274
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

684
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,617
Where have you been?

685
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,936
- Outside-
- Look at you.

686
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,739
Look at those clothes.

687
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,259
I'll go change. I'm sorry.

688
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,532
And you'll put on your
proper school uniform.

689
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,290
- And get out of that ridiculous costume.
- Yes, ma'am.

690
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,889
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

691
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,912
- Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.
- No, ma'am.

692
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,918
I think you're blowing this thing out
of proportion, if you want my opinion.

693
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:28,272
This box is definitely getting
bigger and uglier.

694
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,232
All I'm saying is you can't go nuts...

695
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,198
...over a landscape guy
and a teenager in a blue suit.

696
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,079
She flies.

697
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,310
Can you get that through your thick skull
and into your tiny brain, Bianca?

698
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,159
The girl can fly.

699
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:06,530
Okay. Now, let's get serious.

700
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:10,255
Come to mama.

701
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:39,379
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

702
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,916
I think we're venturing where, you know,
fools rush in and angels fear to tread.

703
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,051
I'm no angel.

704
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,433
It's the wimp again.

705
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,596
And she's trespassing.

706
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,548
Hello.

707
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,955
Oh, no. Not now.

708
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,311
'Tis only but me, my love.

709
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,751
- Please, you'll let everyone know.
- What? That I love you?

710
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,591
- I'd shout it from the highest hill.
- Please don't.

711
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,528
I know you think me the fool,
but at least tell me your name.

712
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,338
Linda. Linda Lee.

713
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:51,419
Linda. Lovely Linda Lee.

714
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,571
These roses pale beside thee.

715
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:02,139
- Well, thank you, but I'm-
- Sweet chocolates for my sweet Linda.

716
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,695
What are you doing?

717
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,833
Please?

718
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,790
- Oh, no, I-
- Please?

719
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,911
Well, all right. But just for a minute.

720
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,430
You hate me, don't you?

721
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,995
Hate you? I don't even know you.

722
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,749
- I don't even know your name.
- Ethan.

723
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,475
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

724
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,757
Look, Ethan-

725
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,872
Ethan.

726
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,538
Ethan.

727
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,829
Your soft caress did at once renew
the beating of this broken heart.

728
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,995
Are you crazy?

729
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,599
Marry me?

730
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,577
Marry you?

731
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,216
- I don't-
- Don't say it. Don't, please. I know.

732
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,095
- What?
- We're from different worlds.

733
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,751
- You mean, you know where I'm-?
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

734
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,155
Love makes everything possible.

735
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,795
A poor uneducated gardener
can indeed worship a rich debutante...

736
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,558
...and make her happy if she'd just-

737
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,716
Oh, Ethan.

738
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,319
I'm not rich. I'm just-

739
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:54,495
Well, then I'll support us both.

740
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:59,973
You're nuts, you know that? You're
so sweet, but you're out of your mind.

741
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,013
Over you.

742
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,776
What a touching scene.

743
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:50,634
Round and round they go
Where they stop

744
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:04,211
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

745
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,011
Where is she?

746
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,092
Jesus.

747
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,959
Who are you?

748
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,200
I am Selena.

749
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,278
Diadanus of Catania,
priestess of Sechnid.

750
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,948
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor...

751
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:37,309
...and you, little lady, are trespassing
on private property.

752
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,374
She means him.

753
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,857
I am Kara of Argo City...

754
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,409
...daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

755
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,855
And I don't scare easily.

756
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,671
- No?
- No.

757
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,956
Try...

758
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,919
...this.

759
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,936
This lady is improving by
leaps and bounds, I gotta tell you.

760
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,888
You okay?

761
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,899
No.

762
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,174
You want a hacksaw or something?

763
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,072
Now I am really upset.

764
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,977
What's going on?

765
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,217
Put me down.

766
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,819
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

767
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:11,050
Safe? Where's Linda?

768
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,337
Put me down.

769
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,699
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

770
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,228
Ethan.

771
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,516
Very clever. That ought to keep her
out of your hair for a few hours.

772
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,111
"Clever"? A cheap trick.

773
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:47,374
Power of Shadow
Bring him to me

774
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:57,652
Bring him to me

775
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,628
Didn't work, huh?
Maybe they're too far away.

776
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,479
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy...

777
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,031
...but I still can't control men's minds.

778
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,073
Not with her around.

779
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,556
So maybe-
Now, don't go through the roof.

780
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,551
But maybe we ought to back down
and give old you-know-who a call.

781
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,548
You know. "Who. "

782
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,398
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

783
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,898
- I shall pretend you didn't say that.
- But I did.

784
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,854
All I'm thinking, and forgive me
for thinking of out of turn here...

785
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,620
...is that he's been around.

786
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,697
He knows things we don't.

787
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,498
Plus, the way you wrap him around
your little finger, I'm always amazed.

788
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,476
- What's in it for me?
- Me.

789
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,834
My dear Nigel...

790
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,595
...the way to a woman's heart
is through the elimination of her rivals.

791
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,516
- Murder. Are you proposing that-?
- Certainly not.

792
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,076
Leave that to me.
You deliver the goods.

793
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,510
- Her.
- Her? How?

794
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,677
By getting me him.

795
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,678
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

796
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,158
- Follow any of this, I mean.
- Put that down.

797
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,016
Nigel, I want one thing:

798
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,814
Time to master my new toy.

799
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,136
So we can rule the world?

800
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:07,250
And you want him here,
Johnny Appleseed, in your living room?

801
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,332
Yes, in the flesh.

802
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,896
So she'll follow? No other reason?

803
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,537
- None.
- You're sure of that?

804
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,399
I'm sorry. The little spider got out.

805
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,239
What?

806
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,718
Where am I?

807
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,174
- Who are you?
- Kara.

808
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,655
Kara?

809
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,777
- What happened?
- You got hit on the head by a coconut.

810
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,249
What's with the Halloween costume?

811
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,639
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

812
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,072
- What do you mean?
- Look, I have to go now.

813
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,676
I will come back for you later, I promise.
I've gotta get to the amusement park.

814
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,559
Amusement park?
Linda.

815
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,979
I gotta find Linda. She was in trouble.

816
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:06,616
Oh, Linda's all right.
She can take care of herself.

817
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:10,290
No, no, no, she can't. Something's
wrong. She's in big trouble and I love her.

818
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,858
I love her.

819
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,293
Yeah, I do love her.

820
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,815
- I have to go, Ethan. Goodbye.
- Yes, so do I.

821
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,058
Hey.

822
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,454
I told you Linda
can take care of herself.

823
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,338
You just flew over my head.
I saw you.

824
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,617
- I'll go back and take care of everything.
- You just flew over my head, true?

825
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,373
True.

826
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,698
- Like Superman.
- He's my cousin.

827
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,269
- He's your cousin?
- Yes. I shouldn't be telling you this. I'm-

828
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,313
Wait. You can do the whole number?
Leap tall buildings in a single bound?

829
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,835
- And look right through things?
- Yes.

830
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,874
- Bend steel bars?
- Yes.

831
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,354
Oh, Selena. I have to go.
Selena has the omegahedron.

832
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,120
Wait, take me with you.
I have to find Linda.

833
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,719
- What is it?
- The Burundi Wand.

834
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,917
Pure unadulterated evil.

835
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,692
Ready?

836
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,517
But how can you love her?
You don't even know her.

837
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,874
Oh, yeah, I do.

838
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,789
If she's in trouble then I got no
business standing here talking with you.

839
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,632
- Even if you are what you say you are.
- Linda is not in trouble.

840
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,559
Look, don't make me get rough, okay?

841
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,354
You wouldn't stand a chance.

842
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,057
Please trust me.

843
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,615
Linda is all right.

844
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,852
How do you know?

845
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,137
I just-

846
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,419
Know.

847
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,498
Linda.

848
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,915
Oh, my God.
How did you do that?

849
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,639
Ethan.

850
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,373
Ethan.

851
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,379
Nigel, you are wonderful.

852
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,492
Pure genius.

853
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,929
You deserve me.

854
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,814
Something else.

855
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,758
Now, let's get out of this dump.

856
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,431
Hey, what's the matter?
Catching flies?

857
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,030
Lucy, look.

858
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,796
One minute that,
and the next minute this.

859
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,797
What is it?

860
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,549
It's a mountain, Lucy. Isn't it?

861
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,354
- Tell me I'm not seeing things.
- How did it get there, Jimmy?

862
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,572
I don't know.
It just appeared.

863
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:13,135
How can a mountain just appear?

864
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,450
Hey, there's something at the top.

865
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,576
- Looks like a castle.
- It's more like a fortress.

866
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,298
Ethan?

867
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,212
Ethan.

868
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,778
Ethan.

869
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:22,436
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl.

870
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,999
Forever and ever.

871
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,310
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

872
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,695
Ethan!

873
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,058
Where am I?

874
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:32,054
You can't arrest me
without a warrant.

875
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,709
Slow down.

876
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,472
We want Selena out!

877
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:50,789
Smile, lunkhead. You're not a gardener
anymore. You're Prince Ethan now.

878
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,079
- Are we gonna stand up to her or not?
- Yeah!

879
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,832
Selena must go!

880
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,718
Who's this little twerpette?

881
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,399
She's someone who believes in freedom.

882
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,596
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

883
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,797
I don't know who you think you are,
or what evil force you represent.

884
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,997
But if you think you can just get rid
of anybody who stands up to you...

885
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,378
...just make them disappear,
like my friend Linda...

886
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,037
- Who?
- Linda, my roommate.

887
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,475
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

888
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,773
- The wimp.
- The wimp.

889
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:23,775
Seize them.

890
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,612
Drive off.

891
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:33,212
- Let me go!
- Nobody messes with Jimmy Olsen!

892
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:36,417
Now, let go of me. I'm with the press!

893
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,738
- Zaltar.
- Squirt?

894
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,278
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

895
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,737
- Zaltar, it's me. It's Kara.
- I know.

896
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,092
Squirt?

897
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,278
What is that?

898
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,192
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

899
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:27,039
- The Phantom Zone?
- It's lonely here, my Kara.

900
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,531
So sad.

901
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:36,653
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

902
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,978
- Ethan?
- Yes, my darling.

903
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:43,819
Don't call me your "darling. "
You despise me.

904
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,198
- Get me the Coffer of Shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

905
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:54,896
I think we need something...

906
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,219
...there.

907
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,489
Oh, Jimmy.

908
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:09,170
Oh, terrific.
The old dangling-in-a-cage routine.

909
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,974
Pathetic, Selena.

910
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,818
- Who is that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

911
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,214
What are they for?

912
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,609
Insurance.

913
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,492
But you can't just give up.

914
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:30,652
- You founded a whole city.
- I did.

915
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:34,449
And then I doomed it to destruction.
That was an error. A tragic one.

916
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,518
When you're my age and you make
as many tragic errors as I do...

917
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:41,035
...it is a different tune
that you will sing.

918
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,631
I will not. I will never give up.

919
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,554
I will never spend my entire life
in a place like this. I would die first!

920
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:52,595
Strong words. There are worse things
than dying and I deserve every one.

921
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,274
- What is this?
- A horse.

922
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,729
I think.

923
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:18,652
On Earth, I think it's called a horse.

924
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:22,134
And you made this here?

925
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,974
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

926
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:31,179
Earth, Zaltar, Earth. A tree, a horse.
You keep making things from Earth.

927
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,171
- The place intrigues me.
- Then let's go there.

928
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,932
Certainly. When is the next train?

929
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,396
What is a train?

930
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:44,712
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

931
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:51,157
I'm only laughing at myself.
For you, I weep.

932
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:56,951
- Is this train a way out of here?
- There is no way out of here.

933
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,993
That is the point of the Phantom Zone.

934
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,192
My neighbors now: The criminals,
the corrupt, the evil.

935
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,632
They're here, over the hill there,
with no way out.

936
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:12,091
But there's always a way out.

937
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:15,657
If there's a way in,
there's a way out.

938
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,374
There is a way.

939
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:23,375
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

940
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,256
No. It wouldn't work.

941
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,213
You'll be swept into a singularity
if it didn't work. No.

942
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,248
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

943
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,999
I could do it.

944
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:46,468
- Then please, at least teach me how.
- There's nothing to teach.

945
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:51,879
You can't, as they say, practice
at the rift. You get one chance.

946
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,851
- The rift.
- Sure you won't have a squirt?

947
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:59,336
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

948
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,179
You're right.

949
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:11,010
You are absolutely right.

950
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,257
There is enough doom and gloom
in the air already.

951
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,532
And it is better to accept defeat
than to take a chance...

952
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:23,613
...and try like fools to redeem ourselves,
save our city and those we love there...

953
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,340
...plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress...

954
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:30,095
...is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers.

955
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,111
We could die trying.

956
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,192
We won't.

957
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,039
We won't. Come on.

958
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,778
Tomorrow...

959
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:14,699
...Thursday, Friday.

960
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,169
Just like here,
we go for the cops first, right?

961
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,312
And the Army.

962
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:24,395
By Saturday, we have the continental
United States, Mexico, Canada.

963
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,470
Oh, my God, Selena. It's the box.

964
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,069
- Hush it up.
- No.

965
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:38,489
What the box wants, the box gets.

966
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,099
What is it?

967
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,432
Fascinating.

968
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,592
I don't know.

969
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,589
Is this it? Is this the way out?

970
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,072
Not yet. This is the Quantum Vortex.

971
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,797
We must risk our destruction in it.

972
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,039
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

973
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,236
Zaltar, I'm scared.

974
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:23,300
Accept your fears.

975
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:29,450
Confront your demons.
Find your destiny in the maelstrom.

976
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,077
Zaltar, I can't. I can't.

977
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,999
You...

978
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,275
...can.

979
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,835
Two specks. Look.

980
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:01,136
What do I do?

981
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:04,896
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

982
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:12,973
- She's with some old guy, it looks like.
- Move, huh?

983
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:16,729
- Come on.
- Calm down, okay?

984
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:21,690
This is what I want.

985
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,772
The Salian Fireballs.

986
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:29,214
Page 321, chapter six.

987
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,173
What's that?

988
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,133
"Power of rainmaking. " No!

989
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:26,019
"How to separate husband and wife. "
No. Not now, not now.

990
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:29,616
Well, you better find something fast,
like an atom bomb.

991
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,192
I found it.

992
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,915
Summoning the Demon storm.

993
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:53,572
We go higher, girl!

994
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:56,248
- Higher!
- Come with me.

995
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,594
I am with you. On, girl!

996
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,714
I am with you.

997
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,353
Zaltar!

998
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,593
Oh, thank God.

999
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,917
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1000
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,155
Hardly.

1001
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:29,575
One false step, bluebird,
and even if you don't...

1002
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:32,174
...your friends will get the point.

1003
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,255
Hey, no!

1004
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,294
I don't like this.

1005
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,968
Don't worry, Lucy. Don't worry.

1006
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:54,051
- I wouldn't, if I were you.
- Well, you're not me.

1007
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:05,289
Quick, get out of the way!
Into the alcove over there.

1008
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:08,578
- Come on.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1009
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:16,119
The omegahedron, Selena. I want it.

1010
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:21,997
Well, then, Supergirl,
you shall have it.

1011
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,854
Supergirl, above you. Look out!

1012
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,836
I think I'll be going,
if you'll excuse me.

1013
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,439
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1014
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:51,054
You have no friends, Selena.

1015
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:54,696
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth to serve you.

1016
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:58,653
More or less, I think they were.

1017
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:01,090
You included.

1018
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:10,813
Power of Shadow
Appear

1019
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,354
Power of Shadow

1020
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:36,980
Destroy her

1021
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,752
I can't.

1022
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,471
I can't.

1023
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:41,672
You can.

1024
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,240
On, girl.

1025
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,094
Confront her with it.
It's the only way!

1026
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,630
I have to go. I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1027
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,432
And I must ask you all something.

1028
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,200
It's all right, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1029
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:43,612
- We never even heard of you.
- Thank you.

1030
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:46,256
Ethan. Linda, she-

1031
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,891
She had to leave in a hurry but she-

1032
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,255
You don't have to say a word.

1033
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:52,973
I know.

1034
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,035
I'll explain about Linda.

1035
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:04,157
Thank you, Ethan.

1036
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,393
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1037
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:33,216
That was some kiss.

1038
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,091
Goodbye, Linda.
