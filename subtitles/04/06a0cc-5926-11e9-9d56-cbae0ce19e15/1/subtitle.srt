00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,004
All that good stuff.
That's very considerate.

177
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,127
Thank you.

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,167
And that's me.

179
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,083
There you are. Gordo.

180
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,046
Oh, and...

181
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,244
Here you go. Yeah.
What is it? Glass cleaner?

182
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,640
For cleaning glass.
Right.

183
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,171
I saw how much you had.
Yeah.

184
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,604
There you go.
Thank you.

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,926
Welcome.

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,286
Very sweet of you.
Thanks, Gordo.

187
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,926
I gotta say,
I really, I love this house.

188
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,891
You do? Huh.
Wow.

189
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,087
Yeah, I really like
this style of architecture.

190
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,968
Well, you should come in
and take the tour then.

191
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,570
I'm sure Simon
will be back soon.

192
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,926
Come on in.
Oh, all right.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,411
Yeah. Come on in.
Sure?

194
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,448
Yeah. It's fine.
Okay.

195
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,287
He's so excited not to be
cooped up in a condo anymore.

196
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,807
That's the laundry
room slash Jangles' room.

197
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,286
Down there
is some storage.

198
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,849
That is going to
be Simon's office.

199
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,047
Bedroom, or studio
for me, I'm hoping.

200
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,208
And in here is the...

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,845
Oh, yeah. I was just
sorting all that stuff out.

202
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,607
Hmm.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,366
Yeah, I know. It was a gift
and then it turned out that

204
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,324
Simon has a phobia of monkeys
from when he was a kid.

205
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,162
He's like, terrified. I have
to get rid of it. You want it?

206
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,371
Do you have a baby?

207
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,365
No. No.

208
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,845
Just the dog, for now.
Mr. Bojangles, after the song.

209
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,244
I'm going to move that stuff around
the back there and then plant

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,086
and, I don't know, maybe fill
a pond here up with fish,

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,965
since it's just sitting there, and yeah...
(TIMER RINGING)

212
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,883
I mean that's
pretty much it.

213
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,887
It's going to come up looking real nice.
It's already great.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,081
Thank you.

215
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,521
I should go
and check on that.

216
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,285
In fact,
there's plenty of food.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,050
I'm not that
great a cook,

218
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,326
but why don't I
check in with Simon,

219
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,601
and maybe we can
all eat together?

220
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,926
Oh, I don't want to...

221
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,371
Yeah.

222
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,885
Hey, it's me.

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,445
I'm cooking, believe it or
not, and we have a guest.

224
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,931
Call me.

225
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,961
Well. Good.

226
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,050
You know, I often think about
this person from school

227
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,849
and that person from school.
Yeah?

228
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,446
About what are they up to, what
are they doing, and I often...

229
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,924
But I always
knew that Simon

230
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,166
would be one of
those people

231
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,846
who would make
something of himself.

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,561
You have. Clearly,
you have. And you did.

233
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,405
I mean,
I'm very happy for you.

234
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,930
Thank you. I am. I'm
very happy for you.

235
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,446
Want a little more?

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,726
Oh, please.

237
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,481
No problem.

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,367
GORDO: So you never see
anybody from high school?

239
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,329
What about Greg?
Greg Pierson.

240
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,530
No, I really, I haven't talked to
anybody since the day we graduated.

241
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,170
You want more pasta?

242
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,605
Oh, no, I'm fine.
You sure?

243
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,091
You were such
good friends.

244
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,321
Not sure he needs
any more of that.

245
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,441
Really?
Yeah.

246
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,561
Okay-

247
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,004
So, Simon, Robyn says that
you work in security systems.

248
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,802
Yeah, security for
large corporations.

249
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,731
Like in, you know,
information protection.

250
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,131
Yeah. Complicated stuff.

251
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,924
Complicated? Yeah,
but I only sell it.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,604
I don't know how to use it.
(GORDO CHUCKLES)

253
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,682
We're developing more
and more for personal use,

254
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,768
not just
the corporate sector.

255
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,929
Kind of widening out.

256
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,560
And what do you
think about this

257
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,449
whole government
thing of, you know,

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,363
listening in to people's
private information?

259
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,324
I mean, that's crazy stuff.
SIMON: Who knows?

260
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,568
I mean, fuck them,
you know?

261
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,202
An eye for an eye, I say.

262
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,167
Yeah.

263
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,607
Anyway, this is a conversation for
another time. SIMON: Mmm-hmm.

264
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,485
But speaking of government,

265
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,690
did you know that
Simon was class president?

266
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,570
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

267
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,926
Mr. President.

268
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,446
Please, people
will think he's...

269
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,162
He had a very organized
campaign, "Simon Says."

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,481
Like the children's game.

271
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,562
Well, his campaign
was based around the game,

272
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,684
so Simon says,
and it would happen.

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,608
"I will make it happen." Simon
says, "More time for sports."

274
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,682
Simon says, "More
choice in the cafeteria."

275
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,000
And it happens.

276
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,605
She gets it.
You got it, right?

277
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,923
So is it, do you have,
like, a poster?

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,809
Posters. Leaflets.

279
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,041
Buttons.
Buttons?

280
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,286
Parades...

281
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,206
Simon says,
"New job." Right?

282
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,281
Simon says, "Beautiful
wife and a new home.".

283
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,806
Well, see? Should have
no problems starting a family.

284
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,848
Because Simon says.

285
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,803
My God, I had
one too many wines.

286
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,729
I just talk way too much then.
No.

287
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,444
No.
No, I talked too much.

288
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,360
What's happened to you since high school?
Everything good?

289
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,406
Military.

290
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,126
Yeah.
SIMON: Really?

291
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,483
Yeah, it's true. Military,
straight outofschooi

292
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,281
Two tours, and then
I got out of there,

293
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,051
and just ended up
doing a lot of things.

294
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,688
But, I mean, a whole lot has happened
to me since we last saw each other.

295
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,128
Some good, some bad, like life.
You know, mostly good.

296
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,283
But, you know, I believe
that a lot of the good

297
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,006
could come from the bad, you know?
I hear you.

298
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,321
If you put the right
faith behind it, you know?

299
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,250
Not to bring
religion into it, God,

300
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,847
but just to say that the bad
things, they can be a gift.

301
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,362
Absolutely. And that's just
the way I like to see things.

302
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,771
Yeah, that's good.

303
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,769
Hey, I'm very
happy for you.

304
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,404
Thank you very much.

305
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,850
I am. Very, very,
very happy for you and...

306
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,762
So I'd like
to make a toast.

307
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,485
Simon says a toast.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

308
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,570
Gordo says a toast.
Gordo says a toast.

309
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,847
To old friends and...

310
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,883
New ones.
New friends.

311
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,361
Thank you.

312
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,410
Are you okay?

313
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,371
Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I was just thinking.

314
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,721
You know, it's so amazing
how some people change

315
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,770
so much after high school and
some just stay exactly the same.

316
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,491
You know what I mean?
I feel kind of bad for him.

317
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Did he seem right to you?
That guy is odd.

318
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,249
He is a little
socially awkward,

319
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,766
but, I mean,
I can be that way.

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,651
I think that
guy's delusional.

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,088
He thinks we're friends.

322
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,287
The whole thing just has me
very uncomfortable, but...

323
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,686
Okay-

324
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,046
It was just one
dinner and it's over.

325
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,645
No one's saying you
have to do it again.

326
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
I just feel bad.
Yeah.

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,685
Can I have that
sponge, please?

328
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,884
Aren't you
forgetting something?

329
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,205
Simon says.

330
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,161
(LAUGHS)

331
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,006
No.

332
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,801
...introduce you to some
of the members of the team.

333
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,962
You might recognize your new bosses.
SIMON: Hi.

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,530
They wanted to be here
to welcome you in person,

335
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,842
but they are in Tokyo
looking to expand the empire.

336
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,331
Danny!
How are you?

337
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,925
Simon, this is Danny McDonald.
Hello.

338
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,007
Hi.
He runs Legal.

339
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,684
Simon. This is
my wife, Robyn.

340
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,489
Robyn, hi.
And his lovely wife, Gina.

341
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,131
It's Janine, actually,
but she'll answer to anything.

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,281
Great.

343
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,731
Guys, let me bring you
through to meet my wife.

344
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,966
Nice to meet you guys.
Good to see you, Danny.

345
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,281
Hey, so this... Guys, this is my wife.
Duffy. Hi.

346
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,600
Hi. I've heard
so much about you.

347
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Hi there,
Duffy, my wife, Robyn.

348
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,320
Hello, Robyn.
Hello, you're so pretty.

349
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,801
Hi, there. And this is,
of course, Wendy Dale.

350
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,008
She's spearheading
Mergers and Acquisitions.

351
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,003
Can I grab two
of those? Here.

352
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,290
Let's kick this party off with a
toast here to welcome the new blood.

353
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,881
I don't actually... She's the
designated driver, so...

354
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,371
I'm so sorry. I'll take it.
Two for me.

355
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,329
Or you can take it.
There we go.

356
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,084
What do you do, Robyn?

357
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,282
She's a brilliant
designer, right?

358
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,169
Tell them. Brag.
Brag a little bit.

359
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,844
She's very, very good.

360
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,686
No, I freelance a little
for consulting firms.

361
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,410
She's being modest.

362
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,323
She was running
a big firm in Chicago,

363
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,249
which is happening
online for the moment,

364
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,722
and she's designing the interiors of
the home we just moved into right now.

365
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,643
That's a big job. Yeah.
Great. Great.

366
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,929
We're also very busy working
on trying to start a family,

367
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,241
and that takes a lot of time.
WOMAN: Oh.

368
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,481
MAN: Congratulations.
Yeah.

369
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,161
Oh.

370
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,610
What do you think?

371
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,364
Very nice.
Isn't it?

372
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,169
Yeah.
You should see upstairs.

373
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,123
You should see Kevin's
office. That's nice.

374
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,123
Uh-huh. But this is,
it's pretty great.

375
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,081
Yeah. Here they are.

376
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,807
I cannot believe these
guys are your bosses.

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,924
You are my boss, honey.
Let's be clear.

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,561
These guys just run the billion
dollar company I work for.

379
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,406
You know they've been multimillionaires
since they were teenagers? Mmm-hmm.

380
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,720
Crazy.

381
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,643
Yeah, once upon a time, the
crusty old men ran the companies

382
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,404
and the teenagers
were down in the mail room.

383
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,323
And now it's
the total opposite.

384
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,571
But I'm going to make it
upstairs before I'm too old,

385
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,483
as long as Kevin
sticks to his plan

386
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,449
of moving on at
the end of the year.

387
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,888
Then I get a little bit of consulting
expertise from you, I'll be all set.

388
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,527
Keep growing the beard. Start
wearing sneakers to work.

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,888
Maybe get a tattoo.
Yeah.

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,570
All good ideas.

391
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,003
I'd look good in
those glasses, I think.

392
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,681
Hey, do you really not
want me to go back to work?

393
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,604
Are you still worried?
That's not what I said.

394
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,761
No?
No.

395
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,649
You know, we moved
to the suburbs and...

396
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,524
Yeah. For a fresh start.

397
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,207
Honey, I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

398
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,171
As long as you
stay healthy,

399
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,642
you can open an office in every
major city in the world.

400
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,566
I want you to start rebuilding the
business. You know, what do I care?

401
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,604
I just don't want you
to be stressed, honey,

402
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,047
because that's when those
other things can happen. Yeah?

403
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,770
Especially if you really
want to start a family.

404
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,405
ROBYN: Okay.

405
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,688
SIMON: Did it sound that bad?
ROBYN: No.

406
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,804
No, I'm just being silly.

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,041
Let's get back to the party.

408
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,241
SIMON: Okay.

409
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,971
SIMON: They're charming.
Right? Yeah.

410
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,328
And they'll probably have good
dirtyjokes every once in a while.

411
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,970
What have we got?

412
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,241
Here.

413
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,450
Uh-oh. "Thanks for
a lovely dinner.

414
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,891
"Return the favor."
No.

415
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,644
"Hope you don't mind."

416
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,446
Smiley face.

417
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,931
Fish food.

418
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,001
(CHUCKLES)

419
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,967
Oh.

420
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,647
Oh, no.

421
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,606
Well, we have to
thank him this time.

422
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,209
For what? Coming onto
our property without asking?

423
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,169
No. This is
not troubling to you?

424
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,760
I really don't think that he
meant it to be troubling.

425
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,161
He wouldn't see it
like that, he just...

426
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,011
He just thinks he's
giving us some fish.

427
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,682
You know, they used to
call him Weirdo in school.

428
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,282
Gordo the Weirdo.

429
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
That's not very nice.

430
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,164
Everybody had a name.

431
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,724
I was Simple Simon.

432
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,569
Yeah. Kids.

433
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,810
Kids are mean.

434
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,485
Kids are honest.

435
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,403
Why do you get
a name like Weirdo?

436
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,041
Hmm?

437
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,522
Well, I think that
he's misunderstood.

438
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,925
Maybe.
Mmm.

439
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,287
It's not ourjob to
figure out what he is.

440
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,486
Sure.

441
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,006
I can tell you
he's a reverse thief.

442
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,811
Breaking in to give us something?
It's not very bright.

443
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,081
Right. Mmm-hmm.

444
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,645
I hope his next gift is a
sushi knife for those fish.

445
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,921
(LAUGHS)

446
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,089
You got a new friend.

447
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,121
Ha-ha.

448
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,009
Someone's got a buddy.

449
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,081
Mmm-hmm.

450
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,561
(SIGHS)

451
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,523
(JANGLES BARKING)

452
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,487
Hi. I was in the area.
I was wondering, is... Oh.

453
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,926
Hey-

454
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,890
ls Simon home?

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,051
No. He's at work. Yeah.

456
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,164
I wanted to
call you, actually,

457
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,930
to say thank you
for what you did.

458
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,289
The fish are beautiful. Really beautiful.
Thank you.

459
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,286
Well, ask and thou shall
receive, huh, Mr. Bojangles?

460
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,445
You know, most people think that
Sammy Davis Jr. or Nina Simone

461
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,841
wrote Mr. Bojangles, but it's
actually written by a guy

462
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,402
called Jerry Jeff Walker who
hardly anybody knows about.

463
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,491
Really?
Yeah.

464
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,366
Did not know that.

465
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,085
My dad named
him, actually.

466
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,251
Well.
Yeah.

467
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,441
I was just about to make a pot of tea.
Do you drink tea?

468
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,285
Yeah.
Well, come in.

469
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,566
You can leave
a note for Simon.

470
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,886
Okay-

471
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,410
I guess I speak to
some girls from high school,

472
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,891
the ones I was closest to.

473
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,009
Most of them, most of them
have children now.

474
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,927
Yep, that ought to do it.

475
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,330
Right, let's see.

476
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,848
MAN: <i>Forty percent less
than the big-box guys! Hey.</i>

477
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,769
<i>Choose your favorite way
to save even more...</i>

478
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,763
Simon's going to
love you for this.

479
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,208
<i>...save 25% in finance,
interest free for 24 months,</i>

480
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,051
<i>or save 20% in financing,
interest free for 36 months.</i>

481
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,805
What do you usually
watch at this hour?

482
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,324
(LAUGHS) Oh, nothing.
I should be working.

483
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,922
Like, really, I should
get back to work.

484
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,162
Oh, of course. Sorry.

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,688
Thank you though.
Really, so much for this.

486
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,007
It's a pleasure. You know,
they really make it seem,

487
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,129
you know, far more complicated
than it really should be.

488
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
Hey, leave that.
I will do it.

489
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,403
No, it's fine, really. Really.
You've already done too much.

490
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,811
Where do these live?

491
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,251
In the drawer
under the microwave.

492
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,927
Oh.

493
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,287
And the trash goes...

494
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,684
Trash goes outside.

495
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,571
Normally, friendships
grow organically.

496
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,681
And if they don't
serve both parties,

497
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,127
they just kind of
organically dissipate.

498
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,328
Yeah, that'd be great.
(ALL LAUGHING)

499
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,449
What you're talking about is,
you know, an asymmetric thing.

500
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,329
A one-sided friendship?

501
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,928
I mean, essentially you're
being forced into a breakup.

502
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,690
Yeah.
No. No.

503
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,491
Although no, no, no. To be fair, this
guy actually sounds like an asset,

504
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,045
so I think you should
let him finish the house

505
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,885
and finish the garden and then
you cut the fucking guy loose.

506
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,327
You know what, I actually
think he's nice.

507
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,044
And he's been
very generous.

508
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,491
So then he saw the thing
that you wrote and then, what?

509
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,608
Yeah. So get
this for confusing.

510
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,769
After he'd supposedly been offended
by what I wrote on the board,

511
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,251
he calls us a few
hours later on the phone

512
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,691
and he invites us
to a dinner party.

513
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,330
At his house.
RON: Alone?

514
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,811
No. With another couple.

515
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,042
Well, surely you're not going
to accept the invitation.

516
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,363
After the whole insult thing, I'm
surprised he wants you around at all.

517
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,568
Unless he wants to chop
you guys up with an axe.

518
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,325
Yeah. Maybe he didn't
see what you wrote.

519
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,129
No, I'm pretty sure
that he did.

520
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,924
Maybe he doesn't care.

521
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,447
Or he cares more about...

522
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,046
To not worry about it.

523
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,361
In this guy's defense,
she is way too nice, right?

524

You two know that.

I love you for it,
but you know.

527
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,809
You could just
politely decline,

528
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,729
and then not offer
another alternative.

529
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,649
But he would offer
an alternative, you know?

530
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,525
He'll keep coming around
and around and around, so...

531
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,207
So basically, eventually, you two
need to have a conversation.

532
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,328
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I'm considering it.

I think you guys
should be careful.

534
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,090
Yeah.
I wouldn't accept.

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,243
And we have a couple of beautiful
children, and she's taken both of them.

691
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,403
And I don't really mention it
because it makes me very upset

692
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,329
and I don't really know
what's going to happen.

693
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,051
And obviously I really
want to make it work

694
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,766
and I don't really
know what the chances are.

695
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,762
And, technically,
this is her home,

696
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,527
her family home,
so it's their money.

697
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,361
And at the moment,
she holds all the cards

698
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,331
so when she says jump,
lhaveto“.

699
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,761
Jump.

700
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,041
Jump. Um...

701
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,083
Which is why I went out there
to speak to her on the phone,

702
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,481
because I didn't
want you both

703
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,882
to hear the conversation
which gets a little heated.

704
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,364
And just
listening to me speak,

705
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,283
I feel very
embarrassed right now.

706
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,282
Well, don't be embarrassed.

Hmm.

773

So they knew him.

00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,610
Well, the husband
did, Mr. Ryan.

775
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,842
He has a fleet of
limousines and cars

776
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,651
for an executive transport service
business type thing or what not,

777
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,609
and he leased
a car to Mr. Mosley.

778
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,286
Now Mr. Ryan says
that Mr. Mosley

779
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,926
actually had
access to his garage

780
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,571
so that he could pick up
and return a Cadillac,

781
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,406
which is probably how he gained
access to the main house,

782
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,926
and why he knew the Ryans
were on vacation in CancUn.

783
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,964
But I assume he won't be
working as a driver anymore.

charges if they wanted.

Um, the dog is what
I'm concerned with.

786
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,204
Yeah, it really could just be that
it's a new neighborhood for him

787
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,845
and we did leave the gate open.
No. No.

the fish then, honey?

Pretty sure he took the dog.

790
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,049
Well, you know,
that's a tricky one

791
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,930
because I can go there and see
him, but that's not the problem.

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,241
You know where he lives?
We can find that out.

793
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,603
But the problem is,
I just can't go there

794
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,643
and look inside
without a warrant.

795
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,802

I need proof of some kind,

which neither of us have.
Well...

with that awkward task

798
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,326
of paying him a visit and
asking, "Did you take the dog?"

799
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,529
and asking him did he
take the dog means that,

to know who sent me.

01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,960
Hi.

1032
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,486
How'd it go?
Good.

1033
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,410
Good.

1034
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,244
My mom get off okay?

1035
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,481
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1036
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,491
Great.

1037
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,161
You hungry?

1038
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,163
Sure. I'll be in
in a minute.

01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,240

you just ask him?

1052
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,009
Okay, so you can't
talk to your husband.

1053
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,370
What are you going to do?

1054
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,885
I want to find
this Greg guy.

1055
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,850
Simon's sister said
he was involved somehow.

1056
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,725
Right.

1057
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,762
Well, maybe you should do
some checking of your own.

1059

Yes.
Ah.

1061
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,610
Right this way.

1062
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,002
Okay. Just relax.

1063
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,002
Uh, I'm sorry.

1064
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,569
I think that you know my
husband, Simon Callem.

1065
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,601
Yeah.

1066
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,690
I came here today 'cause I need to
talk to you about a Gordon Mosley.

1067
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,727
"Simon, just after
all these years,

1068
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,564
"I really was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1069
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,802
"I had nothing but
good intentions."

1070
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,804
And then there are these.
It's from the Bible.

1071
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,726
"Behold he who conceives mischief
and brings forth falsehood.

1072

"and has fallen into
the hole which he made."

1074
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,201
I...

1075
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,250
Look, I think
he wants to hurt us

1076
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,051
for something that
happened back then,

1077
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,285
and I'm just trying to
find out what it was.

1078
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,362
Simon's sister told
me that you and him

1079
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,642
stopped Gordo
from being molested.

1080
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,131
If you were helping him,

1081
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,686
why would he want
to hurt us?

1082
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,330
He wasn't being molested.

1083
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,481
God, this is crazy.

1084
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,164
What do you mean,
he wasn't being molested?

1085
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,846
She told me that he was
found in a car with a...

1086
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,251
I'm sorry, you're
just going to have

1087
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,600
to talk to your
husband about all this.

Ihavetﬂed.

1089
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,766
Please.

1090
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,483
Look, can you
answer me one question?

1091
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,802
The other person in the car
with Gordo, was it Simon?

1092
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,761
What?

1093
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,926
No, it's...

1094
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,366
No.

1095
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,089
Look, I've made
peace with this.

1096
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,721
With Gordo, with what
happened to him, what we did.

1097
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,246
Wait, what you did? But then you
admit that something happened?

1098
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,921
With what you did. No, it was nothing.
I mean, he...

1099
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,088
Look, it was nothing, and then
it kind of became something.

1100
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,730
I'm sorry, but you're not
making very much sense.

1101
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,611
I'm just asking you to tell me...
It was all a lie.

1102
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,121
What was a lie?

1103
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,366
The whole thing.

1104
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,487
The whole story. Not one
part of it was true.

1105
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,287
Simon made
the whole thing up

1106
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,731
about Gordo being
with a guy in a car.

1107
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,809
About him being gay.

1108
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,487
But why? Why would he do that?

1109
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,649
'Cause he could.

1110
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,404
Simon was a bully.

1111
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,724
He had a real mean streak,
and Gordo was a target.

1112
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,609
One of the weak kids.

1113
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,650
He made this whole thing up, and
it basically ruined Gordo's life.

1114
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,969
I mean, it's amazing
how an idea can take a hold

1115
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,207
and really
bring a person down.

1116
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,322
Look, we were just kids.

1117
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,770
We didn't realize how crazy
this whole thing would get,

1118
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,081
but we did have
a chance to stop it.

1119
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,686
Simon could have told the
truth, but he didn't.

1120
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,361
I mean, the bullying,
the kids beating on him,

1121
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,571
and stuff like... I mean, what
happened with Gordo and his dad.

1122
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,365
I don't know what
that does to a person.

1123
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,691
What happened with
Gordo and his dad?

1124
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,320
(INDISTINCT TALK)

1125
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,765
We've really got
a process going.

1126
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,245
They shouldn't get
the impression that I'm...

1127
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,367
Hey, Robyn.

1128
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,646
...and let them
think that I'm...

1129
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,721
Hey, honey.

1130
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,491
You know, I'm passionate
about the job and...

1131
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,721
Yes, I already
did that for you.

1132
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,808
The decision's coming
down Monday, all right?

1133
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,201
I've already given
my recommendations

1134
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,600
and I don't think
you have anything

1135
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,960
to worry about,
to be honest with you.

1136
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,168
Didn't you mention
that there was another guy?

1137
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,810
A Danny someone?

1138
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,609
Danny McDonald.
Did you hear?

1139
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,523
Yes, no, something
went down, man.

1140
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,606
SIMON: Oh, really? KEVIN: Yeah.
The guy's being investigated.

1141
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,126
Listen, it's late. Why don't we pick
this up first thing in the morning?

1142
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,851
I've kept you here long enough.
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,490
Absolutely. it is late.

1144
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,847
I gotta get out. Robyn, I'm leaving.
Your husband's kicking me out.

1145
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,001
Hey, want to hit
balls tomorrow?

1146
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,411
Yep.
Yeah?

1147

<i>SIMON: You scurry around
behind my fucking back</i>

1148
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,009
and you dig up some
idiot from my past?

1149
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,650
Just talk to me about it.

1150
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,165
I'm not talking
to you about shit

1151
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,287
because it's garbage.

1152
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,920
Admit that you told a story...
Stop talking.

1153
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,004
...that nearly got someone killed!
Stop.

1154
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,605
His father tried
to kill him.

1155
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,285
Stop! Stop!

1156
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,249
He tried to burn him.
Forget it.

1157
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,291
Simon, what you said
affected people's lives.

1158
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,966
His father was arrested
for attempted murder.

1159
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,367
No, his dad knocked
him around a little,

1160
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,363
and now it's
25 years later

1161
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,001
and the story's been blown
out of proportion. That's all.

1162
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,806
So you do know.

1163
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,208
Holy shit. I'm an
asshole, Robyn, okay?

1164
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,124
I made his life a living hell
and I treated him like shit.

1165
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,249
Is that what you're trying to figure out?
That I was an asshole?

1166
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,926
I was an asshole, okay?

1167
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,968
My dad was an asshole to me,
treated me like shit.

1168
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,088
But I took it.
lsuckeditup.

1169
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,051
I'm not on my hands and knees
crying about it, praying about it.

1170
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,646
Stuck in the fucking
past about it.

1171
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,568
I moved on. I made
something of my life.

1172
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,166
This world's about
fucking winners and losers,

1173
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,811
and we're all in the same
shitty playground, you know?

1174
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,720
Guess what? That this guy lost
and then he's moaning about it,

1175
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,322
is just him being stuck
because he wants to be stuck

1176
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,324
because he can't get
past the fucking moment.

1177
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,646
He's not going
to pull me back

1178
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,927
and apologize for
something I don't know about,

1179
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,288
that I'm not responsible for,
that I don't care about.

1180
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,330
I don't owe that guy shit.

1181
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,442
You could say you're
sorry for your part of it.

1182
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,727
Fuckthat
People don't apologize

1183
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,086
to everyone all
the time, Robyn.

1184
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,003
That's not
the way the world works.

1185
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,686
Or is that the way it works for you?
Is that what this is about?

1186
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,685
You fantasize about all those girls back
at high school that treated you like shit

1187
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,285
just lining up all
of a sudden saying,

1188
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,682
"Hey, Robyn, we're so sorry
about how we treated you..."

1189
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,006
That's great.

1190
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,645
You're a bully.

1191
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,969
You were then,
and you still are now.

1192
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,009
I'll take
an apology for that.

1193
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,804
Oh, geez, this is not
about an apology!

1194
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,723
Simon, this is
about you and me!

1195
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,731
You have to do this for us, because if
you don't at least try to fix this...

1196
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,564
If you don't...

01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,008
Even if I wanted to, I have no
idea where to find this guy.

1198
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,491
So save it.

1199
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,561
(LAUGHS)

1200
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,209
Oh, yes, you do. You seem
to know a lot of things.

1201
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,489
Those Post-its were
stuck to my car window

1202
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,369
soon after he
sent that letter,

1203
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,161
and they are the reason that I
had that background check done.

1204
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,888
And then had
an attorney contact him

1205
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,170
and get a restraining order.

1206
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,527
I'm sorry. I was
trying to protect you.

1207
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,490
I wanted this to be
my burden, not yours.

1208
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,365
I had no idea to what
extent his father hurt him.

1209
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,051
I'd heard stories, but I did
not know to what extent.

1210
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,726
Funny, when someone
lies to you enough,

1211
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,929
you just stop
believing anything they say.

1212
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,482
'Cause all this time,
I thought that I was crazy,

1213
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,771
and I'm not.

1214
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,010
And you let me.

1215
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,324
And I just realized

1216
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,083
I have no idea
who you really are.

1217
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,566
What can I do to
make it up to you?

1218
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,127
You're asking
the wrong person.

1219
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,681
Our final question
is a bonus round question.

1220
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,482
Which album was famously
introduced as testimony

1221
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,451
in the Tate-LaBianca
homicide cases,

1222
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,684
Los Angeles, in 1969?

1223
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,726
Also referred to as the "what" murders?
The "what" murders?

1224
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,445
Hey-

1225
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,880
Gordo.

1226
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,441
Simon.

1227
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,085
How you doing?

1228
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,848
Long time. I saw you up there.
Wanted to say hello.

1229
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,403
Actually, I tracked
you down, okay?

1230
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,084
I wanted to apologize.

1231
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:53,089
Robyn and I were talking about
things that happened back at school.

1232
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,610
About how I might not
have treated you so well,

1233
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,286
and she wanted me
to bury the hatchet.

1234
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,448
Or as you said,
let bygones be bygones.

1235
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,441
And so...

1236
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,049
So she wanted
you to come.

1238
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,128
No. Listen.

1239
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,490
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't want to be here.

1240
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,723
So I'm here,
and I'm apologizing to you.

1241
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,603
Well?
Well, what?

1242
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,043
You accept my apology?

1243
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,203
You see,
it's too late for that.

1244
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,811
Got it. Okay.

1245
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,080
You know, I was willing.

1246
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,440
Were you, though?

1247
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,602
Yeah. What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

1248
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,365
See, you're done
with the past,

1249
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,082
but the past is
not done with you.

1250
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,525
What? What do you mean by that?

1251
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,005
It's a saying.

1252
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,084
I know it's a saying,
but what do you mean?

1253
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,400
Hey, I asked you a question.

1254

I asked you a question.

late for that.

1262
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,524
It's too late
for you, Gordo.

1263
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,365
Look at you.

1264
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,565
Now I want you
to listen to me.

1265
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,125
I want you to
understand something.

1266
