1
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:08,380
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,140
Close it, quick!

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,179
Could we move along?

4
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,100
Run!

5
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,619
Step away from the door.

6
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,729
We owe you for that.

7
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,019
Just like new.

8
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,699
Drop your weapon.

9
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,619
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

10
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,259
He can handle himself.

11
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,259
Get in back.

12
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,500
Shit.

13
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,420
- Operator.
- Link, where am I?

14
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,019
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,500
- Really?
- Yes, It'll take me a while to get an exit.

16
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:53,969
- Oh Shit!
- What?

17
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,750
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

18
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,140
- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,740
- Operator.
- Get us out of here, Link.

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,540
- That won't be easy, sir.
- I know. We're inside the core network.

21
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,219
Yes, sir. The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,380
- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,140
- Fine, we'll make it.
- Sir, I think I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,460
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

25
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,500
Hold on!

26
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,210
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.

27
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,020
Are you watching this, Link?

28
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,660
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

29
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,540
Any suggestions?

30
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,260
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

31
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,140
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

32
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,900
- Got it.
- Sir, are you sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

33
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,610
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,100
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

35
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,650
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

36
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,900
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

37
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,580
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

38
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,620
Then let us hope...

39
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,100
...that I was wrong.

40
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,540
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

41
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,260
We've been sent to bring you in.

42
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,380
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,460
- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.

44
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,540
Repeat, they're approaching the...

45
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,620
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

46
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,579
Shots fired.

47
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,900
Move!

48
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,460
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

49
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,540
Trinity.

50
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,009
Get him out of here.

51
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,500
Come on!

52
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,259
Crush him.

53
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,490
Morpheus.

54
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,099
He's okay. Keep moving.

55
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,779
Let's go.

56
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,379
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

57
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,779
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

58
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,299
Wait.

59
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,019
Cancel that.

60
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,299
You are handy.

61
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,299
Jump on.

62
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:41,529
She means nothing.

63
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,699
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

64
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,059
One-Adam- 12, please respond.

65
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:54,899
Get down.

66
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,099
Gotcha.

67
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:03,859
She's good.

68
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,259
You are no longer necessary.

69
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:20,209
We do only what we're meant to do.

70
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:25,219
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

71
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,939
Go kick his ass.

72
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,579
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

73
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,699
What is that?

74
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,099
Yes! Yes!

75
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,500
Sir, we have confirmation from the Icarus.

76
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,339
The first two ships
are in position for counterattack.

77
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,569
Good.

78
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,529
Any change?

79
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,339
Looks like, they hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

80
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,500
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

81
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,099
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

82
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,459
Yes, sir.

83
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,899
There is a building.

84
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:56,500
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

85
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,500
...and no stair can reach.

86
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:04,980
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.

87
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,379
Hidden places.

88
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,180
But one door is special.

89
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,460
One door leads to the source.

90
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,700
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

91
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,180
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

92
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,990
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

93
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,019
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

94
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,419
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

95
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,500
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

96
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,379
But you'd have to take out a whole city block
to kill the power of a building like that.

97
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,089
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

98
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,259
There is a power station.

99
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,579
It must be destroyed.

100
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,899
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

101
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,089
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

102
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,980
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

103
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,500
What do you need us for?

104
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,740
Neo could take them both out
easier than we could.

105
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,579
- There's no time.
- Why?

106
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,740
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

107
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:20,099
But another connection
must first be made.

108
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:24,579
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.

109
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,259
Just over five minutes.

110
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,579
That is the length and breadth
of the window.

111
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,940
Only the One can open the door...

112
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,940
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

113
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,659
How do you know all this?

114
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:41,769
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

115
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,220
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

116
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,220
Neo, I know something's wrong.

117
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,819
You don't have to tell me.

118
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,579
I just want you to know that I'm here.

119
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,379
All must be done as one.

120
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,539
Can't hurt.

121
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,940
If one fails...

122
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,339
...all fail.

123
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:29,339
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

124
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:33,779
At midnight, we will strike.

125
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,419
Hey!

126
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,369
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

127
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,259
Okay, they're inside.

128
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,809
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

129
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,460
Oh, shit.

130
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,940
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

131
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,460
Tonight is not an accident.

132
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,659
There are no accidents.

133
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,819
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

134
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,339
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

135
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,859
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

136
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,419
I see purpose.

137
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:39,099
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

138
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:44,059
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

139
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,419
...the very meaning of our lives.

140
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,579
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

141
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:53,980
I promise you, if I can, I will.

142
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:58,460
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

143
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,299
...no matter what...

144
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,700
...to stay out of the Matrix?

145
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,460
Why?

146
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,379
Please.

147
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:18,659
All right.

148
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,250
What is it, Niobe?

149
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,379
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

150
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,700
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

151
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:35,700
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

152
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:38,619
But how would that be different
from any other day?

153
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,940
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

154
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,980
Death can come for us at any time...

155
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,220
...in any place.

156
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,220
Incoming. Incoming!

157
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,659
Incoming!

158
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,700
Now consider the alternative.

159
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,259
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

160
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,659
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

161
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,460
Isn't that worth fighting for?

162
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:29,059
Isn't that worth dying for?

163
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,460
- Time?
- Three minutes.

164
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:33,690
Almost there.

165
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,259
It is done.

166
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,649
Find the others.

167
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,899
I got Niobe right there.
They're already out of the station.

168
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,629
- What about Soren?
- There.

169
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,539
They're still inside, but...

170
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:05,369
They're not moving.

171
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,379
That's it, let's go.

172
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,180
Call Neo now.

173
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,700
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

174
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,019
Everything is still operational.
The emergency system is already rerouting power.

175
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,539
Jesus.

176
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,579
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

177
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,619
The hell it is.

178
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,619
What are you...? Trinity!

179
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:07,700
I will not stand here and do nothing.
I will not wait here to watch them die.

180
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:09,940
Trinity, we're talking
less than five minutes here.

181
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,490
In five minutes,
I'll tear that whole goddam building down.

182
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:16,059
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

183
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,139
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

184
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,649
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

185
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,740
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow some wings.

186
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,579
- Operator.
- I'm in.

187
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,819
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

188
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,379
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

189
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:01,700
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

190
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,659
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

191
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:10,099
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

192
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,829
I want exactly what you want.

193
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,980
I want everything.

194
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,809
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

195
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,700
Go ahead, shoot.

196
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,940
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

197
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,339
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

198
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,139
Hold it right there, little lady.

199
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,819
If you can't beat us...

200
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,740
Join us.

201
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:57,859
Morpheus!

202
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,899
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

203
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:28,059
One minute.

204
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,930
Come on.

205
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,899
Come on.

206
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,259
Please.

207
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,259
Kill them.

208
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,809
They're in.

209
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,859
I don't believe it.

210
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:21,819
It was meant to be.

211
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,139
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

212
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,700
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

213
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,019
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

214
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,500
Hello, Neo.

215
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,649
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

216
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:47,299
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

217
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:51,539
You have many questions. And though the
process has altered your consciousness...

218
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,619
...you remain irrevocably human.

219
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,220
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

220
00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:01,500
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

221
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,210
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

222
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,619
Why am I here?

223
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:11,539
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

224
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,940
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

225
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:18,019
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

226
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,899
...l've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

227
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:25,339
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

228
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,899
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

229
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:32,339
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

230
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:36,289
...which has led you, inexorably...

231
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,419
...here.

232
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:42,500
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

233
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:46,289
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

234
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,980
Others? How many?
What others?

235
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,529
The Matrix is older than you know.

236
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,539
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

237
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,859
In which case, this is the sixth version.

238
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,379
Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

239
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,940
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

240
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,329
Either no one told me...

241
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,379
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

242
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,700
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

243
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:17,139
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

244
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,419
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

245
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,299
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

246
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,500
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

247
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,139
Choice.

248
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,059
The problem is choice.

249
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:55,859
The first Matrix I designed
was quite naturally perfect, a work of art.

250
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,779
Flawless, sublime.

251
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,299
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

252
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,250
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

253
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,619
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human being.

254
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:10,619
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

255
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:14,619
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

256
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,899
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

257
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,819
I have since come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

258
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,940
...because it required a lesser mind.

259
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:30,819
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

260
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,460
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

261
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:40,220
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

262
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:46,099
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

263
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,899
- The Oracle.
- Please.

264
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:53,419
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution
whereby nearly 99 percent of all test subjects...

265
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:56,339
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

266
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:00,460
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

267
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:03,899
While this answer functioned,
it was obviously fundamentally flawed...

268
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:07,899
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

269
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,659
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system itself.

270
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,980
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

271
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:19,059
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

272
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,940
This is about Zion.

273
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,899
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

274
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:29,299
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

275
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:30,569
Bullshit.

276
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,779
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

277
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,169
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

278
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:44,180
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

279
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,609
The function of the One...

280
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:02,259
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a temporary dissemination of the code you carry...

281
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,059
...reinserting the prime program.

282
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:08,460
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

283
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:11,740
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

284
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,259
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

285
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,659
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

286
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:21,289
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

287
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,500
...will alternately result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

288
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,740
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

289
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,980
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

290
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:36,819
However the relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

291
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,419
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

292
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,059
It is interesting reading your reactions.

293
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,740
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

294
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:58,180
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

295
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:01,779
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

296
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,180
While the others experience this
in a general way...

297
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:07,180
...your experience is far more specific...

298
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:10,260
...vis-à-vis love.

299
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,780
Trinity!

300
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,140
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

301
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,490
No.

302
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,140
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

303
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,260
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

304
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:32,260
...as both beginning and end.

305
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,019
There are two doors.

306
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,260
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

307
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:43,860
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

308
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,220
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

309
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,740
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

310
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,820
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

311
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:01,010
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

312
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,620
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

313
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:12,019
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

314
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,780
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

315
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,490
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

316
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,820
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

317
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,340
We won't.

318
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,580
We got a serious situation, sir.

319
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,060
Oh, no.

320
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:41,660
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

321
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,940
Holy shit, he caught her.

322
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,060
Neo, I had to.

323
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,900
I know.

324
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,180
The bullet is still inside.

325
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,340
Trinity...

326
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,140
...don't you quit on me now.

327
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,410
I'm sorry.

328
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,860
Trinity.

329
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,300
Trinity...

330
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,180
...I know you can hear me.

331
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,380
I'm not letting go.

332
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,100
I can't.

333
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,380
I love you too damn much.

334
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,130
I can't take this.

335
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,700
I guess this makes us even.

336
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,740
I don't understand it.

337
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,780
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

338
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,860
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

339
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,740
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

340
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,060
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

341
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,019
- What?
- How do you know that?

342
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,420
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

343
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,100
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

344
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:06,940
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

345
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,060
The prophecy was a lie.

346
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,100
The One was never meant
to end anything.

347
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:18,180
It was all another system of control.

348
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,300
I don't believe that.

349
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,860
But you said it yourself.

350
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,860
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

351
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:36,140
I'm sorry.

352
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,539
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

353
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,740
...I swear to you it's the truth.

354
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,420
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

355
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,690
Oh, no!

356
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,860
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

357
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,539
It's a bomb.

358
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,780
We have to get out of here. Now.

359
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,780
I have dreamed a dream...

360
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,940
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

361
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,700
Here they come.

362
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,580
Let's go, Morpheus.

363
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,860
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

364
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,140
- Come on!
- Something's different.

365
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,220
What?

366
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,300
I can feel them.

367
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,820
Neo!

368
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,180
- What happened?
- I don't know.

369
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,060
It's the Hammer.

370
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,860
He's in some kind of coma...

371
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,180
...but his vitals are stable.

372
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,180
What about you?

373
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,380
I'm fine.

374
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,820
You could use some rest.

375
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,740
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

376
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,060
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

377
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,980
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

378
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,780
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

379
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,300
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

380
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,060
...until someone screwed it up.

381
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,740
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

382
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,580
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

383
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,820
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

384
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,700
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

385
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,220
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

386
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,060
Who?

387
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,769
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

388
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,140
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

389
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,380
You found one?

390
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,700
Only one.

391
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,910
Everything that has a beginning...

392
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,710
...has an end.

393
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:58,789
I see the end coming.

394
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,580
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.

395
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,510
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

396
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,590
We missed you.

397
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,510
It ends tonight.

398
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,430
You are all that stands in his way.

399
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,310
If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
