1
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,729
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,239
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,409
I'm in.

4
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,609
We're almost there.

5
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,560
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,969
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,879
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,050
Given your situation, I can't say
I fully understand your reasons...

9
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,780
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:58,770
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,689
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,640
To trust me.

13
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,689
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,689
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,090
Now repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,290
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,930
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,129
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,650
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,170
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,090
I just wish...

22
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,890
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,810
That's all.

24
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,210
I just wish I knew.

25
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,450
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,600
Here you are.

27
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,090
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,689
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

29
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,010
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,810
They're boring from the surface
straight down to Zion.

31
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,439
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.

32
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,050
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,450
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,970
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,530
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,530
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,050
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,650
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,410
Why not?

40
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,170
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,879
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,129
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,730
Niobe.

44
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,290
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,610
...it's become increasingly difficult
to locate a secure broadcast position.

46
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,890
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Main Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,680
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,920
What are we gonna do about it?

49
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,290
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered us to do.

50
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,080
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,170
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,900
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,650
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,970
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,210
- I think, we should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,360
I don't know.

57
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,210
...however,
I must ask one of you for help.

58
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,850
Some of you believe as I believe, some of
you do not. But those of you that do know...

59
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,450
...we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,689
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,050
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,810
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,570
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,530
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,410
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,170
...just in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,330
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,850
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,530
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,530
And what happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,000
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,320
He won't.

73
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,490
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,810
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,450
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,889
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,290
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,570
A gift.

79
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,529
You see, he set me free.

80
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,009
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,450
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

82
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,009
He gave you this.

83
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,889
He said you set him free.

84
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,009
Is everything all right, sir?

85
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,889
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

86
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,170
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

87
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,930
Go.

88
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,370
Hiya, fellas.

89
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,600
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

90
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:29,970
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

91
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,519
- He is still...
- Only human.

92
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,610
Upgrades.

93
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,730
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

94
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,460
It's happening exactly as before.

95
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,180
Well, not exactly.

96
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,769
- What happened back there, Link?
- I can't figure it out, sir.

97
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,529
Agents just came out of nowhere.

98
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,570
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

99
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,529
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

100
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,050
Where is he now?

101
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,129
He's doing his Superman thing.

102
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,450
Where are you?

103
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,370
This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.

104
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,529
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

105
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,129
Roger that, Control.

106
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,649
This is Zion Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

107
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,490
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

108
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,649
Nebuchadnezzar you are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

109
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,450
Roger that, Control.

110
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,250
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

111
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,050
No place like it.

112
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,200
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

113
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,000
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

114
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,290
Understood.

115
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,080
Captain Mifune.

116
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,250
Captain Morpheus.

117
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,129
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

118
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,570
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

119
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,810
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

120
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,450
- Link.
- Sir?

121
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,080
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

122
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,730
Understood, sir.

123
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,920
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

124
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,090
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

125
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,330
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

126
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,050
What happened?

127
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,529
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

128
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,259
Yeah, she can do that.

129
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,529
Neo!

130
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,250
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

131
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,290
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

132
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,050
You know what they say
about the life you save.

133
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,930
I didn't save his life.

134
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,330
Hiya, Neo.

135
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,970
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

136
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,649
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

137
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,450
- Can I carry that for you, Neo?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

138
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,210
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,889
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

140
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,930
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

141
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,730
I've been thinking a lot about it,
and I've made my decision.

142
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,290
Let me guess.

143
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,649
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

144
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,009
I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other
crew positions, except for you, Link.

145
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,490
I'm sure he has reasons...

146
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,850
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

147
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,490
You know, it's fate.

148
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,129
I mean, you're the reason I'm here, Neo.

149
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,730
I told you kid, you found me.
I didn't find you.

150
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,330
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

151
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,970
You saved yourself.

152
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,769
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

153
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,330
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you the chance to explain your actions.

154
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,250
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

155
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,610
You were given a direct order
to return to Zion.

156
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,490
- I did.
- But you asked for one ship to remain behind.

157
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,220
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

158
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,970
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

159
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,409
Commander, we need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

160
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,450
I don't want to hear that shit!

161
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,180
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

162
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,610
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.

163
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,490
And to do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

164
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:42,050
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

165
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,570
How?

166
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,409
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

167
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,090
Not everyone believes what you believe.

168
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,250
My beliefs do not require them to.

169
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,850
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

170
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,649
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

171
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,649
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

172
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,849
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

173
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,929
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

174
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm recommending to the counsel
that you be removed from duty.

175
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,649
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

176
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:41,519
If it were up to me captain, you wouldn't
set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

177
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,849
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

178
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,839
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

179
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,089
- Captain.
- Councillor.

180
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,490
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

181
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:03,569
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

182
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,119
The people must be told
what is happening.

183
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,929
Of course, councillor.

184
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:13,639
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

185
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:16,689
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

186
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:19,809
A panic is not what anyone wants.

187
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,169
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

188
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,049
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

189
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,250
That army will never reach
the gates of Zion.

190
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:36,449
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

191
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,409
Consider that in the past six months...

192
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,529
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

193
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:43,569
This attack is an act of desperation.

194
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,409
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

195
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,250
I hope you're right, captain.

196
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,009
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

197
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,639
It is simply a matter of time.

198
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,129
My stop.

199
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,649
See you soon.

200
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,209
Hopefully not too soon.

201
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,409
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

202
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,129
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,599
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

204
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,969
- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

205
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:27,169
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

206
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,769
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

207
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:58,289
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

208
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,449
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

209
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,439
No, wait.

210
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,000
It's all right. They need you.

211
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,329
- I need you.
- I know.

212
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:10,049
There's time.

213
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,849
Where's my puss...?

214
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,250
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

215
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,969
God!

216
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,009
Uncle Link!

217
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:26,609
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

218
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:28,849
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

219
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,490
- Yeah!
- Okay!

220
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:32,289
Okay? All right.

221
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:35,369
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

222
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,649
One, two, three, lift!

223
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,849
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

224
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,609
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

225
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:46,609
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

226
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,569
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

227
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,490
You be careful with her.

228
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,329
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

229
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,369
Out the door! Both of you, march!

230
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,490
- Bye!
- Bye!

231
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:08,089
I'm gonna get what?

232
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:13,250
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

233
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:17,089
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

234
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,529
- We'll be past this, when you start operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

235
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,129
- Why?
- You know why.

236
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:25,329
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

237
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,449
Maybe. But it's too late now.

238
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,129
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

239
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,889
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

240
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,889
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

241
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,649
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

242
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,809
I'm afraid of it.

243
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,849
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

244
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,250
It won't.

245
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,169
How can you say that to me?

246
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,209
Because of Morpheus.

247
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:03,809
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

248
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,009
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

249
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,569
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

250
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,859
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

251
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,969
...l'm starting to believe him too.

252
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,199
Be careful, Link.

253
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,609
Please be careful.

254
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:45,609
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

255
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,730
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

256
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,409
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

257
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,649
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

258
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,409
...our children.

259
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,969
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

260
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:04,209
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

261
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:07,529
...and who stand here beside us.

262
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,250
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

263
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,490
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

264
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,809
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

265
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,289
I give you Morpheus.

266
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:45,009
Zion! Hear me!

267
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,969
It is true what many of you have heard.

268
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,969
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

269
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,889
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

270
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:02,769
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

271
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:09,329
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

272
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:14,529
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

273
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,769
Why?

274
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,889
Because I believe something you do not?

275
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,809
No!

276
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,849
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

277
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:30,769
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

278
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:34,129
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

279
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:38,769
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

280
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:43,490
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

281
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:49,490
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

282
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,209
We are still here!

283
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,649
Tonight...

284
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,049
...let us send a message to that army.

285
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:08,129
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

286
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,000
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

287
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,169
...of earth, steel and stone.

288
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:20,359
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

289
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:24,889
Tonight, let us make them remember:

290
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,809
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

291
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,129
I remember.

292
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,240
I remember you used to dance.

293
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:01,969
I remember you were pretty good.

294
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:05,809
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

295
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:09,250
...that will never change.

296
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,329
Niobe!

297
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,529
Some things do change.

298
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,769
Excuse me.

299
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,490
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

300
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:57,480
I was thinking, everyone is here.

301
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,209
Follow me.

302
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,409
Neo, what is it?

303
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:18,849
What's wrong?

304
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,609
It's okay, you can tell me.

305
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,359
Trinity...

306
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,209
Don't be afraid.

307
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,609
I can't lose you.

308
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,569
You're not gonna lose me.

309
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,289
You feel this?

310
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,169
I'm never letting go.

311
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:19,419
Good night, Zion.

312
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,139
Sweet dreams.

313
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,490
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

314
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,169
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

315
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:38,329
It doesn't matter now.
All that matters is this.

316
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,689
You first.

317
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,889
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

318
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,039
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

319
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,569
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

320
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,129
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

321
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,969
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

322
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,689
So could I.

323
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,079
It's nice tonight.

324
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,879
Very calm.

325
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,689
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

326
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,409
Not everyone.

327
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:28,209
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

328
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:32,250
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

329
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:37,209
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

330
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:41,649
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

331
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,849
That you are in fact still human.

332
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,049
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

333
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:55,129
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

334
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,730
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

335
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,250
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

336
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,279
That's how it is with people.
Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.

337
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,650
I like it down here.

338
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:25,369
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

339
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:30,449
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.

340
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,489
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

341
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,730
- ...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

342
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,489
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

343
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,969
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

344
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,009
And when I look at these machines...

345
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,039
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

346
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,089
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

347
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,369
Of course not. How could they?

348
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,969
The idea is pure nonsense...

349
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,449
...but it does make one wonder just...

350
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,130
...what is control?

351
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,289
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

352
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:14,929
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

353
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,769
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

354
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,969
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

355
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,699
...our heat, our air.

356
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,610
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

357
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:33,289
No. No point.

358
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,889
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

359
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:42,279
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

360
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,049
Good point.

361
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:48,730
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

362
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,009
There is so much in this world...

363
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:54,969
...that I do not understand.

364
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,250
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

365
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,289
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

366
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,369
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

367
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,130
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

368
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,289
But I believe there's a reason
for that as well.

369
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:24,049
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

370
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,889
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

371
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:36,679
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

372
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,170
It's time to go.

373
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,449
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

374
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,849
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

375
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,409
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

376
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,730
Right now, that operator's me.

377
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,329
I know.

378
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,690
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

379
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,809
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

380
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,929
It's always brought me luck.

381
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,049
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

382
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:19,569
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

383
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:23,730
Just keep it with you. Please.

384
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,889
For me.

385
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,409
Okay.

386
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,170
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

387
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:53,650
Bane.

388
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,089
Is something wrong?

389
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:56,889
No, I'm fine.

390
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,730
I just wanted to catch you to say...

391
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,650
...good luck.

392
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:04,889
Thanks.

393
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,360
We'll see you.

394
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,849
Neo! Just in time.

395
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,250
- You're gonna see the Oracle, aren't you?
- We don't have time.

396
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,969
I'm sorry sir.
I just had to give something to Neo.

397
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:19,250
A gift from one of the orphans.

398
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,690
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

399
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,889
He said you'd understand.

400
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,489
Thanks.

401
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:40,089
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

402
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:42,130
That is correct.

403
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:44,170
Counsel, am I still in charge
of our defense system?

404
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,559
Of course.

405
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:50,130
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

406
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,769
I understand that, commander.

407
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,400
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

408
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,250
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

409
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:04,849
Be careful.

410
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:34,809
Hello.

411
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:48,089
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

412
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:55,329
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

413
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,210
Apologize for what?

414
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,569
For this.

415
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,690
Good.

416
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,130
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

417
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:04,409
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

418
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,449
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

419
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,769
...until you fight them.

420
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,610
Come. She's waiting.

421
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,849
Where the hell did they go?

422
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:33,809
These are back doors, aren't they?

423
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,769
Programmer access.

424
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:41,409
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

425
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:46,369
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

426
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,769
Are you a programmer?

427
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,170
Then what are you?

428
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,610
I protect that which matters most.

429
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,569
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

430
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,650
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

431
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:29,009
My goodness, look at you.

432
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,049
You turned out all right, didn't you?

433
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,329
- How do you feel?
- I...

434
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,929
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

435
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,690
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

436
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,329
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

437
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:58,449
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

438
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,409
So...

439
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,719
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

440
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:10,289
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

441
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:16,049
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

442
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,449
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

443
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,650
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

444
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,279
...another kind of control.

445
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,769
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

446
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,690
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

447
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,809
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

448
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,489
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

449
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,049
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

450
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:50,809
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

451
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:54,130
Candy?

452
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:00,969
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

453
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,210
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

454
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,250
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

455
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,849
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

456
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:21,009
I thought you'd have
figured that out by now.

457
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:25,159
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

458
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,049
I love candy.

459
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:30,929
But why help us?

460
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:34,449
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

461
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,929
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

462
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,130
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

463
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,650
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

464
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,380
Look. See those birds?

465
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:53,849
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

466
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:59,610
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

467
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,610
There are programs running
all over the place.

468
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:07,049
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

469
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:10,889
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

470
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:14,969
Well, you hear about them all the time.

471
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:18,289
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

472
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,170
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

473
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:27,730
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

474
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,130
...is the system assimilating
some program...

475
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:34,769
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

476
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,809
Programs hacking programs.

477
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,730
- Why?
- They have their reasons but...

478
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,679
...usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

479
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,849
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

480
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:53,369
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

481
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:58,289
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

482
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,019
...or return to the source.

483
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:05,769
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

484
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,319
Where you must go.

485
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,529
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

486
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,369
...in your dreams, haven't you?

487
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:19,250
A door made of light?

488
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,809
What happens when you go through
the door?

489
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,730
I see Trinity...

490
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,929
...and something happens...

491
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:34,929
...something bad.

492
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,929
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

493
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,639
- Do you see her die?
- No.

494
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,329
You have the sight now, Neo.

495
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,369
You are looking at the world
without time.

496
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:52,839
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

497
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,610
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

498
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:59,809
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

499
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:03,679
No, you've already made the choice.

500
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,289
Now you have to understand it.

501
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,210
No.

502
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,489
I can't do that. I won't.

503
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:14,449
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

504
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:17,969
Because you're the One.

505
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,929
What if I can't?

506
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,009
What happens if I fail?

507
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,449
Then Zion will fall.

508
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:40,289
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

509
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,610
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you'll need the Keymaker.

510
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,759
The Keymaker?

511
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,409
Yes. He disappeared some time ago. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

512
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:52,170
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

513
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:55,730
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

514
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,650
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

515
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:03,449
What do all men with power want?
More power.

516
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,250
Be there at that exact time...

517
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,980
...and you will have a chance.

518
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:12,889
We must go.

519
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:18,210
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

520
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,529
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

521
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:24,329
But for what it's worth...

522
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:28,849
...you've made a believer out of me.

523
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:32,130
Good luck, kiddo.

524
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,089
Mr. Anderson.

525
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,009
Did you get my package?

526
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,250
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,130
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

528
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:07,000
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,650
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:12,730
Our connection.

531
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,460
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,849
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

533
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,579
...something overwritten or copied.

534
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:24,329
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

535
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,449
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,210
And what reason is that?

537
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:33,440
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:36,730
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,250
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

540
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,170
...but it happened anyway.

541
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,889
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:52,210
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

543
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,250
...but I didn't.

544
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,409
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

545
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,250
...compelled to disobey.

546
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:07,409
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:11,360
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:14,610
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,409
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:21,049
Congratulations.

551
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:24,009
Thank you.

552
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:29,009
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

553
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:34,119
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:38,969
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:42,889
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,289
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

557
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,089
- ...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:54,130
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:56,049
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,730
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,250
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,610
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,489
Purpose.

564
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,250
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:22,610
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,449
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,210
Me, me, me.

568
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,489
Me too.

569
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,000
More.

570
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:26,449
It is inevitable.

571
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,210
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,889
Are you all right?

573
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,769
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:18,130
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

575
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:21,920
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:24,449
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:28,650
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

578
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:31,449
- ...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:35,880
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:37,409
It felt like dying.

581
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,650
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:44,489
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

583
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,089
These points of intersection
are crucial...

584
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,929
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,969
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

586
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:57,650
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:01,009
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

588
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:04,849
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:08,849
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:13,489
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:16,219
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

592
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,650
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

593
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,279
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,639
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:31,409
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

596
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,969
- ...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:37,369
It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

598
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:40,449
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,489
Careful, commander.

600
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:46,889
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:50,759
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,969
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,489
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

604
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,289
There's no need for such an order.

605
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,849
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:07,319
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

607
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,489
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

608
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:16,360
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

609
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:19,329
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,849
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:24,569
Is there another?

612
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:28,880
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:30,849
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

614
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:32,449
...before I put you in one.

615
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,569
Is there no other?

616
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:46,130
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

617
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:49,130
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:52,929
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

619
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,250
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,319
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,319
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,480
Why?

623
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,849
Because some things
never change, Jason...

624
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:15,250
...and some things do.

625
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,369
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:34,769
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,449
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:38,489
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:42,170
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:44,250
Bad for us.

631
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,089
Here we go.

632
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,569
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:00:57,019 --> 01:01:00,690
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,839
Follow me.

635
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:28,569
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

636
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:30,089
Right?

637
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:32,489
And the legendary Morpheus.

638
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:37,969
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

639
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:41,449
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

640
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:45,489
Something to eat? Drink?

641
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:48,690
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

642
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,239
For the sake of appearances.

643
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,730
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

644
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,759
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

645
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:06,569
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

646
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:09,529
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

647
01:02:09,699 --> 01:02:13,690
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

648
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,889
...especially to curse with.

649
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:24,089
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

650
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,329
You know why we are here.

651
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:33,690
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

652
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:39,690
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

653
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,329
We are looking for the Keymaker.

654
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,289
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

655
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,289
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

656
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,049
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

657
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:59,730
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

658
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,929
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

659
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:05,130
But do you?

660
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,569
You think you do, but you do not.

661
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:10,809
You are here
because you were sent here.

662
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,969
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

663
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:17,329
It is, of course, the way of all things.

664
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,059
You see, there is only one constant...

665
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:24,210
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

666
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,969
Causality.

667
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,329
Action, reaction.

668
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,529
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

669
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:34,369
No. Wrong.

670
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:38,929
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

671
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:41,089
...and those without.

672
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:45,610
Look there at that woman.

673
01:03:46,299 --> 01:03:50,049
My God, just look at her...

674
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:52,860
...affecting everyone around her.

675
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:57,569
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

676
01:03:57,819 --> 01:04:01,409
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

677
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:05,650
...a very special dessert.

678
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:12,170
I wrote it myself.

679
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:15,409
It starts so simply...

680
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:19,969
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

681
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,529
...poetry.

682
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:24,049
First...

683
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:29,730
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

684
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,809
You can see it, Neo, yes?

685
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,880
She does not understand why.

686
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:38,440
Is it the wine? No.

687
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:40,889
What is it then? What is the reason?

688
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,730
And soon it does not matter.

689
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,769
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

690
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:53,009
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

691
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,409
And this is the nature of the universe.

692
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:59,009
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

693
01:04:59,179 --> 01:05:01,639
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

694
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:05,650
Beneath our poised appearance...

695
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:10,889
...the truth is, we are completely...

696
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,409
...out of control.

697
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:26,210
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

698
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:31,849
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

699
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:35,289
"Why" is what separates us from them...

700
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,650
...you from me.

701
01:05:37,819 --> 01:05:41,409
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

702
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:44,730
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

703
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,569
Another link in the chain.

704
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:49,000
But fear not.

705
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,880
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

706
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:55,569
...I will tell you what to do next.

707
01:05:56,059 --> 01:06:00,690
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

708
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,969
Her time is almost up.

709
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:09,369
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

710
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:11,920
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

711
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:18,199
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.

712
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:22,250
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

713
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,929
Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

714
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:30,289
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

715
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,769
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

716
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,569
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

717
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,529
Well, that didn't go so well.

718
01:06:51,699 --> 01:06:53,969
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

719
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:56,170
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

720
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:58,089
Or didn't do something.

721
01:06:58,259 --> 01:07:01,369
No, what happened happened and couldn't
have happened any other way.

722
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:05,159
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

723
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:10,449
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

724
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:19,170
Get out.

725
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:27,089
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

726
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:32,929
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

727
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:37,210
He was so different.

728
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:41,449
He was like you.

729
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:47,679
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

730
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,610
- What?
- A kiss.

731
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,039
Excuse me?

732
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,250
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

733
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:02,529
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

734
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,650
It's all over you both.

735
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:09,650
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

736
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:16,450
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

737
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,450
Just a sample.

738
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,490
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

739
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:28,370
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

740
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,610
Why should we trust you?

741
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:34,610
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

742
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,450
All right.

743
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:47,410
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

744
01:08:48,579 --> 01:08:50,530
All right.

745
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,370
Terrible. Forget it.

746
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,610
Wait.

747
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,970
Okay.

748
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:42,530
Yes.

749
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,480
That's it.

750
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:04,850
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

751
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,050
Come with me.

752
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,530
Not again.

753
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,329
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

754
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,250
These fellas work for my husband.

755
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,090
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

756
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,730
Aren't you, boys?

757
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,880
Yes, mistress.

758
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,650
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

759
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,810
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

760
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:08,329
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

761
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,370
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

762
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,970
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

763
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,600
...or you can stay there and die.

764
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,370
He's in the ladies' room!

765
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,050
Hurry.

766
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:00,610
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

767
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,610
I've been waiting for you.

768
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,690
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

769
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,570
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

770
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,610
There is no cause for this. What cause?

771
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:26,890
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

772
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,650
Lipstick? Lipstick.

773
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,490
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

774
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,700
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

775
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:43,050
Woman, this is nothing.

776
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:48,530
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

777
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,610
Have fun.

778
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,450
All right.

779
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,289
All right.

780
01:13:00,539 --> 01:13:03,210
Let us find out where this goes.

781
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,130
You two, get the Keymaker.

782
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,289
That's a nice trick.

783
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,680
I cannot go back.

784
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,130
I'll handle them.

785
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:24,490
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

786
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,289
Okay, you have some skill.

787
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,289
Kill him.

788
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,970
You see? He's just a man.

789
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,810
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

790
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,690
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

791
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:04,850
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.
