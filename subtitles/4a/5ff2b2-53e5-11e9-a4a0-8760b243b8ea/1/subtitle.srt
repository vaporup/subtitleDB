00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,918
Hello! We're Korea's funniest
comedians, Jung Yong-gi!

15
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,923
And Yang Chul-soo!

16
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,763
Hi! Of the many variety shows,
'King of Comedy'...

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,993
being the most popular...
We wanna perform on those shows...

18
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,431
Unfortunately, we haven't been
discovered yet.

19
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,838
That's right. Thank you all who are here
at the King of Comedy studio today.

20
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:55,638
Now we'll begin the show for all of you.

21
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,573
- Good work. We're going into taping.
- Oh, okay.

22
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,114
Okay, everyone. Give us a hand!
Applause!

23
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,847
Alright, let's keep this spirit
up to the end, okay?

24
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,616
You now know Korea's funniest
comedians, Yang Chul-soo!

25
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,777
And Jung Yong-gi!

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:46,355
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

27
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:47,995
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

28
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,635
- Are they laughing a lot?
- Yes.

29
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,928
Keep up the good work.

30
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,601
We're better off playing nightclubs
than doing this crap.

31
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,271
You're gonna say, 'it's stupid
but it's still TV, right?'

32
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:07,750
If you want it so bad then
fatten some wallets or kiss up...

33
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,152
You're gonna say, 'Am I a butt-licker',
aren't you?

34
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,889
I don't see the answer...

35
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,802
Where is our answer?

36
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,871
Oh, stop your whining!

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,773
Why is it so hard to get on a show?

38
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,105
How many times do I have to tell you?

39
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,041
I said, no!

40
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,739
Oh, Yoo-shik, lovely!

41
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,555
You should say hello. Hey, move it!

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,464
- Huh. Now he won't even say hi.
- Let him be. He's made it now.

43
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,897
Made what?
You mean, his face is made up?

44
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,429
Hey, let's go...

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,702
Yeah, it's a great opportunity
but there's no one good right now.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,848
Sure, PD Kim.
Look into it and call me again.

47
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,382
Okay? Later.

48
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,449
Man, plenty of spots
but no one to fill them.

49
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,088
You get it? The crane...

50
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,957
So this crane is you?

51
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,033
I heard about you two.

52
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,162
They say you guys have talent.

53
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,699
But only talent.

54
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,868
You got it, 'only'!

55
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,000
You know 'only' is what turns
the lights off on a bright future.

56
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:43,140
More talking will just hurt my jaw.
At least, they say you have talent...

57
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,343
How about placing your future
in my hands for 3 months?

58
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,414
If you don't make it by then,
I'll leave this field.

59
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,718
Then what do we have to...

60
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,587
First, bring me 10 grand by next week.

61
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,199
Let's start with a show.
What do you think?

62
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,564
Excuse me? 10 grand?

63
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,398
Guys, has anyone made it by banging
their heads on the ground?

64
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,237
You've gotta invest.
Yong-gi, did you pass the talent test?

65
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,668
No.

66
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,283
- Any connections?
- No.

67
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,008
Did you ever buy a producer drinks?

68
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,549
No.

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,917
There you go. No wonder you're
crawling at the bottom.

70
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,784
- Why? Too rich for you?
- It's not...

71
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,257
Try running barefoot 'cause you can't
buy shoes. What would happen?

72
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,857
- Bloody feet.
- Exactly!

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:37,065
Wear fancy shoes and run your ass
off. You're on your way.

74
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,631
Forget about it!

75
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,632
What are you saying right now?

76
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,840
I don't wanna get on TV
by paving the way with money.

77
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,814
What do you take us for?

78
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,009
I can't believe guys like you
are still around...

79
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,480
What are you doing? Let's go!

80
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,454
- Come on.
- Yong-gi.

81
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,157
Yong-gi...

82
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,824
Mr. Yong-gi!

83
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,866
- He took my card, right?
- Yeah, Chul-soo did.

84
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,438
He won't do nightclubs
for the life of him.

85
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,340
- Why the hell won't he? Huh?
- He says it's embarrassing.

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,011
Embarrassing? Crazy son of a bitch!

87
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,780
Hey, if you wanna succeed,
didn't I tell you to dump him?

88
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,117
How can I? We've been a duo
since high school.

89
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,353
Duo... then become a panhandling duo!

90
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,464
Bro, don't be so hard on him.
After his son, Woo-jin died,

91
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,431
...he took a couple of years off.
Actually, he's much funnier than I am.

92
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,230
That's why he's all wrong.

93
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:50,809
Is that a pro?
Can't he separate work and home?

94
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,310
Leave him to me.
Give us a job, a cool one.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,641
You told me to live like a man.

96
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,808
Oh, brother. Where did I put it?

97
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,688
Why is this so small?

98
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,459
Why do you say no?

99
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,858
We'd be better off apart than
living like this.

100
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,696
Because it's damn embarrassing!

101
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:57,069
Think about it. To get married after
everyone was dead set against us.

102
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,745
And then, we break up now?
How could I hold my face up?

103
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,642
Hold your face up? What face?

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,250
It's not like you make any money.
Why are you home so late?

105
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,511
Crazy bitch!

106
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,451
Do you even love me? Huh?

107
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,223
Of course.

108
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,298
I love you. I do love you.

109
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,500
Hey!

110
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,500
Dammit...

111
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,979
- You worthless...!
- Honey!

112
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,818
Are you asking us to accept
an orphan into this home?

113
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,393
It's not enough that you're a clown?

114
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,792
Get out! Rotten, worthless brat...

115
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,558
But father, if you'd just meet
Jung-yeon once...

116
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,362
- Still with this! You brat!
- Dear, no!

117
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,667
Listen! Don't even come near here...
Rotten brat!

118
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,642
- What are you doing? Come!
- Yes.

119
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,018
Give it! Come on!

120
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,321
This is Jin-young,
can you believe it?

121
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,293
Look at her hair and clothes.
How tacky.

122
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,056
I have to say I was really cute.

123
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,359
How adorable.

124
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,526
- Yeah, she was really cute.
- See.

125
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,765
What do you mean she was cute?
The duckling grew into a swan.

126
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,308
What? Duckling? Swan?

127
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,139
Hey. What's this?

128
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,779
Friendship... Love... J.Y.

129
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,283
How can you be so corny?

130
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,055
Look at these.

131
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,456
They're not corny!

132
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,119
It's from all the boys
who chased after me.

133
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,523
Do you even have any corny stuff
like this?

134
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,763
Of course. My walls were plastered
with leaves. What did you expect?

135
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,634
Look at her lie.

136
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,777
- I didn't see any in your room.
- I took them down long ago.

137
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,571
- When would that have been...
- Oh, you didn't see, huh?

Fall Field Trip"

139
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,311
What is your wish?

140
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,319
To turn the lights off in our house.

141
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,436
Abracadabra...

142
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,129
The lights are going,
the lights are going!

143
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,901
The lights are going, the lights...

144
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,131
Hey, Shim Jin-woo, you ass!
Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,865
The finals are days away and
you don't have any judges yet?

146
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,136
- Well...
- Shut up!

147
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,939
Are you guys really gonna shit
around like this?

148
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,316
If I see you screw up during taping,
I'll crush your skulls!

149
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,316
Get out! Out!

150
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,817
You guys get out, too! Out!

151
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,019
What am I gonna do with those morons?

152
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
Dammit.

153
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:53,562
Um, excuse me. Oh, can I help you?

154
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,033
Yes.

155
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,209
How do you do?

156
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,642
Who... are you?

157
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:06,443
Oh, yes... I'm Yong-gi Jung's wife.

158
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,212
- Who?
- The comedian.

159

Comedian Yong-gi Jung.

160
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,284
So?

161
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,419
How did you get in?

162
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,700
I have something to ask you...

163
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,901
- Have you had lunch?
- Yes, I have.

164
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,869
Huh, this TV station...
what kind of security...

165
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,582
- Do you want to go for some coffee?
- I'm busy.

00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,338
Have you been enjoying the night air?

170
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,178
Is that a way to talk to your husband?

171
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,780
What?

172
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,156

'Jung Woo-jin: 1998.4.20'

175
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,192
Let's go...

176
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,771
He wishes he could brag about
his father to his friends.

177
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,780
When will you grow up? My God...

178
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,232
- How was that?
- It's a little weak.

179
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,635
Then I'll have to hit him.
What can I do?

180
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,573
That's a little too much.

181
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,839
This isn't even funny. Let's skip it.

182
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,880
Okay. Let's take it out when we tape.

183
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:58,179
That's better.
Let's take a break! I'll be outside.

184
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,462
Thanks for filling in.
This is how it is.

185
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:16,234
Go eat. See you. Let's go, Yoo-shik.

186
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,324
What did you learn in Kindergarten?
Dewey Rain? How do you do that?

187
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:47,432
- Hi, hello.
- Hello. Who may you be?

188
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:53,203
- Are you the wife of PD Hwang?
- Yes. And you are?

189
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,476
How do you do? I'm the wife of
comedian Yong-gi Jung.

190
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,346
I heard Yong-gi worked with
PD Hwang a couple of times.

191
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,478
I see.

192
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,351
Ah, you're so pretty!
Do you want one? Here.

193
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,593
Oh, how adorable.

194
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,290
Excuse me, take this back with you!

195
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,729
Then do what you want!

196
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,731
Where the hell is it?

197
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,339
Jeez, so much make-up.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,876
Is she going out for Miss Korea?

199
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,628
I'll pay you back every cent.

200
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,801
How much?

201
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,376
Is that all this store is worth?

202
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,109
I see... Alright.

203
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,424
Welcome.

204
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,634
- How old is your child?
- What? Oh, 35.

205
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,774
Jung Yong-gi is your husband, right?

206
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,325
- Well...
- Yes...

207
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,902
Can he really get a regular spot
on a show for that money?

208
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,270
Well, if I say that, I'm a con-man.

209
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,468
How can I put it... it's to grease
the way to getting connections.

210
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,446
Anyway, Yong-gi needs
family support right now.

211
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,117
- If that's the case...
- Oh! Sorry.

212
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:57,863
- Hello? PD Park?
- Mr. Kang, this is Jung Yong-gi.

213
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,391
Oh, right. I can hear you fine.

214
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,128
Yeah...

215
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:09,968
I'm calling because I gave it
some thought and I think...

216
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,409
What? Hello?

217
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,507
Hello? Hello?

218
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:24,045
Oh. Well, I do know someone
who's good.

219
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:25,948
PD Park.

220
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,653
You always call when you need...

221
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,270
You got disconnected, right?

222
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,600
- Hello? It's me...
- Sure, I'll call you back.

223
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,105
Give me a call.

224
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,840
- Look here!
- Yes?

225
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,088
- You're a con-man, aren't you?
- What? No, I'm not!

226
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,649
Where do you think you're going?

227
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,754
- Let go!
- I got you, scumbag.

228
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,294
- What's wrong with this woman?
- Let's go to the police.

229
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,864
What, police? Let me go!

230
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,700
- Hey, Hakchul! Get the car!
- Why? Why...

231
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,841
Get in, quick! Start the car!

232
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,207
- Hey, look... There!
- What? What?

233
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,112
Damn...

234
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,392
You're scaring me.

235
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,966
I didn't even touch her, really!

236
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,536
I just gave her a little push.

237
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,335
Hey, she was gonna call the police.

238
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,671
A little push and she passed out?

239
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,843
- Yeah! It's insane, right?
- Guardian for Park Jung-yeon?

240
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,449
- Guardian?
- How is she?

241
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,451
Are you the husband?

242
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,451
What? Well...

243
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,060
How is my sister-in-law?

244
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,330
How could you bring her in now?

245
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,167
She was fine just
until a moment ago...

246
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,165
What?

247
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,237
- How good of you...
- Yes.

248
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:25,468
I can't understand how
you didn't know until now.

249
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,004
- Listen.
- Yes.

250
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,443
It's almost a miracle she's alive!

251
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,375
But why are you getting mad at me?

252
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,419
How could you not know
while living under the same roof?

253
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:41,418
She must have been in incredible pain.
Didn't you even hear her moaning?

254
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,326
- Did you hear it?
- Uh-huh.

255
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,025
I'm very sorry.

256
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,369
Doctor! The patient's disappeared.

257
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,043
Funeral Home

258
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,117
Daddy, let's go.

259
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,605
Look at this mess!

260
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,805
Damn losers,
I should cut their electricity!

261
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,841
Sleazy crooks.

262
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,382
Is he gone?

263
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,258
Why is life so pathetic?

264
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,557
Why is my life like 4 walls caving in?
I'm going crazy!

265
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:31,964
Trying to con a lady like that...
We're lucky lightening didn't strike us.

266
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,432
Shut your trap!
You're the wall, the wall.

267
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,840
Hello? Hello?

268
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,407
Oh, Yong-gi!

269
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,648
- Have you gone insane?
- What did you do with it?

270
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,626
- What?
- My store's lease!

271
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,228
Oh, I used it for something.

272
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,255
For what?

273
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,228
To get a loan. I needed some money.

274
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,901
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know what that is?

275
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:18,010
Oh, I'll pay it back. I will!
Hey, it wasn't even worth much.

276
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,047
Don't even think about throwing that...
I won't take it anymore!

277
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,380
Hey, you almost hit me! Dammit!

278
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,624
Get it back, at once!

279
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,869
Shit...

280
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:54,042
I'm sorry about the last time.
I'm in your hands.

281
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,417
Where did you get this money?

282
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:09,831
Actually, my wife has a small shop.
I got a loan off it.

283
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,194
Do you have any insurance?

284
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,873
Insurance?

285
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,599
What?

286
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,275
Just wondering
if you broke your insurance...

287
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,043
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it. I thank you.

288
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,615
When I say thanks, just accept it.

289
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,992
- I'll be in touch.
- Yes, I'll be waiting.

290
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,253
Next week, let's start with
a variety show.

291
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,021
A variety show...

292
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,759
- See you next time.
- Bye.

293
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,701
Bro!

294
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,480
Dammit.

295
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:07,922
Forget about it! Just forget it!

296
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,653
I'll just call everything off, okay?

297
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,229
Okay? God-dammit...

298
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,629
But sir, this, I...

299
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,866
Wake up, buddy!

300
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,030
You can't even take care of your own
wife! And you want to be a success?

301
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,267
Just take your money back.
Go away! Okay?

302
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,910
There, you happy?

303
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,975
I don't know what you mean.

304
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,120
Your wife's dying right now.

305
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,265
Jung-yeon! Jung-yeon!

306
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,968
Jung-yeon.

307
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,044
Park Jung-yeon, where are you?

308
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,846
You, you... why...

309
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:50,226
- Why... why...
- What? Just say it!

310
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,234
Your husband's home.
Why won't you even look at him?

311
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,309
Since the home's a mess,
no wonder I can't succeed outside!

312
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,874
- Let go! Let go!
- What's the matter with you?

313
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,745
- You can't go in!
- Don't do this!

314
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,746
What are you? You, a doctor?

315
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,892
- Who is he?
- Park's husband.

316
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,687
How can you leave a patient like that?

317
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,799
Whatever she said, you should have
forced her to get treatment.

318
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:08,695
What did you do, bastard?
You call yourself a doctor?

319
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,210
Then... what did you do?

320
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,214
Let me.

321
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,235
Here.

322
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,438
What?

323
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,536
What is it?

324
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,436
Can't you see? It's your shop's lease.

325
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,477
Why'd you bring it back? You acted
like you were gonna hit it big.

326
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,519
I was just teasing you to see
how you'd react.

327
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,358
Is it so much fun for you
to drive me crazy?

328
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,094
Is it?

329
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,869
Yeah, it is.

330
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,173
I live for that.
What are you gonna do?

331
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,742
Rotten bastard!

'Traditional Treatment Methods
for Women Disease'

333
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,903
Oh, I thought you were on the phone
with some guy...

334
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,464
Lee Won-jae?

335
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,442
It's the 20 grand we talked about.
Count them.

336
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,278
That's okay.

337
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,515
You don't have a sick person
in your family, do you?

338
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,189
What? No. Why?

339
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,497
Oh, just checking...

340
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,500
Let's start with a variety show
next week.

341
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,829
Show, show, show! Good?

342
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,366
Quite a show you're putting on.

343
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,940
Take this back.

344
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,805
- This is all a con!
- A con?

345
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,550
Fraud, don't you know?

346
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,547
You bad people...

347
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,691
Lee Won-jae, Jung Ae-suk,
Kim Young-man,

348
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,922
Teacher Kwak Hyung-min, what's this?

349
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,992
- You want us to find these people?
- Yes.

350
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,697
Why do we have to?

351
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:00,579
These are the people my wife
wants to see for the last time.

352
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,680
So, why do we have to find them?

353
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,721
Are we a reunion website? To hunt
down classmates and teachers?

354
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,121
There's no one else I can ask.

355
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,521
So you do it.

356
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,398
How can I leave my wife's side
when she can go any day?

357
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,702
Whatever, just don't bother me. Okay?

358
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,900
All I can think of is the 20 grand.
Go away.

359
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,249
Are you gonna make me call the police?

360
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,284
- Hello?
- Hey, hey.

361
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,549
- Don't put on a show, man.
- Hello. Police Department.

362
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,284
What's wrong with you?

363
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,258
There isn't much time left.

364
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,000
You're driving me nuts. Damn.

365
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,932
Bro, this can be more rewarding
than cheating people.

366
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:59,342
And also, this Won-jae, see?

367
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,502
This Lee Won-jae, you have to find him.

368
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,576
- Lee Won-jae?
- Yes, him.

369
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,609
Please.

370
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,254
You said nightclubs
were too embarrassing.

371
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,591
He's got no more face
to be embarrassed about.

372
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,858
Hey, in my hey-day,
to live like a man...

373
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,469
We'll do our best.

374
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:32,098
We need... our money up front.

375
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,206
- Go!
- Come on, bro.

376
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:41,011
We got no bread.
You said for us to live like men.

377
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,328
We got a good deal, don't you think?

378
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,634
Please stop doing this.
This is pointless.

379
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,945
I'm afraid people will find about
the kid's clothes from last time, too.

380
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,781
Then don't tell anyone.

381
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:27,091
I'll bring it up to him once but don't
get your hopes up too much.

382
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:32,268
When women interfere in men's work,
it becomes trouble.

383
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,035
Oh, what's wrong?

384
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,506
Are you okay?

385
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,648
Wake up!

386
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,441
Jungyeon!

387
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,344
Yong-gi, are you okay?

388
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,457
That crazy bastard always hits
someone when he gets drunk.

389
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,284
Come, sit here.

390
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,763
So why'd you keep talking back for?

391
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,595
Hey, I'm okay so...
go and get the rest of our money.

392
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,899
Okay, okay...

393
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,599
Double nose-bleed...

394
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,417
Oh, you're awake.

395
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:33,224
- Who... brought me here?
- A lady.

396
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,733
- Where is she now?
- She's talking with the doctor.

397
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,757
Hello? Is Jung Yong-gi there?

398
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,237
It must be hard for you to understand.

399
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,467
Why? Is it a crime to be sick?

400
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,040
You see, my husband,
he needs to be able to smile.

401
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,783
- Is that so important?
- It is.

402
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,086
It is most important to me.

403
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:43,631
I haven't done anything for him.
I don't want to get in his way.

404
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:55,835
I beg you, please keep my secret.

405
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,319
I wanted to do something for him...

406
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,566
What's this?

407
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,777
- What?
- Don't you know what this is?

408
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:38,686
Oh, that? I got paid with that.

409
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,589
When I was done, they whined about
having no cash and gave me that.

410
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,595
I threw a fit saying I wouldn't take it...
You mean, they sent it home?

411
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,664
Hey, why don't you take it?

412
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,070
What was the job?

413
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,534
Oh, just a little show...

414
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,805
I filled in at my friend's club.

415
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,947
Why do you live like that?

416
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,755
You're all talk...
Is that the best you can do?

417
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,156
Oh, well... It's supposed to be
good for women so have some.

418
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,696
You take it!

419
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,188
Just take it if I say so!

420
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,515
- Hey, bad move.
- No, it's not.

421
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,327
Dammit, that's a penalty!

422
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,089
Told ya, it was a bad move. Idiot!

423
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,098
- This sucks.
- Quiet!

424
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,703
Well, look at this. Go on, go on.

425
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,107
Who's Young-man?

426
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,705
Hak-chul, go ahead.

427
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,078
Why are you picking on me, huh?

428
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,345
I was just watching. Shit!

429
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,451
Quiet and I won't hurt you, okay?
Just be still.

430
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:24,992
You know Park Jung-yeon, right?

431
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,929
Jung-yeon Park or fucking whatever,
what do I...

432
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,393
Who?

433
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,293
Park Jung-yeon.

434
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,968
Don't you remember?
Your seatmate in grade school.

435
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:41,134
Jung-yeon... What about her?

436
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,152
What are you doing? Come on.

437
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,992
Do you know that show,
King of Comedy?

438
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,968
I'm gonna be on it next week.

439
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,106
Woo-jin told me to work hard
and win first prize.

440
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,239
It's not a nightclub.

441
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,672
Jung-yeon was a sweet girl
who kept to herself mostly.

442
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:28,884
I don't know why but I liked her a lot.

443
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:37,958
But I found out she liked
someone else.

444
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,093
Jung-yeon, I found out!

445
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:48,504
He transferred from Seoul.

446
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:53,502
He's really good at soccer.
He's even gonna be a pro player!

447
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,919
I have no idea why she'd want to
see me.

448
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:42,523
Why would I see her?
And she has no reason to see me.

449
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,854
If we got together,
it'd be immoral, not right.

450
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,055
Well, there is such a thing
as memories...

451
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:53,294
Memories? That's nonsense!

452
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,604
I'm busy earning a living.
What good are memories?

453
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,141
- Hak-chul, pull over.
- You gotta pee?

454
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,885
- Get out.
- Why?

455
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:14,513
Just get out. You talk too much!
If I say get out, get out!

456
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,460
Look, dickhead. She's better off
not meeting a dickhead like you.

457
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,359
- But you said...
- Never mind.

458
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,624
Go play your cards! Let's go.

459
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,028
Hey!

460
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,096
Hey!

461
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,904
I'll kill you!

462
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,742
Hey!

463
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,998
I told you, what did I say?

464
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,894
They won't even open the door!

465
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,537
They won't wear it. Why'd you go
to the trouble of knitting 2?

466
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,079
Let's go.

467
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,620
We'll come back another time.

468
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,448
How have you been?

469
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:59,788
Father... how are you feeling?

470
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,028
I feel well enough to die.

471
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:05,891
I see...

472
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,804
And you, mother?

473
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,506
I live because I can't die.

474
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,575
You ran out saying you wouldn't be
back! Why are you here?

475
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:22,809
Oh, father. The ties between parents
and children can't be easily...

476
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,720
- Please.
- Before I throw this...

477
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,719
Say what you're here to say.
And get out!

478
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,195
My wife and I are living very well.

479
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,454
Our happiness is...

480
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,461
- Why you brat...
- Please, dear!

481
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:42,431
Father... I have something to tell you.

482
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,877
Yes, it's been a long wait.

483
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,542
The second half of King of Comedy
will now begin!

484
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,387
- Hyo-jin.
- Yes.

485
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,857
I'm excited to see what stars
the second half will bring.

486
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,996
- Yes. Welcome our first contestants.
- Who are they?

487
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,359
- Warriors.
- Welcome!

488
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,635
Arrogant pig, today is your funeral.

489
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,769
Attack!

490
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,556
The difference between
Eminem and Jay Leno?

491
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,658
Yo, my name is Eminem.

492
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:44,267
Hey, folks, this is Jay Leno!

493
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,631
Vocal mimicry of Sin Mun-sun.
It's short so listen well.

494
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:49,703
Thank you.

495
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:54,173
Why did you follow me? Why?

496
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,211
Bang! Bang!

497
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,415
The bitch is not home yet.
I'm gonna...

498
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,554
- Mother, I'm sorry.
- You brat!

499
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,553
What have you been up to all night?

500
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,057
- Actually, mother, it's not that.
- Close your mouth!

501
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:19,031
In our family, you know if you lie,
you'll be petrified!

502
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,261
- Yes, mother.
- Good.

503
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:26,899
Now answer my questions truthfully.
Where did you sleep last night?

504
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,511
- At a friend's house. Ah!
- You!

505
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,383
You didn't sleep at a friend's house!

506
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,548
Did you sleep with a man last night?

507
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,948
No, mother. I didn't.

508
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,749
Oh, did you sleep in that position?
Did you?

509
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,859
You have brought shame on
our family name!

510
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:50,899
In my 30 years as a widow,
I never did anything like what you did!

511
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,839
...quarter finalists, Comedy Valley team!

512
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,508
Warriors!

513
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,318
And the Jung Yong-gi and
Yang Chul-soo duo!

514
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,850
Congratulations.
We'll see you next time...

515
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,861
Warriors!

516
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,231
And the Jung Yong-gi and
Yang Chul-soo duo!

517
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,392
Congratulations.

518
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:33,066
We'll see you next time. Good-bye.

519
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,771
Wow, my wife waited up for me?

520
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,614
Where did you get so drunk?

521
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,552
What's the matter with you?

522
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,955
Can't I have a drink?

523
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:51,788
What's that now?

524
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,600
Even the asses at the TV station
gave us this instead of cash.

525
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,903
Do you think you're making sense?

526
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:11,874
Am I? Did I buy this with the money?

527
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:19,386
Anyway, they say it's really good
for you...

528
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,956
...so boil it for a long time
before taking it.

529
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,591
You asked me to keep you
in luxury, right?

530
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:35,528
Just wait a little.
Today, I was a hit!

531
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,938
Do you know how funny
I was at the TV station today?

532
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:47,145
Jung-yeon. Don't look down on me.
