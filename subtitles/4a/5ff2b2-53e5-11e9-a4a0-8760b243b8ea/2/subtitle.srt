1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,533
Oh, you hopeless nut-case!

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,696
Please get your act together!

3
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:36,430
Jung-yeon... I'm sorry.

4
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,467
You've just made it
to the quarterfinals.

5
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,212
Do your best, Yong-gi.

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,926
Oh, Jung-yeon?

7
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,030
I know her well. We went to the
same elementary and junior high.

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,326
How many years ago was that?

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,876
Jung-yeon! Jung-yeon!

10
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,080
- I finally found out. I did.
- What?

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,079
- Your crush!
- Really?

12
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,657
I finally found out
where he goes to school.

13
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,851
Really?

14
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,758
Where? Where is it?

15
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:43,231
Whenever Jung-yeon got a chance,
she flew to Suwon to see him.

16
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,335
- Suwon? Not Seoul?
- It was Suwon.

17
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,067
I'm positive. I don't know how many
times I bought the ticket.

18
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,245
But wasn't his name Wonjae Lee?

19
00:01:54,547 --> 00:02:01,214
Lee Won-jae... No, it wasn't that.
What was his name...

20
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,289
His last name was Kang or something.

21
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,824
I'm going crazy.
Who the hell is this guy?

22
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,120
Okay. Enough baking.
Let's go. Hey, hey.

23
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:17,470
- Do I really have to go?
- What?

24
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,833
You see, actually, there's something
I used to say to her all the time...

25
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,339
When I grew up, I'd become
a big success...

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,241
...and flip this country upside down!

27
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,044
So?

28
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,517
Well, forget about the country,
all I'm flipping is this here bread.

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,824
- So...
- I'm embarrassed to see her.

30
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,792
It's only nice to meet old friends
if you're doing well.

31
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,368
Why are you looking at me like that?

32
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,440
Is that so? Then forget about it.

33
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,266
Bro!

34
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:01,278
Why bring someone who doesn't wanna
see her? Keep flipping. Let's go.

35
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:06,511
Jung-yeon is doing well... right?

36
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,289
Welcome.

37
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,337
Have you been well?

38
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,031
You must be surprised to see us
here so suddenly...

39
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,994
We came here to say something to you.

40
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,512
No matter what,
you're our daughter-in-law.

41
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,849
Our only son's wife.

42
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:20,889
Actually, it was because
we didn't approve of our clown son...

43
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:28,631
...who wouldn't listen to us.
It wasn't because we didn't like you.

44
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:36,173
Forgive us for not treating you right.

45
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,114
The unpleasantness...

46
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:51,515
Let's forget about that now.

47
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,903
Sweetheart...

48
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,271
Yes?

49
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:22,214
Let's go somewhere together.

50
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,937
Hello.

51
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,073
A picture, all of a sudden...

52
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,856
Ready... Look here.

53
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,195
Sit down, please.

54
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,636
Mom...

55
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:58,576
Today, I took a family picture
with my husband's parents.

56
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,350
They both wore the sweaters
I knitted for them.

57
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:19,767
And now... they say they welcome
me as their daughter-in-law.

58
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:34,845
I really blamed you for not telIing me
about your illness...

59
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,115
... until you were about to die.

60
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:46,397
But now...
I think I know how you felt then.

61
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,103
Mom...

62
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,871
I feel so bad for my Yong-gi...

63
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,750
He's been so good to me.

64
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,388
My Yong-gi,
he can't do anything without me.

65
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,060
My Yong-gi,
what is he going to do, mom...

66
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm in trouble. I'm so nervous!

67
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:48,753
Let's start. 'How can this be?'

68
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,394
The President Kim missile... '

69
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,098
Your action is weak. When you enter...

70
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,867
Once again. One, two, three.

71
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,012
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

72
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,640
I'll be back before the taping starts.

73
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:15,379
- Are you out of your mind?
- I just wanna see my wife, that's all.

74
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,056
What? See what?

75
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:46,015
- Hello?
- Ma'am, this is your husband.

76
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,451
- What...
- Well...

77
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,753
In a little bit, there will be a funny
show. Please be sure to watch.

78
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,926
- Okay.
- You have to watch. You have to!

79
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,858
I said, oKay.

80
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,732
Alright, ma'am. I'll see you later.

81
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,060
Jung Yong-gi, that dickhead!
Why isn't the idiot here?

82
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,289
- Well, it's not...
- Do you wanna blow the taping?

83
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,866
He said he'd be right back.

84
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,233
And if he isn't...
are you gonna take responsibility?

85
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,568
Don't worry. He said he'd be here.

86
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,639
- Shut your mouth, asshole.
- I'm sorry.

87
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,503
What the hell are you? Why I outta...

88
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,273
Get ready, dickheads.

89
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,845
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

90
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,328
- Let's go.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

91
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:10,425
With 3 of our semi-finalists determined,
we'll an nounce our last semi-finalists.

92
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,070
- We only have one more slot.
- Yes.

93
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,638
And the winners are...

94
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,640
...the Yong-gi Jung and
Chulsoo Yang duo.

95
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:29,648
Congratulations.

96
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,525
Next week, we'll bring you
the 4 semi-finalist teams...

97
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,637
Hey, guys.

98
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,870
Do you know if Kwak Hyung-min
still teaches at this school?

99
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,943
- Mr. Kwak?
- Yeah.

100
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:01,052
- You know, octopus.
- Oh, you mean, octopus head?

101
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,412
Octopus?

102
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,119
Here, read this once.

103
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:12,926
They're poems Jung-yeon wrote.
She was a very sensitive girl.

104
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,667
Oh, we don't need to read this...

105
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,534
Actually, I feel weird when I'm in
a teachers' room.

106
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,902
- Shall we go?
- One second.

107
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,376
My hair...

108
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,660
'In my memories, there is only you.'

109
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,169
'Afraid if our eyes met,
the longing may fly away...'

110
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,433
'In my memories, there is only you.'

111
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,979
'Afraid if our eyes met,
the longing may fly away.'

112
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,310
'Afraid if we spoke, the happiness
may only be a moment.'

113
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,887
'I spent such a long time
hanging from a far, watching you.'

114
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,697
'In my memories, there is only you.'

115
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,503
Sir, aren't we gonna study?

116
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,481
- Is that so important to you?
- I need to go to college.

117
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,986
The person who wrote
on the bathroom wall...

118
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,125
...that Jung-yeon and I were dating.

119
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,594
- It was you, Hae-Kyung, wasn't it?
- No, she wrote that.

120
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,289
Hey! You wrote that
they slept together!

121
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,500
- You're full of crap!
- You said you saw them.

122
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,531
Quiet!

123
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,274
Grade school, junior high,
highschool...

124
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,241
Quite a faithful girl, alright!

125
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,313
Does she think she's Juliet?

126
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,981
- What?
- Never mind.

127
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,619
By the way, wasn't her crush
Lee Won-jae?

128
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,785
I don't know his name.

129
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,217
This is driving me up the wall!

130
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,956
- Well, let's get going.
- Please wait!

131
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,488
Why?

132
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,562
I'm sorry but I think it'd be better
if I didn't see Jung-yeon.

133
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,203
Now what?

134
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,639
Oh, that looks so good. Cheers.

135
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,312
Wow, with a famous hubby,

136
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,109
...you can take us to a fancy place
like this. How great!

137
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,113
That's why a person's gotta be
successful.

138
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,550
Now that he's famous, we can eat here.

139
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,087
If not, you think this stingy
would take us here?

140
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,691
- No way.
- You're right.

141
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,625
Don't be so tacky.
Slow down and eat up.

142
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,094
Okay.

143
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:04,963
My heart's in my throat.
I can't even swallow.

144
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,797
This place has great atmosphere,
right?

145
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,032
- Yeah. Wow.
- Really cool.

146
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,175
Jeez, talk about tacky!
How embarrassing.

147
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,784
I'm so embarrassed...

148
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,792
Hello.

149
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,722
How did it go?

150
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,228
- What about the people?
- Don't even mention them.

151
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,064
Do your homework before sending
someone off, dumbass!

152
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,138
We met with everyone
but they didn't want to see her.

153
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,504
What?

154
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,476
- Why not?
- No clue!

155
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,937
Then what about Won-jae?

156
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,480
He's in the U.S. on business
till next week.

157
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,014
Hey, forget about Won-jae.

158
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,515
Your wife has had a lifelong crush
on someone. Who's that?

159
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,824
- Lifelong?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,488
Who is he?

161
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't know. If I did, I would have
dragged him here, stupid.

162
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,570
She never told me.

163
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,236
See, no communication
between the two of them.

164
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,273
In any case, forget about it.
Leave us alone.

165
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,809
We've done our best, okay?
This is it.

166
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,674
Over! See ya.

167
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:27,012
Hey, octopus head gave this to us.
Take it. Let's go.

168
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,721
What's wrong with you today?

169
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,900
Oh, I'm just surprised, that's all.

170
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,804
Getting married... With whom?

171
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,110
Oh, remember? I showed you
a picture last time. It's him.

172
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:58,578
That guy, he even has a kid.
You must be crazy.

173
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,311
His son's name is Dong-uk.
He's so cute.

174
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,251
Boy, you're totally into him.

175
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,022
I know, it's so great.

176
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,090
Jung-yeon, don't look at me like that.

177
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:21,167
Just like you love Yong-gi,
I love him and Dong-uk.

178
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,536
Welcome.

179
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,839
Please take it.

180
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,836
If I knitted better, I could have
given it to you sooner.

181
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,134
Wear it in the fall when it gets colder.

182
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,505
Oh, I'll just wear it now.

183
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,377
- It's too warm now.
- Who cares?

184
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,215
The colors are great!

185
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,849
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, I really like it.

186
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,024
- It looks good on you.
- But what's this?

187
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,827
Something's stuck.

188
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,527
- What is this?
- What is it?

189
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:13,705
Actually,
I bought this a long time ago.

190
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,677
Let me see your hand.

191
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:24,547
How do you like it? It fits, right?

192
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,764
Thanks for the sweater.

193
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:42,604
Man, I look so scruffy.
Mr. Scruffy. Damn.

194
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,443
Yes, yes, they're ready.

195
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,249
- Alright! Are we good?
- Yes.

196
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,180
- Let's go.
- Yep.

197
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,321
Yong-gi, let's go.

198
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,602
Jung-yeon, wake up!

199
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,472
Jung-yeon!

200
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,614
What are you doing? We're up!

201
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,018
- She's not at home or at the store.
- Enough already. We have go!

202
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,648
What are you waiting for! Come on!

203
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,418
Yong-gi, let's go!

204
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:47,338
Jung-yeon, can you hear me?

205
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,596
- I was lonely so I had a fling.
- A fling?

206
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,438
You must be crazy!
Now you're calling me a man?

207
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,523
Hey, is there supposed to be a phone?

208
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,820
- That's not right.
- It's not in here.

209
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:47,295
What the heck? Who's calling...

210
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,594
Oh, darling. Let me just answer it.

211
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,027
Hello?

212
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,134
What?

213
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,783
Okay... I'll be right there.

214
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,249
Who is it? It's her, isn't it?

215
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,983
What are you looking at?
Why are you... looking at me...

216
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,458
Chul-soo...

217
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,096
I'm sorry! Good heavens...

218
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,861
- You're ditching me?
- Hey, hey... What's he doing?

219
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,029
Oh my goodness!

220
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,138
Jung-yeon, are you going
to be alright?

221
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,307
- Are you sure?
- We'll be right back.

222
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,582
What are you doing here?

223
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,725
Jung-yeon...

224
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,894
You... have to stay here
a little longer.

225
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:08,733
What are you saying?
It's nothing. Don't worry.

226
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,701
Jung-yeon, please...

227
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:18,648
What's wrong?
It's nothing, really. Go.

228
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,377
Stop it now!

229
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,762
- I'm fine. What's the matter?
- I know everything!

230
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,497
Everything!

231
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,531
Why can't you ask me, huh?

232
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,979
To hold you, to help you,
to comfort you...

233
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,778
Why can't you tell me the truth?

234
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,548
What... have you heard?

235
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,049
There's nothing wrong with me.
You've heard wrong.

236
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:06,186
It's not me so don't worry about me.
It's not me. I'm fine!

237
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,692
Please stop!

238
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:15,598
Don't do this. It's not me.
I told you...

239
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:22,505
Don't! Just go and do your work.
I'm fine. Please, don't.

240
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:29,618
Don't do this. It's harder for me.
You shouldn't. Stop!

241
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:36,985
I told you I'm okay.
It's not me, it's not me...

242
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,870
It's not me...

243
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,090
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

244
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,195
- We'll see you later.
- Thank you. Bye.

245
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:32,600
You think this makes
you a good hubby?

246
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:40,677
- Did I say anything?
- You're really bad.

247
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,851
I know.

248
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,458
Get some sleep.

249
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:58,732
Yong-gi! Sleep here.

250
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,845
Are you asleep?

251
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,433
I'm sorry... Yong-gi.

252
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,736
Did you sleep well?

253
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,001
What are you doing standing there?
Go wash up.

254
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,125
Yong-gi.

255
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:43,994
I need a favor. Will you do it?

256
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,140
No matter how busy you are,
make sure you eat.

257
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,451
I know it's bothersome but
make sure you wear clean clothes.

258
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:07,490
Sleep at home.
Don't sleep just anywhere.

259
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,061
And...

260
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:30,740
I want you to keep making people
laugh no matter what happens.

261
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,541
It's what you're best at.

262
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,163
Is that all?

263
00:32:54,772 --> 00:33:00,972
Is that all... you want?

264
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,687
The stew's getting cold. Eat up.

265
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,224
Don't worry.

266
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,239
Don't worry.

267
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,776
Woo-jin...

268
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:19,920
Mom... is going there to see you.

269
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,636
Sorry, but we're...

270
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:23,182
Jung-yeon. Park Jung-yeon!

271
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,285
Ae-suk...

272
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,625
What brings you here?

273
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
Hey, Yong-gi.

274
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,470
Did you transfer to Seoul
in the 3rd grade?

275
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,801
Yes.

276
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,177
Right.

277
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,179
The person your wife has been
yearning for her whole life...

278
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,049
... is right here!

279
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,424
You made us suffer for nothing!

280
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,294
Don't bother us again, okay?

281
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,906
Oh, I see. So that's how it ended up.

282
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,246
- What about you?
- I already have 2 brats.

283
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,682
- The boys are 3 and 5.
- Wow!

284
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:34,651
I really missed you. Did you know that?

285
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,192
Same here, girlfriend.

286
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,129
I kept seeing you in my dreams.
So I felt like I had to see you.

287
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,363
- I'm glad we got together like this.
- So am I. I'm so happy!

288
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,404
Jung-yeon, I have to go.

289
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,783
- Why?
- Oh, you know, things.

290
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,979
- Still, stay a little longer.
- I'll visit again soon.

291
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,353
Stay a little more.
We have lots to talk about.

292
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,160
I'll come again.

293
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:20,402
Jung-yeon. Take good care of yourself.

294
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,647
Oh, I'm so curious.
Jung-yeon, who is he?

295
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,777
- It's a secret. Who's yours?
- It's also a secret.

296
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,590
- See, you won't tell me, either!
- It's because I'm embarrassed.

297
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,055
Then let's do this.

298
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,032
Circle his face in this picture and
we won't look until we get home.

299
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,397
Okay.

300
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,075
- No lying!
- And no telling!

301
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:21,521
Yong-gi. It's time. Let's get ready.

302
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,938
We're about to start. Please enter!

303
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,920
Yes, it's been a long wait.

304
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,996
Let's begin the finals
of King of Comedy.

305
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,032
- Hyo-jin.
- Yes.

306
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,035
For the final round,
we've moved to a bigger stage.

307
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,672
Yes, it's quite impressive.

308
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,837
Who are the first heroes
to grace the stage?

309
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,382
They've turned the comedy world
upside down.

310
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,313
Please welcome the Jung Yong-gi
and Yang Chul-soo duo!

311
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,248
Give them a big hand!

312
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,151
Look at them.
They even know how to mime.

313
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,077
Yong-gi...

314
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:23,717
I wish for you to bring warm laughter
even to those who are suffering.

315
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,758
In order to do that, they say
you need to know tears first.

316
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,737
It may be heartless of me
to leave you behind.

317
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:41,367
But I wish that even this pain
can become a present for you.

318
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:49,079
Just like you were the biggest
present the world had given me.

319
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,390
By the way, Yong-gi, do you know?

320
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,251
When it was I first started
to like you?

321
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,626
What treasure do you want the most?

322
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,167
I hid them over there
so go look for them.

323
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,066
This is what you're looking for, okay?

324
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,606
Alright, go!

325
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,449
I got one!

326
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,611
Here.

327
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,913
Yong-gi! They're having
a talent contest! Hurry!

328
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,284
Okay. Got it!

329
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,961
Hey, wait for me!

330
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:16,565
'Treasure: a box of crayons'

331
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:25,743
My heart grows tender...

332
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,020
Our fate twirls round-n-round.

333
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:37,093
With the fading time,
I'm afraid our love will grow apart.

334
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,661
What am I to do?

335
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,294
Our fate twirls round-n-round.

336
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,733
With the fading time...

337
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:57,174
Teacher.
May I have that picture, please?
