1
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,905
- Who did you say was getting married?
- Isn't it the eldest son?

2
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,808
No... I think it's the younger daughter

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,404
- Long time no see
- How are you?

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,406
Did you check out the groom?

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,979
- He's pretty cute
- I'm so jealous

6
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,917
Hey, what's up?
Yeah

7
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,724
Hold on a sec

8
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,795
Why are you so late?

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,674
Hey, the bouquet!
You're not supposed to do that

10
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,509
Come here you little brat
You folks are here

11
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,815
- Ain't this little Wonny boy?
- You should say hello to him Won

12
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,050
You've grown so much
How old are you?

13
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:33,854
How old are you?

14
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,026
Five?

15
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:42,669
It's great that you're doing so much
for the wedding. It must be a handful for you

16
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,366
- Don't mention it... mother's over there
- Okay

17
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,444
- Congratulations
- It's such a pleasure to see you all

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,277
- You must be thrilled. Congratulations
- Thanks

19
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,051
When I received the invitation
I thought it was the elder one

20
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,384
What can I say... they surprised me too

21
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,420
You're a bit
disappointed though, aren't you?

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,585
Well, the second one's already married

23
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,294
Besides, I don't think
people care these days

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,756
But still, it's not the same

25
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,096
We'll see you later

26
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,566
Good to see you

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,008
So, when will we hear
the big news from you Professor?

28
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,580
- I'll see you later
- Sure. Take care

29
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,418
You holding up okay there?

30
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,887
It's not like I'm getting married

31
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,621
You remember
Kyu-jin's brother, don't you?

32
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,713
Sure

33
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,086
Don't forget, 3 o'clock sharp

34
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,848
And, don't fuck it up

35
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,453
Pleasure seeing you Mrs. Kim

36
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,828
Nice seeing you too, Kyu-jin

37
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,421
You must be very excited

38
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,625
Actually, I'm stressed
out about Joon-young

39
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,598
Why don't you set
him up with a nice girl?

40
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,761
Actually, I'm setting him up
on a blind date today as we speak

41
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,066
- Really?
- Yes

42
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,108
Who might this be?

43
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,743
She's my girlfriend's close friend

44
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,971
and she's very nice

45
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,477
That's great

46
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,515
You should convince him to stay with her

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,039
He listens to you

48
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,483
- I wouldn't worry too much
- Okay

49
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,289
Where's your brother?

50
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,493
- What?
- Really?

51
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,293
- He was here before
- Oh yeah?

52
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,362
Should I go find him?

53
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,430
He probably left already

54
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,935
He missed the picture for my
wedding too. Don't worry about it

55
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,972
Here we go people
All the way over there...

56
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:32,468
The gentleman with glasses...
will you push in a little?

57
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:41,382
Please look over here everyone
Looking good One, two

58
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:49,551
Marriage is a crazy thing

59
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,103
3 o'clock in front of KFC on College St

60
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,765
with a rolled up newspaper

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,240
That was supposed to be the sign
for meeting a woman named Yeon-hee

62
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,581
Enjoy your meal

63
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,751
May I help you?

64
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,681
Are there other KFCs around here?

65
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,419
No

66
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:22,996
What's wrong?

67
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,523
Someone asked the same
exact question a little while ago

68
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,572
Not bad at all

69
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,472
Let's hope that the girl's
that much hot a least

70
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:38,978
Excuse me

71
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,071
Can I borrow a light?

72
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,201
Excuse me

73
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,903
Aren't you Kyu-jin's friend?

74
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,363
Are you Yeon-hee Kang?

75
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,269
I'm sorry I'm late

76
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,738
I was just about to leave actually

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,178
I'm so sorry. I was taking a nap

78
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,321
Coffee's on me since I almost stood you up

79
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,857
Let's go

80
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,124
Blind Date

81
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,366
Were you really gonna leave?

82
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,200
I thought I was stood up

83
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,443
Strangely enough there was
another guy next to me

84
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,934
with a rolled up newspaper

85
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,172
Really?

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,943
I just stood there for a while
but then felt a bit uncomfortable

87
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,676
so I wanted to leave

88
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,259
So, do you know Kyu-jin from college?

89
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,931
We've been friends since Junior High

90
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,169
I heard a lot about you from Yu-ri

91
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,033
Honestly heard some really nice things

92
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,408
What did she say?

93
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,009
She said that you were attractive and nice

94
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,249
Guess she was right and wrong

95
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,783
No...

96
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,553
you're much more attractive
than I originally expected actually

97
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,552
I know...

98
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,288
I was talking about the latter

99
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,102
May I ask what you do for a living?

100
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
What?

101
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,031
Yu-ri didn't tell me much about you

102
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,701
You know the drill...
age, occupation, schools

103
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,945
I don't think they're that important

104
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,674
Well, sometimes people like to get
minor things out of their way

105
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,583
If they were really important
wouldn't you wanna save it for last?

106
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,423
That's very true

107
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,251
I teach part time at a university

108
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,730
What do you teach?

109
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,924
English Literature

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,067
So, how do you make a living?

111
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:55,568
Well... I'm early in my career
so I'm barely getting by for now

112
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,979
How about siblings?

113
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,413
I have a brother and
a sister and I'm the eldest

114
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,881
Right

115
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,854
If you get married...

116
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:13,724
My chances of making this
beautiful woman mine was very slim

117
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:20,027
She made it seem like this was
only one of the many blind dates she's been on

118
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:27,697
But then
I was no stranger to blind dates either

119
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,331
What can you cook best?

120
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,777
Bean Sprout Bibimbap

121
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,808
Bean Sprout Bibimbap?

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,186
That's all you got?

123
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,917
Our dull and empty
conversation continued

124
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:50,824
And her smile reminded me of a kind
you only see in impersonal portraits

125
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:56,863
That's what made it so hard for me
to tell how she really felt about me

126
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,840
How did you like it?

127
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,776
It was whatever I guess I mean...
it had absolutely no plot

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,287
Yeah... but it was still entertaining I think

129
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,091
Guess that's the beauty
of a Hollywood feature

130
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,423
I'm kind of hungry
You wanna go get dinner?

131
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,098
The problem wasn't the movie

132
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:32,866
I was following
the typical blind date procedure

133
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,706
How about a drink?

134
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,174
Not a big drinker really

135
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,145
A glass of beer won't kill you

136
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,282
- Guess I'll just have one
- Thanks

137
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,795
Cheers

138
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,903
You can drink very well

139
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,115
I guess today's one of those days

140
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,458
The bus is taking too long

141
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,208
How's the tea?

142
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,076
Well... it sure goes well
with the Gayagum sound

143
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,806
I know

144
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,985
One more Pine Leaf Ale please

145
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,956
You sure you can handle that?

146
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,719
Thanks

147
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,733
Let me get that

148
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,177
To tell you the truth

149
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,516
I already saw that movie

150
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,993
I actually went on another
blind date the other day

151
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,691
Don't you find it funny that

152
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,793
I had to sit through
the same movie twice?

153
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,469
I mean, how sad is this?

154
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:58,315
I went on more than ten
blind dates this month alone

155
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,525
I don't know if marriage is
worth doing after all this trouble

156
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,664
Excuse me
Can we get another glass over here?

157
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,299
That was good, thanks

158
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,238
Yeah, I had fun myself

159
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,203
I bet the train stopped running

160
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,141
I think the bus stopped running too

161
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,150
What do we do now?

162
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,086
We should just hope
that we don't blank out

163
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,151
Where are you going?

164
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,257
I'm getting a cab

165
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,288
Okay

166
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,427
Can you get home alright?

167
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,865
Why? Are you gonna
take me home or something?

168
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,868
Why not

169
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,886
I think...

170
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:17,988
it'll be much cheaper
to check-in to a motel though

171
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,125
You know what, you're right

172
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,671
The cab fare will probably be more

173
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,667
Don't take it off
Put it in now

174
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,731
What?

175
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,304
Don't take it off and just put it in

176
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,870
One sec

177
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,006
Put it in

178
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,278
You're not even wet yet

179
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,451
I like it better that way

180
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,622
Pull out before you cum

181
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,703
The guy was ugly, wasn't he?

182
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,679
Who are you talking about?

183
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,544
The guy that was
next to you with the newspaper

184
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,048
Oh that guy...

185
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,483
Actually he was okay

186
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,951
Really? No way

187
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,222
- You know him?
- I met him last night on the internet

188
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,334
He insisted on meeting me

189
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,937
so I was gonna weigh out
you two and choose

190
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,443
Was he really good looking?

191
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,146
Sure

192
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,179
That really sucks, huh?

193
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,590
Probably should've met with him, right?

194
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,889
He called himself a stud

195
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,457
Supposedly an engineer

196
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,755
and even owns a store or something

197
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,699
He even seemed rather innocent

198
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,129
Said he was seriously on a mission...

199
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,338
to find his mate on the internet

200
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,638
So why were you so late?

201
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,243
I missed the bus

202
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,182
Should've caught that one

203
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,814
What kind of a loser looks
for his mate on the internet?

204
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,226
Stop

205
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:18,431
I could be on a date with that
hot KFC girl too if it weren't for you

206
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,934
KFC girl?

207
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,573
Yeah

208
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,074
- Was she pretty?
- Sure

209
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,074
She had her hair tied back with a hat on

210
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,910
She was much younger
and prettier than you actually

211
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,426
What if...

212
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,698
You ended up with that other guy...

213
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,758
and me with the KFC girl?

214
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,467
What do you think
would've happened then?

215
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,168
Are you sleeping?

216
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,001
Guess you'd be sleeping
in the next room with that girl

217
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,775
Anything better than that?

218
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:11,918
Then you'd be asking her
the same exact question

219
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,227
What do you think
would've happened to me

220
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,718
if I went on a blind date as planned?

221
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,730
The main character of this poem Prufrock

222
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,172
...is a cynical character with
a rather strong sense of self

223
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,973
Should I just suck it up and propose?

224
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,240
No... it's not worth doing

225
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:44,745
Yet, great poetry is made possible
by these personal and trivial daydreams

226
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,617
Professor

227
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,594
Here... have this

228
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,724
Thank you. Appreciate it

229
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,796
You know that video tape
you were talking about earlier?

230
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,408
What video tape?

231
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,639
You briefly talked about
that movie before the Elliad lecture

232
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,870
Oh... you mean Requiem?

233
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,413
Yeah, that's it

234
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,476
Is there any chance that
I can borrow that from you?

235
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,686
It's actually a video CD
and I still haven't seen it

236
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,914
And it doesn't even have a Korean subtitle

237
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,488
I still really want to watch it

238
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,452
Well... I guess you're no
leaving me with much of a choice here

239
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,126
Thank you

240
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,697
Should I just watch it with you
when you're watching it?

241
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,264
Well...

242
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,297
That's a promise

243
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,296
I don't think you even know my name

244
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,338
It's Sae-un Ryu

245
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,641
The Date

246
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,449
What are you smiling about?

247
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:54,819
Don't you find all rites of passage
like birth and marriage depressing?

248
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,428
You're the one that's depressing

249
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,487
No one's left but you now

250
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,898
Mind your own business. I'll be just fine

251
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,196
Anyway, congratulations Yu-ri

252
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:11,432
Fine my ass. Then why does
your mother always ask me...

253
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,035
if there are nice girls out there?

254
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,738
Relax

255
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:21,318
You're getting married late too

256
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,750
Oh yeah, how did it go?

257
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,186
What do you mean?

258
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,951
Yeon-hee

259
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,020
Right. How was it?

260
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,593
I set you up on a blind date
and no feedbacks?

261
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,604
- Hello?
- Joon-young?

262
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,438
It's me Yeon-hee

263
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,517
Oh... Yeon-hee

264
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,281
Oh... Yeon-hee? That's it?

265
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,586
Did you get home okay that night?

266
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,661
It's about time you ask me that

267
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,390
Why didn't you call me afterwards?

268
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,662
I was actually just about to

269
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,131
Guess I should've called later

270
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,599
I'm free tomorrow. Shall we meet up?

271
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,303
Sure

272
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,441
What do you want to do?

273
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,373
You wanna go for a bike ride?

274
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,318
Guess it's better than the whole
rolled-up newspaper scheme

275
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,339
Don't take it off, just do it

276
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:13,386
Why do you always have to
run to the bathroom after you cum?

277
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,893
I can't stand having cum on my body

278
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,758
You know, that's a huge turn-off

279
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,369
How come you never let me take it all off?

280
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,733
Because then, I can't get aroused

281
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,141
Why not?

282
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,947
When I look at someone
that's completely naked

283
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,275
it reminds me of chunk of meat

284
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,388
But then when the person has clothes on

285
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,424
I can really feel that person

286
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,962
You know, that unique
trait that gives you intimacy

287
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,224
From underwear?

288
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,662
Sure

289
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,596
That makes no sense

290
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:01,101
whatsoever I bet your ex-boyfriend
just had the same underwear as me

291
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,840
You never missed any bus that day

292
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,206
What?

293
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,212
You were there on time

294
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:18,520
You were hiding someplace so
that you can check out the both of us

295
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,558
Then you figured I was
cuter than the other guy

296
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:27,158
so you just waited till
the other guy left, right?

297
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,634
Whatever

298
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:37,701
If I were given the same choice
you had I would've gone for the KFC girl

299
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,440
Wait

300
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,547
How's this?

301
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,882
Don't I look young and cute also?

302
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,886
From behind you do

303
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:58,460
Well then, think of me
as that KFC girl from now, okay?

304
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,333
- Can't do it
- Why not?

305
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,062
Cause she actually seemed nice

306
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,698
Good one

307
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,730
Let's go

308
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,244
Where?

309
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,405
You're not gonna
stay here all day, are you?

310
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,379
Right on then

311
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,876
We'll be very formal
to each other from now

312
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,886
You'll take me to nice restaurants

313
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,722
...buy me roses and a teddy bear
when I go home, okay?

314
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,322
Why?

315
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,756
Because nice guys do all of that

316
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,797
Let's go to the mall first

317
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,534
Are you really going
to buy me all of that honey?

318
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,767
No, it's my nephew's birthday tomorrow

319
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,070
- Where are you going?
- What?

320
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,806
This is the home appliance corner

321
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,344
It is?

322
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,615
So let's take a look around real quick

323
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,313
Sure, ma'am

324
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,690
This is crystal

325
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,862
You can put this in an oven
or microwave, right?

326
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,164
We can put that on our dining table

327
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,174
Okay, enough

328
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,105
One sec

329
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,853
How about this honey?

330
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,888
They match

331
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,455
I'm good

332
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,327
C'mon... just for a minute

333
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,563
Don't you think we'll
look really good in these?

334
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,969
You have a great husband

335
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,711
I know

336
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,582
This is very popular
among the newly weds

337
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,174
You two look great in them

338
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,113
Really?

339
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,851
I guess we really do look
like newly weds, right?

340
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,026
I don't know about that but you can sure as
hell act. You should consider a career in acting

341
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,295
- It's just fun
- You think so?

342
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,654
Then we should do this
for the rest of our lives

343
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,655
For the rest of our lives?

344
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,326
Sure

345
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,434
Are you proposing?

346
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,365
No

347
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,773
Then?

348
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,933
We'll put on an act just like we did now

349
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,743
My mother would be so thrilled

350
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,472
No way

351
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,118
It's actually a lot easier than you'd think

352
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,107
What is?

353
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,754
You live separate

354
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,779
but for holidays you'll act
like a married couple

355
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,722
Holidays are what's tough
for singles, you know

356
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,685
That will never work
People will find out

357
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,388
No, you can be like a weekend couple

358
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,693
And then when parents come to visit

359
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:59,109
...complain about how your
husband never helps around the house

360
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,040
Then they'll never know
that it's all a show

361
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,880
What about friends?

362
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,016
That's actually quite simple as well

363
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:10,085
Just constantly complain about
the typical marriage problems like petty fights

364
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,590
Say things like
"My husband sits in his ass all day"

365
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:20,320
..."We always fight over who's
supposed to do laundry day and night"

366
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,298
- Sounds pretty easy
- It really is

367
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,264
What about sex?

368
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:34,170
- That should be real
- You are such a jerk

369
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:41,618
You're right though about
the whole marriage thing

370
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,013
I look at my friends that are married
and they all have the same problems

371
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,791
Every marriage is pretty much the same
It's like some sort of a franchise

372
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,824
Where are we going right now?

373
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,165
You have to get your nephew a present

374
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,359
Let's go

375
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,001
The skyline's so beautiful from up here

376
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,068
I know

377
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,369
Whenever I look at something like this

378
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,070
I immediately think of god

379
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:13,349
And how he must have this kind
of a bird's eye view of the world

380
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,556
Everything looks so beautiful
and peaceful from here

381
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,343
But then at this very moment

382
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,811
I'm sure God himself has
his mind on something else

383
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,812
Why?

384
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:49,012
Because there's a really
beautiful woman sitting in front of him

385
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,022
You didn't like that?

386
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,888
I liked it even if it was a lie

387
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,000
Just wish I could date people and

388
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,901
only have to hear nice things
like that for the rest of my life

389
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,672
You think my nephew
will really like what I got him?

390
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,009
I'm sure he will

391
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,177
Tell him to name all five of 'em

392
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,317
I'm getting setup with
another guy next week possibly

393
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,496
Did you just hear what I said?

394
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,588
Yeah

395
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,391
You think I should see him?

396
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,031
Do whatever you want

397
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,574
I knew you would say that

398
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,904
It's not like I can stop
you from seeing him

399
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,604
Guess you're right

400
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,319
But still
if you told me not to meet him

401
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,981
I would've at least acted
like I wasn't going to see him

402
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,183
Are you seriously thinking of marriage?

403
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,892
Of course. I'll get married
as soon as I find the right guy

404
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,194
Oh yeah? You? Marriage?

405
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,905
What? You don't think I can?

406
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,040
If you get married...

407
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,837
don't you think that
that's sort of a crime?

408
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,042
Whatever

409
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,009
I'm not talking about the virginity thing

410
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,186
If a woman like you get married

411
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,848
...do you think you can be
satisfied with just your husband?

412
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,046
You think that's possible?

413
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,459
Absolutely possible

414
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,495
I'll never ever get caught

415
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,745
One thing's for sure

416
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:10,222
You and I both always loved
someone ever since grade school

417
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:17,332
You think that's gonna change
that easily when you get married?

418
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,367
We don't stand a chance

419
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,332
You really think so?

420
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,972
Besides, you're not looking
for love on your blind dates anyway

421
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,573
What?

422
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,809
You're looking for certain conditions

423
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,849
Not the person, but who they
are and what they can offer you

424
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,629
What do you know anyway?

425
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,098
I wouldn't have gone
on that date regardless

426
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,762
I didn't measure up
to your high standards

427
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:56,273
so I was good for pleasure
Am I wrong?

428
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,443
I just wanted to know how
you would react, that's all

429
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,912
I never had any plans
for blind dates anyway

430
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,269
The Wedding

431
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,947
Hello?

432
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,744
It's me, Sae-un. Sae-un Ryu

433
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,150
Oh yeah

434
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,675
You remember the promise
from last time, right?

435
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,154
Sure

436
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,315
Do you have that CD on you?

437
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,559
Yeah, I brought it... where are you?

438
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,722
Just hold on one sec
I'm almost there

439
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,363
Hello, Professor

440
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,468
Hi

441
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,640
Are you enjoying the movie?

442
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:15,086
Frankly, it's sort of boring

443
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,213
but watching it with you is fun

444
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,353
What kind of after shave do you use?

445
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,684
I really like the smell

446
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,695
Oh yeah?

447
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,402
You can finish the rest and
return the CD to me later if you want

448
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,700
Okay, I will

449
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,347
Professor

450
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:58,261
Ever since I took your class
I wanted to kiss you

451
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,030
Why?

452
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,429
The way you taught was so cute

453
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,003
Oh yeah?

454
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,678
Thought you looked out
the window more than anything

455
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,810
Did I really?

456
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,719
Do you have someone you love?

457
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,917
Yes

458
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,690
Then you'll probably
get married soon, right?

459
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,057
Hello?

460
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,454
What are you doing?
Have a seat

461
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,563
How have you been?

462
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,858
Okay, yourself?

463
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,298
What are you doing here?
You're getting married tomorrow

464
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,438
It just sort of happened

465
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,600
I got things to say
to Ji-young and stuff

466
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,972
I need to go

467
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:30,045
Hey Ji-young! Ji-young!

468
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,893
It's not just about
Ji-young, you know

469
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:46,302
I just don't know about
this whole commitment thing

470
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:52,504
Are you afraid of
giving up your bachelor life?

471
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,445
If I could run away I would. Man

472
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,448
This really sucks

473
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,958
Asshole. You don't think
it's the same for Yu-ri?

474
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,093
I don't know man...

475
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,893
don't be surprised if
I don't show up tomorrow

476
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:20,464
Do you, Kyu-jin take Yu-ri as your
beloved wife for the rest of your life?

477
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,469
Yes

478
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,832
I was sort of counting on
Kyu-jin's marriage for some time

479
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:29,078
Because I thought it would be
a natural way of seeing Yeon-hee again

480
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:34,948
To be honest, I was regretting
what I had said to her earlier

481
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:39,384
I was positive that she would be
there since she was friends with the bride

482
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,959
But I couldn't find her
throughout the entire wedding ceremony

483
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,827
- Hey
- What?

484
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,352
- The flight's at seven o'clock, right?
- Yeah

485
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,230
If it's seven, they should
leave here at four at the latest

486
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,359
- Are you okay?
- What?

487
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,405
You're not the one
that's going on a honeymoon

488
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,430
Stop worrying and eat

489
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,676
Guess they're running late with
the after-ceremony. You want a drink?

490
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,210
I'm good

491
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,630
Please look at me

492
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,091
Oh, I'm sorry

493
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,465
Oh... thanks

494
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,611
Here are my friends
from Junior High

495
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,246
- Nice meeting you
- Nice meeting you too

496
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,838
You've seen Joon-young before

497
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,513
- This here is Eun-mi
- Hi, I heard a lot about you

498
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,821
- And this here is Ji-young
- How are you?

499
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,889
Where are you going
for your honeymoon?

500
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,881
To Bali. Make sure to come
over for our house forming party

501
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,827
Yu-ri, we're running tight on time

502
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,987
Hi

503
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,656
Hi, how are you?

504
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,468
Have fun

505
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,333
I'll call you

506
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,701
We shouId go drink more
We can't end it like this

507
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,563
So how long have
you all known each other?

508
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,930
Since Junior High

509
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,307
And you're not sick of them?

510
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,073
I don't really get to see them too often
so they're much better than my husband

511
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,040
You mean that?

512
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,476
Yeah

513
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,750
Uhhh...

514
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,654
I lost a turtle

515
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,933
I looked all over, but can't find it

516
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,796
Should I buy you another one?

517
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,875
I'm just saying that I lost one
One out of the five

518
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,705
If you lose all five, call me

519
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,975
I'll buy you all five of 'em again

520
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,159
Choice

521
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,693
How have you been?

522
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,559
Not too good

523
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,201
Just waited for the turtles to die

524
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,539
I'm serious

525
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,880
Whenever I had extra time

526
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,848
I would lean over
the tank and stare at them

527
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,883
Then my nephew
would walk by and ask

528
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,949
"What are you doing uncle Joon?"

529
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,917
And I would answer
"I'm waiting for the turtles to die"

530
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,294
So what's up?

531
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,093
Thought I would never
hear back from you

532
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:52,471
I was just around here for
a chore and remembered your number

533
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,834
That's all?

534
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,376
- Are you done?
- Yeah, one sec

535
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,680
I went on that blind date

536
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,559
Oh yeah? Who is this guy?

537
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,166
He's a doctor
All his siblings are doctors

538
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,898
Guess you found the one

539
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,365
But he's not
the most attractive person

540
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,508
How bad is he?

541
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,841
You wanna go do it?

542
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,820
No

543
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,312
How come?

544
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,617
I have to go date a doctor too

545
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:45,955
Doctor?

546
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,991
I think I'm gonna go
for a hot chick doctor

547
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,462
That hurt

548
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,568
My mother's ill

549
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,639
Is she gonna be okay?

550
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,859
What's this?

551
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,265
- It's a photo album
- Photo album?

552
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:30,439
Yeah, my history
Aren't you curious?

553
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,939
Oh yeah?

554
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,977
That's my mom

555
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,374
She's beautiful

556
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,152
They look really happy together

557
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:47,847
I know. Mom only knows dad

558
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,220
You were pretty
when you were little

559
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,169
Who took this?

560
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:01,772
I did

561
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,467
Really?

562
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,907
I didn't know that
you had such a talent

563
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:12,338
Actually, my dream was to become
a photographer when I was young

564
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:17,214
That's it over there
You can drop me off right about here

565
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,991
Thanks. Later

566
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,157
You sure the doctor
guy doesn't work here?

567
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,401
There just wasn't
a right place to make a turn

568
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,434
Well, thanks anyway. Bye

569
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,735
Good-bye

570
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,351
You wanna come up for a bit?

571
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,865
- Mom
- Yes

572
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,534
I brought you a gift today

573
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,138
- How do you do?
- Oh, hi

574
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,107
She's one of the many
girls that follow me around

575
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,444
Stop it. How are you?

576
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,680
You didn't have to bring this
Just take a seat over here

577
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,843
- I got it
- Come over here and sit

578
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,186
Sit. Do you need anything?

579
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,421
- Mom, relax
- I got it

580
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,116
It's okay, just sit

581
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,094
I would've prepared something for
her if I had known you two were coming

582
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,028
It's really okay Mrs. Kim

583
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,731
Mom, this is a hospital. Relax

584
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,032
I know... but still...

585
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,233
I'll do it

586
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,167
Don't. It's okay

587
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:37,935
- I'll got it Mrs. Kim
- It's really okay

588
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,028
Just let her do it mom

589
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,337
She knew exactly
what she was doing

590
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,845
With her eyes set down

591
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,040
she peeled the apples
skin into a perfect spiral

592
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:55,718
It was one of those typical
Korean mother & daughter in-law poses

593
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,049
Try this

594
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:04,351
I should've at least put on
some makeup or something

595
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,826
Don't mention it

596
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:06,930
Hope you get better soon

597
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,830
Don't worry mom

598
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:13,560
I'll bring a girl everyday
All you have to do is pick

599
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,596
Maybe we made a mistake

600
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,000
She held on to my hand
and asked me a lot of things

601
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,913
I feel terrible

602
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:27,009
Don't worry about it
I told her that you were just a friend

603
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,379
You did?

604
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,711
Now that you said that
I'm actually a bit disappointed

605
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:40,961
Why?

606
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,734
I don't want to do it

607
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,395
You're the one
that wanted to come

608
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,600
This is such a headache

609
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,831
Why?

610
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,576
One's a doctor

611
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:56,569
two's a salary men
the other's a businessman

612
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,680
and then you

613
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,912
I don't know who I should pick

614
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:08,822
Leave me out of it

615
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,252
Let's start with assumptions

616
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:18,530
First, marrying the doctor will
provide me with life's amenities

617
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:22,966
...but it will be a dull, fixed life
with his stuck up family to deaI with

618
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,877
Not to mention having to
get used to his ugly face

619
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,043
Then there's the life
of a salary man's wife

620
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:41,651
This is good because I get to live
with a man that's younger than me

621
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,784
But then, he's too short

622
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,590
Stop it

623
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,660
Next is also a salary man

624
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:59,140
This guy graduated from a top
notch school and even owns an apartment

625
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,445
And he seemed very nice and all

626
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,180
but he's such a mommy's boy

627
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,555
He wouldn't stop talking about
his mother. My mother this, my mother that

628
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,455
So why am I included?

629
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,955
You?

630
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:25,427
You're honest and
your mother seems very sweet

631
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,334
And?

632
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:33,108
And... you're good in bed

633
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:50,125
But I see us struggling financially
and you'll probably cheat on me

634
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:56,358
Every chance you get
you'll sneak around with other women

635
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,660
Why does everything have
to be so damn complicated?

636
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,234
Nothing has to be complicated

637
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:07,843
Forget about the ones
that aren't wealthy

638
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,407
Why?

639
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,573
Cause you would never
be able to give up financial freedom

640
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,014
Who are you to say?

641
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,256
If I were in your shoes
I wouldn't be able to give it up either

642
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,255
I'm taking 'em out

643
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:34,601
I'm going to choose from two

644
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,536
Congratulations. Pick a date then

645
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:44,613
I haven't decided yet
if I wanna go with you or the doctor

646
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:50,345
It'll never work with me
so pick a date with that doctor guy

647
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,249
Do you really have
no intention of marrying me?

648
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,791
It's not you. It's me

649
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,156
What do you mean?

650
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,537
TaIk to me

651
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,308
I just don't know if I can live with
someone and have to lie all the time

652
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,084
Wish we couId just
go away somewhere

653
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,508
Professor... Professor

654
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,144
Thank you

655
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,559
Maybe I won't get married

656
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:19,208
Why? Is he that bad in bed?

657
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,178
Did he ask for
money for his practice?

658
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,224
He has a huge mole under his eye

659
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,351
and I can't handle it

660
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,426
I'm serious

661
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,999
We've been fighting
all week because of that

662
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,002
I mean... this was a fight
on something terribly stupid

663
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,611
So imagine what would happen

664
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,374
when we have to agree on
what to buy for our house

665
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,407
It's gonna take months to settle all the issues
we need to go over before marriage

666
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,154
He also wanted to
get married in Woolsan

667
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,985
because his relatives
happen to live there

668
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,988
Does that make sense to you?

669
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,963
Maybe I should really
reconsider this marriage

670
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,626
No, you are right on track

671
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,031
What do you mean?

672
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,069
Same thing happened when
my brother was getting married

673
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:28,241
I really thought that the marriage
was over. They fought non-stop

674
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:37,810
I thought, "Do people really need
to get married after all this trouble?"

675
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:42,315
But then I found out that that was
the due process for getting married

676
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,825
That's all you have to say?

677
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,167
Are you busy today?

678
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,571
Did you decide
what you're gonna buy?

679
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,798
I have tons of things to buy

680
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,533
You should've
at least made a list

681
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,740
You sound like my fiance

682
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,472
You're tired, right?

683
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,775
Are you almost finished?

684
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,172
Just take a look
at the dress for me

685
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,279
Almost done now?

686
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,947
Yeah, all set

687
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,293
How is it?

688
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,963
You look great

689
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,403
He's the most
unenthusiastic groom ever

690
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,347
Maybe I should leave now

691
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,183
- You're not gonna come in?
- I'm good

692
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,256
Aren't you curious?

693
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,167
Come in

694
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,338
Hold on a sec

695
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,652
This is real wood

696
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,492
What do you want to drink?

697
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,592
Anything is fine

698
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,593
Thanks

699
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:26,086
Now I'm really glad
that I let you go

700
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,986
At least you know

701
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,325
What?

702
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,793
It was you that let me go

703
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,357
Whatever

704
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,963
You would've come
this way regardless

705
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,128
That's possible

706
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:52,981
But if you weren't so intent
on not getting married

707
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:57,615
I would never have made the
decision to give up on you so early

708
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:29,375
The house was perfect with
the sun shining through

709
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:39,686
The evening tempted you to say
"Are the kids home yet?"

710
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,573
What if your scent remains here?

711
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,312
Are you scared
you might get caught?

712
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:07,152
No, I'm just worried
that I'll get too horny

713
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,519
Just don't call my name when
you're do it with your husband

714
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,336
What?

715
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,335
I can't get it up

716
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:35,910
You're not going in?

717
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,751
I don't want to do it here

718
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,688
Where are you going?

719
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,021
Where are we going?

720
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,798
On a trip

721
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,662
A honeymoon

722
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,736
Honeymoon?

723
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,822
Aren't you glad we came?

724
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,458
Sure

725
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,004
Wait a sec

726
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,013
You prepared for this, didn't you?

727
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,946
I told you before that I wanted
to become a photographer

728
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,653
Stand right there

729
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,317
Forget it

730
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,592
Smile for crying out loud

731
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,659
Do you know where we are?

732
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,797
No

733
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,626
Wow, look at the stars

734
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,569
Why don't we go downtown?

735
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,166
Let's do a home-stay

736
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,909
You sure you don't wanna check-in
to a hotel on your honeymoon?

737
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:31,450
What kind of graduate
student couple stays at a hotel?

738
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,985
It's still a honeymoon though

739
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,218
No, can't do it

740
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:41,694
We have to save up
to buy your parents gifts

741
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,422
Oh, how lovely

742
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,034
Okay, how about
three more dollars?

743
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,728
I already gave you
a good discount

744
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:52,271
Oh, c'mon. Three more dollars

745
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,069
Okay

746
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,776
Thank you

747
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,479
Not bad, huh?

748
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,254
We can still go find a decent
place downtown, you know

749
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,089
This is just fine

750
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:23,965
It really is

751
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,707
I know

752
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,434
Stand right there

753
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,179
Stop taking pictures

754
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,813
Just stay there

755
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,653
Okay, that's the last one

756
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:38,881
Okay

757
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,084
When you get your tenure

758
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,695
we can look at
the pictures and laugh

759
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,134
Let's clean up first

760
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,443
You go get a broom
I'll do the laundry

761
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:07,408
And we can each look out for
each other when taking baths

762
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,619
When I need to
go to the bathroom

763
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,144
you'll follow me with a flash light

764
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,615
This is so much fun, isn't it?

765
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,090
- It's a rat
- Yeah

766
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,461
Miyao

767
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,806
Turn off the light

768
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,367
Okay

769
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:47,122
If you need to go to the bathroom
it's around the corner

770
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,827
I'm going to sleep now

771
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,021
Okay

772
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,095
Take it off for me

773
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,354
Just do it inside

774
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:58,793
No

775
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,321
Why?

776
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,159
You need to work

777
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,172
You're so warm

778
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,704
How come you never talk
about your ex-girlfriends around me?

779
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,746
Why are you asking this?

780
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,512
This is our honeymoon

781
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:33,087
I just don't think it's right to talk
about past girlfriends with a new one

782
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,763
You are such a player

783
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:45,939
I bet the first girl was like "This is mine"

784
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:52,445
And the second, "This is my lolly pop"

785
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:58,145
- Then the third one...
- What number am I?

786
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,523
What?

787
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,924
How many boys did
you sleep with so far?

788
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,354
You're the first one

789
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,328
You don't believe me?

790
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,267
I believe you

791
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,736
Why?

792
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,103
Cause it's our first
night on a honeymoon

793
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:16,329
Weekend Couple

794
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:21,200
Our next poem 'Flea'
written by John Dan

795
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:26,603
primarily works with
conceit and metaphor

796
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,811
As stated in the prologue

797
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,644
these characteristics have been prevalent
throughout the metaphysics of the 17th century

798
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,181
Weeks have passed

799
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:40,151
I just waited for her improbable
phone call like a bad habit

800
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:41,557
Yeah. Yeah. Okay No

801
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,159
Whenever I missed her

802
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,287
I wouId try to picture
her new married life

803
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:54,335
I was certain that she would be taking
on the duties of a housewife perfectly

804
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,598
She probably prepared Miso soup for
her husband right around 6 o'clock each day

805
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,043
And she will have
joined the swim club

806
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,136
so that she can stay in
shape to please her husband

807
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:09,746
On weekends, she would
go shopping with her husband

808
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,624
Those thoughts helped me
forget about her for the time being

809
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:29,101
It was two months into her
marriage when she had called

810
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,165
Do I look like I'm married?

811
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,697
No

812
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,569
How have you been?

813
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,006
I've been quite busy

814
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,077
I have this
translation work right now

815
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,409
Are you still Iiving out
of your parents' house?

816
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:15,709
They keep bugging me about
getting married so I want to move out

817
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,712
...but it's just not the right time

818
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,414
Is it money?

819
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,286
What else?

820
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:27,462
I can help you out, you know

821
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,226
I have some
retirement money leftover

822
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,763
Do you like your new job?

823
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,309
Yeah

824
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,237
I knew it would suit you well

825
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:49,245
But it's sort of boring

826
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,317
What do you usually
do on a regular day?

827
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,951
I fix him
breakfast in the morning

828
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,752
and then go to the swim club

829
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,428
...followed by some
shopping in the afternoon

830
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:03,091
Then you'll fix dinner and
greet him with a smile, right?

831
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,701
Pretty much

832
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,100
What can you cook?

833
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,502
Pretty much everything

834
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,902
But sea bass soup and hardboiled
hairtails are some of my best I must say

835
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:20,172
Do you also have drinks and talk
about your days from time to time?

836
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,283
Are you jealous?

837
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,253
Did you think that
I would call again?

838
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,550
If the swimming instructor
wasn't attractive enough, yes

839
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,661
I never thought you would
actually show up at my wedding

840
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,836
You have no idea
how surprised I was

841
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:43,771
Thought you could do better

842
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:45,933
You think?

843
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,937
I have to get going now
Okay, later

844
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:55,582
- Think about what I said
- What?

845
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,448
About moving out
I really want to help you

846
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,389
Thanks. But I'll pass

847
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:06,590
It's not charity, you know
I'm lending it to you

848
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,630
Just think about
it Joon-young

849
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,808
Okay? Good-bye

850
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,803
Everything's fine except
it's a bit too small, don't you think?

851
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,941
You think it's small?

852
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,874
For the both of us at least

853
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,518
You want more
water in your coffee?

854
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,291
Yeah. This is good

855
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:21,665
You think you would've don't
the same for me if we were married?

856
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,968
I'm not getting married so that
I don't have to do things like that

857
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,636
What?

858
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:32,508
You know, doing the dishes
making coffee, or fighting over love

859
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,178
Mr. Know-it-all

860
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,846
We should put our
honeymoon picture up there

861
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,590
and place the dining table here

862
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,717
And maybe a vase on top

863
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:51,764
That way, I can see if you're
coming home or not while fixing dinner

864
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,557
That's so cheesy

865
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:59,164
When I was little
that was my ultimate dream

866
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,540
I don't care if it's cheesy

867
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,981
If we were married

868
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:09,678
we probably would've ended up
living in a place like this, right?

869
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,819
Aren't you glad that
you went for the other guy?

870
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,254
Yeah

871
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,692
We would've
easily gotten a divorce

872
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,630
Make me a key

873
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:31,932
Why are you trying
to see me again?

874
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,075
I feel so fresh here

875
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,052
That's too big for two

876
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,089
This one looks good
I like the color too

877
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,601
- How much is this?
- 130 dollars

878
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,000
130?

879
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,773
This is too much for the room

880
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,575
It's better of
using hangers instead

881
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,770
Why don't we put
this next to the bed?

882
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,012
This is much better than that
We can put TV on top

883
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,747
How much did
you say this was?

884
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,018
I'll give it to you for 140

885
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,748
There was a scratch on it

886
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,912
- What's this?
- What?

887
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,573
There's nothing we can eat

888
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:51,551
Just wait. I'll make
you some Miso soup

889
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,720
We'll split the bill even

890
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,654
You pay for all of it

891
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,988
That's not fair

892
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:04,161
I don't need any of this stuff

893
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,600
Hey, here

894
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,904
HeIIo?

895
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:23,681
That's not possible
I left it on the whole time

896
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,286
I'm with my friends
I think I'm gonna run a little late

897
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,353
Are you working
overtime tonight?

898
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:38,329
I'll see you at home

899
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,231
Now it looks like
a newly wed's room

900
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,038
You just made
the room all cramped

901
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,281
It looks like a friggin' play house

902
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,511
You're not supposed to sit there

903
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,185
This is a floor mat
not a sitting mat

904
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,617
Who cares? It's new

905
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,589
Don't act primitive

906
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,592
This isn't my taste

907
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,494
You still like it though, don't you?

908
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:16,504
I'm starving

909
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,203
Wait, I'll fix dinner right away

910
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:31,545
How's this?
Don't I look cute in it?

911
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,613
I'm hungry

912
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,888
This over here too

913
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,066
- You wanted spinach last time
- Yes

914
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,001
We have it fresh today

915
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,434
I'm good for today

916
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,136
- So what do you do anyway?
- Excuse me?

917
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,041
I see your husband everyday
but you're sort of on and off

918
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,737
I work outside the city

919
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,472
So you're a weekend couple

920
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,182
Guess we are

921
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,181
A pack of cigarettes please

922
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:08,346
You're here

923
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:13,991
You're home?
I'll fix you nice dinner

924
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,497
We're a weekend couple

925
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,422
Do we have to do this?

926
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,097
It's fun

927
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,961
I always wanted
to do it this way

928
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,737
Oh my!

929
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:28,731
Go watch the soup

930
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,809
- That's enough now
- I'm almost done now

931
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,646
Go brush your teeth
Your breath stinks from the fish

932
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,627
I won't do it unless
you brush your teeth

933
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:56,825
This is why married couples
lose their sex appeal

934
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,676
- Honey
- What?

935
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:20,310
Will you grab the shaving cream
and a razor on your way out?

936
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:21,420
Why?

937
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,180
I wanna shave for you

938
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:24,391
Shave?

939
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,187
It stings when I kiss you

940
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,525
- Be careful with the blade
- Okay

941
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,446
Do you do this
for your husband too?

942
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:03,759
Not bad

943
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:09,931
When I was little, it just looked
so cool the way my father shaved

944
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:16,402
Ever since, I've been wanting
to shave for someone I love

945
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,938
Stop it. You're tickling me
If you wanna get cut, do it

946
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,578
- I wanna get cut
- Stop

947
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,264
Yeah. I'm out

948
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,040
I'll be back soon

949
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,043
Did you eat?

950
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,414
So, you'll be late then

951
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,600
Come out

952
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,824
- You're leaving?
- Yeah

953
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:52,773
Why are you opening my mail?

954
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,538
I think it's a she

955
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:59,214
Professor, this is Sae-un
I have tickets to a concert

956
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,182
So I thought of you

957
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,943
I don't remember
the movie we saw together

958
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:10,922
but I do remember your scent
I remember it vividly

959
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,620
Please give me a call

960
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,521
Are you dating a student?

961
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:19,990
She's just a student I know

962
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,729
This is no ordinary
teacher student relationship

963
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,606
She's just a student

964
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,335
When did you
start meeting her?

965
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,943
Did you sleep with her?

966
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,713
What do you want to know?

967
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,140
It's none of your
business anyway

968
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,177
None of my business?

969
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:44,782
Yeah... why should you care
about who I'm sleeping with anyway?

970
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:48,217
Okay

971
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,199
I don't care if you're sleeping
with that student of yours

972
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:57,538
But never bring her to this room

973
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:58,907
What?

974
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:00,932
I decorated this room

975
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:03,507
Another girl's presence
is not welcome here

976
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,716
You always have it your way

977
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:08,416
What?

978
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,408
You don't think I'm sick of having
to smell another guy's cologne on you?

979
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,865
I'm the one that
should be pissed

980
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:34,301
Okay then
Good luck with that student

981
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,413
I'm sure you told
her the same thing

982
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,319
"I don't believe in marriage"

983
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:52,317
In reality you're the one that
more picky about the women you meet

984
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,801
You can always
just leave like that

985
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,162
What?

986
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,899
And then when you miss me, you'll just
come back and pretend everything's okay

987
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,040
Well, I'm different

988
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:10,904
You can just run away whenever you wish
but I feel like shit being left here all alone

989
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,111
Your shit's all over the place
and your hair is all over the pillow

990
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:17,674
Do you know how that feels?

991
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:45,840
Closure

992
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,539
Hello?

993
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,837
It's your mother
Are you still sleeping?

994
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:15,043
Yeah

995
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,478
Why don't you
come over for breakfast?

996
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,343
I have your
birthday breakfast ready

997
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:24,912
- You know I don't eat breakfast
- Do you even know that it's your birthday today?

998
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:28,653
I know. I'll call you back later

999
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:26,941
You're here

1000
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,348
What brings you here?

1001
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,243
You're eating
instant noodles again?

1002
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,822
I told you to cook
even if it's a hassle

1003
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:38,481
Did you get bored that easily?

1004
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,123
I thought you
would never come back

1005
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,391
Didn't you miss me?

1006
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,698
You lent me the money so that
you can do this from the beginning, right?

1007
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,965
Can't say no

1008
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,169
Hold on

1009
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,178
I baked it myself
Doesn't it look tasty?

1010
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,317
Is that all I get?

1011
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:17,987
Do you know how hard
I worked to bake this all day long?

1012
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,196
Where's the decoration?

1013
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,068
It was here before

1014
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,595
Don't answer

1015
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,199
It's him

1016
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:58,166
He was all suspicious
last time I didn't pick up

1017
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:10,652
Hello? The cIass
just ended and

1018
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,052
I'm going to get some
food with the people here

1019
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:17,854
I don't think I can
be home so early

1020
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:23,095
I told them that I would treat

1021
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:26,029
Yeah, maybe an hour or two

1022
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:30,663
Make sure you eat
and I'll see you later

1023
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,505
What kind of class is it?

1024
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:46,886
I told him I'd take
English classes in the evening

1025
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:52,817
After all, I am an English teacher

1026
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:58,964
Happy birthday. Cheers

1027
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,602
Do we really have to do this?

1028
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,232
Of course. It's a must

1029
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:14,614
Aren't I the best?
I remembered your birthday

1030
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:19,414
Hey, have some

1031
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,451
I bet its much better
than the ones you buy

1032
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:26,487
It's good

1033
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:28,284
Really?

1034
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:31,666
Does he like cakes?

1035
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,293
What?

1036
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:37,365
Oh... I guess

1037
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:40,632
What else does he like?

1038
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:49,574
Bulgogi, sea bass soup
and pretty much everything I cook

1039
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,912
I bet... since you're a good cook

1040
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,920
Why are you
asking me that though?

1041
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,456
You never talk
about my husband

1042
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,021
I was just curious

1043
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:04,989
Curious about what?

1044
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:08,464
Of course I'm curious

1045
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:12,735
Then ask me questions

1046
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,971
Well, you and your husband...

1047
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,443
forget about it

1048
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,306
What is it? Talk to me

1049
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,315
It's nothing important

1050
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,119
I feel like I'm in
a remote island somewhere

1051
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,027
That would be
awesome if it were real

1052
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,561
Don't you have to go now?

1053
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:40,530
I got time

1054
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:45,634
- Don't drink that
- Why not?

1055
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,741
He'll be suspicious
if he smells alcohol on you

1056
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,036
Then maybe
I'll just sleep here

1057
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,332
Dude, let me stay with
you for a few days

1058
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:17,004
- What happened?
- We decided to take a break

1059
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:22,837
A break? That's great

1060
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:31,273
What is it?

1061
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:32,885
Forget about it

1062
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:37,686
She knew all along
I found out yesterday

1063
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:39,725
You know, the Ji-young thing

1064
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,959
She knew for quite
some time now

1065
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,058
Does Ji-young know too?

1066
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,167
She said she would never call

1067
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:50,827
She felt guilty
or something as a woman

1068
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:53,000
What about you?

1069
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:54,408
What about me?

1070
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,171
What are you gonna do?

1071
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,076
I don't' know man

1072
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,215
Why don't you
straighten things out this time?

1073
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,620
How? With whom?

1074
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:40,744
Do you know how long I waited?

1075
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,649
Why did you have
your cell phone off?

1076
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:46,619
I met Kyu-jin today

1077
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:50,564
What about him?

1078
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,295
I spoke to Yu-ri
this morning too

1079
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:04,035
It was that woman
in black at the wedding, right?

1080
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:13,019
Shouldn't he get a divorce
with Yu-ri if he loves her so much?

1081
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:15,181
It's not that easy

1082
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:18,916
Once they get a divorce
he won't even have a place to live

1083
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,755
And Yu-ri will probably
have probIems of her own

1084
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:26,458
If he's so scared of things
like that, how is he in love?

1085
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:30,537
Can you do it?

1086
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,964
I know I can

1087
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:38,377
No. You can't do it

1088
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:39,940
I can

1089
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:48,678
I'm confident that
I'll never get caught

1090
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,927
Don't come here anymore

1091
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,456
Why not?

1092
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:59,226
That's just what I want

1093
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:02,834
Not what I want

1094
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:08,235
This picture came out nice

1095
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,743
You're not a bad
photographer yourself

1096
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,939
This one came out real nice

1097
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:21,682
Maybe I'll send this
to a woman's weekIy

1098
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:27,318
Aren't you scared?
Leaving records like that?

1099
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:31,860
I don't get you sometimes

1100
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:37,401
What are you gonna
do with that anyway?

1101
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:42,337
I'll give it to you as
a gift when you get married

1102
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:59,018
Do you know what
I'm making right now?

1103
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:00,653
What is it?

1104
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,164
Bean sprout soup
and prepared bean sprout

1105
01:35:03,164 --> 01:35:04,688
And...

1106
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,399
Bean sprout rice

1107
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,599
I'll just have instant noodles

1108
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:14,499
You don't want Bean sprout rice?

1109
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:15,836
It's the best

1110
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,771
The best for you not for me

1111
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,075
Just make me
some instant noodles

1112
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,944
Are you complaining about food?

1113
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,642
I'm doing my best here

1114
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:29,017
You don't have to do that

1115
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:31,348
Don't eat it if you don't want it

1116
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,425
Just don't ask for it later

1117
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:37,531
Where are you going?
To buy instant noodles

1118
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:38,930
Hold on, wait

1119
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:42,328
Get some pepper too

1120
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,737
I don't put pepper
in my instant noodles

1121
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,510
You'll get it, right?

1122
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:58,446
Here

1123
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:03,515
Your wife bought it
with bean sprout

1124
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,222
She did?

1125
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,896
You were gonna get it anyway

1126
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:18,603
You had instant noodles

1127
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,571
Yeah, but somebody had to
get up and buy pepper anyway

1128
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:29,512
You're really gonna
eat instant noodles?

1129
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,917
You're such a cry baby

1130
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:48,094
Come on... it's getting cold

1131
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,676
Eat that if you're gonna try me

1132
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,156
Don't try me

1133
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,654
You want me to eat
this all by myself?

1134
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:16,650
Let's end this right now

1135
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:20,953
We're slowly getting
sick of each other

1136
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,725
Can you do it?

1137
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:29,696
We can't do this forever

1138
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:35,966
I never thought that it would be
over a stupid Bean Sprout Bibimbap

1139
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:40,673
Can you really do it?

1140
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,580
It's about will power...

1141
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,886
If it's hard forgetting you

1142
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,690
I'll try to find someone else

1143
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,694
I'll do just the same

1144
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:07,732
I might come back
to see you though

1145
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:09,473
Don't

1146
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,409
If I come back to see you

1147
01:39:21,355 --> 01:39:23,721
Please tell me to leave

1148
01:39:26,827 --> 01:39:29,796
I don't even feel any
kind of guilt anymore

1149
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,560
I just feel a lot busier
than most people

1150
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:39,734
Just don't come back

1151
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,004
I don't know
if I can send you back

1152
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:50,973
Thinking that it was
last got me more aroused

1153
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:56,916
Her hair, eye movement

1154
01:39:57,925 --> 01:40:03,522
the sheet like skin, and
the feeling of her moving fingers

1155
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:14,304
I wanted to hold on to every part of
her body that was no longer mine

1156
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:36,225
Uncle Joon's here

1157
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:41,094
- Uncle Joon
- How have you been Wonny?

1158
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,533
- No one's home?
- Wonny's mother went to get her hair done

1159
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,765
What brings you here?
You never come home without calling

1160
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:53,044
You must be hungry
Let me fix you some lunch

1161
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,015
Are you getting along
with your friends okay?

1162
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:56,949
I can beat them all

1163
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:59,545
You're supposed to
be friendly with them

1164
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,245
There's only two, huh?

1165
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:06,024
I don't know. They're gone

1166
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,162
You should take care of them

1167
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:15,433
Do you eat right?

1168
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:18,133
Yeah, I'm fine

1169
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:25,607
What happened to that nice girl
you came to the hospital with?

1170
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:29,649
Oh, she got married

1171
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:41,987
I haven't gotten
a call from her in weeks

1172
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,264
Now that I come to think of it
it was every other week that she came by

1173
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,402
Why she came by every other week

1174
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:56,706
I'll never know. It's just funny that
I'm suddenly curious about all of this

1175
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:03,148
Our relationship just
had so many flaws

1176
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:11,313
We never shared
things most couples had

1177
01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:26,062
I'm looking at the album that
Yeon-hee left me for the first time

1178
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:31,338
She's been diligently taking pictures
to make this album for quite some time

1179
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,947
I just never really
cared much about it

1180
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:40,209
It just seemed like one of her pointless
and dangerous acts that she did

1181
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:48,586
At least in the pictures
we looked very happy together

1182
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:55,023
But in the end
we ended up taking a different road

1183
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:02,242
I think I know now...

1184
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:05,309
Why she worked so hard
to take these photos

1185
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:14,883
And I also know what
she wanted to tell me
