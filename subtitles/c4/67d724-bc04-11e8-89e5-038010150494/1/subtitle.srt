To those who loved this world once before
and spent time with its friends,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Gather again and devote your time...

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,160
Shion-san!

5
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,820
Look at this!

6
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,900
Found it.

7
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,130
...kinda gross, isn't it?

8
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,730
Just hurry it up, yo.

9
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm counting on you, Reno.

10
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,670
Alright, yo.

11
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,420
Hey, hey, hey!

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,250
Senpai, hurry up!

13
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,790
Senpai!

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,930
Who is that?!

15
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,360
Ugh...

16
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,260
Elena!

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,470
G-go!

18
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,750
Lifestream...

19
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,290
The flow which governs the life of worlds.

20
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,610
It is the source of all worlds
and all of the life on those planets.

21
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,590
The Shinra Company found a way...

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,030
to take the lifestream and use it as a resource.

23
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,030
Because of that, we were able...

24
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,400
to live rich and plentiful lives.

25
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,810
But that wore away at the life of the planet...

26
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,740
There were a lot of people who thought that.

27
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,240
Shinra tried to use force...

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,750
against those who stood in opposition.

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,480
Shinra had a special force
who were called Soldier.

30
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
They were the ones who long ago...

31
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,300
took the one falling from the sky
to destroy the world,

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,230
Jenova's cell, and buried her.

33
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,900
There was one among them named Sephiroth...

34
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,640
who was an excellent Soldier.

35
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,970
But when he found out
that he had been born in a horrifying experiment...

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,780
he came to hate Shinra.

37
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,650
And then finally came to hate everything.

38
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,060
Shinra and those who stood against them.

39
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,660
Sephiroth, whose hate was so great
that he tried to destroy the world...

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,830
Those people who tried to stop Sephiroth...

41
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,270
There were many battles.

42
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,970
There was sadness in the sheer number of battles.

43
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,380
One who I loved
also became part of the Lifestream.

44
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,420
And then one day...

45
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,560
A fated day...

46
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,200
The world's power itself stopped all of the battles.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,340
The world used the Lifestream as a weapon.

48
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,600
The Lifestream, gushing out over the world...

49
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,870
took battles, ambition, and sadness...

50
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,810
It took everything and swallowed it up.

51
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,350
In exchange for that sadness, everything stopped.

52
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,620
These things all happened two years ago.

53
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,310
Let's go.

54
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,890
OK.

55
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,850
But... the world...

56
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,370
seems to have been much, much angrier than anyone believed.

57
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,930
The Star-Scar Syndrome. (Geostigma)

58
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,270
Hey, Marlene?

59
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,080
What's going on?

60
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,780
Please, I ask of you.

61
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,420
Please don't take Denzel away.

62
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,160
He's not here anymore~

63
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,350
Cloud...

64
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,490
Where are you...?

65
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,510
Hello, Strife Delivery Service!

66
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,540
We'll deliver anyth...

67
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,180
...who is this?

68
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,910
I remember you, yo.

69
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,700
I got a phone call from Reno and them in Healin.

70
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,410
They said it's a commission.

71
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,470
Cloud... have you been doing OK?

72
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,780
No more messages.

73
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,250
Hey, Kadaj...
Is that big brother's city?

74
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,350
Yeah.

75
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,020
You think they'll give us a big welcome?

76
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,360
No way.

77
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,330
Don't cry, Yazoo.

78
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,470
Mother must be with him too, right?

79
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,460
I dunno about that.

80
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,630
Don't cry, Loz.

81
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,210
Look, it's big brother.

82
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,520
Where's Mother?

83
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,890
Big brother's hiding her, isn't he?

84
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,070
Did he trick us?!

85
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,570
Mother's really -there-, isn't she?

86
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,300
Don't yell about it.

87
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,480
I don't wanna talk to you!

88
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,580
Give me the boss.

89
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,020
Hey, it's me, Barret! I did it!
A new oil field!

90
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,570
O-IL-FIELD!
A huge one, too!

91
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,870
And we're sticking to plan, so soon
I'll be able to come visit Marlene!

92
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,630
Tell her for me!
See ya!

93
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,570
There was another phone call from Reno.

94
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,680
Anyway, just hurry, he says.

95
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,280
He seemed a little weird, though...
Be careful.

96
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,710
Uoryaaaa~~

97
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,120
Just as I expected, yo!

98
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,290
Rude, you're so cool!

99
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,870
Just as expected, would-be ex-Soldier.

100
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,540
Your skills are as impressive as ever.

101
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
Is that you, Rufus?

102
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,990
You've got no luck either...

103
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,400
That day, I...

104
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,370
What do you want with me?

105
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,300
Just before the buildings crumbled...

106
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,460
Who were those people who attacked me?

107
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:04,970
Say something.

108
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm leaving.

109
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,140
...lend us your power.

110
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,200
Not interested.

111
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,650
We at Shinra have a big debt to repay to the world.

112
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,540
The responsibility of putting the world
in its current, pathetic state...

113
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,210
There's no helping people saying
that it falls to us.

114
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,590
Consequently,
we must somehow repay this debt of ours.

115
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,990
Let me in!

116
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,990
As our first step...

117
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,330
We began an investigation
into the influences that Sephiroth left.

118
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,960
The Northern Crater, yo.

119
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,630
What do you think was there?

120
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,710
Nothing.
There was nothing.

121
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,870
You don't have to worry about it.

122
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,310
But something unexpected happened.

123
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,140
Someone tried to get in our way.

124
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,220
Those people who attacked you...

125
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,120
They're Kadaj's gang.

126
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,980
Kadaj...

127
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,990
It seems that they meant to interfere with our plans.

128
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,660
Really... I can't figure why.

129
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Why did they attack me?

130
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,700
You're with us, right?

131
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,470
Kadaj's gang is young and brutal.

132
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,400
They're extremely dangerous.

133
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,680
So, we decided to try and hire a skilled bodyguard.

134
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,580
I'm a delivery man.

135
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,310
You're the only one.

136
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,920
Please, ex-Soldier Cloud.

137
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,660
Would-be...

138
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,920
What is this "Mother" they were talking about?

139
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,960
Kadaj said something, huh?

140
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,970
Well, don't worry about that.

141
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,900
There are children all over the world
who yearn for their mothers.

142
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,210
You're living with the orphans, I hear.

143
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,950
You don't want to bring smiles back to their faces?

144
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:04,190
Our ultimate goal
is the rebuilding of this world, Cloud.

145
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,890
I...

146
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,560
Please, Cloud!
We're rebuilding the Shinra Company, yo!

147
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,770
Not interested.

148
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,610
Reno!

149
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,670
Cloud's living here?

150
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,700
Looks like it.

151
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,280
What?

152
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,030
Just like Denzel's!
Is Cloud sick too?

153
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,930
He could just tell us...

154
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,570
Did he leave because he's sick?

155
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,510
He thinks he's going to fight them by himself.

156
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,940
Fight?

157
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,710
No...

158
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,520
He doesn't have the will to fight...

159
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,620
Tifa?

160
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,850
Let's go home, Marlene.

161
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,660
No!
I want to see Cloud!

162
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,260
...I guess you're right.

163
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,000
It'd be nice to see him, huh?

164
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,840
Yeah!

165
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,300
Hey, what should we do when he gets here?

166
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,840
Go home together!

167
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,980
Before that, we'll lecture him!

168
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,880
Agreed!

169
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,020
I hate lies, you know.

170
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm sorry!
This time I'll be honest with you.

171
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,230
While we were running away from you...

172
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,000
It seems that it fell from the helicopter.

173
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,260
What a ridiculous story...

174
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,140
Truly?

175
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,270
I swear it.

176
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,780
Then swear it on these.

177
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,350
What are you after?

178
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,990
We need Mother's power.

179
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,190
We have to have it, for Reunion.

180
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,230
Reunion...

181
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,000
We're going to collect everyone
with Mother's cells into one place.

182
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,530
And then we're going to get revenge on the world.

183
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,470
Preparations are coming along pretty well...

184
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,940
but you see,
someone had to go and hide Mother...

185
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,540
Preparations?

186
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,540
Geostigma.

187
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,150
You know all about it, right Boss?

188
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,120
In the Lifestream...

189
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,990
All because Mother's cells are working hard...

190
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,320
And yet we...

191
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,870
We don't even know where Mother is.

192
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,730
It's sad but there's no helping it.

193
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,970
We're spirits, after all.

194
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,410
Until we find Mother and divide up here cells...

195
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,440
We can't be normal!

196
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,080
Spirits and Geostigma aren't enough!

197
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,380
Not for the real Reunion, you see.

198
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,090
...what are you talking about?

199
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Boss... you've figured it out, haven't you?

200
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,870
I'll live for you as well...

201
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,950
That's what I decided...

202
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,550
You wanna be a Soldier?
Work hard!

203
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,310
Hey, how do you feel?

204
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,480
Hey,
what are you gonna do when we get to Midgard?

205
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,580
We're friends, right?

206
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,590
Cloud, run!

207
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,590
Wanna play?

208
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,430
I see, you don't want to.

209
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,470
Where's mother?

210
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,940
It stinks!

211
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,750
Hey, where's Mother?

212
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,750
There's no one here!

213
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,190
Then let's play.

214
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
This should be fun!

215
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,010
Tifa!

216
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,940
It's not here.

217
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,010
I'm not crying.

218
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,020
Got it.

219
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,550
I'll bring it.

220
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,990
Time to finish this.

221
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,050
Cloud...

222
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,950
Run!

223
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,990
You've got Geostigma too, don't you?

224
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,770
He says he's gonna cure us.

225
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,480
Tifa?

226
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,090
Tifa!

227
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,560
You're late...

228
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,170
Who did this?

229
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,970
Someone I didn't know.

230
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,010
Marlene?!

231
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,050
Dammit!

232
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,360
You were heavy, yo.

233
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,060
...you were living with some kids, right?

234
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,300
It's empty.

235
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,870
That OK?

236
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,510
I...

237
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,280
You're so annoying, yo.

238
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,070
Brother was hiding it, huh?

239
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,050
The power born from the Lifestream.

240
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,880
These Materia will give us a new power...

241
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,150
Reno and them are searching...

242
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,950
It's Geostigma... isn't it?

243
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,760
It's alright if I die.
...is that what you're thinking?

244
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,000
As I thought.

245
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,860
There's no cure.

246
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,270
But Denzel was trying his best, wasn't he?

247
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,410
Why don't you fight it with us instead of running away?

248
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,740
We could all help each other and try our best!

249
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,650
Can't do it since we're not a real family, huh?

250
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,990
I can't...

251
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,360
I can't save anyone, I don't think.

252
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,050
Neither family nor friends...

253
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,130
No one.

254
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,500
Drifting, drifting...

255
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,370
Drifting, drifting!

256
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,280
How long are you gonna drag along like that, yo?

257
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,910
You couldn't find them?!

258
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,180
There was a witness who saw them being taken away, yo.

259
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,890
Where did they go?

260
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,850
The Forgotten Capital...

261
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,260
Ajit.

262
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,340
I've received a special power from Mother.

263
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,770
A power to fight against this planet...

264
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,650
which hurts the people living on it.

265
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,120
Actually, you all have this power.

266
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,420
That's right.

267
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,190
We're all siblings.

268
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,060
Chosen siblings...

269
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,900
who inherited Mother's cells
that were absorbed in the Lifestream.

270
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,740
But...

271
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,500
The planet is trying to interfere.

272
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,740
It's trying to stunt our growth!

273
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,550
That's why our bodies hurt
and our hearts seem to give up.

274
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,690
I'll cure you.

275
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,130
And we'll all go to Mother together.

276
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,400
We'll bring our family's power together
and get back at the planet!

277
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,500
Follow my lead.

278
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,380
Denzel!

279
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,890
Denzel!!

280
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,400
So you showed up.

281
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,640
Even though you're falling apart...

282
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,710
I'm sure this will be a good thing.

283
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,970
Question!

284
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,780
Why exactly did you come here?

285
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,660
I... wish to be forgiven.

286
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,850
Yes, I want to be forgiven.

287
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,830
By who~?

288
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,250
So he did show up.

289
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,950
I came for the children.

290
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,280
This guy is our Brother.

291
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,120
But you know, it's a shame...

292
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,230
He's a traitor.

293
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,830
Cloud!

294
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,870
You really can't save anyone, can you?

295
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,680
Vincent...
What's happening?

296
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,850
I come here a lot.

297
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,060
So I saw Kadaj and them here.

298
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,020
The Geostigma...

299
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,690
It seems that the cause is an overloading of the system
to remove parasites in the body.

300
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,840
There's a flow through the body like the Lifestream...

301
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,780
It fights against the invasion of harmful substances.

302
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,240
Harmful substances...

303
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,010
The Sephiroth element... Jenova's cells...

304
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,220
Call it what you want.

305
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,720
You know a lot about it.

306
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,090
Shion and Elena...

307
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,330
They were carried here on the edge of death.

308
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,200
It seemed
that they had been put through some hideous torture.

309
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,030
I managed to save them, but...

310
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,860
Well, I'm not sure how well...

311
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,240
Torture?

312
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,380
You reap what you sow.

313
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,070
It seems that they came into possession of Jenova's head.

314
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,310
And the Mother that Kadaj's gang is searching for is...

315
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,210
That abominable thing which heaven sent.

316
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,050
Jenova.

317
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,960
If they wanted to,
they could even remake Sephiroth.

318
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,820
Kadaj...

319
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,820
What is he?

320
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,690
Hmph, I don't want to think about it.

321
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,670
Marlene!

322
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,180
Cloud!
Denzel and Tifa, they...!

323
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,640
Tifa is all right.

324
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,470
I want to talk to Tifa!

325
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,890
Do you have it?

326
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,620
I can't believe it!

327
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,060
Vincent, can you take Marlene back to the store?

328
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,740
I'm going to go talk to Shinra about this.

329
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,630
I can't approve.

330
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,290
But...

331
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,830
I don't care about you anymore, Cloud!

332
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,700
Why won't you listen to what we're saying?!

333
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,680
Marlene...

334
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,010
Just wait a little longer...

335
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,480
The fight is going to begin now.

336
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,550
But we can't just fight!

337
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,480
You understand, right?

338
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,020
I don't understand!

339
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,350
Cloud, is this really about the fight?

340
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,490
Where did they go?

341
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,420
The Forgotten Capital.

342
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,630
Ajit.

343
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,500
Take care of it.

344
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,940
I'm going to go talk to Rufus.

345
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,410
Don't run!

346
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,480
I know you are!

347
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,240
Even if you find the children,
you might not be able to do anything.

348
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,950
They might be somewhere that we can't get them back.

349
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,290
You're scared of that, aren't you?

350
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,050
But you have to react to now, to more of this!

351
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,860
A burden?
Well there's no helping that, it's a heavy burden!

352
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,560
Unless you want to live all alone,
you have to deal with that!

353
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,130
You don't want to be alone, do you?

354
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,700
Even though you never answer,
you always have your phone with you.

355
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,870
You go to Ajit, yo.

356
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,080
Have we lost to our memories?

357
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,630
But... we just let her die.

358
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,160
Really, always drifting...

359
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,700
Hey...

360
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,830
Why don't you forgive yourself?

361
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,470
Can sin be forgiven?

362
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,240
...I've never tried it.

363
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,480
Tried it?

364
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,540
Tried it...

365
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,420
Marlene, we're going home!

366
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,900
I'll try it.

367
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,360
I'll let you know how it turns out.

368
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,580
It's me, Reeve.
How's work going?

369
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,560
I just saw you pass by,
but can you really make a living doing that?

370
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,720
It is like you, though, Cloud-san.

371
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,960
If it's OK, I'd like to help,
so I'll contact you again.

372
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,730
I got a phone call from Reno in Healin,
he says it's a commission.

373
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,030
Long time no see! It's Yuffie!

374
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,700
Hey, all the kids from Wutai disappeared...

375
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,100
Do you know anything?
Give me some info! Please!

376
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,700
He seemed a little weird, though...
Be careful.

377
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,750
I've never thought badly of you.

378
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,250
You came for me, didn't you?
That's plenty right there.

379
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Hey! Are you listening?

380
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,930
Why are you doing this?!

381
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:52,480
Denzel!

382
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,910
Denzel!

383
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,350
Denzel!

384
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,110
What are you doing?

385
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,280
Mother's in there, right?

386
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,390
Why do you say that?

387
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,660
This... what is it? Memorial statue?
Shinra's the one that made it.

388
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,000
Wow, you used your head, didn't you?

389
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,870
But you're off-base.

390
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,510
We don't know either, yo.

391
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,340
What's this?
You don't have any faith in us, huh?

392
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,690
Uorya~~

393
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,600
Hey, Kadaj.

394
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,990
Tell me one thing.

395
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,000
Just one thing.

396
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:25,740
You said that you would become normal
once you got Jenova's cells, but...

397
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,670
What did you mean by that?

398
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:33,150
He... will return.

399
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,390
...Sephiroth.

400
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,250
A nightmare, huh?

401
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,050
So I hear.

402
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,320
So you hear?

403
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,990
I don't know Sephiroth.

404
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,690
Yeah, I just feel him!

405
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,930
It irritates me!

406
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,500
Me or Sephiroth, which does Mother...

407
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,210
Poor spirit...

408
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,500
Whichever it ends up as,
you all will meet the same end!

409
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,580
Mother made a long journey to come to this planet.

410
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,590
To erase a bunch of fools from space, you see.

411
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,250
But... you know, don't you?

412
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,260
Nothing has changed here
since the time when Mother came.

413
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,230
That's why I'm going to make Mother happy.

414
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,900
I'll do anything if Mother commands it.

415
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,970
Hmph, the nightmare comes again, huh?

416
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,140
As long as you guys are here,
the same thing will keep happening.

417
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,580
The Lifestream, which governs the flow of worlds...

418
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,450
It comes and goes in the space between life and death...

419
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,150
If that repetition is proof of life...

420
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,790
It is inevitable that history will repeat itself.

421
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,760
I don't know about Jenova or Sephiroth, but...

422
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,730
The same things should keep happening...

423
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,960
We will obey the fate of life.

424
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,770
And while doing so, we will stop you.

425
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,840
Chief, is that your excuse for seizing Mother?

426
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,520
Are you sure you're not regretting it?

427
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,520
Regretting?
I'm... beside myself in anticipation.

428
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,390
Good.
Then, shall we go ahead and end this?

429
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,270
Denzel, you have to run!

430
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,030
Uoryaa~~

431
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,910
This is...

432
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,080
It's no use...

433
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,520
Is it coming?!

434
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,290
I don't want to look.

435
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,760
Isn't this fun?

436
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,520
Not at all, yo!

437
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,070
You guys are really stubborn, yo.

438
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,540
I told you, if you just give Mother back,
that will be the end of this.

439
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,310
You guys...

440
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,420
What are you planning to do with Jenova's head?

441
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,100
This Reunion or whatever, are you serious?

442
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,900
We just want so see Mother.

443
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,040
She's our Mother,
but she's going to decide everything now.

444
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,090
So, where's Mother?

445
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,700
You know, you keep calling it Mother,
but it's just Jenova's head.

446
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,470
Hey!

447
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,910
Don't call Mother that!

448
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,380
I can't forgive that.

449
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,780
...sorry.

450
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,120
That's right...
Wait, why are we apologizing?!

451
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,900
Tifa?

452
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,440
You bastard!

453
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,720
Protect your mom here!

454
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,750
Barret!

455
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,530
Marlene's safe, right?!
Huh?

456
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,880
I can't match this!

457
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,240
Ugh.

458
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,750
Who's using my materia?!

459
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,410
The bad guys, of course.

460
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,850
Damn them!

461
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,020
Who's that?

462
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,030
The new version of Sierra!

463
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,300
I'll let you ride it later!

464
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,730
Where's the phone shop...?

465
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,910
Who's that person?

466
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,780
They're all friends.

467
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,190
Marlene is safe.
I dropped her off at the store.
