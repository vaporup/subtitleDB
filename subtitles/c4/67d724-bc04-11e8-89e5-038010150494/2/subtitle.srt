1
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:04,665
Maybe I wore it down by dragging it along so much.

2
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,425
I'll go back to the store by myself!

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,435
I'll be waiting with Marlene.

4
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:19,835
Cloud, you'll come back too, right?

5
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:21,965
A little late there!

6
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:31,195
Isn't this fun, Boss?
What should I call out next?

7
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,675
Mother?

8
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,675
Figure it out, you who lack filial piety.

9
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:58,895
Go, Cloud!

10
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,305
There you go!

11
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:19,785
Haiya!

12
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:22,715
Nuoo~

13
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:35,655
Fly!

14
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,105
Not done yet!

15
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:25,135
Here!

16
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:18,235
Mother!

17
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:26,965
Boss!

18
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,285
Hey, pal.

19
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:39,385
Is this thing powerful?

20
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,665
It's a refinement of Shinra technology.

21
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:44,235
So you made it...?

22
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,925
I don't know about powerful,
but it sure is flashy.

23
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,735
Oh, really?

24
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,165
You like that, don't you, pal?

25
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:56,165
Guess there's no overtime today, yo?

26
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,045
Mother...

27
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:25,725
Mother...

28
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,365
Mother!

29
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,565
Let's go, Cloud.

30
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:48,605
I was finally able to meet mother!

31
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,175
What's going to start now?

32
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:55,755
Mother will tell me.

33
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,785
...the spirits don't know anything, huh?

34
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,955
I'm just a marionette, after all.

35
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,655
Just like...

36
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:16,595
the old you!

37
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,265
Cloud, I brought you materia!

38
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:47,795
Don't shake it!

39
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:49,665
Hey, Cid!
Hurry and let us down!

40
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,205
Shut up!
Just jump! Jump!

41
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,375
Let them fight by themselves.

42
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,505
Wha?!

43
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,645
That guy's a spirit of Sephiroth.

44
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,845
You could say he's kind of like a larva.

45
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,615
Larva? Bug? He's a bug?!

46
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,275
Calm down, Princess.

47
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,655
You're saying
that he'll turn into Sephiroth one day?

48
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,695
Hey, do you think that Cloud knows that?

49
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:15,185
Probably.

50
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:16,595
I see...

51
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,965
Let's leave them alone.

52
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,965
I don't get it! Explain!

53
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:24,405
It's man's talk.

54
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:26,375
Discrimination!
Discrimnaaation~

55
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,505
Calm down, Princess!

56
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,305
Us men don't understand either!

57
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:31,575
Two years ago...

58
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:36,815
That strong feeling
that he definitely had during the last battle...

59
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,485
Though it was just two years ago,
somewhere along the way, he lost that feeling.

60
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,625
I think that it brought Cloud back to us.

61
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,925
Tsh... I'll wait 10 minutes.

62
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:52,225
Cloud sure is a pain, just as always, huh?

63
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,495
He's honest.

64
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:14,935
I'll show you my Reunion.

65
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,065
It's been a while, Cloud.

66
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:56,085
You lost your Geostigma?

67
00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:59,425
How unfortunate.

68
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,295
Just what are you hoping for?

69
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,995
The spirits of the deceased who carried the Geostigma...

70
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:09,865
That, with the Lifestream, guides the flow of worlds.

71
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,235
Eventually it infringes on the planet...

72
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,605
What I hope for, Cloud...

73
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:21,205
is to use this world as a ship to sail the darkness of space.

74
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,715
As Mother did before me, you see.

75
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:36,225
One day we will discover a new world.

76
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:39,435
We will create our shining future on that ground.

77
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:41,495
What will happen to this planet?

78
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,265
Who knows... that depends on you, I guess.

79
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:08,455
Sister?

80
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:57,205
Oho... What made you stronger?

81
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,345
I don't want to tell you.

82
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,305
I thought of what to give to you as a gift...

83
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,955
Shall I give you despair?

84
00:21:56,635 --> 00:22:00,335
Kneel, and show me your figure, begging for forgiveness.

85
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,965
What is most important to you?

86
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,435
Would you give me the happiness of stealing it from you?

87
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:56,415
I pity you who understand nothing.

88
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,295
There is nothing that isn't important!

89
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:34,155
Stay there for me, trapped in memories.

90
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:41,665
I...

91
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,895
I won't become a memory.

92
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:16,865
Brother...

93
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:20,605
Kadaj?

94
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:23,835
Huh?

95
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:38,655
Let's stop working so hard...

96
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:46,355
Is that you... Mother?

97
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,765
Let's go back with everyone, shall we?

98
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:53,865
OK.

99
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,255
He did it!
That's how it goes!

100
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:18,845
See?
Just like I told you.

101
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:21,015
A man!
Cloud-san's a man!

102
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,185
Cloud can do anything if he puts his mind to it!

103
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:24,995
Hold on tight, you guys!

104
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:38,275
You were always with us, weren't you...

105
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:40,745
Thank you.

106
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:25,555
Let's all go home together.

107
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,465
We can all have fun together.

108
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,355
Cloud!

109
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:09,235
Cloud's going to come back too, right?

110
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:46,035
Mother...?

111
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:48,935
Again!

112
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:52,475
How many times is it that you called me Mother now?

113
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:57,345
Isn't it nice to be yearned for?

114
00:29:58,585 --> 00:30:01,185
I don't need a kid as big as this one!

115
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:07,185
Too bad...
Your place isn't here, I'm telling you.

116
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:06,415
Sister told us...

117
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,755
Cloud will come here, she said.

118
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:12,725
Welcome home.

119
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:24,505
I'm back.

120
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,035
There are still kids who have the Geostigma.

121
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,015
Yeah.

122
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:42,785
Alright, now we're getting you cured.

123
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,925
It's all right now.

124
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:50,755
Try your best.

125
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,715
Now, everyone jump in!

126
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:46,985
It's cured, it's cured!

127
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:38,735
You're all right now, aren't you?

128
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:00,525
Yeah.

129
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,225
I'm...

130
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:07,965
I'm not alone.
