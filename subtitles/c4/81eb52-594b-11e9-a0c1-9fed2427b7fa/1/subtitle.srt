1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Is the sweetheart you married...

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,400
the husband
you expected him to be?

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Has the war created...

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,900
new problems for you
in your marriage?

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
To answer these
and other personal problems...

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
John J. Anthony...

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,000
founder of the famed
Marital Relations lnstitute...

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
in a brand-new program
of daily sessions...

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,200
of kindly
and helpful advice.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,900
Mr. Anthony, are you ready
for your first case?

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,300
Quite ready, George.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,900
The first case
is that of Miss C.A.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,400
All right. Let's go.
Your problem, please? Come in.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Broadcasting's original
program of mediation...

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,800
"The Court Of Human Relations."

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,200
I wonder if we're not
losing sight of the fact...

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,500
that the basic reality
of life...

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,900
is not machinery
or politics or industry...

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,600
or even rockets to the moon,
but human relationships.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Tonight, one of the letters
I'll discuss...

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,900
is this one
from a man who writes...

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,800
"My second wife
is starting to resent me...

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,200
"for all the things
I did with my first wife.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
"How can I convince her
that I love her...

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,700
"and want us to have
many happy years together?"

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
Please stay tuned.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
Possibly you see these
as feminine qualities.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Now, we all have
feminine qualities.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,300
We're a part
of male and female.

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,900
Every man has a tiny vagina...

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,100
and every woman
has a tiny penis--

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,000
very, very tiny,
but it's there.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,900
We are part of a total whole...

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,400
and if we accept this whole
within ourselves...

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,100
then we can become
an entire person...

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and accept ourselves
and love ourselves...

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,200
and become lovable so others
can love us as well.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Yes, that's right.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,000
- Burns, someone escaped.
- Oh, good.

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,100
Goddamn it! How did Lopez
get out on that ledge?

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,400
He stole Watkins' key
and opened the window.

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,900
Wait a minute.
How did Lopez get that key?

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Was Watkins stoned again?

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,300
Yes, sir.
- All right.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,900
Let's go bring in Lopez,
and you call Chuck...

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
and tell him,
"Turn off this goddamn alarm!"

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
It's driving me nuts!

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Hey, where are you going?

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't concentrate
with alarm bells going off.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100
I got a friend
out on that ledge...

51
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,600
gonna be thrown into solitary.

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,800
That's it. No more messing
around with the inmates.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm sticking to the doctors
and the guards.

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
It won't be as much fun.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,600
I want you to come in here
this instant.

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
All right. Let's talk.
I'm here for you.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
I'm--I'm here to listen.

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,400
- Up yours, man.
- All right.

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
What I hear you saying
is "Up mine, man."

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Up yours. Up yours. Up yours.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,400
OK. What I hear you saying
is a lot of up mines...

62
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,800
and that's really good--
listen--

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,400
because you're starting
to work out some of your anger.

64
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
Go ahead, give it to me.
I can take it. I'm your man.

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,200
You're full of shit.

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,500
- What I hear you saying--
- Hey, I hear me saying it, too!

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Now back the fuck off!

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
I hear you.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,100
Goddamn it,
I thought I told you...

70
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,000
to beef up
his dose of thorazine.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
- I think we did.
Yeah.

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm your doctor!
Now get the hell off this ledge!

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
- Burns?
- Burns!

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Dr. Baird! What the heck...

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
are you two guys
doing out here tonight?

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Get out of here.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,900
I get it. You're having
a private therapy session.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
- Burns, get back now!
- I want to talk to Burns.

79
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,800
I don't give a shit
what you want!

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
That's very sensitive of you.

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,100
Lawrence? May I speak with you
privately, inside?

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
I can handle this.

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,200
What makes you think
you're qualified?

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,300
This time, he's jumping.

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
Next time,
he may be pushing others.

86
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,600
- He's a menace to society.
- Only if he falls on somebody.

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Remember, I'm the doctor.
You're just an inmate.

88
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Yes, Doctor. Now would you
please close the window?

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
So, what's the thinking here?

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm thinking I can fly.
And if not, who gives a shit?

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,000
And what about our dreams, man?
The dream of you and me...

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
playing for the Cubs
in the World Series?

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
You're pitching. I'm catching.
Bases are jammed in the ninth.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
I call for the spitter.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,900
You hork up
an ungodly goober...

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
fire it up, the bottom
drops out of the pitch.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
Mattingly strikes out!

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
And when the dust clears, man,
it's you and me...

99
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,400
sitting around
at Hef's in the grotto...

100
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,000
with a bunch of ladies
named Miss February.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,200
- No way, man.
- And why not?

102
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,400
'Cause even in a dream...

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,700
the Cubs can't win
a World Series.

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,600
- To hell with it. I'm jumping.
- Wait! Wait!

105
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Now, here's an aspect
of your death...

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
that you may have overlooked.

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,400
You hate Dr. Baird, don't you?

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,700
I hate the miserable bastard.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Just think how awful
you could make him feel...

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
if I can talk you
off this ledge...

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
and succeed where he failed.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,500
- Get in here.
- Wait a minute.

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,100
Now, all those people
down there...

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,100
have come here
expecting someone to jump.

115
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,000
And if nobody does,
they are going to leave here...

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
with an empty, unsatisfied...

117
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,300
what-is-the-point-of-my-job
kind of feeling.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,000
- Do you know what I mean?
- No, and I don't care.

119
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

120
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,000
I do care. And now...

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,900
diving for the Cicero County
Correctional Mental Facility...

122
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,000
John William Burns, Jr.

123
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Geronimo! Heads up!

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
George?

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,700
What?

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,700
It's a beautiful day outside.
Don't you want to get up today?

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
But you've been in bed
for two weeks.

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
So?

129
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Well, you're a psychiatrist.
Don't you think that's odd?

130
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
I brought you some lunch.

131
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,800
George, I really think this is
one of your worst depressions.

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,100
Am I alone
in this marriage, Vera?

133
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,800
How many times
do I have to tell you?

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm not depressed.
I just need space.

135
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,700
What about your radio show
and your patients?

136
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
Patients? With their
petty penis problems...

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,000
and their empty
vaginal concerns?

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Those vampires
are sucking the life out of me!

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,400
All right, I'm going to do
a little shopping.

140
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,600
Can I get you anything?

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
I love you.

142
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,600
I can't deal with that, either.

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,200
All right, George.
Time to say good-bye.

144
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Tell me something. When did
you two angels of mercy...

145
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,700
first feel the burning need...

146
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,000
to assist
the mentally handicapped?

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
When we found out
we could hit them...

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,700
without getting caught.

149
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,900
Hi, Robin. How are you?

150
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
- He's all yours.
- I've heard that before.

151
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
So, kid, you missed my dive.

152
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,400
It was a classic.
But you'll be able...

153
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,200
to see it
on the eleven o'clock news.

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,500
Please, let me take you
away from all of this.

155
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
I think my boss is planning...

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
to take you away
from all of this.

157
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
Dr. Lawrence Baird's office.

158
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm sorry,
Dr. Baird's no longer...

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,300
connected with this institution
in any way...

160
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,500
shape, fashion, or form.

161
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,200
He can be reached
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
As a patient.

163
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
What am I supposed to say
when they call back?

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,200
Tell them the truth.

165
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,500
He's a hopeless case.
He's never getting out.

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
You embarrassed me.

167
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,500
You embarrassed
the hospital, the staff...

168
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
and the entire state
health care system...

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
all for a cheap laugh.

170
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
It was not cheap.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,100
It won't happen again, 'cause
you know what I got here?

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,100
Your record.

173
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Great. Put on side two.
Let's rock.

174
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Now, that was cheap, sir,
by way of illustrating--

175
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
Shut up.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Thrown out of Cornell.
Dumped by the Army.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Sentenced to four years
in Joliet for computer fraud.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm a pathetic
human being, sir...

179
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,800
a pathological misfit
with delusions of grandeur.

180
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,600
I think Jung said it best,
or perhaps it was from...

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
"The Anatomy of
Human Destructiveness--"

182
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
A little learning
is a dangerous thing.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
Do I at least get points
for self-knowledge?

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
What you get, Mr. Smart Ass...

185
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,900
is your transfer
back to prison.

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,200
Doesn't take too much
to shut you up, does it?

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,300
You're here because
you were able to convince...

188
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
a bleeding-heart warden
that you were crazy.

189
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,300
I know you're not crazy.

190
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,200
You're just another asshole
looking for a way out.

191
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,300
Now, this order
is undated and unsigned...

192
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,700
and it stays that way
if you behave.

193
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,800
If not,
your ass is back in prison.

194
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
Need I say more?

195
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Actually, I think
we can contain this problem.

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
You're not broadcasting
for a couple of days.

197
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,100
I'll just get the P.R. guys
to start deflecting the flack.

198
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,700
I did not have
a nervous breakdown...

199
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,200
and I did not try
to kill myself.

200
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm simply a man who,
under a lot of stress...

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
took a few too many valium.

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,600
- lt was twenty-seven.
- Were you actually counting?

203
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm a big fan of yours,
Dr. Maitlin.

204
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,500
My name is Klevin...

205
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,900
and I really think
your radio show is special.

206
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,100
Thank you.

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,000
You saved my life one time.
- Really? I did?

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,700
I was living in one of those...

209
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,400
depressing apartments
in North Hollywood.

210
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
It was one of those hot
July eighth kind of--

211
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
You know what, Klevin?

212
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
I really can't cope
with this right now.

213
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,800
I'm under
a tremendous amount of stress.

214
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
Get me out of here.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Dr. Rosenberg...

216
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
I've got to get out of L.A.

217
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm being constantly recognized.
I'm not getting any rest.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're in no shape
to go anywhere.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,700
Actually, George has a point.

220
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
People find out
he's at a you-know-what...

221
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,200
and tried to commit
you-know-what...

222
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,700
it would be very bad
for business.

223
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,100
Harvey, book me to London.

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Tell everybody that I'm off
on a six-month sabbatical...

225
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
to do research on my next book.

226
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
Do you think you're in any
kind of shape to write a book?

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,100
There's no book.
It's just a business lie.

228
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
What?

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,500
Was there something wrong
with the service?

230
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,300
- Did I offend you in some way?
- What do you want?

231
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,400
The gratuity was a bit scarce.

232
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,200
I see. You want more money?

233
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,500
Leeches! This is what you get
for saving somebody's life!

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
They want more, more--more time,
more money, more love!

235
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,300
We'll pay for it.

236
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Is everyone all right
except the waiter?

237
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,600
Maybe it would be a good idea
to get George out of town.

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,100
- Thank you.
You're welcome.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
I need to find a replacement--

240
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,600
someone from
a mediocre medical school.

241
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Someone who can
take over my practice...

242
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
without really curing anyone.

243
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,500
Someone who can continue
my radio show...

244
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,900
without helping anyone
and making me look bad.

245
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
In other words, a bum.

246
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,300
Right, but make sure
it's an out-of-state bum.

247
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,500
Why?

248
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,400
Why? Because every therapist
in this town...

249
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,800
is insanely jealous of me.

250
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Find me some convention
in London...

251
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,600
so I can write it off.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,100
I just want to go to sleep.

253
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
- Fastball.
- Good.

254
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,400
Peace.

255
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
If you're gonna play
in the Major Leagues...

256
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
you've got to learn
what the signals are.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,300
This is important, OK?
Now...

258
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
- Spitball.
- Good.

259
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,800
Happy hour.

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Look, you're interrupting
the game, all right?

261
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Now get off the field.

262
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
Open your mouth.

263
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
You know how I enjoy
opening it for you.

264
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
Well, I'm going to hydrotherapy.

265
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Watkins, I'm so sorry!
I accidentally did that.

266
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,300
But now I'm dancing on them.
I'm right out of control!

267
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
Help me.

268
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Sunlight comes at daytime

269
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,500
And the moonlight comes
at night

270
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,900
You call my name

271
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,100
And I get a fever
when you hold me tight

272
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
You give me fever

273
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,200
Fever

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,200
It's so wrong. He's my husband.

275
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
You're his lawyer
and best friend.

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
From now on,
just think of me as his lawyer.

277
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,600
What if George's depression
is because he knows about us?

278
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
- Did he say anything?
- No.

279
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,600
- Good!
- What are you doing?

280
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,100
All I can think about
is having you on my desk.

281
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,200
- It's so wrong.
- I'm so tired of what's right.

282
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,000
- Are you all right?
- No, we're not all right.

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

284
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Not at all.

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,000
Is that a Chloe or a Montana?

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,400
- It's a Gee Kee.
- Outrageous.

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
This ought to cheer you up.

288
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
I think I found
the perfect guy.

289
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,900
- He's in Chicago.
- Good. Who is he?

290
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,300
His name's Dr. Lawrence Baird.
He's chief psychiatrist...

291
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,800
for the Cicero County
Corrections Mental Facility--

292
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,300
a real dump,
which ought to satisfy...

293
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,700
Maitlin's
out-of-state requirements.

294
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,900
- That's good.
- Secondly...

295
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
he wrote his doctoral thesis
on Maitlin's theory...

296
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,600
of psychocerebral equilibrium,
so he's in alignment...

297
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
with Maitlin's
theoretical approach.

298
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,300
Perfect. Is he too smart?

299
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,700
He graduated from
Florida State University...

300
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,100
with a C-plus average.

301
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
The guy's lucky to be working.

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,800
The sleeves on this jacket
are awfully long.

303
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
I always like to show
a little linen at the cuff.

304
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
You're a smart ass...

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,300
and you'll always be
a smart ass.

306
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,800
Now your smart ass
is going back to prison.

307
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
They won't take me.

308
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,500
You convinced them
you were crazy.

309
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
You were "eating paint chips
off the windowsills...

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
"and licking dust
off the tops of radiators."

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
That part was easy.
Then I got really carried away.

312
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,800
You know,
paper clips, plastic forks...

313
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,200
- Kleenex, Naugahyde.
- An epicure! Good!

314
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I think I can arrange
a loaf of bread...

315
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,300
a jug of water,
and thou licking the floor...

316
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,200
of maximum solitary.

317
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm impressed. You have
quite a way with words.

318
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
One would think you'd be
thought of around here...

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
as a poet instead of
an ignorant, puffed-up...

320
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,100
smidgen of blowfish shit.

321
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,600
A self-destructive need
to defy authority.

322
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Now that's convincing.

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,900
Come to think of it,
Joliet isn't really...

324
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,000
the right environment for you.

325
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,100
You require something
more specialized.

326
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
They've got
this endorphin research...

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
going on
at Stateville Sanitarium.

328
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Research? That's very exciting!

329
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
Plenty of long needles
and heavy sedation.

330
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,700
Trouble is...

331
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,100
they need maximum-risk
psychopathic patients.

332
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,700
They'll be happy to hear
I found them one.

333
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Where is he?
I'd love to meet him.

334
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,700
A subject
for all those experiments...

335
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
they want to do on you...

336
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,100
for the rest
of your four-year stretch.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,200
And with you out of my way...

338
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
I can take my vacation
in peace.

339
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Lopez is screaming his head off
in solitary.

340
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't go away.

341
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not quite finished with you.

342
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
May I speak to Dr. Baird,
please?

343
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
This is Dr. Baird.

344
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,900
I hope you don't mind.
I'm using my speaker phone.

345
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,300
Not at all.
This is Harvey Michaels.

346
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,800
I'm the attorney
for the Greater Los Angeles...

347
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,500
Neuro-Psychiatric Society.

348
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm calling on behalf
of Dr. George Maitlin.

349
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,300
Never heard of him.

350
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,500
Didn't you do
your doctoral thesis...

351
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
on Maitlin's theory
of psychocerebral equilibrium?

352
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, that Maitlin.
How is the old fraud?

353
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,700
Dr. Maitlin had to leave
suddenly for Europe...

354
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,900
and he asked me to find
a replacement for him...

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,100
while he was away.

356
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
What kind of money
are we talking about here?

357
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,800
Let's just say
that Dr. Maitlin...

358
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
has about
the most successful practice...

359
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,700
in Southern California.

360
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,100
I don't like
that word "about"...

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
especially when
we're talking about money.

362
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,800
Could you volunteer
a few numbers?

363
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
I'd say Dr. Maitlin
makes in the vicinity of--

364
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,800
give or take a few dollars--
a million a year.

365
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,500
Are you there, doctor?

366
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm here, Harvey,
but I'm coming there.

367
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
- Great! When can you start?
- ls tomorrow too late?

368
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,500
I need to get released
from a few things.

369
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
He'll be here tomorrow.

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Shouldn't we tell him
about the radio show?

371
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,500
I don't want to scare him off.
He's perfect.

372
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Greedy and dumb--
my favorite combination.

373
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,900
Are you there?

374
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,700
We're all set.
We're all set, Doctor.

375
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,100
I'm going to leave
a ticket for you...

376
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,000
at Continental--
first class, of course.

377
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,200
Only way to go!

378
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,700
It'll be a great pleasure
to meet you.

379
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,900
Just call me Larry.

380
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,500
He wants us to call him Larry.

381
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
What was that all about?

382
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,400
My future.
Here, get me out of this.

383
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,300
You must be joking.
- Just for five minutes.

384
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,700
But Baird could be back
any second.

385
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
That's why we have to hurry.

386
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,300
Gentlemen, aren't you
supposed to be at your station?

387
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
- Lunch.
- Official break.

388
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,900
That's a new one.

389
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,100
You're stealing
my ambulance pager.

390
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
I'm not. I'm redesigning it.
May I have a hairpin, please?

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,300
You're such a crook.

392
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Hurry, please!

393
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,500
You didn't know
I was this good with my hands.

394
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
Yes, I did.

395
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Hurry!

396
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,400
Dr. Baird's office.

397
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,200
I love you, baby.

398
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,900
Are you planning to escape?

399
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,300
Let's call it
unauthorized egress.

400
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,900
That's where
your pager comes in.

401
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,400
- And my hairpin.
- Get that so he can't see it.

402
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,300
Even if you made it
out of the building...

403
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
how do you expect
to get past the guard gate?

404
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,700
Well, Robin,
that's where you come in.

405
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,700
I was hoping
that you could park your car...

406
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,200
out front with the keys
above the sun visor?

407
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
You're crazy.
- Not according to Dr. Baird.

408
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,500
- Any calls?
- It's been very quiet.

409
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,800
Thanks to you
and your little tap dance...

410
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,900
Lopez is now doing
his carrot impression.

411
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
You'll be out of here tomorrow.

412
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
I sure hope so.

413
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,500
It's all set.

414
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,400
You're excused.

415
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Jack, this is Dr. Baird.

416
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,300
Would you and Phil
please come to my office?

417
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
Yes, sir. Right away.

418
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,100
I've been
much too harsh on you...

419
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,200
for these minor infractions.

420
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Come down to my office
immediately.

421
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Baird's off his rocker.

422
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,000
- Security.
- Chuck, Jack Watkins here.

423
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,700
What the hell's
going on down there?

424
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,500
Baird's up with
the goddamn catatonics...

425
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
and the alarm bells
are going off.

426
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
I don't get any signal
down here.

427
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,800
- They're all turned off.
- No, they ain't.

428
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,300
They're ringing.
I can hear 'em.

429
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
And Baird's having
a hot-dipped shit fit.

430
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,600
- Nobody's flashing.
- Don't tell me goddamn nothing.

431
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,700
Them alarm bells are ringing.
Now get to that main terminal...

432
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,100
and turn off
the main switch right now.

433
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
He ain't there.

434
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,300
He gets weirder all the time.

435
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,900
Good evening.

436
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,700
I believe you have
a prepaid ticket for Baird.

437
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
B-a-i-r-d? Right?

438
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,900
- Dr. Baird?
Yeah. Doctor. That's me.

439
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm that doctor.
That's my ticket.

440
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,600
All set, Dr. Baird.

441
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,700
Your flight will be boarding
at gate seven.

442
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Just what the doctor ordered--
this doctor.

443
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,100
- Sir?
- No handcuffs.

444
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,300
Can I have your name, please?

445
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Uh, Baird. Lawrence Baird.

446
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Dr. Lawrence Baird.

447
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
Can I offer you anything,
Dr. Baird?

448
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,200
A bag of macadamia nuts,
all your available cheeses...

449
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,100
a dozen raspberries
with creme fraiche...

450
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,500
and a double shot
of Black Bush.

451
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,600
- On top of the raspberries?
- I'll take it neat.

452
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
- Neat?
- No ice.

453
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,300
Then the filet mignon--rare--
and the duck and the fish.

454
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Blanket, pillow,
eye shades, a pair of...

455
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,000
So, the guy turns to the lady,
and he says...

456
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,700
"Lady, you look like
a very nice woman.

457
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,000
"Where are you from?"
She says, "I'm from Queens."

458
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,500
He says, "Queens? I'm from
natural parents myself."

459
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,100
Speaking of queens,
you are two genuine queens.

460
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,400
And so are you--just kidding.

461
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,200
Captain, thanks for
letting me sit in your lap.

462
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I felt like an 8-year-old kid.
Really. All right.

463
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,900
Hey! I'm Baird.

464
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,300
I'm Dr. Baird. Where you going?

465
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,200
Hey, you! With the sign!

466
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,300
Luscious one! I'm the man...

467
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
you've been waiting for
your whole life.

468
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Aren't you supposed to pick up
Dr. Lawrence Baird?

469
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,500
Yes.
- That's me, Dr. Baird.

470
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,000
I just saw my name
on your sign.

471
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,700
Should I give you
my fingerprint chart?

472
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,900
Do I have to call security?

473
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,300
I'm Dr. Lawrence Baird.

474
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,100
I was contacted
by Harvey Michaels.

475
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I'm supposed to be filling in
for Dr. George Maitlin.

476
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,300
You're not what
I was expecting.

477
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm just dressed a little
hipper than you thought, huh?

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
What, this look
hasn't hit L.A.?

479
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,200
It's the newest trend--
inner city funk.

480
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm Maitlin's associate,
Dr. Rollins.

481
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
Did the plane crash?
Am I in heaven?

482
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,900
I must be dreaming. Pinch me.
Or better yet, I'll pinch you.

483
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
The car's outside...

484
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
so if you'll give me
your claim checks...

485
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,900
I'll have your bags picked up.

486
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,400
No bags. Mugged in Chicago.

487
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Really?

488
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,600
Right in long-term parking
at the airport.

489
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
Three guys this big.
One had his arm around my neck.

490
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,800
The other
went through my pockets.

491
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
- And what did the third do?
- He encouraged them.

492
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Trees suffer, too...

493
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,900
palm, elm,
oleander, eucalyptus.

494
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,300
You ladies care to save
the eucalypti?

495
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Listen to
the high-frequency sounds...

496
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
they make
when they're being cut!

497
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
I'd like you to meet
Oscar Hendricks.

498
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,300
He's the station manager and
producer of your radio show.

499
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,300
Radio show?

500
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Welcome to L.A., Doctor.
Where's your luggage?

501
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,300
Dr. Baird has no luggage.

502
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,900
We can go straight
to the Bel Air.

503
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
- Excuse us.
- Doctor?

504
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,000
Sir? You hear that noise?

505
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
Those are
ultrahigh frequency sounds...

506
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,400
made by ivy weeping...

507
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,900
during a cross-pollination
experimentation at U.C. Davis.

508
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,900
Who speaks for horticulture?

509
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,800
- Doctor, you certainly--
- Look, ease up on me, pal.

510
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm just beginning
to enjoy my jet lag.

511
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,400
I know you're busy.

512
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,100
Only God can make a tree,
but only you can spare one.

513
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,500
My friend,
I think at this juncture...

514
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
I should explain something
to you.

515
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,500
I was born in a lovely
little Midwestern town--

516
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,300
Webster City, lowa.
Maybe you know it.

517
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Lived on a quiet street,
beautiful little white house.

518
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,400
Outside my bedroom window...

519
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,000
there was a spectacular,
huge, giant elm tree.

520
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
One night,
there was a fierce hailstorm.

521
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,600
That tree was hit by lightning
and fell.

522
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,000
Took out half the house
and killed my puppy Dwayne.

523
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,100
Ever since then, no plant
has been a friend of mine.

524
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,500
Wait a second, Doctor.
Wait a second.

525
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Those pants look familiar.
That stripe down there--

526
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,700
Of course
they look familiar to you...

527
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,900
if you've got a subscription
to "Gentlemen's Quarterly."

528
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,500
And incidentally, they grind up
twenty-five maples...

529
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,800
for the September issue.

530
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,400
Did you hear that, everybody?

531
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,700
A doctor who won't help
his little green friends.

532
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Don't you know
that no man is so tall...

533
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
as when he stoops
to pet a plant?

534
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.
You'll have to keep moving.

535
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,500
- I'm sorry.
- This is police brutality!

536
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
How does it feel
to be uprooted?

537
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,600
Put me down!

538
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,300
Let go of me, will you?

539
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,200
How long have you been
a policeman? Help!

540
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
Help! Police brutality!

541
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Is this really necessary?

542
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,100
All of a sudden, the rich
Beverly Hills doctor cares.

543
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,100
Isn't that touching?

544
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
Do you want to press charges?

545
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You bet I do.
This man's a menace to society.

546
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
All right. Come on.

547
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
What did you think
about his display...

548
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,000
of negative delusionary
fixations about plant life?

549
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
I believe in
the secret life of plants.

550
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,500
In fact,
I consulted on that book.

551
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,700
So where are they gonna
take him, anyway?

552
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,900
If he's lucky,
L.A. County Psychiatric.

553
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,900
He's not crazy.

554
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,700
That's a pretty speedy
diagnosis, Doctor.

555
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,900
Antisocial behavior
just happens to be...

556
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,300
my professional specialty.

557
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,800
You have lunch with Michaels
at the hotel at 12:00.

558
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,400
That's good, because
there's nothing in here.

559
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,200
Well, I didn't expect
you wanted anything...

560
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,800
at nine o'clock in the morning.

561
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,000
You forgot.
It's later back east.

562
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
Well, after lunch--

563
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,700
What's the number at the hotel?

564
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,300
- What?
- What's the number of the hotel?

565
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,900
472-1 21 1!

566
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,100
Turned out to be
just your old gym socks.

567
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Then at 3:30,
you'll be at the radio station!

568
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,500
Is it like a panel show--
me with a bunch other doctors?

569
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,000
It's a call-in show...

570
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,300
Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays.

571
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
...vending-machine photo
of you and Sally...

572
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,900
and a partially used box
of Mentor condoms.

573
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
My favorite brand.

574
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
It made me proud to think
that my son...

575
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,600
is one of those people
who can have his cake...

576
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,800
and eat it, too.
Son, I'm proud of you.

577
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,200
And I'm proud
of your choice of condoms.

578
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Love, Dad.

579
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
This is Dr. Baird.

580
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
I'll be checking in shortly,
and I wondered...

581
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,500
if could you send
some things to my room?

582
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,600
Well, how about a case
of Millers, ice cold...

583
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,800
and a pound of Beluga caviar.

584
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,400
Do you think one pound of
caviar will be enough, Doctor?

585
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Maybe you're right. Make that
two pounds of caviar...

586
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
and throw in some cheese puffs.

587
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,700
What are those
big white things?

588
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,500
They're swans.
They belong to the hotel.

589
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,900
- Are they dangerous?
- Hardly.

590
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,500
That's right,
and a pair of shoes, size ten.

591
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,300
- 10 1/2 "D" wide.
- 10 1/2 "D" wide.

592
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,600
- Boots.
- Make that boots.

593
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,700
- With corn pads.
- With corn pads.

594
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,300
- And arch supports.
- And arch supports. Thank you.

595
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,200
You know how I like my shirts?

596
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,000
Shirts should match the suits.

597
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,700
You mean a la page.

598
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,400
Exactly.

599
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Excuse me.

600
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,800
Here you go. Thank you.

601
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,300
Why, thank you, sir.

602
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,400
Would you like some caviar?
We've got plenty.

603
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,600
- No, thank you.
- All right.

604
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
I thought
they took your wallet.

605
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,000
They did,
but when you live in Chicago...

606
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,700
you always keep
a couple of extra bucks...

607
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
in your hollowed-out heel.

608
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,700
Well, your clothes will be
delivered before lunch.

609
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,300
Thank you, Doctor.

610
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
No trouble, Doctor.

611
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,600
Thank you.

612
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,200
- Lawrence.
- Harvey.

613
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,700
My assistant Perry Kovin.

614
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,200
- How do you do?
- Dr. Baird.

615
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
And here's to
a successful practice, Lawrence.

616
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,100
- May I call you Larry?
- Sure.

617
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,700
By the way, Harvey,
how long does this job last?

618
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,700
At least six months.

619
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,500
Six months. That is
a fair chunk of my time.

620
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
It could be a little less.

621
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,500
Six months
will cost you half a mil.

622
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
I'd like 200 thou up-front.

623
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
That's steep.

624
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I'll tell you what.
You go and find...

625
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,100
a psychiatrist
with my qualifications...

626
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,000
who's willing to give up
his practice and come here...

627
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
with no guarantees
and no cash up-front.

628
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm sure he's out there...

629
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,000
but he probably
doesn't speak English.

630
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,300
Your practice, Larry,
consists of a couple of wards...

631
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,100
of indigent psychotics
and jailbirds.

632
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
You don't have
a private practice.

633
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,700
You work for the county...

634
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,500
and drive a Volare
without a radio.

635
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,400
The best year you ever had,
you made, what, 30,000?

636
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,100
We're thinking of offering you
in the neighborhood of...

637
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,900
50,000.

638
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm anxious to move out
of that neighborhood.

639
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,000
And frankly, if you could
have gotten somebody else...

640
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,700
you would have grabbed them.
But I'm the one you wanted.

641
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,400
And now you don't want me,
so, fine. I'm histoire.

642
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,400
I think we all want
to make this work.

643
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,300
I'll just have
to call Dr. Maitlin.

644
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
After all, it's his money.

645
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
You talk to him.

646
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,400
No lunch?

647
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,700
I have a broadcast to do...
maybe.

648
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
And you have an important
phone call to make.

649
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
So, ciao, now.

650
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,500
I have something
to confess to you.

651
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,400
I've done something wrong.

652
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,800
I can't keep it inside anymore.

653
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,700
Did you eat
all of the cucumber sandwiches?

654
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,300
The reason I may or may not
have had a nervous breakdown...

655
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,600
and may have subconsciously
tried to kill myself--

656
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,500
not that I'm saying I did--

657
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,900
is because of the incredible
guilt that I felt...

658
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,700
for the absolutely despicable
act that I have committed.

659
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,300
What is it?

660
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,200
I had sex
with one of my patients.

661
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Excuse me?

662
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,800
I--I had sex with a patient.

663
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm sorry?

664
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,800
I had sex with a patient!

665
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,100
You had sex
with one of your patients?

666
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,300
Phone call for you, sir.

667
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,700
- What do you want?
- We have to talk.

668
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,600
This isn't a good time.
What is it?

669
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,200
What's a Baird?

670
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,800
Lawrence Baird,
the guy from Chicago...

671
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
who's taking over for you.
He's being tough.

672
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
He wants 200,000 up-front.

673
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,200
I will not be held up
for $200,000 up-front.

674
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,400
George, darling,
put on your thinking cap.

675
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,100
You want me to shut down
your practice?

676
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,600
You want your radio patients
tuning to another station?

677
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Now, come on, buddy. Be smart.

678
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Get a receipt.

679
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,900
These are the sales offices.
Hi, Charlie.

680
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
I'm back.

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,600
Say, what is this guy
Maitlin, anyway--

682
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
some kind of
a road-company Dr. Ruth?

683
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,400
You'll see.

684
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Welcome. Nice to see you again.

685
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,500
- Now, had a nice lunch?
Yeah, sure.

686
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Let me fill you in
with the details.

687
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,200
The program runs two hours...

688
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
and there are
twelve commercial breaks.

689
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Now, if you'll
sit down over here--

690
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Oscar, just a sec.
Excuse me for a second.

691
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
Gentlemen, where's my money?

692
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
It's being transferred
from Switzerland.

693
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,600
It's just gonna take
a couple of days.

694
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,300
- Forty-eight hours, then?
- Great.

695
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm going to need
some walking-around money.

696
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,800
We heard about the mugging.
OK, so I'll send...

697
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,200
what, a couple hundred
to the hotel?

698
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,100
I was thinking more like
a couple of thousand.

699
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Just to walk around?

700
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Gentlemen, when I feel
a lack of support...

701
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,500
something very, very strange
happens to my larynx!

702
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,100
And if that happens,
I will not be able to help...

703
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
all those troubled people
out there in radioland.

704
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,300
So we'd better arrange--
thank--thank you.

705
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,100
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

706
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
And now from
the Palm Garden room...

707
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,400
high atop
the Knickerbocker Hotel...

708
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
it's the sound
of the Jack Hilton Orchestra.

709
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,700
The love boat, a good train,
a bad dog, a beautiful girl.

710
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,200
Tonight on "MacGyver."

711
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
Now, what does
all this stuff do?

712
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
Now, the most important thing
is the dump button.

713
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
You're on a seven-second delay.

714
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,100
Anyone gets too vulgar
or intimate...

715
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
you press the button,
and it cuts them off the air.

716
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,200
These are neat.

717
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
They're just
special-effects buttons.

718
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,500
Now, you've got
three commercials to read...

719
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,200
and they're numbered here,
and they're laid out for you.

720
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,100
When she goes like this...

721
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
that means
the commercial break...

722
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,900
and that's when you read
the commercials.

723
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,800
And please,
put this in your ear.

724
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,500
I know you're gonna be
brilliant. I'm so excited!

725
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,600
I wouldn't put it
anywhere else.

726
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,000
You're beautiful, Hendricks.
Don't ever change, babe.

727
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,300
Welcome to "Mind Your Mind"--

728
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,000
the program that invites you...

729
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
the radio audience,
to phone in...

730
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,400
and discuss your problems
with qualified psychiatrists.

731
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Today, substituting
for Dr. George Maitlin...

732
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,800
Dr. Lawrence Baird.

733
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,300
Hi, everybody.

734
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,200
Hi. This is Dr. Baird,
and you're on the air.

735
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,300
We've got our first call today
from Palos Verdes--

736
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,500
Scott. Hello, Scott.
You're on the air.

737
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,800
I guess Scott's
not quite ready...

738
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,900
to deal with his problem yet,
so we're gonna give him...

739
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,300
a couple of minutes
and he'll collect his thoughts.

740
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Going on to our next call now
from West Covina--

741
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Ida. Hello, lda.
You're on the air.

742
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Hello?

743
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Hi there, lda.
What's your problem?

744
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,800
Well, it's not really
a problem, Dr. Baird.

745
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,600
Then why are you calling?

746
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,500
Recently,
I met an old school friend.

747
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Let me ask you something.
How old are you?

748
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,700
Fifty-nine.
Anyway, I ran into this man--

749
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,900
Just a minute.

750
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,500
Sweetie, I can't talk now.
I'm on the phone.

751
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,500
What was that there?
Who were you just talking to?

752
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,000
- My daughter.
- OK, got it.

753
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,400
- I got the door closed.
- Good.

754
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,800
And when we met,
he was very happy to see me.

755
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,800
I mean, we hadn't seen
each other in forty years.

756
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,000
And he told me he thought
I was still beautiful...

757
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
and he wants
to have lunch with me.

758
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,600
That's great. Sounds like fun.

759
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,400
I said no, naturally,
of course not.

760
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,000
But after thinking it over,
I mean, it kind of excited me.

761
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,700
You married, lda?
- Very happily, and so is he.

762
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,200
It's nothing sexual, Dr. Baird.

763
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
Nothing like that.
It just makes me feel young...

764
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,700
and I guess a little romantic.

765
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,800
Now, what really
goes through your head...

766
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,400
when you think about
having lunch with this man?

767
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,700
Just off the top?

768
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
A nice time--
maybe flowers on the table...

769
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,900
glasses of wine.

770
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,500
Now, come on. What are you
really thinking about?

771
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,600
I guess it's
a lot of flattery, too.

772
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
Come on.

773
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,400
You're thinking
penis and vagina here, right?

774
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,500
What?

775
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Maybe he throws you on
the table, spills the wine...

776
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,500
knocks over the flowers,
and you do it right there?

777
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,400
- lt would ruin my marriage.
- Right, but what do you care?

778
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,900
Some hot sex in the afternoon.

779
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,800
When was the last time
you had it? It'd be worth it.

780
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,200
Absolutely not.
I love my husband.

781
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I want my marriage.
I was just talking about lunch.

782
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,500
Bullshit! You were not
talking about lunch.

783
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,300
You're talking about hot...

784
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,200
sweaty bodies
in a steaming, humping mass.

785
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,100
Well, l--you see, l--

786
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,700
Look, the point is,
it's OK to fantasize.

787
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
But you just have to be aware
that sometimes...

788
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,800
these hidden feelings can
come up out of your psyche...

789
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
and kick you in the ass
when you least expect it, OK?

790
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,900
Yes, Doctor. Thank you.

791
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
We're on the air
with Dr. Lawrence Baird...

792
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,500
and we're going to take a break
for a commercial now.

793
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
"A public service message
from the National...

794
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
"Hang Gliding Club President's
Memorial Foundation.

795
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
"Hang gliding is a fun sport...

796
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
"but sometimes

803
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,400
Everything's going swimmingly.

804
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Good. I'm glad you're happy.

805
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,800
Teensy tadpoles of concern--

806
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,900
you took an awfully long time
with your first caller...

807
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,600
and I think your advice
is a bit too specific.

808
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,600
The references
to penises and vaginas...

809
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,800
should be toned down
just a smidge.

810
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,700
So I should use
alternative terms like...

811
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
dick, wang, purple bulb,
midget fireman's helmet...

812
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,200
Iove sausage, and bearded clam?

813
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,800
I mean, this is a conservative
afternoon drive-time show...

814
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,400
and we try to keep things
on an even-keelish level.

815
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,000
Now do you know what I mean?

816
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,600
I guess so. I'm sorry.

817
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,100
Go ahead. You're on the air
with Dr. Lawrence Baird.

818
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
The phone lines are jammed.

819
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Oh Dear. Start writing
our apology to the F.C.C.

820
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,700
So I did it,
and I hate myself for it.

821
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
What is this jerk's name?

822
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
I don't want any trouble.

823
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,400
Here's what you do.

824
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,300
Next time that asshole
comes on to you...

825
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,500
you grab the son of a bitch
by the balls...

826
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,700
and give them a good yank.
If that doesn't fix...

827
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,400
his little red pig of a wagon,
you call me...

828
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,800
and I'll come down there
and deal with that fuck.

829
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Next call,
Caroline from Topanga.

830
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,000
- Did Baird just say "fuck"?
- I think so.

831
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,300
You can't say "fuck"
on the radio.

832
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,000
Apparently Baird can.

833
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
He said "balls," "asshole"...

834
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,000
"son of a bitch,"
and finally "fuck."

835
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,800
We're OK on "balls."
We're iffy on "son of a bitch."

836
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
And even "asshole"
is somewhat...

837
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
anatomically
potentially forgivable...

838
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,700
But there's
no getting around "fuck."

839
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,200
How many negative calls?

840
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,100
None of them.
They all want to talk to Baird.

841
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,100
Go ahead. You're on the air
with Dr. Lawrence Baird.

842
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,700
We have Yuri from Encino.
Go ahead, Yuri.

843
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,100
Doctor, I have a problem
satisfying my partners.

844
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,600
- What business are you in?
- I mean the other ones.

845
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,100
You mean sexual partners.

846
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,300
I mean, just the mention
of the word "sex," and l--

847
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,400
It sounds to me, sitting here
several miles away...

848
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,500
that you have a case
of premature ejaculation--

849
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,400
and a pretty severe one at that.
The first thing I'd suggest...

850
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,800
is not to feel
too bad about it.

851
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,800
It happens to all men
at some point in their lives.

852
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,900
But mine's been going on
twenty-five years.

853
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,500
I can't look at a woman.
I can't even think about sex.

854
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,200
Doctor, it just happened again.

855
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,200
Just calm down now and relax.

856
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Let's try something here.
Think about something...

857
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,200
that could not possibly
arouse you.

858
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,700
For instance...

859
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,100
fixing the transmission
in a 1961 Dodge Shiftomatic.

860
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,400
That's what always
works for me.

861
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,300
I like to mentally
put on my overalls...

862
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,900
take my mechanic's palette...

863
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,000
slide along the floor
under the drive shaft...

864
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,800
pass the universal joint,
grab the joint on the way by...

865
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,000
and wiggle it back and forth,
check it for play.

866
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,800
Then get to the bell housing
and take out your ratchet...

867
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,300
unscrew all the bolts...

868
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,500
and separate the bell housing
from the rest of the apparatus.

869
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,600
And there
you can feel for splines...

870
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,300
and spread the planetary gears.

871
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
You are getting
sexually excited...

872
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,500
as I sit here and talk about
transmission repair.

873
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,500
I think you'd better
come down to my office.

874
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,100
I couldn't afford it, Doctor.

875
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,900
If you need to talk,
just come on down...

876
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,200
and we'll talk.
There's no charge.

877
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,700
Really? What's your address?

878
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,000
I just got into town,
and I'm working...

879
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,600
out of the offices
of Dr. George Maitlin...

880
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,500
in Beverly Hills. Come down
and see me. We'll talk.

881
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
No charge whatsoever.
Thank you.

882
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,000
I've got everybody
in my control booth here...

883
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,900
signaling me like crazy
for a commercial.

884
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,800
They've got these funny...

885
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,500
desperate looks
on their faces...

886
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,000
Iike it'd be
the end of the world...

887
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
if I don't stop
for some silly announcement.

888
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,300
But your problems
are more important.

889
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,100
And if you're like Yuri,
you cannot afford therapy...

890
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,000
come on down and see me
at the offices...

891
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,600
of George Maitlin
in Beverly Hills.

892
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Otherwise,
keep those calls coming...

893
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,300
until they drag me off,
pull the plug...

894
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,800
or everybody in L.A. is cured!

895
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,000
- How was l?
You were fine.

896
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,800
- I wasn't any better than fine?
You were better than fine.

897
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,000
By the way, here's a message...

898
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,200
from someone who didn't
want to talk on the air.

899
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
He's a friend of yours
from this morning...

900
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,700
and he knows
where you got your pants.

901
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,800
See? I told you those pants
would be all the rage someday.

902
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,700
Donald Becker. He's
your garden-variety misfit...

903
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,700
in and out of here
every couple of weeks.

904
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,700
He doesn't fit in anywhere--
not in prison...

905
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,300
not here, not on the streets.

906
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,200
So, in other words,
society rotates him.

907
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,700
Dr. Smet, you ever
look around this place...

908
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,900
at these patients and think...

909
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,900
there but
for the grace of God, go l?

910
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,400
We're supposed to study
emotions, not have them.

911
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,000
Spoken like a true healer.

912
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,300
Can I have the Becker
release forms, please?

913
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,100
He's gonna be a little groggy.
We had to sedate him.

914
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,000
Is this the kind of place
where if anything moves...

915
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,200
you whack it with a thousand
mikes of chlortianazine.

916
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,400
My, didn't we get out...

917
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,400
on the wrong side
of the couch this morning?

918
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,700
Here, sign all five copies.

919
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,100
Dr. Baird
has generously given...

920
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,600
his personal guarantee
for Donald Becker.

921
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,200
He'll be released
with his usual...

922
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,300
seven-day maintenance
prescription.

923
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,800
It'll make it much easier
to handle that way.

924
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,400
Thanks.

925
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,300
I got you into this.
Now I'll get you out.

926
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,100
Here's $50. Have a nice life.
You don't have to thank me.

927
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,800
Wait a minute. Where you going?

928
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,500
Mr. Becker,
out there is life's highway.

929
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,100
The farthest journey begins
with a single step...

930
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,500
and I want you as far away
from me as possible.

931
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,600
Fifty bucks
isn't gonna buy me off.

932
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,700
What I know
is worth a lot more than that.

933
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,000
What do you know?

934
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,200
Those pants you were wearing.

935
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,900
Prison issue in Texas,
Arkansas, and lllinois.

936
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,100
I had a friend
who was buried in them.

937
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,000
I knew it, even though...

938
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,500
the son of a bitch
who sold them to me...

939
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,200
swore they were one of a kind.

940
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,900
I don't know.

941
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,500
There's an air about you--
a certain look.

942
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,300
You don't seem like
a doctor to me.

943
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,500
You look like
a malcontent misfit...

944
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,900
who skirted around
society's edges...

945
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,800
and never done shit.
Takes one to know one.

946
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,400
So either you share
the wealth with me...

947
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,900
or you share the cell with me.

948
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,100
You know, I could get used
to a place like this.

949
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,800
Could really,
really mellow out.

950
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,200
Before you get too mellow...

951
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,300
give me the rest
of those drugs.

952
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,700
What are you--

953
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,300
That's my--my pills,
my maintenance dose.

954
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,300
Hope they got cable.

955
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,300
I won't be able to watch
regular TV without drugs.

956
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,500
Yes, that's a one-way ticket
to Mexico City.

957
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,200
Let me ask you something.

958
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,400
Is there anything more
expensive than first class?

959
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,300
Too bad.

960
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,700
No, leave the departure open.

961
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,900
A flight leaves every night
at 10:00?

962
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,900
I'll leave payment
at the front desk. Ciao.

963
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,200
What's all this stuff about?

964
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,000
You ever heard
of the Klephthes?

965
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,700
- What?
- They were my ancestors.

966
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,200
That hardy band
of Greek patriots...

967
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,100
who held the hills
during the Turkish conquest.

968
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,600
They were known
as the Klephthes...

969
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,800
hence, kleptomaniacs.

970
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
Their revenge was
taking everything in sight.

971
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,100
You know, my ancestors
were Toro Fecundians.

972
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,200
They had the ability
to smell bullshit a mile away.

973
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,100
Why do I have to come with you?
I could be so happy here.

974
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,100
"A," because
you're in my custody...

975
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,300
"B," I don't trust you,
and "C," the maids refuse...

976
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,000
to clean the room
with you in it.

977
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,300
Are you sure
that this is your office?

978
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,600
- ls that him?
- What's going on here, Officer?

979
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,000
Some shrink named Baird offered
free therapy on the radio...

980
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,500
and all these people showed up.

981
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,300
This is a bad dream,
and you're late for Mrs. Guber.

982
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,700
And what is he doing here?

983
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,400
I'm here because I'm
desperately in love with you.

984
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
I have been from the moment
we met at the airport.

985
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,900
I could tell I aroused
an emotion in you.

986
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,600
I knew it was only disgust,
but I can build on that.

987
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,900
- Becker.
- Will you marry me?

988
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Cease and desist.
Give me five minutes.

989
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Mrs. Guber, I'm afraid...

990
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,500
we're going to have
to reschedule today.

991
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,500
Reschedule? Doctor, please.

992
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,400
This can't wait.
I need your help now!

993
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,600
I'm having a power struggle
with my maid...

994
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,700
and she's winning.

995
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,500
- Any ideas, Dr. Rollins?
You're the idea man.

996
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,500
Doctor,
forget about those freebies.

997
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,200
What about me and Maria?

998
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,200
We want Baird!

999
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,900
History teaches us,
among other things...

1000
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,600
that most power struggles are
based on money and/or religion.

1001
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,800
Now, did you have
any religious differences...

1002
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,900
with your maid?

1003
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,900
- We ironed those out years ago.
- Anybody have a pen?

1004
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,700
Thank you.

1005
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,000
Your five minutes are up.
What are you going to do?

1006
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,300
I know what I'd do
if I were in Chicago.

1007
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,400
What's that?

1008
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,400
I'd take them all
to a ball game.

1009
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,500
Thank you very much,
patients...

1010
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
for coming to
our free therapy session today.

1011
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,200
As announced on the radio,
all therapy and treatment...

1012
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,500
today is absolutely free.

1013
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,900
The buses
have been categorized...

1014
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,900
as to particular condition
and ailment.

1015
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,400
All sexual malfunctions
and dysfunctions...

1016
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,800
on bus number one. Penis envy?

1017
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,100
Come on, now. Penis envy?

1018
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,900
Girls, come on. We're
all in this together. Come on.

1019
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,400
Penis envy? On board, please.
Thank you very much.

1020
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,500
Premature ejaculators
and non-ejaculators.

1021
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,700
Now, come on, now.
Premature and non-ejaculators.

1022
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,000
Premature ejaculators,
non-ejaculators...

1023
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,800
and retrograde ejaculators
on board, please.

1024
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,700
Nymphomaniacs.
Don't let me out of your sight.

1025
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,900
Nymphomaniacs,
please come with me.

1026
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,100
Thank you very much.
Bus number five...

1027
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,000
all other forms of
obsessive-compulsive behavior.

1028
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,300
And bus number six,
schizophrenics.

1029
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
Actually, schizophrenics...

1030
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,200
you get to choose
between one and six...

1031
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,900
and bus number six,
all others, please.

1032
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,500
All right, Doctor.
We're all set.

1033
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,000
We're playing New York
at one o'clock.

1034
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
I got you
280 bleacher section seats...

1035
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,900
and the buses are prepaid...

1036
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,300
and here's the microphone
you asked for.

1037
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,000
Great job.
Why don't you join us?

1038
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,100
No, thank you.

1039
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,400
Come on. I got a section
reserved here on the special...

1040
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,100
just for people who have
a compulsive need to brown-nose.

1041
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,100
Brown-nose!

1042
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,500
Relax.
Take a load off those knees.

1043
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,200
All abo-o-o-oard!

1044
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,900
Guy goes to a shrink.

1045
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Says, "Last night,
I dreamt I was a wigwam.

1046
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,300
"Night before,
I dreamt I was a tepee.

1047
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,000
"What's it all mean?"
Shrink says...

1048
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,800
"It's very simple.
It means you're two tents."

1049
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,300
Get it? Tense!

1050
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,600
You're a beautiful audience--
absolutely fantastic.

1051
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,800
He's brilliant, or he's a fool.
One or the other.

1052
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,000
We'll try to work through
your problems here today...

1053
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,300
and see what we can do,
see if we can help each other.

1054
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,400
Who's first?

1055
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,200
Here's a lady. All right.
Where are you from?

1056
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,700
Susan, from Hollywood.

1057
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,800
From Hollywood.
What's your dream?

1058
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,500
I dreamed recently that
I was crossing Afghanistan...

1059
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,800
wearing nothing but high heels.

1060
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,700
And you were embarrassed?

1061
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,400
The Russians and tanks
went right by me...

1062
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,300
and the Afghan rebels
ignored me.

1063
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,600
But when I got
to the Pakistani border...

1064
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,500
there was
a giant shopping mall...

1065
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,100
called the Karachi Galleria.

1066
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,800
But the parking lot
was empty...

1067
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,000
except for millions of lizards
wearing dark glasses...

1068
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,500
and one of them
looked like Barbara Walters.

1069
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,100
They were eating
tiny, little Haagen-Dazs...

1070
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,200
ice cream cones being served...

1071
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,600
by a guy
I went to high school with.

1072
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,700
I went inside the mall
to the food fair...

1073
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,700
where the smell
of caramel popcorn...

1074
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,100
and cleaning fluid
so overwhelmed me...

1075
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,100
that I noticed my nakedness...

1076
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,800
Speaking of nuts,
I'm Donald Becker.

1077
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,100
I'm Dr. Laura Rollins.

1078
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,800
You a shrink?
I don't care much for shrinks.

1079
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,800
All that honesty and openness
and truth-telling gets so icky.

1080
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,500
Sometimes the truth is icky.

1081
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,200
I'm Dan Peterson,
head of promotion.

1082
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,900
This is a wonderful thing
you're doing here.

1083
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
Thanks for giving us the seats.

1084
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,200
If there's anything else
I can get for you...

1085
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,800
please, don't hesitate to ask.

1086
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,200
There is one thing...

1087
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,100
that I've always wanted
to do at a ball game...

1088
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,200
but--no. Forget it.

1089
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,400
Your wish is our command.
- I can't.

1090
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,200
- Sure you can.
- I can?

1091
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,300
The bombs bursting in air

1092
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,800
Gave us proof through the night

1093
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,700
He's been in town
less than thirty-six hours...

1094
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,300
and he's at a ball game
singing the national anthem.

1095
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,800
This guy could be
a goddamn TV star.

1096
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,400
What does a syndicated
shrink show mean to you...

1097
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,100
executive producer Perry Kovin?

1098
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,900
And the home of the brave

1099
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:29,800
Over here, in the left-field
bleachers, are my patients.

1100
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,800
Please give them
a warm L.A. welcome.

1101
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,800
Thank you.

1102
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,500
- Hot dog?
- Thank you, Doctor.

1103
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,000
- Hot dog?
- I hate hot dogs.

1104
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,600
- Getting cured?
- Not yet, but I'm gonna get it.

1105
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,200
All right. On that note,
I think I'll just continue...

1106
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,300
with my therapeutic ministry.

1107
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,600
Unblock your emotions!
Have a red hot!

1108
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,400
Anorexics, come on.
Don't be afraid!

1109
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,100
Have two or three!
It's all right!

1110
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,400
How are you doing? Very good.
Enjoying the game?

1111
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,000
What other sports do you like?

1112
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,400
Fabulous, wasn't it?

1113
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,500
Sigmund was the first
to deal with mass hysteria.

1114
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,800
I am the first to deal
with mass transit.

1115
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,500
You are the strangest shrink
I've ever met...

1116
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,000
and this is the strangest date
I've ever been on.

1117
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,900
Good afternoon. It's 4:00,
tea time in England...

1118
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,900
and therapy time
here in the Southland.

1119
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,100
I am Dr. Lawrence Baird...

1120
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,700
When was the last time
you saw ratings...

1121
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,200
go up like this in two days?

1122
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
He's got something, doesn't he?

1123
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,800
He cares. That's the secret.
It's in his voice.

1124
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,700
You know what that's worth
to an advertiser?

1125
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,000
Absolutely.

1126
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,700
If anyone wants a doughnut
without jelly, they're ready.

1127
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,300
...and recording them
in a diary...

1128
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,200
to analyze
what each drill hit feels like.

1129
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,500
All right. This is
a very, very abnormal problem...

1130
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,200
and certainly the first
we've had on the show.

1131
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,600
I think that immediately
you should seek...

1132
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,900
professional help
and counseling...

1133
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,500
because using an electric
drill on the human skull...

1134
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,700
is something that,
well, we really shouldn't do.

1135
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,300
Next call.
From Torrance, California...

1136
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,000
we have Lucille on the line.

1137
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,000
You're on the air
with Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1138
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,800
What can I do? My husband,
he's the worst slob.

1139
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,200
Anything I cook,
no matter what it is...

1140
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,000
the first thing he says is,
"Do we eat it...

1141
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,200
"or did we eat it?"

1142
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,700
- Then what does he do?
- Then what what?

1143
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,300
- What does he do?
- He laughs.

1144
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,800
- He laughs?
- He learned it in the army.

1145
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,300
"Do we eat it,
or did we eat it?"

1146
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,700
I'm ready to bury an ax
in his head, Doctor...

1147
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,500
and I'm thinking
of buying a gun.

1148
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,400
I have rat poison
in the house already.

1149
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,000
I know how you feel, Lucille.

1150
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,000
I can't take it anymore.
I'm not going to be happy...

1151
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,800
until I see them
taking him out in a body bag.

1152
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,500
I mean, I want the guy dead.

1153
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,100
In these circumstances...

1154
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,400
I think you have to start
by centering yourself.

1155
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,800
I'm not going to center myself.

1156
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,300
Why do I always have
to center myself?

1157
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,200
You got to calm down.
You got any T.M. experience?

1158
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,700
Let him center himself
right in the cemetery.

1159
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Just start by--
close your eyes--

1160
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,200
Hey, lady, zip it up!

1161
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,400
Now, look at your problem
this way.

1162
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,600
If you knock this guy off...

1163
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,100
how long is your happiness
going to last?

1164
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,400
I mean, is this no-good slob
worth going to jail for?

1165
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,800
So what should I do?

1166
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,500
For openers,
I'd say stop cooking for him.

1167
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,200
Does it ever stop raining
in London?

1168
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,200
Rain! Rain! Rain!
It's so depressing.

1169
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,900
- What was her name?
- Whose name?

1170
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,000
Here you are, Dr. Baird.

1171
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,400
The information packet
for your convention...

1172
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,000
all the events of the 3 days.
I'll show you to your room.

1173
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
How many times
do I have to tell you...

1174
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,100
she was a patient!
If I told you her name...

1175
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,400
I'd be breaking the psychiatric
code of confidentiality.

1176
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,900
Don't throw codes at me.
You've committed adultery...

1177
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,400
and you had sex with a patient.
Now what was her goddamn name?

1178
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,700
Is there no end
to this madness?

1179
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,800
I can't tell you!

1180
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,700
I always feel more
comfortable...

1181
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,300
if I can actually
see my luggage.

1182
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,000
Don't worry, sir.
Everything's taken care of.

1183
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,200
I'm sure.

1184
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,400
Give me her first name.

1185
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,800
Then give me the first
initial of her first name.

1186
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,200
This is so immature.

1187
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,800
Then give me one letter
in her first name.

1188
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Aren't I entitled to that?

1189
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,700
"E." Now drop it.

1190
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,300
"E." "E" doesn't tell me
anything. I need a consonant.

1191
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Have you no sense of privacy?

1192
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,500
Christ! You have sex
with a patient...

1193
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,100
and you talk about privacy?

1194
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,100
Am I supposed to tip you,
or is that--

1195
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,100
That's entirely up to you, sir.

1196
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,100
This is worth
how much in American?

1197
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,700
That's about $1.50, sir.

1198
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,300
I'll have to work this out.

1199
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,400
- What?
- I've had an affair, too.

1200
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,800
That is so sad.

1201
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,600
I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm trained...

1202
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,700
to see through
these ego defenses.

1203
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,900
You're hurt,
and you're striking back.

1204
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,000
It's all right. I understand.

1205
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,300
Look at me.

1206
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,400
I've had an affair
for the last year and a half.

1207
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,000
- Who is he?
- I can't tell you.

1208
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,200
- Why?
- He's a friend of yours.

1209
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,100
No friend of mine
would ever sleep with you...

1210
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,100
because, if he did,
I would kill him.

1211
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,700
Now tell me you're lying.

1212
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
I'm lying.

1213
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
Maitlin? Who's Maitlin?
Forget Maitlin. Maitlin's a bum.

1214
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,300
Already you're wiping him
off the ratings charts.

1215
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,100
- I like your loyalty.
- Maitlin's history.

1216
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,900
- Histoire.
You're hot, Larry.

1217
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,900
So, what do you think
of a self-help video series?

1218
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,700
- A doctor diet book.
- Please, shut your toilet.

1219
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,400
Although he's got a point.
A shrink's diet book. Why not?

1220
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,100
I got the title:
"Shrink Along With the Shrink."

1221
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,500
Sensational!

1222
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:58,300
Hardcover's very prestigious,
but the real profit's in paper.

1223
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,900
You might want to--
the rose on that...

1224
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,800
I don't think it's edible.

1225
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,500
What did I tell you?
Has he got a mind?

1226
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,700
We don't want to stop there.

1227
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,900
That thing you did on the buses
was just the beginning.

1228
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,200
Buses seat
eighty-four people...

1229
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,400
even if you rip out
the toilets...

1230
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,300
but ocean liners--
ocean liners hold thousands!

1231
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,800
I figure you get the QE ll...

1232
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,300
you paint a happy face
on the back...

1233
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,600
950 a pop.
What could be so terrible?

1234
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,000
- I can see millions.
- I'll settle for my 200,000.

1235
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,900
Cookie money. Cookie money!

1236
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,100
So call me Famous Amos.

1237
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,700
Campari and soda.

1238
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,400
Now, tomorrow night...

1239
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,700
Maitlin's getting
the G.L.A.N.S. award...

1240
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,400
and I want you
to accept it for him.

1241
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,900
Now, don't worry. Before
you step up on the dais...

1242
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,300
the money's
gonna be in your hand.

1243
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,600
And afterwards...

1244
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,300
I'm the toughest negotiator
in the west.

1245
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,200
Ask anybody. Nobody fucks
with Harvey Michaels.

1246
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
Excuse me,
I promised the staff...

1247
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,800
I'd help with the dishes
and take out the garbage.

1248
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,300
Then I have to make
a phone call.

1249
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,000
Do you know my friend
had shoulder pad implants?

1250
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,200
- ls that the ultimate?
You're kidding?

1251
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,300
Dr. Glassman
did my uppers and lowers.

1252
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,200
- lsn't it great?
- Wonderful!

1253
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,500
I spent the entire weekend...

1254
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,300
being pounded on
by Madame Wanda.

1255
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,700
I highly recommend it.

1256
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,100
I had my initials
carved into my leg.

1257
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,300
Who did it?

1258
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,300
I did it myself.

1259
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,700
- It's nice.
- Fascinating.

1260
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,000
Hef, nice to see you...

1261
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,200
in somebody else's jacuzzi
for a change.

1262
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,100
Good. I want
to sit down with you...

1263
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,100
and carve out
some long-range objectives.

1264
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,800
I'd never let you work for me.
You're a sleazoid. Ask anybody.

1265
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,000
And he's got integrity.

1266
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,500
Why wouldn't l
just love this man?

1267
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,800
You know I do. I love you.
I do. I love you.

1268
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,400
I love this man!

1269
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,300
- He does. He does love you.
- Good.

1270
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,600
And I'm not embarrassed
to say it. Here.

1271
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,400
Keys to the Maserati.
It's parked outside.

1272
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,800
It's got a cellular phone,
everything.

1273
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,200
These are the keys
to the motor sailor.

1274
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
Now take them, use them.
They're yours.

1275
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,600
You've been working too hard.

1276
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,100
You know why I'm lending you
the car and the yacht?

1277
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,100
Because I believe in you.
I believe in you.

1278
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,800
I believe that you do!

1279
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,500
Great!
Have a contract drawn up.

1280
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,900
- Contract?
- Now, don't worry.

1281
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,100
It's only for seven years.

1282
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,600
And remember,
a contract's like a marriage.

1283
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,200
You're unhappy,
it's not working out...

1284
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,600
What do we do?

1285
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,800
You know what they say, boys.

1286
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,600
It's unlucky to look upon
the bride before the wedding...

1287
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,600
so I'll catch you guys
at the altar.

1288
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,600
At the altar.

1289
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,800
How about it, girls?

1290
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,400
Want a demonstration
of Archimedes' principle?

1291
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,100
What did he say?

1292
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,500
You know, I had fun tonight.

1293
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,700
I finally found
a place I fit in...

1294
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,200
as well as I do the nut house--

1295
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,900
Beverly Hills.

1296
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,300
What's wrong?

1297
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,000
I have this rumbling
in my gut...

1298
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,900
and these terrible chest pains.

1299
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,200
You ate too much.

1300
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,500
It's not gas. It's trust.

1301
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm not used
to trusting anyone.

1302
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,500
It doesn't feel right.

1303
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,600
I had one of the hottest...

1304
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,400
Church of the Gethsemane
franchises in Texas.

1305
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,600
It netted about 1,100 a month
in donations...

1306
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,900
pamphlets, baptisms...

1307
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
and then she walked in.

1308
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,400
You're sitting on my covers.

1309
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,800
Long red hair,
short red dress, Nadine.

1310
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,800
She said she played the organ,
and she sure played mine.

1311
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
I trusted her,
did everything she told me...

1312
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,300
including
burning down my church...

1313
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,300
and running off with her
and the insurance money.

1314
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,700
Then I woke up alone
on a vibrating bed.

1315
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Nadine was gone for good.

1316
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,700
But she did leave me
a couple of quarters...

1317
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,900
to keep the bed going.

1318
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,200
That's what I got
for trusting her...

1319
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,600
over my own selfish instincts.

1320
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,100
Always a mistake.

1321
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,100
You see,
that's what I like about you.

1322
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,700
You talk straight.

1323
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,200
It's hard not to trust you.

1324
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,600
You'll learn.

1325
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,600
And what do we do when
your refrigerator repairman...

1326
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,000
suddenly cancels
an appointment?

1327
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,600
And when your daughter
borrows your new clothes?

1328
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,400
And when your doctor refuses
to validate for parking?

1329
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,500
The snarl is good, a little bit
more protestation...

1330
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,400
and we'll tack a woof on there,
so what you'd have would be...

1331
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,100
- Work on it.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1332
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,100
And I'll be looking forward
to our next session.

1333
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,300
I will, too.

1334
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,100
Neo-Pavlovian
rackoff technique...

1335
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,800
for immediate stress relief.

1336
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,400
I'm Dr. George Maitlin
from Los Angeles.

1337
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,200
Are you registered?

1338
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,300
I saw your sign.
I thought I'd drop by.

1339
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,100
I'll gladly pay
whatever fee is...

1340
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,800
The Paleo-Jungian luncheon
is £10.

1341
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,300
The entire conference
carries a fee of £500...

1342
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,100
which includes
the various lectures...

1343
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,100
and the concept exchange
period.

1344
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,000
I'll take lunch.

1345
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,400
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

1346
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,500
So, we're two Yanks abroad.

1347
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,900
I saw you and your wife...

1348
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,400
playing a word game
in the elevator.

1349
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,700
Where's your practice?

1350
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,000
L.A.

1351
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Mine's in Chicago.

1352
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,700
You're here
just for the conference?

1353
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,400
I'm here on sabbatical.

1354
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,700
I'm...doing research
on a...new book.

1355
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,400
I'm just here...

1356
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,600
to get out of the grind
of Chicago for a while.

1357
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,500
Are you familiar with Chicago?

1358
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,100
I'm telling you,
Cicero County Hospital...

1359
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,100
has got to be the most
depressing hospital...

1360
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,200
in the history of medicine.

1361
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,900
Did you say
"Cicero County Hospital"?

1362
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,000
Are you familiar
with Dr. Baird?

1363
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
That's me. Lawrence Baird.
Glad to meet you.

1364
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,900
- What do you mean, "That's me"?
- Dr. Baird. Cicero County.

1365
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,100
You're not Dr. Baird.

1366
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Dr. Baird's
in my office in L.A.

1367
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,100
Excuse me. I think
I ought to know who I am...

1368
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,500
better than you do.
I'm Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1369
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,700
What are you doing here?

1370
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
Just what you're doing.
Eating lunch.

1371
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,700
Well, what about my $200,000?

1372
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,600
Here's your parking pass
for the big dinner tonight...

1373
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,300
and your tux has been
delivered to the hotel.

1374
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
Watch the phones for me?

1375
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Can I interest you
in some lunch?

1376
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,200
I can't have lunch.
But you can take me to dinner.

1377
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:48,600
I'd love to, but
I've got this thing tonight.

1378
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,600
Me, too. Why don't you
pick me up at 6:00?

1379
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,200
Sure. I can pick you up,
but then, like, after...

1380
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,900
I don't think
I'm going straight home...

1381
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,300
after the evening's over, so...

1382
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,000
Well, maybe I can
talk you into it.

1383
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,500
1425 North Orange Grove Avenue.
6:00?

1384
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,000
I'll see you there.

1385
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,500
- ls this a joke?
- Just wait.

1386
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
They're ringing my office
in Beverly Hills.

1387
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,000
If Dr. Lawrence Baird answers,
you've got a problem.

1388
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,600
I'm so glad you're here.

1389
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,100
Listen,
I'm tired of this charade.

1390
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,600
Yes? Hello? Dr. Baird's office?

1391
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,300
I have to tell you who it is.

1392
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,400
Is Dr. Baird in?

1393
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,900
I'm going to kill Michaels!

1394
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,100
When did you find out?

1395
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
- Just now!
- Who told you?

1396
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,300
Who cares?
Some doctor from Chicago.

1397
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,400
He's telling everybody!

1398
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,100
I thought I was
the only one who knew!

1399
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,500
You knew? How?

1400
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,000
- I mean, I was there.
- Where?

1401
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,500
Do I have to give you
all the sordid details?

1402
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,800
You can tell
Dr. Lawrence Baird...

1403
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,600
that Dr. Lawrence Baird called!

1404
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,900
I deserve it.

1405
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,500
Mostly in hotel rooms,
twice at his house...

1406
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,800
and once--I can't believe
I'm telling you this--

1407
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,300
on his desk.

1408
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,800
What, for Christ's sakes,
are you talking about?

1409
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,300
Michaels. He's the one I've
been having the affair with.

1410
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,600
You've been having an affair
with Harvey Michaels?

1411
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,900
Isn't that what
you were talking about?

1412
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,800
They say
I'm doing my radio show.

1413
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,900
Thanks for watching the phones.
Any calls?

1414
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,300
This what you looking for, Doc?

1415
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,800
Your one-way ticket
to Mexico City?

1416
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,000
That was just--

1417
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,900
What happened
to partners in crime?

1418
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,600
Honor among thieves?

1419
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,900
You don't want to skip
south of the border with me?

1420
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,600
Maybe I don't want
to team up...

1421
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,000
with an asshole
with one bad hand.

1422
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,500
- Do you want me to pay?
- Pay him! Pay him!

1423
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,000
- We can settle it.
- Give him the money!

1424
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,700
Come on, come on,
we're gonna miss the plane!

1425
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,000
You're not dressed yet?
We're going to be late.

1426
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,500
They'll wait for you, Doctor.

1427
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,100
I guess so.
I'm the prime attraction.

1428
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,400
Have you seen Becker?
He disappeared on me.

1429
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,000
Win a few, lose a few, Doctor.

1430
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:08,100
What is it now
with this "Doctor"?

1431
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,600
You are a real doctor,
aren't you?

1432
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,100
Dr. Lawrence Baird?

1433
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,400
Who told you?

1434
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,400
The real Dr. Baird. He called.

1435
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,700
Don't worry.

1436
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,200
I didn't give you away.
I covered your ass.

1437
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,900
Why?

1438
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:32,600
Because I once thought
it was cute.

1439
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,600
The customs people treated you
with such respect...

1440
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,000
and they went through my bag...

1441
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,100
Iike I was some kind of
a drug dealer, you know?

1442
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,100
First stop, Beverly Hills.
465 North Bedford Drive...

1443
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,400
then the Riviera Country Club.

1444
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,100
Nice rental. Where's Harvey...

1445
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,100
and my box
of green dead presidents?

1446
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
They're waiting to be exhumed
in the game room.

1447
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,300
Is he here?

1448
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,200
I thought he was
at some kind of banquet.

1449
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,900
Would you stop following me?
I told you to stay in the cab.

1450
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,400
Driving me crazy.
Would you calm down...

1451
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,000
and act like the doctor
you claim to be?

1452
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,500
At least the police
could identify him--

1453
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
I've been telling you
for fourteen hours...

1454
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,200
shut the fuck up
about the cops!

1455
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,800
I'm the one
who's been violated!

1456
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,300
What about my reputation?

1457
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,500
Your reputation
isn't worth ten cents.

1458
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,700
My reputation's
a million-dollar industry!

1459
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,000
It'll go right down the toilet
if the public finds out...

1460
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,700
some fraud's been doing
my radio show.

1461
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,800
We got to keep things quiet...

1462
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,200
and I've got to get
my $200,000 back.

1463
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,500
I'm calling the cops!
911--it's the same everywhere.

1464
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,300
Sorry, Doctor, but I haven't
traveled five thousand miles...

1465
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,500
to have you fuck up my revenge.

1466
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,500
Grab your balls
for the last time.

1467
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,200
Help!

1468
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,100
I'm in Dr. Maitlin's office!

1469
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,300
Here's your money
and here's your contract.

1470
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,500
Just think of it
as your blood test.

1471
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,100
I never get married
on an empty stomach.

1472
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,000
Let me bark down some steamed
puffed chicken rolls...

1473
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,600
some boiled peas,
I'll speed-read this...

1474
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,200
and get back to you
with some addendums.

1475
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,900
Fair enough. By the way,
I want you to know...

1476
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,900
I didn't even take out
the money I advanced you.

1477
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,000
- Now, you know why?
- Because it's not your money.

1478
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:40,500
This is a serious breach
of professional ethics!

1479
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,100
Are you there?
Are you there, you rat?

1480
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,400
Help! Anybody, help!

1481
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,400
Please help me!

1482
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,500
It's about time.

1483
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,700
Who are you, and what are you
doing in Dr. Baird's closet?

1484
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,500
- I'm Dr. Baird.
- Sure, you are.

1485
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
That's how come
you're locked in his closet.

1486
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,400
- I'm calling the cops.
- Good.

1487
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,700
...true paranoid is the one
in possession of all the facts.

1488
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,400
But the real reason
we're here tonight...

1489
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,400
is to honor
our Dr. George Maitlin...

1490
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,900
and to accept the award...

1491
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,300
a man who's only been with us
for four days...

1492
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,900
How long do these people take?

1493
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,300
How long it takes
is how long it takes.

1494
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,700
Oh. How long it takes
is how long it takes.

1495
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,300
That's not fast enough!

1496
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,900
Freeze, scumbag.

1497
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,100
Get in the closet.
Come on, get in there!

1498
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,200
OK, but you're gonna have to
answer to Dr. Baird about this.

1499
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,500
- I am Dr. Baird!
- Sure, you are.

1500
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,800
I wasn't born yesterday.

1501
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,700
I'm a trained professional,
fella!

1502
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,300
Thank you. Thank you.

1503
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,200
Thank you, Harvey.
Thank you. Thanks very much.

1504
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,900
Not here. Go around back.

1505
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,900
...to try to fill
the shoes of a man...

1506
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,200
who has made therapy
a household name.

1507
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,700
Some may say, "Why does therapy
have to take such a long time?"

1508
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,500
To them I say,
there's nothing...

1509
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,100
that can be done
in a short time...

1510
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:31,800
that can't be done
just as well in a long time.

1511
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,300
Thank you and--wait a minute.

1512
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,000
Oh, boy. You're not
gonna believe this.

1513
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,500
I left that wallet...

1514
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,500
in the other taxi,
the one we took from the air--

1515
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,400
If Dr. George Maitlin
could have been here tonight...

1516
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,100
he would be most, most
honored with this award...

1517
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,600
and he would thank you
for this honor, but...

1518
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,400
You're supposed
to be in London.

1519
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
We were gonna tour
the countryside...

1520
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,100
but Vera decided
she wanted to come back...

1521
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,300
to fuck you again.

1522
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,700
You know,
you're not feeling well, and--

1523
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,300
Let's not talk about that
right now.

1524
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,000
- Let's talk about money.
- Money?

1525
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You gave my money
to the wrong man!

1526
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,300
He's the perfect choice.
The ratings have soared.

1527
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,000
You shithead! That's not Baird!

1528
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,700
If you go out there
in this condition...

1529
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,200
everyone will know
the kind of man you really are.

1530
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,600
You're right.
We don't want that.

1531
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:35,000
Now, some of you may say
that this is a materialistic...

1532
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Good evening, I'm here to--

1533
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,100
I'm sorry.
This is by invitation only.

1534
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,800
I'm Dr. Baird.

1535
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,000
Excuse me?

1536
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,000
Madame,
I am Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1537
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,800
I don't think so.

1538
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,300
I assure you, I am Dr. Baird.

1539
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,900
I'm a legitimate
psychiatrist...

1540
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,300
and this is a legitimate
psychiatrist's dinner!

1541
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,700
Let's just calm down.

1542
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,900
I'm perfectly calm,
I assure you.

1543
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,100
Be a psychiatrist.

1544
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,700
You won't have
to wash your hands as much!

1545
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,600
No trouble.
No trouble whatsoever.

1546
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,700
I'm perfectly calm.
Don't touch me.

1547
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,400
Get your hands off me!

1548
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,800
My goodness,
what do we have here?

1549
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,400
- Where's my money?
- Don't worry about the money.

1550
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,500
As soon as the dinner's over...

1551
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,000
we'll get Baird,
or whatever his name is...

1552
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,600
we'll take him outside,
we'll grab the briefcase...

1553
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,100
- with the cash.
- Cash?!

1554
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,300
You paid him cash?

1555
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,000
You told me never
to pay anybody in cash!

1556
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,700
It's the only way
he would take the job...

1557
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,100
and so far,
he's worth every penny.

1558
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:36,200
I'll kill him!
And when I get finished...

1559
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,000
if there are
any bullets left...

1560
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,700
On your desk.

1561
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,300
Thank you. You have been
a beautiful audience.

1562
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,000
Quick! He's getting away!

1563
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,200
- Hurry!
- Crowd, clear, please!

1564
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,500
Crowd, clear, please!

1565
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,500
Watch your stuffed
chicken rolls, folks. Parking!

1566
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,500
...be arresting the fake!
I'm Dr. Baird! Listen to me!

1567
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,400
I am Dr. Baird! I am--

1568
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,100
Be on back to my office
on Monday. See you later!

1569
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,400
When do we board?

1570
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,900
- Fifteen minutes.
- Thanks.

1571
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,000
...that has developed here.

1572
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,000
Because of the difficulty
of the access...

1573
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,600
to the Hollywood sign,
it's going to take...

1574
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,100
a coordination
of Herculean effort...

1575
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,800
on the part of all three
of these departments...

1576
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,300
to deal with the problem.
As you can see...

1577
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,400
an unidentified man has climbed
to the top of the "Y".

1578
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,000
Continental announces...

1579
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,600
the boarding of flight 45
to Mexico City.

1580
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,500
You just don't have
your thinking cap on.

1581
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,400
We don't want
to go public with this.

1582
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,700
The pens from my office!
My jellybeans!

1583
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,000
Your eye's not on the sparrow.

1584
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,600
- I want my $200,000!
- It's deductible.

1585
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,500
It's a legitimate
business expense.

1586
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,700
We're talking, what,
72.5% of that.

1587
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,900
Then I want my $145,000!
My antique lighter!

1588
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,500
And you say he's not a crook!

1589
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,300
You made a commitment.

1590
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,500
And remember, in this town,
your word's your bond.

1591
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,200
Let's not forget Balzac
when he said...

1592
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,300
"A man's reputation
is like a famous painting.

1593
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,800
"Once its authenticity's
questioned, it's never--"

1594
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,500
- Shut up!
- Right.

1595
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,500
We'll have to get back
to you on that...

1596
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,900
if you promise
to come back to us...

1597
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,700
as soon as we get
the picture and the sound.

1598
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,600
As you can see from
our helicopter up in the sky...

1599
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,800
we're getting
a very clear picture now.

1600
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,700
The man seems to be dressed
all in black...

1601
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,200
in some sort of ministerial
suit of clothing.

1602
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,200
Late word has come in.

1603
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,800
The man's name is Donald Becker.
One Donald Becker.

1604
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,700
If there is a relative
out there...

1605
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,000
who knows Donald Becker...

1606
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,600
could you please make your way
to the Hollywood sign?

1607
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,800
Perhaps you could, uh...

1608
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,400
I'm doing this for you, Baird!

1609
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,300
Please don't do this.

1610
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,300
Please don't do this to me.

1611
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,000
Where are you now?

1612
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
In first class.

1613
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,800
I've never seen
such a mass of chaos in my life.

1614
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,200
We'll cut to the copter
in the air...

1615
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,100
to see if they can pick it up.

1616
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,100
He seems to be saying "Baird."

1617
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,800
Where is he?
Where is he?

1618
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,300
Where's who?

1619
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,300
It's only money.
It's only money.

1620
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,700
You can cash in
on his momentum.

1621
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,100
You don't want to blow that.

1622
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,300
That looks like
Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1623
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,400
You crook!

1624
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,100
...recently on the radio.
Dr. Baird...

1625
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,300
there's a rumor that
this man is your patient.

1626
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,100
Is this true, and if so,
how does it reflect...

1627
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,300
on your treatment of him?

1628
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,800
Badly, but maybe he won't live
to spread the word.

1629
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,300
Thank you.
That was Dr. Lawrence Baird...

1630
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,200
noted radio psychiatrist.
My goodness.

1631
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,000
Looks like Dr. Baird has taken
Captain Goldblatt's horse!

1632
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,300
With my money!

1633
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,900
- lsn't anybody--
- I'll stop him!

1634
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,100
Good shot.

1635
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,900
- Where are we going?
- Guess!

1636
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,100
Are you Dr. Baird?
It's an honor to meet you.

1637
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,000
Listen, I have got
to get up to the "Y."

1638
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,400
My wife heard you on the air.

1639
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,100
When she finds out
I met you in person--

1640
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,000
Listen, Doc, actually, I got
a little problem with her.

1641
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,200
For the last few months--

1642
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
We should really
talk about this later.

1643
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,600
She likes to come home Friday,
put on my uniform--

1644
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,800
Is that the only way out?
Is there any other way out?

1645
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,000
It's not like she's kinky,
either.

1646
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,500
I think she just wants
to be me.

1647
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,000
Look, I am responsible
for this guy, and--

1648
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,900
She runs around
writing parking tickets.

1649
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,700
She tries to pee standing up.

1650
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,100
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1651
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,100
I'll put my mind
to a solution to your problem...

1652
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,800
and see if we can't
come up with something...

1653
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,200
but I have to go.

1654
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,400
Yeah, but, Doc, I really
need your advice on this--

1655
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,900
Got a session down here now.
See you after.

1656
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,100
Just in case
you don't make it...

1657
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,300
Later. We'll talk later.

1658
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,800
I really will
think about it, though.

1659
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,500
It's you.

1660
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,300
Decided to come back, have you?

1661
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,400
Besides, I thought you were
on your way to Mexico.

1662
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:51,000
What happened--my fatal
attraction lured you back?

1663
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,100
This is a fitting setting
for our reunion.

1664
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,500
Where's your unicycle
and your umbrella?

1665
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,800
I've seen trained bears
do better wire acts.

1666
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,500
I can't see my money.

1667
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,900
Maybe he gave it
to someone to hold.

1668
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,900
Cool it about the money.
There's TV here.

1669
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,200
You want
the whole world to know?

1670
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,400
He could fall,
and we'd never find it.

1671
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,600
You're a doctor.
Act concerned.

1672
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,800
You don't think I'm concerned?

1673
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,300
You give away my $200,000
and sleep with my wife?

1674
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,900
I'm concerned.

1675
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Quiet.
A man's life is at stake.

1676
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,300
Guess whose.

1677
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,900
As I've said, I've been at
numerous crisis situations...

1678
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,300
but never one where the parking
was just so terrible.

1679
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,600
Hold on. Hang on.

1680
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,700
That's it.

1681
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,800
Why did you come back?

1682
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,900
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

1683
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,800
- Scared, Doctor?
You've got the wrong man.

1684
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,700
You just needed a little help.

1685
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,100
How did you get up here anyway?

1686
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,000
Same way you did, Doc.

1687
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,900
Thanks for thinking of this.

1688
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,100
What do you want?

1689
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,500
What do I want?
What do you want?

1690
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,900
You're the one
who was screaming...

1691
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,300
all over local TV for me.

1692
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,600
I just wanted you
to watch me jump.

1693
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,500
Bullshit. You wanted me here.

1694
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,900
Now I'm here, so let's do it.

1695
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,000
Great. Let's do it.

1696
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,900
- Me first.
- We jump together.

1697
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,100
But before we go, there's
something I gotta tell you.

1698
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,600
Hurry up.
I haven't got all night.

1699
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,200
I was history.
I had in my possession...

1700
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:48,100
$200,000 in crisp, cold cash.
I was rich.

1701
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,800
You take this key...

1702
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,700
go to the airport,
get my 200,000...

1703
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,800
and start a new life.

1704
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,900
Why did you come back?

1705
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,500
You were wrong
when you said I deserted you...

1706
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,500
but you were right
about the pants.

1707
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,800
Size thirty-eight crazy.

1708
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,400
- What?
- Prison issue.

1709
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,400
The County Correctional
Mental Facility For Men...

1710
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,400
at Cicero, lllinois.

1711
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,800
John William Burns, Jr.,
inmate number 7474505-B...

1712
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:34,000
current status--
escaped and at large.

1713
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,500
They'll get us.

1714
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,400
We'll live to jump again.

1715
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
- Cuff him.
- Arrest him, too.

1716
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,900
Dr. Baird? He's the hero.

1717
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,500
That's the nut case
we're taking in.

1718
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,900
He's not Dr. Baird!

1719
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,900
What's in a name?
This man's a hero.

1720
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,500
- Don't be ungracious.
- He stole my money!

1721
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,000
Come, come, we'll talk.

1722
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,300
Here.
You better take back your key.

1723
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,900
Absolutely not. My offer
still stands. You keep it.

1724
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,600
- They're gonna lock me up.
- Don't count on it.

1725
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,100
Sorry about this.
I'm gonna have to take you in.

1726
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,300
That's quite all right.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

1727
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,800
A nice guy like you?
It's a shame.

1728
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,600
- I quite agree.
- Cuff him, too.

1729
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,200
Listen, Captain,
you don't want him.

1730
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,000
He's not a criminal.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

1731
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,300
I sent him up there.

1732
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,600
It's not his fault.
It's my fault. Let him go.

1733
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,200
You'll still be
on the 11 :00 news.

1734
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,500
Release the other guy.

1735
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,700
I want my money!
He took my money!

1736
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,000
You! You! You took my money!

1737
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,200
- Are you Maitlin?
You're damn right!

1738
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,400
Author of the theory
of psychocerebral equilibrium?

1739
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,700
You better believe it!

1740
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,300
- Garbage!
- Garbage?!

1741
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,800
I'll show you garbage!

1742
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,300
This is no time for violence.

1743
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,900
- Wrong, Harvey!
- Holy shit!

1744
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,800
You let my money get away.

1745
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,000
- But you didn't.
- I'm your friend!

1746
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,800
You banged my wife
for a year and a half...

1747
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,800
on your lousy desk!

1748
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,200
The desk
is a signed Julian Schnabel!

1749
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,800
Sign this!

1750
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,600
Jesus! He's got a gun!
Grab him! Get him!

1751
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,200
We have another
late-breaking development.

1752
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,000
Gunshots have erupted beneath
the famed Hollywood sign...

1753
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,900
which recently saw
the thrilling rescue...

1754
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,100
of a deranged patient by radio
psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1755
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,600
The alleged assailant is
allegedly Dr. George Maitlin...

1756
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,200
another Los Angeles
psychiatrist.

1757
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,500
Perhaps we could get
an interview with him.

1758
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,600
Dr. Maitlin, is there
anything you'd like to say?

1759
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,100
- Fuck you!
- That's another first.

1760
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,400
Let's check on two-thirty.

1761
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,900
Doctor.

1762
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,400
I'm Dr. Baird.

1763
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,300
I'm Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1764
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,400
I hear you.

1765
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,500
I hear you saying
you're Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1766
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,800
I am Dr. Baird, though.
I really am.

1767
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,200
I'm Dr. Baird.

1768
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,900
I hear you. I really do.

1769
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,400
I hear you saying,
"l am Dr. Baird."

1770
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,100
You're not really
listening to me.

1771
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,600
You think you're hearing
what I'm saying...

1772
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,000
but you're not
really listening.

1773
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,500
I'm Dr. Lawrence Baird.

1774
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,700
I'm a qualified,
accredited psychiatrist...

1775
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,800
and somebody else
has supplanted me.

1776
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,100
Up his thorazine
to 500 milligrams.

1777
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Another evaluation for you,
Dr. Smet.

1778
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,400
- Amazing.
- What, sir?

1779
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,600
How many psychiatrists
we're getting these days.

1780
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,500
- What?
- I'm Dr. Smet.

1781
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm not sick.

1782
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,300
I just need space.

1783
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,600
And the moon
lights up the night

1784
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,600
My eyes light up
when you call my name

1785
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,900
I get a fever--

1786
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,100
Hey, Houdini, let's go.
You're going to Lompoc.

1787
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,700
You give me fever

1788
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,200
See you later,
fellow timesters.

1789
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,600
Good luck.

1790
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,000
You'll be glad to know
that the horror stories...

1791
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,900
about Lompoc prison
aren't really true.

1792
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,400
Good.

1793
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,400
I mean, they got rid
of most of the rats.

1794
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,200
The number of knife attacks
is way down...

1795
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:31,800
as are the cases of ptomaine
poisoning and gang rape.

1796
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,100
I'm glad to hear it.

1797
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I mean, they haven't had
a really nasty death...

1798
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,300
there in at least a week.

1799
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,800
- Nice.
- Hey.

1800
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,300
Frank, a little trouble ahead.

1801
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:48,100
33 David, we got a 902T
at Pacific Coast Highway...

1802
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,500
and Decker Canyon. Send rescue.

1803
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,100
There's a woman
trapped in there!

1804
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,600
Hey, what's going on?

1805
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:20,000
Frank, stop that van!
Stop, or I'll shoot!

1806
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,200
You're under arrest! Stop!

1807
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:29,100
You didn't say they were
gonna be shooting at us!

1808
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,100
Welcome to life on the lam!

1809
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,300
Hold still
while I get these off.

1810
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:37,100
You really are everything
a guy could want.

1811
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,500
- Shit!
- What? What's wrong?

1812
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,200
The Freon's not working!

1813
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,900
Who planned this disaster,
anyway?

1814
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,500
- She did.
- He did!

1815
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,200
The gods of transportation
have been kind to us.

1816
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,200
- Put this on.
- How?

1817
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,100
Over your shoulders. Good.

1818
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:59,300
Just call me the wild one.

1819
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,600
- Good luck, boys.
You're not coming with us?

1820
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,800
This is it for me.

1821
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,300
But I don't want you.

1822
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,900
I want the girl.
This isn't fair.

1823
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,800
Life isn't fair. Hop on.

1824
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,100
But I don't want to escape
with you. I hate you.

1825
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,600
I can accept that.

1826
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,700
This hog can kick ass!

1827
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,600
Can outrun any cop car
built since '71!

1828
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,300
Where did you get
this bike, anyway?

1829
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,900
I dipped into petty cash--
your briefcase!

1830
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,300
I take back everything...

1831
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,800
I ever said about you!
You really are crazy!

1832
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,500
How far do you think
we're gonna get on this thing?

1833
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,200
- To Monte Carlo.
- On a motorcycle?

1834
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,000
No! On Harvey's yacht!

1835
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,300
There are worse things
than being crazy!
