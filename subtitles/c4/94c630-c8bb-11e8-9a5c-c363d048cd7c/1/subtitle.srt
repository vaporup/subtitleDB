1
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,862
Okay, ladies, gather up your possessions.

2
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,699
Get up, ladies, let's go.

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,350
All right, let's move it.

4
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:47,925
Move it this way.

5
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,391
Move it.

6
00:00:58,775 --> 00:00:59,764
Move it.

7
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,076
Move it, then.

8
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,243
Hey, can't rush, huh?

9
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,029
Come on, ladies. Let's go walk.

10
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,210
Come on.

11
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:47,955
Quiet down now, girls.

12
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,424
- He looks good.
- Gutierrez, Luna.

13
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,894
- Coming, baby.
- Take your property, ladies.

14
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:55,658
Washington, Tyra.

15
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,398
Yes. Yes, I'm coming.

16
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,298
Baldonado, Lucy.

17
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,264
- Jones, Arabella.
- Asshole.

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,738
Kirk. Claudia.

19
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,043
- Hold it, baby.
- Cortez, Consuela.

20
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:13,779
Mazzola, Elle.

21
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,084
- All right, ladies, let's go.
- Let's go, ladies.

22
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:19,416
It's show time.

23
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,351
All right, ladies, keep it moving.

24
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,263
Watch the steps, now.

25
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,428
Shut up.

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,470
Come on over here,
and get some real hard shit.

27
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,478
Do you like Puerto Ricans, baby?

28
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,822
Quiet, please!

29
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,956
$500 or 30 days. Three weeks to pay.

30
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:07,628
October 14. Calendar 21.
People v. Roosevelt Davis.

31
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:11,436
Docket number 8483, September 19.

32
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,368
Defendant is charged
with attempted grand larceny.

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,572
Does the defendant waive
the reading of the rights and charges?

34
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,545
We do.

35
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,016
For the People, Saul Kreiglitz.
For the defendant, Aaron Levinsky.

36
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,048
- What are you gonna give me on him?
- A misdemeanor.

37
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,886
He's an accomplice. Disorderly conduct?

38
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,585
Come on, he shows a prior.

39
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,595
Yeah, he shows a prior,
but he hasn't done any hard time.

40
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,755
Give him a break.

41
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,061
What are we supposed to do,
give him a medal?

42
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,429
- How much you talking about?
- We're talking $100.

43
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:41,804
$50.

44
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,996
$75. Best I can do.

45
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,369
Hey, hey, coming through here.

46
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,646
Excuse me. Coming through.

47
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,541
...twenty-five years.

48
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:00,248
She started to laugh and told me
to go to hell, and ordered me to leave.

49
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,787
- Rose?
- In a minute.

50
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:13,561
Gonzales, your lawyer has just entered
a plea of guilty on your behalf.

51
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,298
You understand, pleading guilty,
you waive your right...

52
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,670
There she is, Arthur.

53
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,606
Now, is that what you wish to do?

54
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,470
- Do you understand what I've said?
- Sit down, Rose.

55
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,982
- Is that what you wish to do?
- Yes, yes, it is.

56
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,719
By this plea of guilty,
you're giving up important rights...

57
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:34,814
...I wish to make you aware of.
- She looks terrible.

58
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,722
Remember, Clarence said
this would be the worst of it.

59
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,053
Yes.

60
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,256
Do you understand that by pleading guilty,
you're waiving your right...

61
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,133
...to confront and cross-examine
any witnesses against you?

62
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,268
And you are also giving up
your right to remain silent?

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,906
Be calm, Rose. Everything's under control.
We'll be out of here in no time.

64
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,082
Now, sir, did you take property
from premises...

65
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,950
...at 540 East 8th Street
without permission of authority?

66
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,216
Are you pleading guilty? Because you are...

67
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,920
Did you see who's here, at $250 an hour?
Clarence fucking Middleton.

68
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,553
Last I heard, it was $350.

69
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,961
- Who's the client?
- I don't know.

70
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,226
Say it aloud.

71
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,301
Guilty.

72
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:23,396
Did anybody make any threats or promises
in order to induce you to plead guilty?

73
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,798
Saul, do you have the Kirk folder?
I'll be taking that one.

74
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,205
Mr. Gonzales,
this is your third appearance...

75
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,267
Thank you.

76
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:34,180
...before this court since last year.
The sentence of this court is six months.

77
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,848
Do you understand what I've said so far?

78
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,323
What have you done?

79
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,421
Counsel. Notify your client
of his right to appeal.

80
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,725
Thank you, Mr. Torres. Next case.

81
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:52,798
Calendar 28. People v. Claudia Kirk.
Docket 6418.

82
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,265
The defendant is charged
with manslaughter in the first degree.

83
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,139
- The Morales case is next on the docket.
- All in good time, Mr. Levinsky.

84
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:04,202
- I have an appointment in Part 30.
- It'll wait. Sit down, please. Let's move it.

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,269
Take it easy.

86
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,407
- My name's wrong.
- We'll take care of it.

87
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,780
Counsel, state your appearances
for the record.

88
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,286
Francis Xavier MacMillan
for the prosecution.

89
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,346
Clarence Middleton for the defendant.

90
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,620
The defendant has been indicted
in the county of New York...

91
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,025
...for first-degree manslaughter.
We request...

92
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,154
May I say something?

93
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,189
...she be given psychiatric evaluation
to determine her capacity to stand trial.

94
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,736
In accordance with article 730 of the CPL...

95
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:31,637
...she was remanded to the New York
County Prison Hospital for examination.

96
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,765
Excuse me!

97
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:36,437
The psychiatrists' report finds
the defendant not competent to stand trial.

98
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,104
I have something to say!

99
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:42,015
They recommend that she be committed
to a mental facility and the People concur.

100
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,945
- Hands by your side.
- All right.

101
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,046
I can't hear. I have a right to hear.

102
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:50,354
Defendant will keep quiet
if she knows what's good for her.

103
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,228
- Clarence, have you read these reports?
- We have.

104
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:55,924
- Do you move to confirm?
- I do.

105
00:06:55,998 --> 00:07:00,697
- Consult with your client.
- Larry, in view of the overriding fact...

106
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,672
- Could you please let me go?
- The fact is, she's impossible to talk to.

107
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,941
Clarence, please consult with your client.

108
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,336
Make it quick!

109
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,945
- Get your hands off me!
- Face forward.

110
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,776
Claudia...

111
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,154
Listen, they don't have my name right.
I don't want to be known as Kirk.

112
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,693
Do you understand?
My name is Draper. Claudia Draper.

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,749
Yes.

114
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,058
- D-R-A-P-E-R.
- Yes, we'll get that changed.

115
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,859
Good.

116
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:32,389
Now look, Claudia, I am trying to help you.
We all are.

117
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:33,863
What's going on here?

118
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,928
We're trying to do
what we feel is best for you.

119
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:39,772
Who is "we"?

120
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,333
We offered you
criminally negligent homicide.

121
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,935
You didn't want us to.

122
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,572
Hey.

123
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,581
Who are you?

124
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,651
What?

125
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Who are you?

126
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:57,587
Well, Clarence Middleton.
Don't you remember me?

127
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,128
Who do you work for?

128
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,993
- I'm your lawyer, Claudia.
- Good. We're on the right track.

129
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:09,161
We have to claim
that you're incompetent to stand trial.

130
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:13,635
- Do you understand?
- No, I didn't give you permission to do that.

131
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,802
- I'm not incompetent.
- Of course you're not.

132
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:18,870
- I'm innocent.
- I know you are. But that's not the issue.

133
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:22,111
- What do you mean it's not the issue?
- The doctors agreed.

134
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:26,246
Your parents agree it's best if you're
in a hospital rather than in a prison.

135
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,290
I don't give a shit what they say!

136
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,882
Your parents love you.
It's all been arranged.

137
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,191
- You goddamn son of a bitch!
- Arthur, stop her!

138
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,289
I'm not incompetent.
I'm not incompetent, you are!

139
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,698
Get her off me! Get her off me!

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,828
- Move it now.
- Hit him again.

141
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,496
Quiet in the court!

142
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,937
You can't lock me up.

143
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,804
Let go of me! Get away from me!

144
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,867
Let me through. That's my daughter.

145
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,606
- Calm down.
- Don't hurt her.

146
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,272
Sir, restrain yourself.

147
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,407
Why are you trying to put me away?

148
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,817
Why are you trying to lock me up?

149
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,611
You are all in cahoots.

150
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,049
Put me down!
There's nothing wrong with me!

151
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,390
God! Keep going!

152
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,589
- No!
- Watch out!

153
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,822
Put me down. I need a lawyer!

154
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,295
- Quiet in the court!
- All right, everybody settle down.

155
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,766
Order in the court!

156
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,903
Order in the court.
It's over, folks. Sit down.

157
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,465
- God, Clarence, are you all right?
- I'm bleeding. My glasses...

158
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,737
Can we go on?

159
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:25,809
No, we can't go on. I've been attacked
in a courtroom, for Christ's sake.

160
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,141
I hereby request permission
to be released from this case.

161
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:33,245
- Can't you just move to confirm?
- No, sir! Get someone from Legal Aid.

162
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,846
I'm going to a doctor.

163
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,754
- Are you all right?
- I need a Legal Aid member.

164
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,094
Where's Torbick? Where's Morella?

165
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,565
Don't we have anybody
in the appointments list?

166
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:46,693
Levinsky.

167
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,070
Where are you going?

168
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,299
To get Morella. I have an appearance
in Part 30, Your Honor.

169
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,868
- Let me get Morella. He's on catch.
- But I caught you.

170
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,282
Your Honor, I respectfully submit
that my caseload is...

171
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,286
Mr. Levinsky, is your caseload too heavy
to accept any appointments in this court?

172
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,549
For the record, Mr. Middleton withdraws.

173
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,754
Mr. Levinsky is appointed counsel
for the defense.

174
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,024
It's 7:30. We have two psychiatric reports.

175
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,631
All it takes from you
is a motion to confirm.

176
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,332
- I haven't seen the reports.
- See them. Let's move it.

177
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,400
Let's get this one out of here.

178
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,636
- What's the original charge?
- Manslaughter.

179
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,339
The original charge is not the issue.

180
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:35,783
Psychiatrists' reports say she's unfit
to stand trial. Let's have your motion.

181
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:40,244
Didn't you say you were in a hurry,
Mr. Levinsky?

182
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,525
- I am in a hurry.
- Then let's have your motion.

183
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,082
I don't have all day.

184
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,393
I move to controvert.

185
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,538
For the record,
the defense moves to challenge.

186
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,035
You wanted a motion.

187
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,313
That's my motion.

188
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,051
What's your basis, Levinsky?

189
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,323
Well, as I observed,
the defendant seemed a bit reluctant.

190
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,385
I have to consult with my client.

191
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,270
Fine. Adjourn until Monday.

192
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,662
Monday? I haven't even met the woman.

193
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,534
Between now and Monday
I have no time to prepare a case.

194
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,067
Adjourn until Monday, Part 65. Next case.

195
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,012
Calendar 29, People v. Calvin Johnson.

196
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,523
Docket 6914, robbery in the first degree.

197
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,597
Aaron? Are you out of your mind?

198
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,568
- I don't have to take that shit from him.
- Of course you do, he's the judge.

199
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:05,366
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go back in and settle up.

200
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:13,675
- Did you see that girl work over Middleton?
- I wish she'd nailed MacMillan, too.

201
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,445
Pardon me, I'd like talk to you.
I'm Arthur Kirk, the girl's father.

202
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,283
I'd like to talk to you, too.

203
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,323
- Aaron? See you later?
- Yeah, yeah.

204
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,652
My wife, Rose.

205
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,251
- Mrs. Kirk.
- How do you do?

206
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,956
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe what happened.

207
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,827
- Sit down.
- Yeah, thank you.

208
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,835
Tell me, why did you stop the motion?

209
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,998
I'm not familiar with the case yet.

210
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,768
The case is about a very disturbed girl.
She needs to be hospitalized.

211
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,710
I haven't read the reports,
and I have to confer with the defendant.

212
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,237
- How can you confer? She's sick.
- I know how painful this is for you.

213
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:49,841
You're damn right. What about her pain?

214
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,915
- Arthur.
- You see, we're talking about my child.

215
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,625
She needs to be in a hospital,
not some kind of a prison cell.

216
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,660
And let me tell you.

217
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:03,454
- She is in no condition to stand trial.
- Darling, he didn't say he wouldn't do it.

218
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,333
Of course. You didn't say that, did you?
Please, forgive me.

219
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,536
- I guess I'm not handling this too well.
- That's perfectly understandable, sir.

220
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,580
- Will you be seeing her soon?
- I'll have to, yes.

221
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,649
- Will you tell her that I love her?
- Of course.

222
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,684
Please.

223
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,375
I want to give you my card.

224
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,880
If you need anything, anything at all,
just call my office.

225
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,082
Thank you.

226
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,785
- Mrs. Kirk?
- Good-bye.

227
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:47,202
Doctor Arantes to the conference room.

228
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,668
Doctor Arantes to the conference room.

229
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm here to see Claudia Draper.

230
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,716
Levinsky, Legal Aid.

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,981
May I inspect your bag, sir?

232
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,266
Your name tag, sir.

233
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,834
Dr. Simon, 817. Dr. Simon, Psychiatry, 817.

234
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,034
Come with me, sir.

235
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,711
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Dr. Morrison.

236
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,407
- Excuse me. Dr. Morrison?
- Yes?

237
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:34,114
My name is Aaron Levinsky.
I'm the new attorney for Claudia Draper.

238
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:37,681
I just read the report
that you did with Dr. Arantes about her.

239
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,789
- Is there going to be a hearing?
- I think so, yeah.

240
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,387
Yeah, you got a minute?

241
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,658
Not about Mrs. Draper.
It wouldn't be ethical. Sorry.

242
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:50,671
I'm just curious about a couple of things
you wrote here in this report.

243
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,401
You mention that you found her
flagrantly sexual...

244
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:58,980
...and had random visions
and was subject to paranoid...

245
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,948
I'm really sorry, Mr. Levinsky.

246
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,041
Doctor?

247
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,121
Doctor?
I just want to ask you one question.

248
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,385
Is she crazy?

249
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,056
Crazy is a word I dislike.

250
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:17,254
Dr. Hodges, telephone on line 3.

251
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,728
Do I think she should go to prison? No.

252
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:23,827
She's where she belongs, Mr. Levinsky.
Good night.

253
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,334
Good night.

254
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,502
Shut up, Mary!

255
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,983
Watch out for Babby.
She might try something.

256
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,387
Dr. Morrison's left a prescription for her.

257
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,159
You can wait in here, sir.

258
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:37,974
Claudia...

259
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:42,250
...you feel more better.
You feel more calm, huh?

260
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,787
You are a woman of passion.

261
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:50,113
Passion is good in the bed, but not here.

262
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,158
Someone is waiting to see you.

263
00:16:58,534 --> 00:16:59,523
What?

264
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,861
Someone is here to see you.

265
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,945
She's fine.

266
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:19,885
- Do you want some help, Dr. Arantes?
- No, no.

267
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,889
You just follow me.

268
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,987
Follow me, Claudia. Just follow me.

269
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,989
- Right this way, Mrs. Draper.
- Thank you, Manuel.

270
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:45,880
You must be Claudia.

271
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,914
And I hope you're Mr. Green from Chicago.

272
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,115
Just call me Allen. Sit down.

273
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:53,680
Thank you.

274
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,920
- Champagne?
- Yes, please.

275
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,974
I've never had to take a test before.

276
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,774
Not since high school.

277
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,416
Do you have certain questions
that you ask?

278
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:32,758
Things like that?

279
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,117
No.

280
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,956
I just go by the seat of my pants.

281
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,863
How am I doing?

282
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,462
I'm about to slide over my chair.

283
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,444
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
My name is Aaron Levinsky.

284
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,981
I'm an attorney sent by the court.

285
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,693
Mr. Middleton
doesn't represent you anymore.

286
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:16,596
Would you like to discuss your case?

287
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,675
I don't know if you can follow any of this...

288
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,079
...but do you understand
that I'm gonna go to court on your behalf?

289
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,755
And tonight I got to go home to Brooklyn
on the subway...

290
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,919
...and that scares the shit out of me.

291
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,491
I'm real tired. It's been a long day.

292
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,390
You're breaking my heart.

293
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,534
- Terrific. She can talk.
- Talk?

294
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,707
I can dance, juggle, card tricks.

295
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,040
What kind of a show
do I have to put on for you?

296
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,440
Did I say something wrong?

297
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:08,748
It seems I can't get a fair trial
unless I put on a good show for...

298
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:11,718
...who now?

299
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:16,125
Aaron Levinsky, Legal Aid.

300
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,063
- No, it's not like that.
- No?

301
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,001
Well, how do I get to stand trial?

302
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,362
You don't have...

303
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:25,463
How do I get to stand trial?
That's what I want to know!

304
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,703
That's okay. Close the door, please.
I'm her attorney.

305
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,845
- Says who?
- Says the court.

306
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,374
If you need me, I'll be right out here.

307
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,049
You think I'm gonna need him?

308
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,853
Well, haven't you heard?
I lash out and strike people at random.

309
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,929
I know. I was there.

310
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,800
- I think you broke his nose.
- So the day's not a total loss.

311
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,906
All right, what we've got here
is a 730 process.

312
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,877
This is a process
whereby the State is assuming that you...

313
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,744
- Are you married?
- Pardon me?

314
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,915
You got a missus?

315
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,287
She give good head?

316
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,922
You want to talk
about your situation here or what?

317
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,686
You've been indicted
for manslaughter first degree.

318
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,129
I know all that.

319
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,760
Tell me why you're here.

320
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:32,200
- The truth?
- No, the bullshit, Levinsky.

321
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:36,907
I love listening to bullshit,
especially when I'm drowning in it.

322
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,012
I know why you're here.

323
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,849
- You're here to see if I'm crazy, right?
- No.

324
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,818
No. No, you're here to see
just how crazy I am.

325
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,253
Well, two psychiatrists already say
that you are incompetent.

326
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,825
Morrison and Arantes? Frick and Frack?

327
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:59,226
Arantes can barely speak English,
and Morrison...

328
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,963
...he's a very weird guy.

329
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,004
You know, I flashed,
and he didn't even look.

330
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,476
How about you, Levinsky?

331
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,045
Are you weird, too?

332
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,714
I must be okay, I'm looking.

333
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,621
- Your mother says she loves you.
- Fuck my mother!

334
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,892
Why didn't you tell me you work for them?

335
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,018
I'm not working for them...

336
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,460
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- Hold it! Listen!

337
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,398
- I came here to do my job in good faith.
- You talked to my mother?

338
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,630
- Will you listen to me? You got a choice.
- What did she tell you?

339
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:38,571
You can either cooperate with me
and maybe it goes your way...

340
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,337
...or you can yell at me, I'll sign that
motion to commit, and that's it.

341
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,003
You creep lawyers are all alike.

342
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,344
As long as you get paid, you don't care
who goes where for how long.

343
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,747
I'm not taking money from you.

344
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,547
This one comes in here
and tells me if I don't kiss ass...

345
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,315
...he's gonna walk out on me? Walk.

346
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:56,050
And be held in contempt of court?
No, thank you.

347
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:59,284
It doesn't work that way.
I'm stuck with you.

348
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,255
Oh, man!

349
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,463
Oh, boy.

350
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:12,673
First, we have to get a shrink
to look at you and then you...

351
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,707
No more shrinks.

352
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm giving you very good legal advice.

353
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:23,181
Thanks. What I said about lawyers
goes double for shrinks.

354
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:29,446
Mrs. Draper, there are two psychiatrists
who already say that you're crazy.

355
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:33,494
You got to have at least one psychiatrist
who says you're not crazy...

356
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:36,429
...or you don't have a case.
- Sure, I do. I'm my case.

357
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,694
I get up there, I say my piece,
I prove I'm competent!

358
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,260
Look, I don't know if you believe this,
but I'm a perfectly sane woman.

359
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:47,069
And I don't bother anyone
who doesn't bother me first. You get it?

360
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:49,872
I don't want any more quacks
running around in my head...

361
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:51,913
...talking about my toilet training.

362
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:57,649
There's only one thing that scares me.
A stupid client. And you terrify me.

363
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,555
- Have you ever testified in court?
- No.

364
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,783
- So you've never been cross-examined?
- No.

365
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,726
- How long have you been hooking?
- Three years.

366
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:10,228
- And you've never been busted?
- Never. Now tell me I'm incompetent.

367
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,230
Well, look.

368
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,871
Mrs. Draper, it doesn't look good
to beat up one of the city's top attorneys.

369
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,776
Well, it may not have looked good,
but it sure felt good.

370
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:29,249
What was I supposed to do,
sit there while my own lawyer says...

371
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,251
...I’m incompetent to stand trial?

372
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,183
Are you?

373
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,916
How competent do you have to be,
for Christ's sake?

374
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,652
Good point.

375
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,727
Let's say for now
that you're not entirely incompetent.

376
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:42,126
Yeah, let's say that.

377
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,688
Let's say for now
that the doctors here are all wrong.

378
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,031
- Yeah, let's say that, too.
- Then why is all this happening to you?

379
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,209
Mrs. Draper?

380
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,588
Do you want me to represent you
in this competency hearing?

381
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:17,160
- I don't know. Are you any good?
- You had good. Now you got me.

382
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,000
I could do worse.

383
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,132
Don't be so sure.

384
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,434
If we win at the hearing, you get a trial.

385
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,569
But if you lose the trial,
you can go to jail for 25 years.

386
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:36,308
I'll take the risk. Because if I don't,
I could end up wearing this bathrobe...

387
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,284
...until I collect social security.

388
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:44,087
MacMillan's gonna eat me alive.

389
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:48,962
- All right, let's start at the beginning.
- Fine.

390
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,698
- Give me some background details.
- All right.

391
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,204
Now, you talk to me
and pretend I'm sane, okay?

392
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,965
Okay.

393
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:04,374
And I'll do the same for you.

394
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:06,736
Okay?

395
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,375
Thank you.

396
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:16,512
Frank.

397
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,584
MacMillan.

398
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,550
Yeah, Aaron, what's up?

399
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:24,121
The Claudia Draper thing.
I'm gonna go ahead with it.

400
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,026
Well, good, good.

401
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:29,070
No, no. I'm gonna defend the girl
at a competency hearing.

402
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,900
The judge set it up for Monday.

403
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,332
Why are you doing that?
She's better off in a hospital than in prison.

404
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,672
Don't mess this up.

405
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,370
She wants to stand trial
on the manslaughter charge.

406
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:40,846
I think she's up to it.

407
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,110
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, I do.

408
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,515
I'll need the police reports
and a court order to enter the apartment.

409
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,990
You're making a mistake. That girl is sick.

410
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,129
I have an aunt who's crazier than she is.
She's president of the PTA.

411
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,596
Arthur Kirk is very well-connected.

412
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:02,364
He doesn't want his daughter going through
a trial. We're doing her a favor.

413
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:06,931
The accused wants her day in court.
I still believe in that kind of stuff.

414
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:08,600
Don't get high and mighty with me.

415
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,441
Maybe you just don't have
a good enough case.

416
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,080
Maybe you're trying to avoid a trial.

417
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,579
I don't have a very good case? Really?

418
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:20,016
She almost cut off a john's head.
You want her back on the streets?

419
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:23,784
- Will your secretary pull the reports?
- She has more important things to do.

420
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:24,847
Really?

421
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,918
Then I'm gonna have to paper you
to death, Francis.

422
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:31,432
You'll have to hire another secretary
just to keep up with the work.

423
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,727
All right, kid.
But you're going up against me on this one.

424
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,035
Hey, what are you doing?
Carla is waiting for Fantasy Island.

425
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:46,977
Hey, fuck it.
Girlfriend, I want to watch my game show.

426
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,781
That's not your card.
That's my card, Marian. I had four.

427
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,218
One, two, three, four.

428
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,517
Hey.

429
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,352
I told you not to do that.

430
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,925
- These aren't the same cards I had before.
- I don't want to see your cards.

431
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,899
Come on, Suzanne.

432
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,569
How many, Suzanne?

433
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,674
- Three.
- No, five on that play.

434
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:16,540
No, no. Wait. Stand pat, Suzanne.

435
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,600
Stand pat?

436
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,546
Yeah, you see, because you got
a good hand, so you can stay.

437
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,914
Hey, hey, that's not fair. No, hey, look.

438
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,749
Suzanne, you were gonna win.
Look, you got a full house.

439
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,346
You got three jacks and two kings.

440
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,585
Claudia? Claudia, would you like
to come into my office now?

441
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:35,560
Would I like to?

442
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,693
Let me put it this way.
Come into my office, Claudia.

443
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:51,778
I see you're still taking notes.

444
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,013
I have a feeling I'll need them.

445
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,247
Need them for what, Claudia?

446
00:28:57,952 --> 00:29:01,718
Some guys are trying to put me away.

447
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,849
When you say "some guys,"
who do you mean exactly?

448
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:10,925
You mean, men in general,
or do you have some specific men in mind?

449
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:15,428
- Claudia.
- What do you want?

450
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,136
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.

451
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:22,307
Last time I talked to you,
you and Pancho Villa asked me...

452
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,641
...stupid questions
and called me incompetent.

453
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:28,045
- It would be better if you could trust me.
- Yeah? Why?

454
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,717
Because you have so many degrees
on your wall?

455
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:36,652
Do you think I'm one of the guys
trying to put you away?

456
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:40,558
They don't pay you to turn me loose.
Do you guys work on commission?

457
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,132
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Only if it has Thorazine in it.

458
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,294
- Sorry, only milk and sugar.
- Pass.

459
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:55,670
I heard you had quite a violent episode
in court yesterday.

460
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,741
Where does it say I have to be nice
to get a fair trial?

461
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,351
- You couldn't seem to control your anger.
- No, I couldn't.

462
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,884
And based on the circumstances,
how did you expect me to act? Dead?

463
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:11,354
- You're getting angry again.
- I've got a lot to be angry about.

464
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:18,131
We all have these feelings, Claudia,
but we learn to control them.

465
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,225
Well, don't you ever lose control, Herbie?

466
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:25,104
Don't you ever let yourself go?

467
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,038
You're a very frightened girl.

468
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,045
And under stress,
you could become dangerous to others.

469
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,171
Bullshit.

470
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,214
That's what I plan to say in court
on Monday.

471
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:39,986
You need treatment
in order to be able to control yourself.

472
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,355
I'm in control.

473
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,124
Because right now,
I'd like to wring your fucking neck...

474
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,653
...but I'm not going to.

475
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,796
Good. That's a step in the right direction.

476
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,629
I'd like to help you
put your life back in order.

477
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:59,607
But, Herbie, there is no order in life.

478
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:04,740
Now, maybe you need order.
Maybe that's why you're here...

479
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,542
...behind bars.

480
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,482
It makes you feel safe, doesn't it?

481
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:12,845
- Do you think this is productive?
- I know you.

482
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,989
You see,
I know you better than you know me.

483
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:21,119
Do you know why?
'Cause I've seen you with your pants down.

484
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:24,123
You drop your pants
and talk about your troubles.

485
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,895
How you couldn't make it on Park Avenue,
not even Columbus.

486
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,428
So you're stuck...

487
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,274
...in the crummiest joint in town.

488
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,005
Right, Herbie?

489
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:29,488
This is 555-1246.

490
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,033
But I'm much more than a number.

491
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:35,461
Talk to me.

492
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:41,238
This is Mr. K. Back at the Tower Hotel,
room 671.

493
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:44,840
I have a tip
on some telecommunications stock...

494
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,539
...you might find interesting.

495
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,645
Come on over and we'll talk.

496
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:57,088
Mrs. Draper, your VCR is ready.
Give me a call when you want it delivered.

497
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:04,456
Hi, Claudia, I'm a friend of Lee.

498
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,364
Do you remember Lee?
The big guy, dark hair, glasses.

499
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:10,098
He's with Allied.

500
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,305
Anyway, he suggested
I give you a ring and...

501
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:17,172
Damn it, I hate to talk to these things.
I feel like an idiot.

502
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:23,473
My name is Allen. I'm at 555-9970.

503
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:27,750
Could you call me? I'd really like that.

504
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,789
Lee says I'd really like that, too.

505
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:34,189
It's 555-9970.

506
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:33,980
Hey, Levinsky. Are you ready for this?

507
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,040
A doctor who makes sense.
We have been talking for hours.

508
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,584
- Really?
- Really.

509
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,644
- May I join you?
- Please.

510
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,155
Dr. Johnson, this is my attorney,
Aaron Levinsky.

511
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,250
- Mr. Levinsky.
- Pleasure to meet you.

512
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:51,026
We're discussing the nature of paranoia,
a subject of interest around here.

513
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:55,057
Yeah, to put it in a nutshell, Levinsky,
this lady says I do not need a hospital.

514
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,195
I need a nice walk down Fifth Avenue.

515
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,603
You're saying that you don't agree
with Dr. Morrison's diagnosis?

516
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,405
I won't deny that Claudia could benefit
from therapy...

517
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,002
...but it could be conducted
on an outpatient basis.

518
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,081
Twice a week to start with,
leading to a group therapy situation...

519
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:13,143
...once a week.
- Is this terrific? Just what we needed.

520
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:14,347
Wait. Wait a minute.

521
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,188
Are you willing to have a doctor
testify on your behalf?

522
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,851
Well, this doctor, yes.

523
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:22,127
Doctor...

524
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:25,757
...are you prepared to testify
at Claudia's hearing on Monday morning?

525
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,792
- Monday?
- Monday.

526
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:30,731
What's today?

527
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,632
- Friday.
- Friday. Oh, my, Friday.

528
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,803
My. The weekend?

529
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:41,577
- Monday, you say.
- Monday.

530
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,278
Let me check my calendar.

531
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,010
Monday's the day I...

532
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,451
One of my secretaries
will be in touch with you.

533
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,458
Monday. What in God's name
am I supposed to do Monday?

534
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:14,678
Cheer up, Levinsky.
Don't want people thinking you're crazy.

535
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,142
You're very cute.

536
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,179
She is a doctor, you know.
A chiropractor, sort of, I think.

537
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:27,592
- What's that? For me?
- Lf you like mustard.

538
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,195
- Food? Honest-to-God food?
- Pastrami.

539
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,528
Pastrami? You're okay, Levinsky.

540
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,830
God, she looked so normal.

541
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,361
Poisoned her husband.

542
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,907
Oh, delicious!

543
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,407
- We're on Monday, 10:00 a.m.
- Okay.

544
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:46,810
I marked some places here
I want you to study.

545
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,542
Here and here. All right?

546
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:49,981
This is so good.

547
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,879
Why do you look nervous?

548
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:56,488
- I'd like more time.
- Relax. You'll do fine.

549
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,628
And I brought you some clothing
to wear at the hearing.

550
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:06,198
- You bought me clothes, darling?
- Brought you. Brought you.

551
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,902
- From where?
- From your apartment.

552
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,776
Who said you could go to my apartment?

553
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,111
What did you take?

554
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,614
Some clothing.

555
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,685
A dress. You know, some shoes,
some nice things.

556
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,879
I want you to wear your own clothing
at the hearing.

557
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,479
Why didn't you ask me?

558
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:34,719
Because there was no time.
Claudia, I'm just trying to help you.

559
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:40,392
What gives you the right to invade me?

560
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:45,230
Invade you?
I don't want you to look like a nut in court.

561
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,933
When is the last time
you went through your wife's dresser?

562
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:52,540
When is the last time
you searched in her panty drawer?

563
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,911
- It's no big deal. Calm down.
- It is a big deal!

564
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:58,247
Has anyone ever gone through your things
without permission?

565
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,614
I'm sorry.

566
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:03,956
I decide who sees my underwear.

567
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:09,721
I'm sorry.

568
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,082
I think you better get dressed now.

569
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:37,950
- Hey, I'd love to see you in these.
- Next week, my sweet.

570
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:44,697
I don't want to go home tonight.

571
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,001
You should have told me earlier.

572
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:52,672
Let's take
a nice sexy bubble bath together.

573
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,574
I can't, sweetheart.
I have another appointment.

574
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,042
I'm really sorry.

575
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,613
What are you going to do now?
Fuck somebody else?

576
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:06,482
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.

577
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:09,579
- Claudia? You okay?
- No, no. I'm coming. Just that...

578
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,022
Where's the bubble bath?

579
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:13,492
You got some bath salts
or that kind of thing?

580
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,960
That sounds great.

581
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,921
About a half-hour? All right. 'Bye.

582
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,440
Allen, come on. Turn off the water.
Please, be a good boy.

583
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,541
Don't give me that whore talk.

584
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,077
Look, we had a lot of fun...

585
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:37,779
...but the time's up and the party's over.

586
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:45,919
I'll tell you when the party is over.
I like to bathe girls.

587
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,953
I'm not a girl anymore.

588
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:51,554
And you're not a boy.

589
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:54,958
- I don't do baths. Please.
- You bitch!

590
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:59,294
You sound just like my wife.
"Don't do this. Don't do that."

591
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,533
Hey, stop it.

592
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:04,044
Stop it, you creep! I'm not your wife.
Calm down!

593
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:09,043
You goddamn cunt!

594
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,481
You're all alike! Whore!

595
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,721
No! Don't! No! No.

596
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:27,834
Don't!

597
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:37,268
Make sure there's always plenty of water
in the pitcher for the judge.

598
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:39,932
The defendant must be well-guarded
at all times.

599
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,149
You look wonderful.

600
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:52,782
You know what I use this dress for?

601
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,014
For the ones
who want to sit on Mommy's lap.

602
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,395
All rise, please.

603
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,524
- Good morning, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.

604
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,398
His Honor, Stanley Murdoch,
the Justice of the Court.

605
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:13,230
Will counsel please state
your appearances for the record?

606
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,836
Francis Xavier MacMillan
for the prosecution.

607
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:17,740
Does the missus pick out your ties?

608
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,945
Aaron Levinsky for the defense.

609
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:25,718
This hearing is set
to controvert the findings...

610
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:29,078
...of psychiatric examinations...

611
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,181
...in the matter of the People
of the State of New York...

612
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:35,251
...v. Claudia Faith Draper.

613
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,825
Is the defendant ready, Mr...

614
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,836
Levinsky, Your Honor.

615
00:43:43,904 --> 00:43:45,496
Yes, Your Honor...

616
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,275
...let the record show that counsel
for the defense has recommended...

617
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:52,244
...independent psychiatric examination
and testimony...

618
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:55,180
...and the defendant has refused it.

619
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,213
- Covering your ass?
- You bet.

620
00:43:57,985 --> 00:44:01,148
- So noted.
- I'll make a note of that, too.

621
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,154
Defense is ready.

622
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:07,354
- Prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
- Proceed, Mr. MacMillan.

623
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:11,897
Two psychiatrists found the defendant
incompetent to stand trial.

624
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:15,196
One is present to testify,
but since their findings are the same...

625
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:17,601
...I’d like a stipulation
for the absent witness.

626
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:20,401
- Objection! Both of them should be here.
- Overruled.

627
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:22,401
I call Dr. Herbert Morrison.

628
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,553
Give your full name and county of residence
for the record.

629
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,645
Dr. Herbert A. Morrison, New York.

630
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,891
Do you swear the testimony
you shall give in this special proceeding...

631
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,054
...shall be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

632
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,119
I do.

633
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:45,390
Mr. MacMillan.

634
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,696
How long have you been a psychiatrist?

635
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,293
I've been a licensed psychiatrist
for 30 years.

636
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,770
Where do you practice?

637
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,331
I am currently Ward Unit Chief
of New York County Prison Hospital.

638
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,239
When did you examine the defendant,
Claudia Draper?

639
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:02,076
Eight days ago, when she was transferred
from the Women's House of Detention.

640
00:45:02,149 --> 00:45:04,083
What did your examination consist of?

641
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:08,655
The examination consisted of questions
and answers in the usual psychiatric flow...

642
00:45:08,722 --> 00:45:11,657
...in order to determine
the patient's mental condition.

643
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:15,586
How would you define
the mental condition of the defendant?

644
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,521
Initially, she was withdrawn...

645
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:22,726
...silent, almost catatonic.
Completely uncooperative.

646
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:26,568
When she finally did speak,
she was abusive, hostile...

647
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,567
...deeply distrustful...

648
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,370
...with a tendency
towards inappropriate humor.

649
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,674
You just didn't like my jokes, Herbie.

650
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:38,178
Mrs. Draper, you are to remain quiet.

651
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:44,755
She was convinced of a conspiracy
and unable to comprehend...

652
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,986
...I was a physician who was there to help.

653
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:52,422
Do you believe the defendant can
consult rationally with her counsel...

654
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,559
...and assist in her defense?
- No, I don't believe so.

655
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:58,264
Does this mean
she can't understand the charge?

656
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,805
In this patient's case...

657
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:02,364
...she's so convinced
that the district attorney...

658
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:05,003
...her parents, and I
are conspiring to put her away...

659
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:08,104
...that I don't see
how she could distinguish...

660
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,117
...between a criminal charge
and persecution.

661
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,380
I can tell the difference.
This is persecution.

662
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:14,443
Mr. Levinsky?

663
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,682
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

664
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:17,815
Continue.

665
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:21,188
Do you think the defendant
is dangerous to herself and to others?

666
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:22,250
Yes, I do.

667
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:24,695
- Define dangerous.
- That's for cross-examination.

668
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,426
Ask him to define dangerous.

669
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:30,999
When a patient is paranoid,
and I found this patient to be paranoid...

670
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:33,437
- Ask him to define paranoid.
- Will you be quiet?

671
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,032
...and has her history,
then I consider such a person dangerous.

672
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,338
Define dangerous.

673
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:41,074
Mr. Levinsky, if these proceedings...

674
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,875
...are too much of a burden
for the defendant...

675
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,780
...I would be happy to entertain
a request for an adjournment.

676
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,055
It won't be necessary, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.

677
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:55,492
We allow a good deal of leeway
in these circumstances, Mr. Levinsky.

678
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,122
We're not nearly as formal here
as in other courts...

679
00:46:58,198 --> 00:47:01,133
...but I would remind you
that the rules of contempt apply.

680
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:02,728
Young lady?

681
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,363
Do you understand what I just said?

682
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:12,907
- I speak English. Of course, I understand.
- She understands perfectly, Your Honor.

683
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,608
Continue, Mr. MacMillan.

684
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:20,417
As a professional, would you like to see
the defendant receive treatment...

685
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,387
...before being brought to trial?

686
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:25,425
Absolutely. If she had appendicitis
or pneumonia...

687
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:30,388
...no court would expect her to go to trial.
They'd postpone until she recovered.

688
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:33,729
Do you believe, with a reasonable degree
of medical certainty...

689
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,929
...that Claudia Draper...

690
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:39,328
...as a result of mental disease or defect...

691
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,566
...lacks the capacity
to understand the charges against her...

692
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,304
...or to assist in her own defense?

693
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:50,180
In my professional opinion, the patient
can't understand the charges against her...

694
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,582
...nor can she assist in her own defense.

695
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,652
Thank you, no further questions,
Your Honor.

696
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,983
Mr. Levinsky?

697
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,492
Yes. Your Honor, if you don't mind,
I'm going to be going rather slowly.

698
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,429
I mind, Mr. Levinsky.
This is a hearing, not a trial.

699
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,861
Yes, sir.

700
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:10,192
Dr. Morrison...

701
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:14,105
...you describe the defendant
as abusive and hostile...

702
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,698
...and deeply distrustful.

703
00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:18,609
- Tending toward inappropriate humor.
- Thank you, thank you.

704
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,180
Did you describe her
as abusive and hostile?

705
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,442
Yes, I did.

706
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,118
Abusive and hostile.

707
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:28,551
To whom, Doctor?

708
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,783
- To the world in general.
- Yes, well...

709
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:34,619
...the world wasn't in one room with her.
You were.

710
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:38,995
- And after I, Dr. Arantes.
- The man couldn't speak English.

711
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:42,729
- Mr. Levinsky, control your client.
- The man doesn't speak English.

712
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,499
I asked two questions,
you've interrupted twice. Shut up!

713
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:48,700
- I never understood a word.
- You never understand a word I say.

714
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,504
Young lady? Young lady.

715
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:53,979
You've been warned.

716
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:01,613
Dr. Arantes speaks with an accent,
but he's fully qualified.

717
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,952
After all, Dr. Freud had an accent.

718
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,015
Thank you for volunteering that.

719
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:07,185
Tell me...

720
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:09,694
...you described the defendant
as dangerous.

721
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,755
- Is that right?
- In my professional opinion.

722
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,597
Did you ever see
the defendant hurt herself...

723
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,033
...or anybody else?

724
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:19,271
No, not personally.

725
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:23,105
Ever hear her threaten to hurt herself
or anybody else?

726
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,274
No.

727
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:28,504
Did anybody at New York
County Prison Hospital...

728
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:31,016
...ever see Claudia Draper hurt herself...

729
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:33,848
...or anybody else,
or threaten to hurt herself...

730
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:35,752
...or anybody else?

731
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:37,221
Well, let me see.

732
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:43,589
- Take your time, Doctor.
- Thank you.

733
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,399
Yes.

734
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:53,063
Three days after her arrival, she blackened
the eye of one of our other patients.

735
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,964
She made a pass at me.

736
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,209
The patient had to go to the infirmary.

737
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,145
Your Honor, may I have a moment?

738
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:03,872
Please.

739
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,053
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I forgot.

740
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:13,923
- I have to prove you're not dangerous.
- She grabbed my tit, I socked her.

741
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:16,121
If you had tits, you'd do the same thing.

742
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,254
I'm sorry.

743
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:18,658
Mr. Levinsky?

744
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,960
Are you prepared
to pursue a line of questioning?

745
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:24,264
I...

746
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:29,575
- I certainly hope so, Your Honor.
- I hope so, too. Continue.

747
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:37,543
Dr. Morrison,
before your examination of Mrs. Draper...

748
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,609
...were you aware
of why she had been arrested?

749
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,848
Yes. First-degree manslaughter.

750
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:45,619
It was more like womanslaughter,
but I finished first.

751
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:47,159
That's enough, Mrs. Draper.

752
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:52,061
Mr. Levinsky, you continue.
This time, stay on track.

753
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:55,762
Dr. Morrison...

754
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:58,700
...knowing that she had been arrested
for manslaughter...

755
00:50:58,772 --> 00:51:02,833
...were you in any way predisposed
to regard Mrs. Draper as dangerous?

756
00:51:05,178 --> 00:51:08,511
I considered that for a while,
but I held it in abeyance...

757
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,516
...and let the examination provide me
with a proper psychiatric profile.

758
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:16,453
You've been a psychiatrist for many years.

759
00:51:16,923 --> 00:51:18,185
That's correct.

760
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,262
You must have testified
at many competency hearings, right?

761
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:24,922
Hundreds.

762
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:28,896
Do you have a standard set of questions
that you ask these patients?

763
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,061
Yes, I do.

764
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:32,537
So I imagine
you've already asked Mrs. Draper...

765
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:34,938
...if she understood
the charges against her.

766
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,270
That's correct.

767
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,812
You asked her such questions as
what day of the week it was...

768
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:44,811
...and what her parents' names were.
- Yes, that's right.

769
00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:47,413
Did she know the answers
to these questions?

770
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:51,253
She refused to answer.
How could I know if she knew the answers?

771
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,485
Let me ask the questions, okay?
I'm the attorney.

772
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,787
Thank you.

773
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,861
She could have known the answers.
Yes or no?

774
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,833
Yes, she could have known the answers.

775
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:05,861
You say she didn't answer you.
What did she do?

776
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:07,933
She laughed.

777
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,868
She laughed?

778
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:14,475
- What else did she do?
- She never stopped taking notes.

779
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:18,541
She was entirely belligerent in her attitude.
She wouldn't answer me.

780
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:21,678
You're really not used to patients
who don't answer, are you?

781
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:26,089
I'm used to all kinds. What concerns me is
their attitude and behavior.

782
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:29,321
Could it be that the attitude
and behavior of this patient...

783
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,024
...challenged you,
and got you a little bit hostile...

784
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:34,658
...and perhaps colored the findings
in this report?

785
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:39,228
I've been a psychiatrist for 30 years.
I know how to control my emotions.

786
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,631
I did not show the patient
what I was feeling at the time.

787
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:45,507
So you felt hostile, you just didn't show it.

788
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,670
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

789
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:51,907
- I didn't. Don't put words in my mouth.
- I'm not putting words in your mouth.

790
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,283
I don't like your attitude, Mr. Levinsky!

791
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,652
Getting a little hostile, Doctor?

792
00:52:56,723 --> 00:52:59,214
You're very clever
with your courtroom tricks.

793
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:03,222
But what you're doing here
is depriving a sick girl of proper treatment.

794
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,493
I'm a doctor.
I want her to receive that treatment.

795
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,068
I don't care whether
you win this argument or not.

796
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,870
The girl has a history,
and you're ignoring it.

797
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,771
- A broken home, a broken marriage.
- Sounds like half of us.

798
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:16,468
- Disillusion.
- That's the other half.

799
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:19,410
Your Honor, could we eliminate
Mr. Levinsky's commentary...

800
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:21,140
...and let the doctor speak?

801
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:24,311
I agree. Go on, Doctor.

802
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,555
We're not talking about a defendant,
we're talking about a very troubled girl.

803
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,420
She's not a girl from the streets.

804
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:34,756
She's a bright, upper-class girl
who couldn't cope, broke down!

805
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:39,464
She's a girl with a history. Broke down!
She became a prostitute...

806
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:42,262
...and in a homicidal rage,
killed one of her customers.

807
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,963
I object. There's been no charge
of prostitution...

808
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:47,165
...and any charge of homicide
has to be tried.

809
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,333
We're talking about a breakdown.
When there's...

810
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:50,433
Are you gonna allow this?

811
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,499
My job's to put...

812
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:54,206
The witness is making a speech.
It's not a proper forum.

813
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:57,478
That can't be in a courtroom or prison.
It has to be in a hospital.

814
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,949
Your Honor, I object!

815
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:03,388
I would like everything about homicide
and prostitution stricken from the record.

816
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:07,819
Mr. Levinsky, I am aware of the law.

817
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:10,829
You're going to have to trust me
to separate the issues.

818
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,165
I'm going to allow it.

819
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:20,232
I have no more questions.

820
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,882
With Your Honor's permission,
I will save my redirect for later.

821
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:38,249
You may step down, Dr. Morrison.

822
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:42,322
Thank you.

823
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,556
I'd like to call Mrs. Arthur Kirk.

824
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:52,499
- I don't want her up there.
- We don't make out the invitation list.

825
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:54,472
I don't want to hear her!

826
00:54:56,476 --> 00:55:00,469
Your Honor,
I'd like to request a short recess.

827
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:04,682
- I want to consult with my client.
- That's an excellent idea, Mr. Levinsky.

828
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:08,520
We'll stand in recess for a few minutes.

829
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,814
Please remain seated until the judge
leaves the courtroom.

830
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,356
Go talk to her. Tell her you love her.

831
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:22,562
Come with me.

832
00:55:32,212 --> 00:55:32,803
Claudia?

833
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:40,109
Hello, darling. How are you?
You look thin.

834
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:45,976
Are they feeding you?

835
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:50,152
I can arrange to have food sent in.
Would you like that?

836
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,425
You look tired.

837
00:55:54,196 --> 00:55:57,165
Are we making you tired?
You can say so, darling.

838
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:00,730
Say something, please.

839
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,137
Can we go in there?

840
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:05,829
We can talk to her later.

841
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:08,375
We'll talk later, Claudia.
We love you, darling.

842
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:12,602
What?

843
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:16,174
- We love you.
- Don't you know that?

844
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,412
"We love you"?

845
00:56:19,054 --> 00:56:19,952
Yes!

846
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,753
"We love you." One more time.

847
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:30,865
"We... "

848
00:56:35,037 --> 00:56:36,061
Come on.

849
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,205
"We... "

850
00:56:41,643 --> 00:56:42,575
We...

851
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,612
"Love... "

852
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:47,907
Love...

853
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,140
"You."

854
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:51,908
You.

855
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:58,786
Outstanding.

856
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:01,695
Let's go, Levinsky.

857
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:21,871
- My wife and l...
- I don't want to hear about your wife.

858
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:28,188
I'm sorry. Talk about your wife.

859
00:57:29,858 --> 00:57:32,224
I was thinking about
how people withhold...

860
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,391
...in a family.

861
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,465
How many kids do you have?

862
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:45,935
Three. Two boys and a girl.

863
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:49,271
You going to get divorced?

864
00:57:51,446 --> 00:57:53,175
We talk about it sometimes.

865
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:56,210
Then we go to the movies.

866
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:01,013
Why didn't you want her to testify?

867
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,287
I just don't want her to testify.

868
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:07,089
Why? You wouldn't let me
get an independent shrink.

869
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:08,993
Officer?

870
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:10,755
Harry?

871
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:13,161
You can take me to my seat now.

872
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:14,766
No gum, Claudia.

873
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:31,909
And how soon after the divorce
did you marry Mr. Kirk?

874
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,355
Eleven months. Nearly a year.

875
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:39,353
- Did your daughter get along with Mr. Kirk?
- Fine. It was love at first sight for both.

876
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:46,896
Can you tell us when you first noticed
any changes in her behavior?

877
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:50,968
As early as the sixth grade.

878
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,306
She was around 11.

879
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:59,441
She'd always been active in school,
in sports and clubs and that sort of thing.

880
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:03,407
She was always a very happy child.

881
00:59:03,985 --> 00:59:05,953
Then all of a sudden she withdrew.

882
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:09,384
She seemed to live in a fantasy
most of the time.

883
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:12,692
You never knew how she would act,
is that it?

884
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,250
Never.

885
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:17,960
One day she'd talk a blue streak
of utter nonsense.

886
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,062
The next day, not a word. Later...

887
00:59:22,037 --> 00:59:25,871
...in high school, we had some problems...

888
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:29,366
...with marijuana,
and staying out all night and...

889
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:32,773
...there was a period of promiscuity.

890
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:36,913
Once, she was 16...

891
00:59:37,152 --> 00:59:40,280
...we found her
at the mirror in the bathroom.

892
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,049
She'd cut her hair an inch from her scalp.

893
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:47,487
When we approached her,
she brandished the scissors on us.

894
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:50,062
She turned the scissors on you
as if to attack you?

895
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:52,827
Objection.
The prosecution is leading the witness.

896
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:54,458
Sustained.

897
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:56,862
Did you get any professional counseling?

898
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,628
Arthur was against it.

899
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:00,800
He doesn't believe
in airing family problems.

900
01:00:00,876 --> 01:00:05,370
And I agreed with him.
We assumed it was part of adolescence.

901
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:08,840
Brandishing scissors on her parents,
a part of adolescence?

902
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,845
Do you have any idea
what caused her behavior?

903
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,628
I don't know. I don't know.

904
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:26,558
I know that I made mistakes.

905
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:32,238
Every mother makes mistakes,
and I'm sure that I made them sometimes.

906
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:37,539
But not enough times for her
to carry on the way she did.

907
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:41,912
Not enough times for her to drink and lie...

908
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:44,383
...and cut school and not talk to me...

909
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:50,117
...and not kiss me, not touch me.
Not enough times for that!

910
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:53,788
I don't know.

911
01:00:54,796 --> 01:00:55,990
I don't know.

912
01:00:56,998 --> 01:00:58,727
When she was a little girl...

913
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,162
...she loved me so much.

914
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:06,734
She used to say, "I love you
to the moon and down again.

915
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,805
"And around the world and back again."

916
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,604
And I would answer, "I love you...

917
01:01:14,649 --> 01:01:18,551
"...to the sun and down again.

918
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:23,120
"And around the stars and back again."

919
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:34,228
Do you remember, Claudia?

920
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:39,702
Just answer the questions, Mama.

921
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:44,608
Did she get in touch with you
when her marriage failed?

922
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:49,474
I found out from a friend.
So I called and said, "Is it true? "

923
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:51,446
And she said, "Yes, it's true."

924
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:53,678
There was a big silence. So I said:

925
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,948
"Stay with us until you feel better."

926
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,086
"No," she said. Just no.

927
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:04,826
I was frightened for her.
A divorced woman is a target.

928
01:02:06,735 --> 01:02:09,465
She's easy prey to any polite man
who comes along.

929
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:12,132
Were you able to keep in touch after that?

930
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:14,001
I called. I called.

931
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:17,277
But she never answered my messages.

932
01:02:17,746 --> 01:02:20,544
So instead of calling, I wrote.

933
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,950
These are the letters. I have them here.
You should see them. You see...

934
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:29,115
Your Honor, I never knew about this.

935
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:32,152
Your Honor, I hardly think this is proper.

936
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:33,123
Mrs. Kirk?

937
01:02:33,194 --> 01:02:37,324
Is this your handwriting?
Answer me! Is this your handwriting?

938
01:02:37,565 --> 01:02:38,691
Mrs. Kirk, please.

939
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,461
I have 31 letters in my hand!

940
01:02:41,836 --> 01:02:44,862
And every one is marked
"Return to Sender"!

941
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:46,530
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

942
01:02:51,279 --> 01:02:52,371
Poor Mama.

943
01:03:00,288 --> 01:03:01,380
Mrs. Kirk?

944
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:04,184
- Are you all right?
- Mrs. Kirk?

945
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,927
You could take a moment if you like.

946
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:09,355
I'm all right. I'm sorry.

947
01:03:12,233 --> 01:03:15,293
I know this is difficult for you.
If you just bear with me.

948
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:20,072
Your daughter has been
continuously withdrawing...

949
01:03:20,275 --> 01:03:22,709
...from you in the past 20 years,
is that right?

950
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:24,342
Yes, that's true.

951
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:27,541
Does your daughter need psychiatric help?

952
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:31,615
Objection. Is Mrs. Kirk a medical expert?

953
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:33,045
Sustained.

954
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:37,223
Rephrase. As a parent, solely as a parent...

955
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:41,125
...would you like to see your daughter
receive psychiatric treatment?

956
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:42,253
Hey, I'm a grown-up.

957
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:43,991
What difference does she make?

958
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,158
- Miss Draper?
- It's my life, Stanley.

959
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:47,531
You're trying my patience.

960
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:50,594
Why do you listen to all this crap?
Why don't you listen to me?

961
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:51,832
Sit down.

962
01:03:52,107 --> 01:03:54,507
You'll have a chance to testify later.

963
01:03:55,743 --> 01:03:57,108
Mrs. Kirk.

964
01:03:57,445 --> 01:03:58,503
I'm sorry.

965
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,304
What was the question?

966
01:04:03,818 --> 01:04:06,810
"As a parent, solely,
would you like to see your daughter...

967
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:09,220
"...receive psychiatric treatment? "

968
01:04:09,724 --> 01:04:10,986
She needs help.

969
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:14,895
It's a difficult thing for a mother
to say about her daughter.

970
01:04:15,096 --> 01:04:16,154
Yes.

971
01:04:17,398 --> 01:04:18,797
She needs help.

972
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:20,864
One last question, Mrs. Kirk.

973
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,730
Do you love your daughter?

974
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:25,169
Say it for the record, please.

975
01:04:30,178 --> 01:04:31,805
Yes.

976
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:34,345
I love my daughter.

977
01:04:38,786 --> 01:04:41,016
Thank you. I have no further questions.

978
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:45,254
- All true?
- Close enough. Let her go.

979
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,226
Mr. Levinsky. Do you have any questions?

980
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:50,822
Let her go, Levinsky.

981
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:54,793
Would you like to take a minute?

982
01:04:55,737 --> 01:04:56,965
No, thank you.

983
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:01,342
You stated that you
and the defendant's father...

984
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:13,046
You testified that
when Claudia was in high school...

985
01:05:17,258 --> 01:05:18,247
What?

986
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,459
You'll have to let me discredit the witness.

987
01:05:28,236 --> 01:05:29,703
Maybe you are crazy.

988
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:37,244
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

989
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,311
Mrs. Kirk, you may step down.

990
01:05:42,183 --> 01:05:44,344
I would like to call Mr. Arthur Kirk.

991
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:08,541
Do you solemnly swear that...

992
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:13,070
...your testimony shall be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

993
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:15,077
- I do.
- Be seated.

994
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:16,611
Mr. MacMillan?

995
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:20,585
How old was the defendant
when you married her mother?

996
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:22,454
Claudia was 5.

997
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:27,160
At that time, was there anything about her
that would have led you to believe...

998
01:06:27,262 --> 01:06:28,957
...that Claudia was troubled?

999
01:06:29,664 --> 01:06:33,498
She was frightened. They were both
frightened when I first met them.

1000
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:37,663
They'd been abandoned, you see,
by Claudia's natural father.

1001
01:06:38,006 --> 01:06:41,134
So you would describe her
as frightened, traumatized?

1002
01:06:41,442 --> 01:06:44,309
Objection. The prosecution is
putting words in his mouth.

1003
01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:46,377
Overruled. Continue, Mr. Kirk.

1004
01:06:46,614 --> 01:06:47,478
Yes, sir.

1005
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:50,309
She was always on guard, distrustful.

1006
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:54,619
I shouldn't say always.
There were periods when she was happy.

1007
01:06:55,757 --> 01:06:57,190
But they were short-lived.

1008
01:06:57,592 --> 01:06:58,923
Did you get along well?

1009
01:06:58,993 --> 01:07:00,426
We got along fine.

1010
01:07:01,129 --> 01:07:02,426
I was her champion.

1011
01:07:02,563 --> 01:07:03,791
What do you mean?

1012
01:07:04,198 --> 01:07:05,460
Well...

1013
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,896
...I forbade Rose to spank her.

1014
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:12,333
Children should never be spanked.
It breaks their spirit.

1015
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:18,144
- You tried to be a good father to her?
- Yes, I tried.

1016
01:07:19,113 --> 01:07:21,343
When I was courting her mother,
she said to me:

1017
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,350
"Art, what about Claudia Faith? "

1018
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:27,580
I didn't say, "Send her off to school,
get rid of her, send her away."

1019
01:07:27,755 --> 01:07:31,384
No, sir, I said,
"Rose, if you love her, I love her."

1020
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,520
When she woke up
in the middle of the night...

1021
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:37,860
...crying because of bad dreams,
I was the one who went to her.

1022
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:40,760
I didn't know much about children,
but I learned.

1023
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:44,303
And later, when she got a little older...

1024
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,104
...I even took her to the office with me.

1025
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:50,872
Given your years with her...

1026
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:53,679
...and the close relationship
that you shared...

1027
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:56,406
...would you say that you
understood her pretty well?

1028
01:07:56,484 --> 01:07:58,384
Objection. Leading the witness.

1029
01:07:59,854 --> 01:08:00,946
Overruled.

1030
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:05,290
I understood her pretty well, yes,
I think so.

1031
01:08:08,062 --> 01:08:10,292
She was a troubled, but lovely, child.

1032
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:14,031
A joy to be with, in spite of everything.

1033
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:18,429
Even though I don't have the opportunity
to see her now...

1034
01:08:19,741 --> 01:08:21,971
...I’m sure she's a very special woman.

1035
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,912
Were you surprised
when her marriage collapsed?

1036
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,069
No.

1037
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:30,576
All that surprised me was
that the marriage lasted that long.

1038
01:08:30,952 --> 01:08:33,113
I didn't know Peter until after the marriage.

1039
01:08:33,187 --> 01:08:34,586
I didn't know him well.

1040
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:37,282
- He's a remarkable young man.
- You hated him.

1041
01:08:37,392 --> 01:08:39,587
Mrs. Draper, don't start up again.

1042
01:08:39,727 --> 01:08:42,594
That didn't mean anything
when he swore to tell the truth?

1043
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:46,494
- He hated Peter's guts.
- You'll have an opportunity to speak later.

1044
01:08:47,702 --> 01:08:50,136
Speaking as a loving and devoted parent...

1045
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:53,273
...do you believe
your stepdaughter needs hospitalization?

1046
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:55,064
Yes.

1047
01:08:56,177 --> 01:08:57,576
I'm sorry to say I do.

1048
01:08:57,845 --> 01:08:58,834
Honey?

1049
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:01,877
Go away, Peter.

1050
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:04,251
Don't do this to me again.

1051
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:07,952
I don't want to hurt you.
I promise, I'll just hold you.

1052
01:09:08,256 --> 01:09:11,020
Claudia? I love you.

1053
01:09:12,126 --> 01:09:13,525
Come on, open the door.

1054
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:18,228
Mr. Kirk, did you hate Peter?

1055
01:09:18,566 --> 01:09:20,056
No, no, not at all.

1056
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:22,498
I may have had
the typical father's reaction.

1057
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:24,594
No man was good enough for my daughter.

1058
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:26,264
- I see.
- Forget him.

1059
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:30,673
You tied my hands pretty good.
Let me walk around a little bit, okay?

1060
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:35,007
Mr. Kirk, do you have any idea
why Claudia attacked...

1061
01:09:35,082 --> 01:09:37,209
...her former attorney, Clarence Middleton?

1062
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:39,185
Obviously, she didn't like his advice.

1063
01:09:39,253 --> 01:09:40,242
What was that advice?

1064
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:45,224
I recall he suggested a hospital would be
a better place for her than Ryker's Island.

1065
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:48,288
- Really?
- He felt it was the best way.

1066
01:09:48,863 --> 01:09:51,457
I see. "The best way."

1067
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:55,335
The best way.

1068
01:09:56,771 --> 01:10:01,470
When you and Mrs. Kirk
talked to Dr. Morrison...

1069
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:03,840
...when you chatted with him...

1070
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:06,343
...about the crime
Claudia had been charged with...

1071
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:08,644
...did he also indicate to you that...

1072
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,781
...he thought it was the best way?

1073
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:15,345
Mr. Levinsky, a trial is a public event.

1074
01:10:15,656 --> 01:10:18,523
If she were your daughter,
would you want her laughed at?

1075
01:10:18,793 --> 01:10:21,455
Hammered to a pulp by the attorneys
and the press?

1076
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:25,328
She's just a client to you.
Day after tomorrow, you're gone.

1077
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:27,892
But she's not just a client to me.

1078
01:10:28,336 --> 01:10:32,033
I'm not going to see her humiliated
in front of the whole world, no, sir.

1079
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:35,401
No, this is not a common criminal.

1080
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:38,708
My child is ill. She's sick.

1081
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,905
And I will do everything I possibly can
to see that she gets better.

1082
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:47,146
And that doesn't mean letting her sit here
in a public courtroom and be destroyed.

1083
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:02,628
When you and Mrs. Kirk
were first married...

1084
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:19,679
Strike that.

1085
01:11:21,923 --> 01:11:23,584
You're wasting your time.

1086
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,636
Mr. Kirk, it's very clear to me
that both you and your wife...

1087
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:39,536
...were very warm, loving parents.

1088
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:42,899
- Both of you loved Claudia...
- And we still do.

1089
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:45,574
That's right.

1090
01:11:45,846 --> 01:11:48,076
That's why I don't understand why...

1091
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:51,316
...Claudia could behave
the way you described.

1092
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:55,347
She was abandoned.
Her father walked out on her.

1093
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:57,485
She was frightened, unprotected.

1094
01:11:57,692 --> 01:11:59,717
You replaced him
with something substantial.

1095
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:02,262
Isn't that correct?
With love, affection and security.

1096
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,319
All of those.

1097
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:07,595
- Lf that's the case, it doesn't make sense.
- No, it certainly does not.

1098
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,570
Maybe you gave her too much.
Maybe you were too generous.

1099
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:20,512
I'm not ashamed to say I was generous.
I'm a generous man.

1100
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:24,415
Well, is it possible then that you,
you spoiled her?

1101
01:12:25,152 --> 01:12:27,620
Look, I loved her.

1102
01:12:28,656 --> 01:12:31,022
And when you love someone,
you give them things.

1103
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:33,649
Christmas, birthdays, graduation.

1104
01:12:34,595 --> 01:12:36,460
When she was young, I gave her presents.

1105
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,727
When she got older, I gave her
gift certificates, sometimes cash.

1106
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:41,926
- Cash?
- Yes.

1107
01:12:43,371 --> 01:12:47,102
Sorry. My mother always told me
it was wrong to give children money.

1108
01:12:47,942 --> 01:12:51,673
I'm afraid I disagree with your mother.
I'm a businessman.

1109
01:12:52,246 --> 01:12:54,476
To me, running a home is like
running a business.

1110
01:12:54,548 --> 01:12:58,040
You want someone to do something,
you give them an incentive to do it.

1111
01:12:58,552 --> 01:13:02,921
For instance, if she, let's say,
straightened out her room...

1112
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:04,524
...she got $1.

1113
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:08,220
If she came home from school
with a good report, she got $10.

1114
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:10,021
- Like a reward.
- Exactly.

1115
01:13:10,131 --> 01:13:12,326
Let them have money,
give them a responsibility.

1116
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,163
Let them make their own choices.

1117
01:13:14,368 --> 01:13:16,302
Now what did Claudia choose?

1118
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,598
Mr. Kirk, isn't it true
that what Claudia did...

1119
01:13:19,774 --> 01:13:22,299
...was withdraw from you and Mrs. Kirk?

1120
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:26,105
And from her husband Peter,
and from everyone else in her life.

1121
01:13:26,914 --> 01:13:29,712
God knows what's left
for her to withdraw from.

1122
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:43,261
Speak no evil.

1123
01:13:44,865 --> 01:13:46,662
Speak no evil.

1124
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:49,860
The people in your life have no mouths.
What can they talk about?

1125
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:52,201
- Come on, Claudia, help me out.
- Stop it.

1126
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,069
Mr. Levinsky?

1127
01:13:55,576 --> 01:13:57,476
Mr. Levinsky?

1128
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:03,041
- Have you finished with the witness?
- Not quite yet, Your Honor.

1129
01:14:04,251 --> 01:14:07,880
You can bang that goddamn glass
all you want. I'm questioning this witness.

1130
01:14:12,093 --> 01:14:15,585
Boy, you must be a saint.
You really must be.

1131
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:18,665
Only a saint could love
a frustrating woman like this.

1132
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,499
- Do you really love a woman like this?
- I've always loved her.

1133
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:25,095
How? How could you do that?

1134
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:29,065
This is a woman even a father could hate,
one you could beat with a belt.

1135
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:32,711
- Is this your idea of humor?
- This line of questioning is irrelevant.

1136
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,112
- I'll allow it.
- Did you ever lose your temper?

1137
01:14:35,182 --> 01:14:38,845
- Sometimes, yes, I lost my temper.
- You did?

1138
01:14:39,053 --> 01:14:41,749
- I even spanked her.
- You did spank her!

1139
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:45,087
I recall you told Mr. MacMillan
that you never spanked her.

1140
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:51,421
Once or twice, if you call a smack
on the fanny a spank. Then I did.

1141
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:54,361
And I probably did
a lot of other stupid things...

1142
01:14:54,535 --> 01:14:56,469
...but I was always there for her.

1143
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:59,368
I helped her with her homework,
dressed her, bathed her.

1144
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:02,032
I was the one
who gave her breakfast before school.

1145
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:05,135
She never drove you crazy?
Come on, Mr. Kirk.

1146
01:15:05,212 --> 01:15:08,181
I know you're the perfect father,
but you never lost control?

1147
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:09,238
Stop that.

1148
01:15:09,316 --> 01:15:13,116
- Didn't you ever want to beat her?
- Arthur would never hurt Claudia.

1149
01:15:13,254 --> 01:15:14,915
How would you know, Mama?

1150
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,521
Mrs. Kirk, sit down, please.

1151
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,665
Rose, sit down, darling, please.

1152
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:33,000
Mr. Levinsky?

1153
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:45,384
Mr. Levinsky?

1154
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:47,117
Mr. Levinsky.

1155
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:51,917
Excuse me.

1156
01:15:52,793 --> 01:15:54,226
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1157
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:57,319
Proceed.

1158
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:02,658
Mr. Kirk...

1159
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,304
...you said that among
the many fatherly duties...

1160
01:16:08,442 --> 01:16:12,208
...that you assumed
when Claudia entered your life was...

1161
01:16:13,848 --> 01:16:16,282
...bathing her.
Do you remember saying that?

1162
01:16:17,151 --> 01:16:19,142
- Please respond verbally.
- Yes, I did.

1163
01:16:19,286 --> 01:16:22,483
How long did you practice
this particular fatherly duty?

1164
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,514
Objection, Your Honor!

1165
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:27,691
Overruled. Answer the question, Mr. Kirk.

1166
01:16:30,531 --> 01:16:32,123
I don't remember.

1167
01:16:34,935 --> 01:16:36,800
Did it stop when she was 5?

1168
01:16:38,305 --> 01:16:40,432
Did it go on a year and stop
when she was 6?

1169
01:16:40,507 --> 01:16:41,599
What are you suggesting?

1170
01:16:41,675 --> 01:16:45,167
Did it stop in two years when she was 7?
I remind you you're under oath.

1171
01:16:45,512 --> 01:16:47,104
I don't know. Not long.

1172
01:16:47,448 --> 01:16:49,211
- She liked me to do it.
- Do what?

1173
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:51,080
- To bathe her.
- To bathe her?

1174
01:16:53,354 --> 01:16:54,548
To bathe her.

1175
01:16:55,456 --> 01:16:56,718
It was nothing!

1176
01:16:57,157 --> 01:16:58,818
I object to your insinuations!

1177
01:16:59,126 --> 01:17:01,890
My daughter locked me out
of the bathroom when she was 4.

1178
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:04,053
- How old was Claudia?
- Claudia, please.

1179
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:06,632
How old was she? 10? 12?

1180
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:08,299
How old were you?

1181
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:10,063
How old was she?

1182
01:17:10,337 --> 01:17:14,000
Was she 13 when you stopped bathing her?
Was she 14?

1183
01:17:14,108 --> 01:17:16,042
- She was a child...
- How old?

1184
01:17:18,712 --> 01:17:22,375
- He's harassing the witness.
- I'd like to hear an answer.

1185
01:17:22,449 --> 01:17:24,815
- How old?
- I don't remember.

1186
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:26,385
I was 16.

1187
01:17:48,642 --> 01:17:52,601
What else occurred in that bathroom
between you and your stepdaughter?

1188
01:17:55,015 --> 01:17:56,505
What occurred in her bedroom?

1189
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,983
Stop it! Stop it!

1190
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,653
It's not true, Rose, you know it's not true.

1191
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:04,987
Did you make her your lover?

1192
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,719
- I told you, it was nothing.
- How old was she, Mr. Kirk?

1193
01:18:07,795 --> 01:18:09,626
That's enough, Mr. Levinsky.

1194
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,990
When did it begin?

1195
01:18:11,065 --> 01:18:14,000
You little bastard! Look what you've done.

1196
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:16,400
Didn't you make
your stepdaughter your lover?

1197
01:18:16,837 --> 01:18:18,634
That's enough, Mr. Levinsky.

1198
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:20,366
Tell them it's a mistake.

1199
01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:22,073
I didn't do anything wrong.

1200
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:23,803
Calm yourself.

1201
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:25,635
Claudia, believe me, it's not true.

1202
01:18:25,713 --> 01:18:27,010
Mr. Kirk, sit down!

1203
01:18:27,348 --> 01:18:29,316
- Claudia?
- No, Daddy.

1204
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:31,441
- Claudia, please.
- You stop that!

1205
01:18:31,518 --> 01:18:33,008
Tell him it's not true.

1206
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:34,745
Mr. Kirk, control yourself.

1207
01:18:36,323 --> 01:18:38,086
Mr. Kirk, you're out of order.

1208
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:39,819
No, please. Don't let him touch me.

1209
01:18:39,893 --> 01:18:42,293
- She's not in her right mind.
- That's enough!

1210
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:44,627
I love you, baby.
Tell Daddy what you want.

1211
01:18:45,065 --> 01:18:49,058
I'll give it to you. Please!
I'm pleading with you!

1212
01:18:49,336 --> 01:18:52,601
Don't let him touch me.
Don't let him hurt me anymore.

1213
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:45,923
It's me.

1214
01:19:48,295 --> 01:19:49,284
Aaron.

1215
01:19:56,136 --> 01:19:57,103
Aaron?

1216
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:01,963
I'm sorry.

1217
01:20:05,245 --> 01:20:07,770
I got so wrapped up
in being a goddamn lawyer.

1218
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,480
Did we lose?

1219
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,315
Not yet.

1220
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:21,826
Maybe they're right.

1221
01:20:26,366 --> 01:20:27,594
Maybe I am crazy.

1222
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:38,372
I didn't tell him to stop!

1223
01:20:40,047 --> 01:20:41,742
I didn't tell him to stop.

1224
01:20:44,017 --> 01:20:45,609
You were a little girl.

1225
01:20:47,855 --> 01:20:50,653
I wanted him to love me, that's all.

1226
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:53,985
Claudia, that's what everybody wants.

1227
01:20:55,696 --> 01:20:57,687
Oh, I'm afraid.

1228
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:00,889
I'm afraid, I can't go back.

1229
01:21:02,136 --> 01:21:03,967
I'll go crazy in there again.

1230
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:09,072
Don't be afraid.

1231
01:21:11,345 --> 01:21:12,505
You're sane.

1232
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:15,412
Do you hear me?

1233
01:21:24,324 --> 01:21:28,124
You got to go home on the subway.

1234
01:21:30,998 --> 01:21:31,930
What?

1235
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:36,396
You're supposed to be with the missus.

1236
01:21:41,441 --> 01:21:42,135
No.

1237
01:21:44,545 --> 01:21:46,911
No, I'm supposed to be right here.

1238
01:22:12,105 --> 01:22:13,231
Get up.

1239
01:22:14,374 --> 01:22:16,103
- What?
- Get up. We have to talk.

1240
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:17,608
I'm eating.

1241
01:22:18,579 --> 01:22:19,568
You finished.

1242
01:22:20,113 --> 01:22:22,479
- You got a problem?
- You drugged my client.

1243
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:26,215
After what you put her through,
I had to give her some sedation.

1244
01:22:26,453 --> 01:22:29,547
- I want her lucid. Not drugged.
- She'll be fine tomorrow.

1245
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,384
If she's a zombie tomorrow,
I'll sue your ass.

1246
01:22:33,093 --> 01:22:35,493
Don't threaten me,
you lawyer son of a bitch!

1247
01:22:38,365 --> 01:22:39,832
Bon appetit.

1248
01:22:55,749 --> 01:22:57,683
You don't have to do this today.

1249
01:22:58,418 --> 01:22:59,476
I'm okay.

1250
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:05,820
Mr. Levinsky, are you ready to proceed?

1251
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,652
Yes, I am.

1252
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:10,322
I call the defendant, Claudia Faith Draper.

1253
01:23:10,397 --> 01:23:14,834
Mrs. Draper, you may testify
from your seat, if you like.

1254
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:16,867
Why?

1255
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:19,631
I thought you might be more comfortable.

1256
01:23:22,175 --> 01:23:24,302
I'd rather go on the stand.

1257
01:23:24,478 --> 01:23:27,914
I have no objection to your being
sworn in right there.

1258
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:30,279
I'm not an invalid, I'm a witness, right?

1259
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:32,716
Witnesses go in the box.
So, if you don't mind...

1260
01:23:32,786 --> 01:23:34,720
- As you like.
- Thank you.

1261
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,623
I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax.

1262
01:23:45,465 --> 01:23:47,660
Left hand on the Bible, raise your right.

1263
01:23:48,135 --> 01:23:52,128
Do you swear the testimony you shall give
shall be the truth...

1264
01:23:52,205 --> 01:23:54,173
...the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1265
01:23:54,241 --> 01:23:56,607
- I certainly do.
- Please be seated.

1266
01:24:03,016 --> 01:24:04,074
Are you okay?

1267
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:09,381
Mrs. Draper...

1268
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:14,487
You understand
the charge made against you?

1269
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:19,330
- The manslaughter charge, right?
- Yes.

1270
01:24:20,267 --> 01:24:21,734
Could you define it for me?

1271
01:24:26,073 --> 01:24:30,009
First-degree manslaughter
is a Class B felony...

1272
01:24:32,045 --> 01:24:33,171
...under...

1273
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:46,153
...2.5 point something
of the Penal Law Code?

1274
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:49,256
I forgot...

1275
01:24:49,396 --> 01:24:52,490
Have you been given any medication
in the last 24 hours?

1276
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:55,501
- Tranquilizers, sedatives?
- Yes, I told him I didn't need them.

1277
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,002
Objection, Your Honor.

1278
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,937
If he wants medical testimony,
he can question Dr. Morrison.

1279
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,098
Sustained.

1280
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:05,873
Tell me your understanding
of the legal concept...

1281
01:25:06,246 --> 01:25:07,907
...of justifiable force?

1282
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,855
That's when someone's beating
your brains out and...

1283
01:25:16,957 --> 01:25:18,788
...you can stop them any way you can.

1284
01:25:18,859 --> 01:25:19,985
Thank you.

1285
01:25:20,927 --> 01:25:24,385
Would you tell us your understanding...

1286
01:25:25,232 --> 01:25:28,224
...of the provisions of the 730 process?

1287
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:30,470
Yeah.

1288
01:25:32,806 --> 01:25:36,799
If I lose today,
they can commit me for a year.

1289
01:25:38,512 --> 01:25:43,074
Sixty days before the year is up,
the hospital can ask to retain me.

1290
01:25:45,285 --> 01:25:46,616
If I lose again...

1291
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:50,021
...I’m gone for another year.

1292
01:25:50,424 --> 01:25:54,724
From then on,
it's two-thirds of the maximum sentence...

1293
01:25:55,462 --> 01:25:57,089
...which comes out to be...

1294
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,764
...sixteen or 17 years without a trial.

1295
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,067
Your Honor...

1296
01:26:01,201 --> 01:26:04,762
Mr. MacMillan, you'll have ample time
to cross-exam. Let her finish.

1297
01:26:06,339 --> 01:26:07,431
Mrs. Draper...

1298
01:26:08,842 --> 01:26:11,106
...what does all that mean to you?

1299
01:26:11,545 --> 01:26:14,139
It means if they do it right,
they can lock me up...

1300
01:26:14,314 --> 01:26:16,339
...in a mental hospital forever.

1301
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,916
- The witness is exaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

1302
01:26:19,085 --> 01:26:22,452
There's a book on the table,
called Criminal Law of New York.

1303
01:26:23,356 --> 01:26:24,050
Look it up.

1304
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:27,116
The witness is extending
the practical limits of the statute.

1305
01:26:27,227 --> 01:26:29,161
I didn't write the book.

1306
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:32,961
The Honorable Eugene R. Canudo...

1307
01:26:33,099 --> 01:26:35,693
...Judge, New York City Criminal Court,
he wrote it.

1308
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:41,568
However it's executed, that is the statute,
as you should know.

1309
01:26:43,777 --> 01:26:45,301
Proceed, Mr. Levinsky.

1310
01:26:50,517 --> 01:26:53,384
Can you tell us the names of the doctors
who examined you?

1311
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,180
Yes, I can.

1312
01:26:56,022 --> 01:26:59,321
Julio Arantes and Herbert Morrison.
Herbert A. Morrison.

1313
01:26:59,693 --> 01:27:03,254
And how long was
Dr. Arantes' examination?

1314
01:27:04,364 --> 01:27:06,889
Fifteen, maybe 20 minutes.
He barely speaks English.

1315
01:27:07,133 --> 01:27:08,100
Objection.

1316
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:10,692
He doesn't.
His Spanish isn't so hot, either.

1317
01:27:12,305 --> 01:27:14,603
How long was Dr. Morrison's examination?

1318
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:19,071
Fifty, fifty-five minutes.
He knows more English.

1319
01:27:22,849 --> 01:27:25,875
Tell me, do you accept the findings
of these examinations...

1320
01:27:26,052 --> 01:27:27,917
...given to you at the hospital?

1321
01:27:27,988 --> 01:27:29,046
I do not.

1322
01:27:29,789 --> 01:27:32,724
Do you believe you are mentally prepared
to go to trial?

1323
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:34,118
Yes, I do.

1324
01:27:35,629 --> 01:27:36,721
Thank you.

1325
01:27:38,999 --> 01:27:40,557
I have no more questions.

1326
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:42,896
Mr. MacMillan?

1327
01:27:47,407 --> 01:27:50,137
- Claudia, if you're tired...
- I'm not tired.

1328
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:53,071
And I'd like you to call me Mrs. Draper.

1329
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,904
Very well.

1330
01:27:55,382 --> 01:27:57,111
When I get tired I'll let you know.

1331
01:27:57,183 --> 01:27:58,445
Mrs. Draper...

1332
01:27:58,552 --> 01:27:59,780
Are you tired?

1333
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:03,516
How long were you married?

1334
01:28:05,725 --> 01:28:07,886
Six weeks short of 10 years.

1335
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:10,156
Was this a happy marriage?

1336
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:11,662
It had its moments.

1337
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:14,131
- Do you have children from this marriage?
- No.

1338
01:28:14,334 --> 01:28:15,699
Was that by choice?

1339
01:28:16,236 --> 01:28:17,225
Yes.

1340
01:28:17,304 --> 01:28:18,498
Whose choice?

1341
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:20,428
We agreed.

1342
01:28:20,607 --> 01:28:22,040
You jointly agreed?

1343
01:28:23,176 --> 01:28:27,272
Yes. I told him if I got pregnant,
I'd leave him. So he agreed.

1344
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,172
- And you didn't get pregnant?
- No, I did.

1345
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,115
- You did get pregnant?
- Yes, I did.

1346
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:35,779
We came home late from a party one night
and we were a little drunk.

1347
01:28:35,956 --> 01:28:39,289
I put too much jelly
on my diaphragm and...

1348
01:28:40,627 --> 01:28:43,255
Did your husband leave you
when you got pregnant?

1349
01:28:45,765 --> 01:28:47,289
No, I had an abortion.

1350
01:28:47,867 --> 01:28:48,765
Why?

1351
01:28:51,938 --> 01:28:53,769
I don't believe in childhood.

1352
01:29:03,516 --> 01:29:05,211
Did you love your husband?

1353
01:29:07,387 --> 01:29:08,581
I don't know.

1354
01:29:10,323 --> 01:29:12,814
Where did you move
when your marriage collapsed?

1355
01:29:13,293 --> 01:29:14,760
I guess I loved him.

1356
01:29:15,629 --> 01:29:16,618
What?

1357
01:29:17,097 --> 01:29:18,530
Where did you move?

1358
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:20,998
501 East 66th Street.

1359
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:23,433
- You lived there at the time of your arrest?
- Yeah.

1360
01:29:23,503 --> 01:29:26,529
- What is the rent at that address?
- $2,400 a month.

1361
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,870
When you moved in,
what was your income?

1362
01:29:31,745 --> 01:29:35,647
Peter gave me $10,000 when I signed
the separation agreement.

1363
01:29:35,715 --> 01:29:37,342
Did you ask your parents for money?

1364
01:29:38,084 --> 01:29:38,880
No.

1365
01:29:38,952 --> 01:29:43,116
Could Mr. MacMillan tell us why he is
so fascinated with Mrs. Draper's finances?

1366
01:29:43,256 --> 01:29:45,486
Does he plan to sell her a car?

1367
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,884
Where are you heading?

1368
01:29:49,229 --> 01:29:52,721
My next group of questions will show,
Your Honor, if you'll indulge me.

1369
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:53,956
Proceed.

1370
01:29:54,701 --> 01:29:58,102
So you lived off the $10,000
your husband gave you?

1371
01:29:58,772 --> 01:30:01,366
No, I spent that on furniture
and kitchen stuff.

1372
01:30:02,442 --> 01:30:03,966
What did you live on?

1373
01:30:07,847 --> 01:30:09,678
- Gifts.
- Gifts.

1374
01:30:12,085 --> 01:30:13,677
Gifts from whom?

1375
01:30:15,855 --> 01:30:17,345
- Friends.
- Men friends?

1376
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:24,255
And what did these men friends give you?
Jewelry?

1377
01:30:25,598 --> 01:30:26,428
Sometimes.

1378
01:30:26,566 --> 01:30:27,498
Furs?

1379
01:30:29,302 --> 01:30:30,929
I got a fox boa once.

1380
01:30:32,305 --> 01:30:34,432
- Did they give you food?
- Food?

1381
01:30:35,642 --> 01:30:38,133
One guy used to bring caviar.
Is that what you mean?

1382
01:30:38,478 --> 01:30:41,914
Did you exchange your jewels and furs
for food at the market?

1383
01:30:42,082 --> 01:30:44,016
- Isn't that silly?
- Did you?

1384
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,014
No.

1385
01:30:45,452 --> 01:30:48,444
- I assume you didn't live on caviar.
- Hardly.

1386
01:30:48,755 --> 01:30:51,280
Did you use those gifts to pay your rent?

1387
01:30:54,627 --> 01:30:55,719
Excuse me.

1388
01:30:56,262 --> 01:30:58,162
Is it legal to take cash gifts?

1389
01:30:59,032 --> 01:31:00,431
I beg your pardon?

1390
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,437
I mean, if I say to you, "Stanley,
here's $500 just because I like you... "

1391
01:31:05,638 --> 01:31:06,866
...is that legal?

1392
01:31:07,974 --> 01:31:09,373
Yes, that's legal.

1393
01:31:09,509 --> 01:31:11,636
Thank you. A lot of the gifts were cash.

1394
01:31:11,845 --> 01:31:15,110
And these cash gifts were enough
to pay your expenses?

1395
01:31:17,016 --> 01:31:19,849
What did these men expect in exchange
for the cash gifts?

1396
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:23,852
- Is counsel leading up to...
- Your Honor, I haven't used the word "fee."

1397
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:25,914
I'll permit an answer.

1398
01:31:26,559 --> 01:31:30,586
What did these men friends expect
in return for these cash gifts?

1399
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:33,858
Friendship.

1400
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:37,735
"Friendship." What kind of friendship?

1401
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:39,999
Objection! The question is vague
and misleading.

1402
01:31:40,073 --> 01:31:41,165
Overruled.

1403
01:31:41,508 --> 01:31:45,467
These men that gave you cash gifts,
did they expect you to talk to them?

1404
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:48,076
- Did you listen to them?
- God, yes.

1405
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:50,274
- And you did them favors?
- Your Honor.

1406
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:53,214
You did them favors. What kind?

1407
01:31:53,353 --> 01:31:54,945
Objection on the same grounds.

1408
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:57,990
What kind of favors did you do
in exchange for these gifts?

1409
01:31:58,258 --> 01:32:00,988
What does it matter how Mrs. Draper
makes her living?

1410
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,654
What kind of favors?

1411
01:32:03,797 --> 01:32:06,288
Let's stop all the bullshit
and get to the point.

1412
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:09,360
You want to know what I do for a living?
Ask me.

1413
01:32:10,603 --> 01:32:14,039
My time is very expensive, Mr. MacMillan.
Probably more than yours.

1414
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:18,143
I get $500 an hour. How much do you get?

1415
01:32:19,078 --> 01:32:23,708
I get $400 for a straight lay,
$300 for a hand job and $500 for head.

1416
01:32:24,984 --> 01:32:27,509
If you wanna wear my panties,
that's another $100.

1417
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:30,847
You take them home, Mr. MacMillan,
that's another $100.

1418
01:32:31,224 --> 01:32:34,125
No whips, no ropes, no spikes.
I've got liquor and grass.

1419
01:32:34,194 --> 01:32:37,061
Anything else, you bring your own.
It works like this.

1420
01:32:39,165 --> 01:32:41,065
You call me up, we make a date.

1421
01:32:42,402 --> 01:32:45,803
I look you over. And if I like you...

1422
01:32:47,407 --> 01:32:48,772
...we make a deal.

1423
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,603
And, darling, I am worth the trouble.

1424
01:32:52,545 --> 01:32:55,036
Take my word for it, if you want the best.

1425
01:32:56,816 --> 01:32:58,909
Do you want the best, Mr. MacMillan?

1426
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,819
I am talking about
taking your body to heaven...

1427
01:33:04,924 --> 01:33:07,950
...and sending your mind south.

1428
01:33:08,695 --> 01:33:11,186
I'm talking about spoiling you so bad...

1429
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:14,229
...you'll hate every other woman you touch.

1430
01:33:16,269 --> 01:33:18,737
I'm talking about my mouth
on your mouth...

1431
01:33:19,239 --> 01:33:20,501
...and my tongue...

1432
01:33:22,141 --> 01:33:24,075
...anywhere you want it.

1433
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:29,747
I'm talking about indulging
your every fantasy...

1434
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:34,147
...and then giving you those fantasies
one by one.

1435
01:33:35,555 --> 01:33:39,457
Just for you. All for you. Nobody but you.

1436
01:33:42,962 --> 01:33:44,793
Do you get all that, darling?

1437
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,391
Would you like that, baby?

1438
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:51,660
Do you get what I'm telling you?

1439
01:33:54,307 --> 01:33:57,276
Do you all get what I'm telling you?

1440
01:34:08,821 --> 01:34:10,721
Now, could he bust me for that?

1441
01:34:13,192 --> 01:34:14,682
Can he...

1442
01:34:17,263 --> 01:34:18,890
No, he can't bust you.

1443
01:34:19,465 --> 01:34:20,397
Good.

1444
01:34:25,638 --> 01:34:29,335
- That's very enlightening.
- I thought you'd like it.

1445
01:34:30,843 --> 01:34:34,472
How long did you perform these favors?

1446
01:34:35,281 --> 01:34:37,215
35 months, 24 days.

1447
01:34:38,851 --> 01:34:40,842
Why did you perform these favors?

1448
01:34:42,388 --> 01:34:44,049
For $100,000 a year, net.

1449
01:34:45,558 --> 01:34:47,685
Did you ever ask your parents for money?

1450
01:34:49,329 --> 01:34:50,193
No.

1451
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:53,094
Do you believe they would have refused
to give it to you?

1452
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,225
No, they would have given it to me.

1453
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:58,527
But you preferred living a life
of exchanging favors for gifts.

1454
01:34:58,972 --> 01:35:01,167
It hurts less to sell yourself to strangers.

1455
01:35:01,441 --> 01:35:06,378
If you were in the same position today,
would you make the same choice?

1456
01:35:06,612 --> 01:35:08,807
She's not in the same position today.

1457
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,849
I'd like an answer.

1458
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:13,743
I might.

1459
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,619
You would rather lead that life
than ask your parents for money?

1460
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:20,554
Probably, yeah.

1461
01:35:23,696 --> 01:35:26,164
Mrs. Draper, would you describe
your behavior...

1462
01:35:26,366 --> 01:35:28,459
...in the courtroom the past days as...

1463
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:29,733
...normal?

1464
01:35:29,869 --> 01:35:31,837
Would you consider
the circumstances normal?

1465
01:35:31,904 --> 01:35:35,203
It's my job to ask the questions,
your obligation is to answer.

1466
01:35:36,042 --> 01:35:38,135
Yesterday this hearing had to adjourn...

1467
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:40,805
...because you were no longer able
to participate.

1468
01:35:42,181 --> 01:35:44,672
The truth is, I didn't have a nifty childhood.

1469
01:35:45,618 --> 01:35:47,347
Poor me. Life sucks.

1470
01:35:51,424 --> 01:35:52,413
Yesterday...

1471
01:35:55,028 --> 01:35:58,691
...you all had a good time
watching me and my stepfather squirm.

1472
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:01,760
Okay, it's out. It's over.

1473
01:36:02,969 --> 01:36:04,436
It's a fact of life.

1474
01:36:05,238 --> 01:36:06,500
I'll handle it.

1475
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,838
The point is,
it's not relevant to what's going on here.

1476
01:36:15,314 --> 01:36:17,407
You don't trust me, do you?

1477
01:36:18,751 --> 01:36:21,549
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry, that's your question.

1478
01:36:21,754 --> 01:36:23,551
Have I done anything to harm you?

1479
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:26,254
I don't believe this.
You're trying to put me away.

1480
01:36:26,325 --> 01:36:29,089
You don't believe I'm simply doing my job?

1481
01:36:29,195 --> 01:36:32,596
Your job is to put me in a hospital.

1482
01:36:32,698 --> 01:36:35,064
Maybe I'm dumb,
but I take that personally!

1483
01:36:35,401 --> 01:36:39,394
But you believe Dr. Morrison
is acting out of a personal motive?

1484
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:40,469
No.

1485
01:36:41,908 --> 01:36:44,103
I'm sure he believes what he believes.

1486
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:48,577
He thinks whores are girls on 8th Avenue,
who stick needles in their arms.

1487
01:36:49,882 --> 01:36:53,113
Whores aren't nice white girls
from nice white homes.

1488
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,611
He knows that as sure
as he knows his wife is home...

1489
01:36:56,689 --> 01:36:59,089
...cleaning the oven.
Isn't that right, Herbie?

1490
01:37:00,927 --> 01:37:02,554
But what if he's wrong?

1491
01:37:03,529 --> 01:37:06,293
What if his wife is out balling
the insurance salesman?

1492
01:37:06,499 --> 01:37:08,694
What if he doesn't know his ass
from his elbow?

1493
01:37:08,768 --> 01:37:11,828
What if he is just an asshole
with the power to lock me up?

1494
01:37:12,138 --> 01:37:14,333
What if that's all he is?

1495
01:37:15,975 --> 01:37:17,499
An asshole with power.

1496
01:37:18,244 --> 01:37:20,678
Your Honor, forgive me for interrupting.

1497
01:37:20,847 --> 01:37:24,681
I believe the pressure of this proceeding
is doing serious harm to the patient.

1498
01:37:24,784 --> 01:37:26,581
She should be sent back to the hospital.

1499
01:37:26,652 --> 01:37:29,678
With due respect, Dr. Morrison,
I have a witness testifying...

1500
01:37:29,755 --> 01:37:32,781
...and I'd like to hear it without interruption.
Please sit down.

1501
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:34,724
For her sake, Your Honor, I insist...

1502
01:37:34,794 --> 01:37:36,887
I said, please, sit down.

1503
01:37:42,268 --> 01:37:43,860
Proceed, Mr. MacMillan.

1504
01:37:44,637 --> 01:37:47,367
Do you trust His Honor, the court?

1505
01:37:48,207 --> 01:37:49,731
More than I trust you.

1506
01:37:50,076 --> 01:37:51,771
Do you trust Mr. Levinsky?

1507
01:37:56,315 --> 01:37:58,078
As lawyers go, he's all right.

1508
01:37:58,317 --> 01:38:00,148
Do you trust your mother, Mrs. Kirk?

1509
01:38:00,219 --> 01:38:02,687
- My mother?
- Yes. Do you trust your mother?

1510
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:05,422
No.

1511
01:38:06,425 --> 01:38:09,553
Is there anyone in this courtroom
you do trust?

1512
01:38:17,737 --> 01:38:18,635
Him.

1513
01:38:20,373 --> 01:38:22,500
You're pointing at Officer Harrison?

1514
01:38:22,975 --> 01:38:26,103
Officer Harrison is the only person
in this room you trust?

1515
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:29,514
He can't hurt me. You can.

1516
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,414
The judge can, Morrison can. She can.

1517
01:38:34,353 --> 01:38:36,821
I don't trust people who can hurt me,
not anymore.

1518
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:40,486
You believe your mother
wants to hurt you?

1519
01:38:40,793 --> 01:38:44,559
- She doesn't want to, but...
- You don't believe she wants to help you?

1520
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:47,628
Sure she does. You all want to "help" me.

1521
01:38:48,234 --> 01:38:50,725
Except for Harry. Harry doesn't give a shit.

1522
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:53,168
You don't believe your mother loves you?

1523
01:38:53,739 --> 01:38:55,468
God, of course, she loves me.

1524
01:38:55,775 --> 01:38:58,938
She told you that. Didn't you hear her?
He wrote it down.

1525
01:38:59,412 --> 01:39:02,245
Now you stand up there asking,
"Do you love your daughter? "

1526
01:39:02,381 --> 01:39:04,975
And she says, "Yes, I love my daughter."

1527
01:39:05,184 --> 01:39:07,550
And you think
you've asked something real?

1528
01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:11,119
And she thinks she said something real?

1529
01:39:15,528 --> 01:39:17,928
You think because you toss
this word "love" around...

1530
01:39:17,997 --> 01:39:21,194
...like a Frisbee
we're all gonna get warm and runny?

1531
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:22,656
No.

1532
01:39:23,469 --> 01:39:25,994
Sometimes people love you so much...

1533
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,575
...their love is like a goddamn gun
that keeps firing straight into your head.

1534
01:39:30,776 --> 01:39:35,076
They love you so much
you go right into a hospital.

1535
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:38,440
Right, Mama?

1536
01:39:40,486 --> 01:39:41,612
I didn't know.

1537
01:39:43,656 --> 01:39:45,749
I didn't know.

1538
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,655
No, you didn't want to know.

1539
01:39:58,704 --> 01:40:01,172
Mrs. Draper, I'm a little confused.

1540
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,067
Do you love your mother?

1541
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:07,776
Sure, I love her.

1542
01:40:09,682 --> 01:40:10,671
So what?

1543
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:18,823
No further questions, Your Honor.

1544
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:25,287
Mrs. Draper.

1545
01:40:33,272 --> 01:40:35,172
Mrs. Draper. You may step down.

1546
01:40:39,512 --> 01:40:42,379
Your Honor,
I would like to recall Dr. Herbert Morrison.

1547
01:40:43,616 --> 01:40:46,107
You were fine. You told the truth.

1548
01:40:46,585 --> 01:40:49,713
- I don't think anybody heard me.
- I heard you.

1549
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:53,682
Doctor, I remind you,
you're still under oath.

1550
01:40:56,362 --> 01:40:59,525
In view of the defendant's testimony
and all that's happened...

1551
01:40:59,799 --> 01:41:02,393
...have you changed your opinion
as to her capacity?

1552
01:41:02,868 --> 01:41:04,130
Absolutely not.

1553
01:41:04,337 --> 01:41:06,066
Wait one goddamned minute.

1554
01:41:06,205 --> 01:41:07,103
Mrs. Draper?

1555
01:41:07,206 --> 01:41:11,267
Capacity? Why me? Why not him?
Did they examine him for his capacity?

1556
01:41:11,444 --> 01:41:13,071
Did they examine her?

1557
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,373
I know a judge who jerks off under his robe.
Was he tested?

1558
01:41:16,649 --> 01:41:18,412
You are no longer on the stand.

1559
01:41:18,484 --> 01:41:21,476
Then put me back on the goddamn stand
until I convince you!

1560
01:41:21,554 --> 01:41:23,317
Don't whip me with your rules.

1561
01:41:23,389 --> 01:41:25,516
While you're playing
with your goddamn rules...

1562
01:41:25,591 --> 01:41:27,684
...the meter is running out on my life.

1563
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,356
Let her go.

1564
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,962
Thank you.

1565
01:41:39,638 --> 01:41:42,198
Look, I know...

1566
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:47,842
I know I'm supposed to be a good little girl
for my mother and father.

1567
01:41:48,347 --> 01:41:50,474
An obedient wife to my husband.

1568
01:41:50,716 --> 01:41:53,776
Stick out my tongue for the doctor.
Lower my head for the judge.

1569
01:41:53,853 --> 01:41:55,320
I know all that.

1570
01:41:55,755 --> 01:41:57,950
I know what you expect me to do.

1571
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:02,817
But I'm not just...

1572
01:42:03,028 --> 01:42:04,825
...a picture in your heads.

1573
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:07,162
Do you understand?

1574
01:42:07,366 --> 01:42:11,393
I'm not just a daughter or a wife...

1575
01:42:11,604 --> 01:42:15,631
...or a hooker or a patient or a defendant.

1576
01:42:17,676 --> 01:42:19,109
Can't you get that?

1577
01:42:21,814 --> 01:42:23,042
You think...

1578
01:42:24,216 --> 01:42:26,844
...giving blow jobs for $500 is nuts.

1579
01:42:31,624 --> 01:42:33,353
Well, I know women who...

1580
01:42:33,759 --> 01:42:37,957
...marry men they despise
so they can drive a Mercedes...

1581
01:42:38,197 --> 01:42:40,222
...and spend summers in the Hamptons.

1582
01:42:41,133 --> 01:42:43,863
I know women who crawl through shit
for a fur coat.

1583
01:42:45,204 --> 01:42:48,662
I know women who peddle their daughters
to hang onto their husbands.

1584
01:42:48,941 --> 01:42:51,910
So don't judge my blow jobs.
They're sane.

1585
01:42:52,478 --> 01:42:54,946
I knew what I was doing
every goddamn minute.

1586
01:42:55,147 --> 01:42:56,876
And I'm responsible for it.

1587
01:42:58,117 --> 01:43:02,986
I lift my skirt, I'm responsible.
I go down on my knees, I am responsible.

1588
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:09,650
Now, if I play this part
you all seem to want me to play...

1589
01:43:09,728 --> 01:43:14,097
...if I play sick, I won't be responsible.

1590
01:43:14,533 --> 01:43:17,696
"Poor, sick Claudia. She needs our help."

1591
01:43:18,938 --> 01:43:21,168
I won't play that part, do you hear me?

1592
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:23,435
I won't give you that out.

1593
01:43:24,109 --> 01:43:27,670
I won't be another picture in your heads.
Claudia, the nut!

1594
01:43:30,883 --> 01:43:32,783
Do you get what I'm telling you?

1595
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,245
He can sign a piece of paper
saying I'm nuts...

1596
01:43:38,424 --> 01:43:40,449
...but it's only a piece of paper.

1597
01:43:41,026 --> 01:43:44,723
You can't make me nuts that way,
no matter how many times you sign it.

1598
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:48,531
No matter how much you say it,
you can't make me nuts!

1599
01:43:49,902 --> 01:43:51,426
Or you, Mama!

1600
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,037
Get it straight, all of you.

1601
01:43:58,644 --> 01:44:00,271
I won't be nuts for you.

1602
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:04,009
Did you get that?

1603
01:44:26,438 --> 01:44:28,668
Mr. MacMillan, you may proceed.

1604
01:44:30,209 --> 01:44:34,339
Dr. Morrison, do you still believe she lacks
the capacity to stand trial?

1605
01:44:36,015 --> 01:44:37,107
Yes, I do.

1606
01:44:41,353 --> 01:44:44,015
- No further questions.
- Mr. Levinsky?

1607
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,485
I have no more questions.

1608
01:44:50,362 --> 01:44:51,795
You may step down, Doctor.

1609
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,799
Do you rest, Mr. MacMillan?

1610
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:01,870
The People rest.

1611
01:45:02,074 --> 01:45:03,268
Mr. Levinsky?

1612
01:45:04,343 --> 01:45:05,435
Thank you.

1613
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:08,936
Your Honor...

1614
01:45:10,049 --> 01:45:14,247
...my client is a real pain in the ass.

1615
01:45:14,887 --> 01:45:15,979
Excuse me.

1616
01:45:16,755 --> 01:45:19,724
She is ill-mannered and irritating and she...

1617
01:45:20,993 --> 01:45:22,517
...disturbs the peace.

1618
01:45:25,898 --> 01:45:29,959
But we shouldn't confuse her behavior
with her capacity to stand trial.

1619
01:45:34,807 --> 01:45:35,865
The defense rests.

1620
01:45:35,941 --> 01:45:37,067
Mr. Levinsky.

1621
01:45:43,515 --> 01:45:46,279
I would consider adjourning this hearing
for 14 days...

1622
01:45:46,785 --> 01:45:50,846
...if the defendant would consent
to an independent psychiatric examination.

1623
01:45:55,294 --> 01:45:56,556
Absolutely not.

1624
01:45:56,929 --> 01:45:58,191
Absolutely not.

1625
01:46:01,467 --> 01:46:03,196
That's a mistake, Counsel.

1626
01:46:05,638 --> 01:46:08,368
But if that's the way she wants it...

1627
01:46:10,376 --> 01:46:13,743
I'm going to call a short recess
and collect my thoughts.

1628
01:46:15,447 --> 01:46:19,110
You'll have my decision in a few moments.
Please be seated.

1629
01:46:43,876 --> 01:46:44,968
Claudia.

1630
01:46:49,848 --> 01:46:51,782
I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mama.

1631
01:46:54,019 --> 01:46:55,884
I want you to win, sweetheart.

1632
01:46:57,523 --> 01:47:01,755
I want you to have whatever you want
for the rest of your life.

1633
01:47:05,164 --> 01:47:06,096
Mama?

1634
01:47:17,776 --> 01:47:18,606
I...

1635
01:47:25,451 --> 01:47:26,782
Can I touch you?

1636
01:47:27,152 --> 01:47:31,111
Forgive me. I'm so ashamed.

1637
01:47:34,393 --> 01:47:35,382
Oh, baby.

1638
01:47:35,561 --> 01:47:36,926
I still love you.

1639
01:47:38,464 --> 01:47:42,400
"To the moon and down again
and around the world and back again."

1640
01:47:55,047 --> 01:47:58,073
It's all right. Why don't you go sit down?

1641
01:47:59,318 --> 01:48:01,445
- Yes.
- It won't be long now.

1642
01:48:01,653 --> 01:48:03,245
Thank you, I will.

1643
01:48:04,556 --> 01:48:06,990
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1644
01:48:35,954 --> 01:48:38,650
Now, some people might call this larceny.

1645
01:48:38,924 --> 01:48:41,484
I would call it bad manners.

1646
01:48:43,128 --> 01:48:44,618
Consider it your fee.

1647
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:47,161
Would you like me to sign it?

1648
01:48:50,202 --> 01:48:51,635
What would you say?

1649
01:48:53,038 --> 01:48:56,496
Something that would get you
in big trouble if the missus found it.

1650
01:49:00,345 --> 01:49:01,471
The missus.

1651
01:49:03,182 --> 01:49:04,979
You're okay, Levinsky.

1652
01:49:05,651 --> 01:49:08,415
Even though you think
I'm a real pain in the ass.

1653
01:49:23,936 --> 01:49:27,667
The court is deeply concerned
that the defendant will not permit...

1654
01:49:28,006 --> 01:49:30,770
...an independent medical examination
on her behalf.

1655
01:49:30,943 --> 01:49:32,843
It's a critical flaw in her case.

1656
01:49:33,345 --> 01:49:38,078
Nor has her behavior in this courtroom
inspired the confidence of the Bench.

1657
01:49:39,985 --> 01:49:41,452
On the other hand...

1658
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:46,147
...the court is not satisfied that
the opinions expressed by Dr. Morrison...

1659
01:49:46,358 --> 01:49:47,985
...are completely persuasive.

1660
01:49:48,794 --> 01:49:52,787
I do agree with him that Mrs. Draper
does need some kind of help.

1661
01:49:52,865 --> 01:49:57,859
But that is not my role here.
My role is to determine...

1662
01:49:57,936 --> 01:50:01,394
...whether the defendant
is competent to stand trial.

1663
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:04,532
...and that depends on
two factors only. One:

1664
01:50:04,943 --> 01:50:07,275
Can she understand
the charge against her?

1665
01:50:08,013 --> 01:50:10,243
Two: Can she assist in her own defense?

1666
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:15,982
From what I have witnessed in
this courtroom these past two days...

1667
01:50:17,456 --> 01:50:19,754
...the answer to both those questions...

1668
01:50:21,793 --> 01:50:22,919
...is yes.

1669
01:50:24,663 --> 01:50:27,723
I therefore find the defendant
competent to stand trial...

1670
01:50:27,866 --> 01:50:32,098
...release her on her own recognizance
to await trial on the felony charge...

1671
01:50:33,138 --> 01:50:35,436
...of manslaughter in the first degree...

1672
01:50:35,641 --> 01:50:40,669
...which trial shall take place
one month from today. Court dismissed.

1673
01:50:40,946 --> 01:50:42,971
Your Honor,
the defendant has been charged...

1674
01:50:43,048 --> 01:50:44,913
...with a particularly cold-blooded crime.

1675
01:50:44,983 --> 01:50:48,942
- The People request a high bail.
- You've heard my decision, Mr. MacMillan.

1676
01:50:49,154 --> 01:50:51,384
- Court dismissed.
- Thank you, Stanley!

1677
01:50:55,861 --> 01:50:58,159
- Congratulations.
- See you in court, Levinsky.

1678
01:50:58,297 --> 01:51:00,731
- You did okay by yourself today.
- I did, didn't I?

1679
01:51:00,799 --> 01:51:02,994
- Maybe I'll change professions.
- Where you going?

1680
01:51:03,068 --> 01:51:04,057
Out!

1681
