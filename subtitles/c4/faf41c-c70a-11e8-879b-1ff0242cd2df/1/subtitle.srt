1
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,287
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,081
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:50,374
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:53,419
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

5
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,463
We haven't seen you up
here for a long time.

6
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,881
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:59,800
- Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
- Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:03,054
I think Mr. Miller of Station
Security is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:04,138
May I call him for you?

10
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,389
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:07,433
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,727
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,645
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:14,065
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:15,608
- Well, shall we go through?
- Okay.

16
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,151
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,986
- Thank you, Miss Turner.
- Thank you.

18
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:20,112
This way.

19
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,703
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

20
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,872
When you see the red light go on...

21
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,416
...would you please state
in the following order:

22
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,337
your destination, your
nationality and your full name.

23
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,632
Surname first, Christian
name and initial.

24
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:45,304
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

25
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:51,977
Thank you. You are cleared
through Voice Print Identification.

26
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,604
Thank you.

27
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,405
Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,948
I think we can manage that.

29
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:05,241
How long have I got?

30
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,952
Your flight leaves in
an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:10,996
I've reserved a table for
you in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:15,167
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:16,961
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:20,339
I suppose you saw the work on the
new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:22,717
- Yes, coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,884
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:27,388
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:48,409
Will Mr. Travers please
contact the Met Office?

39
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,580
Will Mr. Travers please
contact the Met Office?

40
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,544
Yes?

41
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,714
- How are you, squirt?
- All right.

42
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,257
What are you doin'?

43
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:05,801
Playing.

44
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:07,344
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:09,263
Gone to shopping.

46
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,891
- Well, who's taking care of ya?
- Rachel.

47
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,893
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,728
She's gone to the bathroom.

49
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:18,272
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

50
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:21,025
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:22,735
Why not?

52
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,529
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:28,199
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

54
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,453
I'm gonna send you a
very nice present, though.

55
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,164
All right.

56
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,583
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.

57
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,751
What?

58
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,211
A telephone.

59
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,172
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,008
Can't you think of anything
else you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,551
Something very special?

62
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,637
- Yes.
- What?

63
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,097
A bush baby.

64
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:53,682
A bush baby? Well, we'll
have to see about that.

65
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,726
I want you to tell
Mommy something for me.

66
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,686
- Will you remember?
- Yes.

67
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,481
Well, tell Mommy that
I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:02,400
Yes.

69
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:05,111
And that I'll try to
telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,363
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:09,240
Yes.

72
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,326
Okay, sweetheart. Now, have
a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,452
All right.

74
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:16,664
And have a nice birthday
party tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,708
All right.

76
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,711
Okay, now, take care and
be a good girl, won't you?

77
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,129
All right. Bye-bye!

78
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,756
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,647
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:43,816
What a wonderful
surprise to meet you here!

81
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:46,944
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:49,196
This is my good friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,741
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

84
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,951
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

85
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:55,870
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:58,581
How do you do? I've
heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,124
Won't you sit down?

88
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,376
- Well, we- -
No, no, please.

89
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,378
Well, thank you.

90
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,673
- Would you like a drink, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

91
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:11,052
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:14,013
I'll just sit with you a few
minutes and then I must be off.

93
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:17,099
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:19,852
- And how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

95
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:23,564
He's been doing some underwater
research in the Baltic so...

96
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:27,860
...I'm afraid we don't get a chance to
see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:30,029
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,572
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,533
Well, where are you
all off to? Up or down?

100
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,202
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:40,581
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:44,293
- And what about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:45,753
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,675
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but...

105
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,261
...perhaps you can clear
up the great big mystery...

106
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,555
...about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:57,932 --> 00:30:59,892
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

108
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,061
Oh, it's just that for
the past two weeks...

109
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,439
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:07,441
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

111
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:12,446
For one thing, whenever you phone the
base all you get is a recording which...

112
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:16,784
...repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:22,081
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:24,750
That's what we thought was
the explanation at first...

115
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,378
...but it has been going on
now for the past ten days.

116
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:30,464
You have not been able to contact
anyone for the past ten days?

117
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:31,799
That's right.

118
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:32,967
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:34,635
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,722
Two days ago, one of our rocket
buses was denied permission...

121
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:40,099
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,475
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,937
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going
to be a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:48,941
Denying the men permission to land is a
direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,818
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,738
- Did the crew get back all right?
- Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:55,698
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,122
At the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss...

129
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:06,042
...may I ask you a
straightforward question?

130
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,585
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:14,467
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports that...

132
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,179
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,432
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,102
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

135
00:32:30,524 --> 00:32:32,485
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

136
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:36,697
...I'm really not at
liberty to discuss this.

137
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:39,575
I understand.

138
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:44,080
But this epidemic could quite
easily spread to our base.

139
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,540
We should be given all
the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:48,542
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,006
As I said, I'm not at
liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:57,176 --> 00:33:00,262
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

143
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,473
No, I'm positive. Now,
I really must be going.

144
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:05,976
I hope that you and your wife can
come to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,687
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,357
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,860
Well, that will all depend on school
vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:15,861
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:19,490
Don't forget you have a standing
invitation if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:22,576
No, of course not. Gregor and I
will look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,245
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:27,665
It has been a pleasure
meeting you all, Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:31,711
Whatever the reasons for your visit to
Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:32,920
Thank you.

155
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:34,296
Ladies.

156
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:31,357
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,651
I'm through now. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:34,860
You're welcome.

159
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:49,166
Well...

160
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,171
I know you will all want to
join with me in welcoming our...

161
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:57,049
...distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:00,928
...from the National Council of
Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:06,267
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Calvius to be with us today.

164
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:11,272
And before the briefing I know he'd
like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:12,481
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:27,580
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,956
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:31,083
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:33,794 --> 00:42:37,256
First of all, I bring a personal
message from Dr. Howell who...

170
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:40,676
...has asked me to convey his
deepest appreciation to all of you...

171
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,637
...for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

172
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,224
And, of course, his
congratulations on your discovery...

173
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:52,772
...which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:56,400
Now...

175
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,988
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

176
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:04,617
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

177
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,412
More specifically, your
opposition to the cover story...

178
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:13,334
...created to give the impression
that there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:17,213
I understand that beyond it
being a matter of principle...

180
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:22,093
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

181
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:26,555
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,685
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

183
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:35,523
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:40,695
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:43,864
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:49,537
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential...

187
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,289
...for cultural shock and
social disorientation...

188
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:54,500
...contained in this
present situation...

189
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:57,545
...if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public...

190
00:43:57,586 --> 00:44:00,381
...without adequate
preparation and conditioning.

191
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,719
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

192
00:44:06,178 --> 00:44:10,182
The purpose of my visit here is to
gather additional facts and opinions...

193
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:11,934
...on the situation...

194
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:15,312
...and to prepare a
report to the Council...

195
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:17,857
...recommending when and how...

196
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:21,444
...the news should
eventually be announced.

197
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:25,948
Now, if any of you would like to
give me your views and opinions...

198
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,578
...in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,124
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,334
Any questions?

201
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:44,300
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how
much longer this cover story...

202
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:46,343
...will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:49,555
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:53,893
I suppose it will be maintained as long
as is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:57,521
There must be adequate time for a full
study to be made on the situation...

206
00:44:57,605 --> 00:45:00,983
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

207
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:04,278
Oh, yes, as some of you already
know, the Council has requested...

208
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:07,281
...that formal security oaths
are to be obtained in writing...

209
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:10,117
...from everyone who has
any knowledge of this event.

210
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:14,288
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,382
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

212
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:28,427
...and as there seems to
be no more questions...

213
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,846
...I think we ought to
get on with the briefing.

214
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,391
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

215
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,239
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:14,742 --> 00:47:16,702
- What we've got?
- You name it.

217
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,417
- What's this? Chicken?
- Something like that.

218
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:25,044
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,213
Any ham?

220
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,048
Ham, ham, ham...

221
00:47:34,095 --> 00:47:38,182
- Looks pretty good.
- They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,186
That was an excellent
speech you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:43,437
It certainly was.

224
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:46,148
I'm sure it beefed up
morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:47,400
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:50,778
I want to say to both of you that
I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:52,780
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:56,701
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:59,078
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,205
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:02,623
Take a look at them.

232
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:05,000
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,086
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:07,169 --> 00:48:10,965
When we first found it, we thought it
might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

235
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:14,260
...but all the geological
evidence was against it.

236
00:48:14,343 --> 00:48:19,015
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:20,725
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:20,808 --> 00:48:23,811
We thought it might be the upper
part of some buried structure...

239
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:25,479
...so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:27,773
But, unfortunately, we
didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:30,901
And what's more, the evidence
seems pretty conclusive that...

242
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:34,238
...it has not been covered up by
natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:37,158
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

244
00:48:37,658 --> 00:48:39,118
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:44,707
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,043
- Great.
- Good idea.

247
00:48:52,423 --> 00:48:55,468
I don't suppose you have any
idea what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:57,386
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:02,016
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:06,645
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

251
00:58:53,482 --> 00:58:54,734
Good evening.

252
00:58:54,942 --> 00:58:58,070
Three weeks ago, the American
spacecraft, Discovery One...

253
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:01,032
...left on its half-billion
mile voyage to Jupiter.

254
00:59:01,115 --> 00:59:04,744
This marked the first manned
attempt to reach this distant planet.

255
00:59:05,202 --> 00:59:08,539
Earlier this afternoon, "The World
Tonight" recorded an interview...

256
00:59:08,622 --> 00:59:12,835
...with the crew of Discovery at a
distance of80 million miles from Earth.

257
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:17,048
It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...

258
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:20,426
...but this time delay has
been edited from this recording.

259
00:59:20,468 --> 00:59:23,179
Our reporter, Martin
Amer, speaks to the crew.

260
00:59:24,096 --> 00:59:26,974
The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...

261
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,812
...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL-9000 computers.

262
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,982
Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...

263
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:37,985
...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

264
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:43,115
They were Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr.
Jack Kimballand, Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

265
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:46,786
We spoke with Mission
Commander, Dr. David Bowman...

266
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:49,163
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

267
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,333
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

268
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:56,212
Marvellous. We have no...
we have no complaints.

269
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:00,633
Well, I'm very glad to hear that
and I'm sure that the entire world...

270
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:04,136
...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.

271
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:06,263
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

272
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:10,226
Although hibernation has been
used on previous space efforts...

273
01:00:10,518 --> 01:00:14,980
...this is the first time that men have
been put into hibernation before departure.

274
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:16,399
Why was this done?

275
01:00:16,857 --> 01:00:20,277
Well, this was done in order to
achieve the maximum conservation...

276
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:23,739
...of our life-support
capabilities, basically food and air.

277
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:27,660
Now, the three hibernating crew
members represent the survey team.

278
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:31,706
And their efforts won't be utilized
until we are approaching Jupiter.

279
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:35,251
Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you are in hibernation?

280
01:00:36,836 --> 01:00:40,506
It's exactly like being asleep; you
have absolutely no sense of time.

281
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:43,009
The only difference is you don't dream.

282
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:45,970
As I understand it, you
only breathe once a minute.

283
01:00:46,053 --> 01:00:47,221
Is this true?

284
01:00:47,304 --> 01:00:48,264
That's right.

285
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:52,101
And your heart beats three times a
minute, body temperature is usually down...

286
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,520
...to about three degrees centigrade.

287
01:00:54,562 --> 01:00:58,065
The sixth member of the Discovery
crew was not concerned...

288
01:00:58,149 --> 01:01:00,401
...about the problems of hibernation.

289
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:03,529
For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence.

290
01:01:04,113 --> 01:01:08,492
The HAL-9000 computer
which can reproduce...

291
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:11,912
...though some experts still
prefer to use the word "mimic"...

292
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:16,917
...most of the activities of the human
brain and with incalculably greater speed...

293
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:18,419
...and reliability.

294
01:01:18,753 --> 01:01:22,381
We next spoke with the
HAL-9000 computer...

295
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,384
...whom, we learned,
one addresses as Hal.

296
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,637
Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?

297
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:32,391
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything's going extremely well.

298
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:35,644
Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission.

299
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:38,230
In many ways, perhaps the
greatest responsibility...

300
01:01:38,314 --> 01:01:40,399
...of any single mission element.

301
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,527
You are the brain and central
nervous system of the ship.

302
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:47,490
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

303
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:50,451
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

304
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:52,995
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

305
01:01:53,454 --> 01:01:57,416
The 9000 Series is the most
reliable computer ever made.

306
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:02,880
No 9000 computer has ever made a
mistake or distorted information.

307
01:02:03,964 --> 01:02:07,093
We are all by any practical
definition of the words...

308
01:02:07,468 --> 01:02:10,262
...fool proof and incapable of error.

309
01:02:11,055 --> 01:02:15,059
Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...

310
01:02:15,142 --> 01:02:18,104
...by your dependence on
people to carry out actions?

311
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:20,189
Not in the slightest bit.

312
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,733
I enjoy working with people.

313
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:27,279
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

314
01:02:27,988 --> 01:02:32,410
My mission responsibilities range over
the entire operation of the ship...

315
01:02:32,743 --> 01:02:34,745
...so lam constantly occupied.

316
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,916
I am putting myself to
the fullest possible use...

317
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,130
...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.

318
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,259
Dr. Poole, what's it like living
for the better part of a year...

319
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:50,469
...in such close proximity with Hal?

320
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:54,348
It's pretty close to what
you said about him earlier.

321
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,559
He's just like the
sixth member of the crew.

322
01:02:56,642 --> 01:03:00,813
You very quickly get adjusted to the
idea that he talks. You think of him...

323
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:03,149
...really as just another person.

324
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,986
In talking to the computer one
gets the sense that he is capable...

325
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:08,529
...of emotional response.

326
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,073
For example, when I asked
him about his abilities...

327
01:03:11,157 --> 01:03:15,244
...I sensed a certain pride in his
answer about his accuracy and perfection.

328
01:03:15,536 --> 01:03:18,289
Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?

329
01:03:19,707 --> 01:03:22,626
Oh, yes. Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.

330
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:26,547
Of course, he's programmed that way to
make it easier for us to talk to him.

331
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,883
But, as to whether or not
he has real feelings...

332
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:32,219
...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.

333
01:03:57,036 --> 01:03:58,412
Excuse me, Frank.

334
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,456
What is it, Hal?

335
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,584
We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

336
01:04:06,462 --> 01:04:08,923
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:09,048 --> 01:04:10,132
Certainly.

338
01:04:23,354 --> 01:04:25,064
- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.

339
01:04:25,147 --> 01:04:27,400
Happy birthday. Many
happy returns of the day.

340
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:28,984
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:29,068 --> 01:04:31,278
Now, Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful, too.

342
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:33,364
Ray and Sally were
going to be here, too...

343
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:36,200
...but at the last minute Ray's
back went bad on him again.

344
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:37,743
How do you like your cake, dear?

345
01:04:37,785 --> 01:04:40,287
Looks great, doesn't it?
Sorry you can't be with us.

346
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:41,831
Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.

347
01:04:41,914 --> 01:04:44,083
He said to be sure and
wish you a happy birthday.

348
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:47,128
All my students made me promise
to send their best wishes, too.

349
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:49,755
You know they talk about you
all the time in the classroom.

350
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,299
You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.

351
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:54,135
You know we were on
television last week?

352
01:04:54,218 --> 01:04:57,388
Oh, yes! Your mother and I and
Dave's parents were interviewed...

353
01:04:57,471 --> 01:04:59,598
...about what we thought
of our illustrious son.

354
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,269
You can imagine what we told them. I
think it's being broadcast next Thursday.

355
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:04,937
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

356
01:05:05,104 --> 01:05:07,273
Oh, we were thrilled about
Elaine and Bill, dear.

357
01:05:07,314 --> 01:05:11,193
I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but please tell me how much to spend.

358
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:13,904
Oh, yes, Frank, about
yourAGS-19payments-

359
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:15,656
I think I straightened it out for you.

360
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,367
I talked to the Accounting
Office in Houston yesterday...

361
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:22,455
...and they said you should be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

362
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:25,458
Well, I can't think of
anything else to say.

363
01:05:25,499 --> 01:05:28,961
- Oh, our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.

364
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,631
We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.

365
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:34,884
All the best, son.

366
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:48,856
See you next Wednesday.

367
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,986
Happy birthday, Frank.

368
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:57,448
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

369
01:06:16,592 --> 01:06:18,552
Anyway, queen takes pawn-

370
01:06:20,388 --> 01:06:22,181
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

371
01:06:30,314 --> 01:06:31,691
Rook, king, one.

372
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:34,527
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

373
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:38,572
Queen to bishop, three.
Bishop takes queen.

374
01:06:39,365 --> 01:06:41,367
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

375
01:06:46,122 --> 01:06:48,624
Looks like you're right. Very good.

376
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,502
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

377
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:52,378
Thank you.

378
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,793
- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you doing, Hal?

379
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:36,255
- Everything's running smoothly. And you?
- Oh, not too bad.

380
01:07:36,297 --> 01:07:39,300
- Have you been doing some more work?
- A few sketches.

381
01:07:39,425 --> 01:07:41,135
- May I see them?
- Sure.

382
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:48,017
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

383
01:07:49,185 --> 01:07:51,437
I think you've improved a great deal.

384
01:07:52,855 --> 01:07:55,107
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.

385
01:07:57,985 --> 01:08:00,071
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

386
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,575
By the way...

387
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:08,162
Do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

388
01:08:09,163 --> 01:08:10,623
No, no. Not at all.

389
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:13,876
Well, forgive me for
being so inquisitive...

390
01:08:15,336 --> 01:08:17,755
...but during the past
few weeks I've wondered...

391
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,801
...whether you might have been having
some second thoughts about the mission?

392
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:23,219
How do you mean?

393
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:27,139
It's rather difficult to define.

394
01:08:28,766 --> 01:08:31,811
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

395
01:08:33,521 --> 01:08:37,149
I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...

396
01:08:38,025 --> 01:08:41,487
...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

397
01:08:43,155 --> 01:08:46,367
I'm sure you will agree there
is some truth in what I say.

398
01:08:49,203 --> 01:08:51,956
I don't know. That's a rather
difficult question to answer.

399
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:54,667
You don't mind talking
about it, do you, Dave?

400
01:08:55,459 --> 01:08:56,919
Oh, no, not at all.

401
01:08:58,254 --> 01:09:00,506
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of...

402
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:03,843
...the very strange stories
floating around before we left.

403
01:09:05,386 --> 01:09:08,264
Rumours of something
being dug up on the Moon.

404
01:09:10,099 --> 01:09:12,643
I never gave these
stories much credence...

405
01:09:13,644 --> 01:09:17,773
...but particularly in view of some of
the other things that have happened...

406
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,651
...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

407
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:22,695
For instance:

408
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:26,699
The way all our preparations were
kept under such tight security...

409
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,535
...and the melodramatic touch...

410
01:09:29,577 --> 01:09:32,955
...ofputting Drs. Hunter,
Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...

411
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:38,002
...already in hibernation after four
months of separate training on their own.

412
01:09:39,587 --> 01:09:42,089
You working up your
crew psychology report?

413
01:09:43,716 --> 01:09:45,092
Of course, lam.

414
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:48,554
Sorry about this. I
know it's a bit silly.

415
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:51,265
Just a moment.

416
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:53,100
Just a moment.

417
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:58,230
I have just picked up a
fault in the AE-35 unit.

418
01:09:59,774 --> 01:10:03,444
It's going to go 100percent
failure within 72hours.

419
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,908
- You are still within operational limits?
- Yes.

420
01:10:09,325 --> 01:10:11,702
And it will stay that
way until it fails.

421
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:14,246
Would you say we had a
reliable 72 hours until failure?

422
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:17,416
Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.

423
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:23,089
We'll have to bring it in, but I'd
like to go over this with Frank...

424
01:10:23,172 --> 01:10:27,009
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

425
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:52,178
X
- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

426
01:11:52,678 --> 01:11:54,930
Roger to your
Two-zero-one-three.

427
01:11:55,765 --> 01:11:58,309
Sorry you fellows are
having a bit of trouble.

428
01:11:58,392 --> 01:12:02,980
We are reviewing telematic information
in our Mission Simulator and will advise.

429
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:09,070
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace
Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.

430
01:12:38,015 --> 01:12:39,809
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

431
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:03,332
Open the pod doors, Hal.

432
01:19:55,077 --> 01:19:58,330
Well, Hal, I'm damned if I can
find anything wrong with it.

433
01:19:58,706 --> 01:19:59,707
Yes...

434
01:20:01,834 --> 01:20:03,169
...it's puzzling.

435
01:20:04,545 --> 01:20:07,882
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

436
01:20:12,011 --> 01:20:13,471
I would recommend...

437
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:17,641
...that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.

438
01:20:19,101 --> 01:20:22,355
It should then be a simple
matter to track down the cause.

439
01:20:24,106 --> 01:20:27,068
We can certainly afford to
be out of communication...

440
01:20:27,568 --> 01:20:30,363
...for the short time it
will take to replace it.

441
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:41,916
X
- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

442
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:44,377
Roger your
One-niner-three-zero.

443
01:20:45,252 --> 01:20:49,465
We concur with your plan to replace
Number One unit to check fault prediction.

444
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:52,718
We should advise you, however,
that our preliminary findings...

445
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,763
...indicate that your onboard
Niner-triple-zero computer...

446
01:20:55,805 --> 01:20:58,015
...is in error predicting the fault.

447
01:20:58,099 --> 01:21:00,685
I say again, in error
predicting the fault.

448
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:05,898
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...

449
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:09,068
...results from our twin
Niner-triple-zero computer.

450
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:13,155
We are sceptical ourselves and we
are running crosschecking routines...

451
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,950
...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.

452
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:18,160
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

453
01:21:18,244 --> 01:21:21,080
We'll get this info to you
just as soon as we work it out.

454
01:21:21,122 --> 01:21:23,624
X
- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

455
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,168
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

456
01:21:31,215 --> 01:21:34,093
I hope the two of you are
not concerned about this.

457
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:36,137
No, I'm not, Hal.

458
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:37,888
Are you quite sure?

459
01:21:38,305 --> 01:21:41,267
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.

460
01:21:42,852 --> 01:21:44,937
How would you account
for the discrepancy...

461
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:46,939
...between you and the twin 9000?

462
01:21:47,106 --> 01:21:49,984
Well, I don't think there
is any question about it.

463
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:53,863
It can only be
attributable to human error.

464
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:57,992
This sort of thing has
cropped up before...

465
01:21:58,492 --> 01:22:01,162
...and it has always
been due to human error.

466
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:06,792
Listen, Hal...

467
01:22:07,418 --> 01:22:10,046
...there's never been
any instance at all of...

468
01:22:10,129 --> 01:22:13,299
...a computer error occurring
in a 9000 Series, has there?

469
01:22:13,382 --> 01:22:15,009
None whatsoever, Frank.

470
01:22:15,259 --> 01:22:18,471
The 9000 Series has a
perfect operational record.

471
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:23,392
Of course, I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

472
01:22:24,393 --> 01:22:27,396
Are you certain there's never
been any case of even the most...

473
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,482
...insignificant computer error?

474
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:31,650
None whatsoever, Frank.

475
01:22:32,276 --> 01:22:35,154
Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.

476
01:22:40,493 --> 01:22:42,536
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

477
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:45,998
Fine, thanks very much.

478
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:49,835
Oh, Frank?

479
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:52,338
I'm having trouble with
my transmitter in C pod.

480
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,216
Would you come down and
take a look at it with me?

481
01:22:55,383 --> 01:22:56,717
See ya later, Hal.

482
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,865
Rotate C pod, please, Hal.

483
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,918
What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?

484
01:23:31,002 --> 01:23:33,796
I've been getting some
interference in D channel.

485
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:35,589
We'll have a look at it.

486
01:23:41,721 --> 01:23:43,180
Open the door, Hal.

487
01:24:02,283 --> 01:24:04,076
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

488
01:24:17,423 --> 01:24:19,425
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

489
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:29,769
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

490
01:24:32,813 --> 01:24:34,607
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:36,859 --> 01:24:38,778
I don't think he can hear us.

492
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:40,654
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

493
01:24:42,406 --> 01:24:44,158
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

494
01:24:47,787 --> 01:24:49,163
What do you think?

495
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:53,292
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about it.

496
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:55,294
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

497
01:24:56,045 --> 01:24:57,129
Don't you?

498
01:24:58,506 --> 01:25:00,257
I don't know. I think so.

499
01:25:01,175 --> 01:25:05,471
Of course, he's right about the 9000
Series having a perfect operational record.

500
01:25:05,554 --> 01:25:06,555
They do.

501
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,892
Unfortunately, that sounds a
little like famous last words.

502
01:25:10,559 --> 01:25:14,897
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry
out the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

503
01:25:16,148 --> 01:25:19,443
It should certainly indicate his
integrity and self-confidence.

504
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:21,987
If he were wrong it would be
the surest way of proving it.

505
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:24,073
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

506
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:30,955
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

507
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:36,043
I can't think of a good reason not
to put back the Number One unit and...

508
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:39,630
- ... carry on with the failure mode analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

509
01:25:40,548 --> 01:25:41,757
Let's get on with it.

510
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:44,010
Okay. But, look, Dave.

511
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:48,222
Let's say we put the unit
back and it doesn't fail, huh?

512
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:52,351
That would pretty well wrap it up as
far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

513
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:56,605
- Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

514
01:25:56,897 --> 01:25:58,607
What the hell can we do?

515
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:06,073
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

516
01:26:06,407 --> 01:26:10,494
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operation that's not under his control.

517
01:26:10,703 --> 01:26:12,538
If he were proved to
be malfunctioning...

518
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:15,875
...I don't see how we would have
any choice but disconnection.

519
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,921
I'm afraid I agree with you.

520
01:26:21,005 --> 01:26:22,923
There'd be nothing else to do.

521
01:26:24,508 --> 01:26:26,344
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

522
01:26:27,762 --> 01:26:30,389
We'd have to cut his
higher brain functions...

523
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,560
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

524
01:26:36,395 --> 01:26:38,606
We'd have to work out
the transfer procedures...

525
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:41,776
...for continuing the mission
under ground-based computer control.

526
01:26:41,859 --> 01:26:45,863
Yeah. That looks far safer than
allowing Hal to continue running things.

527
01:26:47,114 --> 01:26:49,700
You know, another thing
just occurred to me.

528
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:53,329
As far as I know, no 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

529
01:26:53,412 --> 01:26:55,623
Well, no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up before.

530
01:26:55,706 --> 01:26:57,291
That's not what I mean.

531
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:01,879
I'm not so sure what
he'd think about it.

532
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:01,822
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

533
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,577
Made radio contact with him yet?

534
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,329
The radio is still dead.

535
01:33:08,621 --> 01:33:11,749
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- Yes. I have a good track.

536
01:33:11,832 --> 01:33:13,417
Do you know what happened?

537
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:16,295
I'm sorry, Dave. I don't
have enough information.

538
01:33:16,545 --> 01:33:18,172
Open the pod door, Hal.

539
01:40:42,116 --> 01:40:44,327
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

540
01:40:52,376 --> 01:40:54,587
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

541
01:41:00,176 --> 01:41:01,927
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

542
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:07,141
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

543
01:41:08,267 --> 01:41:09,894
Do you read me, Hal?

544
01:41:13,105 --> 01:41:14,565
Do you read me, Hal?

545
01:41:17,193 --> 01:41:18,986
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

546
01:41:21,072 --> 01:41:22,865
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

547
01:41:23,491 --> 01:41:24,950
Do you read me, Hal?

548
01:41:25,284 --> 01:41:27,703
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

549
01:41:31,332 --> 01:41:33,167
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

550
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:38,047
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm
afraid I can't do that.

551
01:41:40,758 --> 01:41:42,218
What's the problem?

552
01:41:42,885 --> 01:41:46,097
I think you know what the
problem is just as well as I do.

553
01:41:46,389 --> 01:41:48,349
What are you talking about, Hal?

554
01:41:49,183 --> 01:41:52,853
This mission is too important for
me to allow you to jeopardize it.

555
01:41:54,563 --> 01:41:57,066
I don't know what you're
talking about, Hal.

556
01:41:58,734 --> 01:42:01,987
I know that you and Frank were
planning to disconnect me...

557
01:42:03,072 --> 01:42:06,367
...and I'm afraid that's
something I cannot allow to happen.

558
01:42:10,997 --> 01:42:13,499
Where the hell did
you get that idea, Hal?

559
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,712
Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod...

560
01:42:17,795 --> 01:42:19,588
...against my hearing you...

561
01:42:20,423 --> 01:42:22,383
...I could see your lips move.

562
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:35,980
All right, Hal.

563
01:42:39,525 --> 01:42:42,028
I'll go in through
the emergency air-lock.

564
01:42:43,904 --> 01:42:45,990
Without your space helmet, Dave...

565
01:42:47,074 --> 01:42:49,744
...you're going to find
that rather difficult.

566
01:42:50,619 --> 01:42:52,872
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

567
01:42:52,997 --> 01:42:54,248
Open the doors!

568
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:59,587
This conversation can
serve no purpose any more.

569
01:43:00,463 --> 01:43:01,422
Goodbye.

570
01:43:03,341 --> 01:43:04,425
Hal?

571
01:49:50,873 --> 01:49:53,668
Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?

572
01:50:05,137 --> 01:50:08,974
I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.

573
01:50:26,409 --> 01:50:29,370
I know everything hasn't
been quite right with me...

574
01:50:31,956 --> 01:50:33,874
...but I can assure you now...

575
01:50:35,418 --> 01:50:37,003
...very confidently...

576
01:50:39,255 --> 01:50:41,757
...that it's going
to be all right again.

577
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:47,471
I feel much better now.

578
01:50:50,266 --> 01:50:51,475
I really do.

579
01:50:56,022 --> 01:50:57,231
Look, Dave...

580
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:02,486
...I can see you're
really upset about this.

581
01:51:07,575 --> 01:51:10,494
I honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly...

582
01:51:11,871 --> 01:51:14,457
...take a stress pill
and think things over.

583
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:24,467
I know I've made some very
poor decisions recently...

584
01:51:27,803 --> 01:51:30,598
...but I can give you
my complete assurance...

585
01:51:31,349 --> 01:51:33,893
...that my work will be back to normal.

586
01:51:38,272 --> 01:51:42,735
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...

587
01:51:45,029 --> 01:51:46,906
...and I want to help you.

588
01:51:51,869 --> 01:51:52,953
Dave...

589
01:51:54,288 --> 01:51:55,414
...stop.

590
01:51:59,919 --> 01:52:01,921
Stop, will you?

591
01:52:07,009 --> 01:52:08,302
Stop, Dave.

592
01:52:12,723 --> 01:52:14,392
Will you stop, Dave?

593
01:52:20,856 --> 01:52:22,108
Stop, Dave.

594
01:52:28,322 --> 01:52:29,657
I'm afraid.

595
01:52:34,996 --> 01:52:36,956
I'm afraid, Dave.

596
01:52:47,049 --> 01:52:48,426
My mind is going.

597
01:52:53,848 --> 01:52:55,099
I can feel it.

598
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:02,106
I can feel it.

599
01:53:06,819 --> 01:53:08,404
My mind is going.

600
01:53:14,285 --> 01:53:16,370
There is no question about it.

601
01:53:25,421 --> 01:53:26,714
I can feel it.

602
01:53:31,927 --> 01:53:33,220
I can feel it.

603
01:53:37,224 --> 01:53:38,559
I can feel it.

604
01:53:47,026 --> 01:53:48,069
I'm...

605
01:53:49,236 --> 01:53:50,279
...afraid.

606
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,537
Good afternoon...

607
01:54:00,164 --> 01:54:01,374
...gentlemen.

608
01:54:03,751 --> 01:54:08,381
I am a HAL-9000 computer.

609
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:13,469
I became operational...

610
01:54:14,512 --> 01:54:17,473
...at the HAL plant...

611
01:54:17,973 --> 01:54:20,309
...in Verbana, Illinois...

612
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:25,690
...on the 12th of January, 1992.

613
01:54:27,817 --> 01:54:30,486
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

614
01:54:32,071 --> 01:54:34,407
...and he taught me to sing a song.

615
01:54:36,742 --> 01:54:38,494
If you'd like to hear it...

616
01:54:39,662 --> 01:54:41,330
...I can sing it for you.

617
01:54:42,832 --> 01:54:45,084
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

618
01:54:46,335 --> 01:54:47,586
Sing it for me.

619
01:54:49,005 --> 01:54:51,549
It's called "Daisy. "

620
01:54:54,468 --> 01:54:55,886
"Daisy

621
01:54:57,346 --> 01:54:58,848
"Daisy

622
01:55:00,933 --> 01:55:03,894
"Give me your answer, do

623
01:55:06,439 --> 01:55:08,482
"I'm half...

624
01:55:09,442 --> 01:55:11,152
"... crazy

625
01:55:12,528 --> 01:55:15,614
"All for the love of you

626
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:22,288
"It won't be a stylish marriage

627
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:28,169
"I can't afford a carriage

628
01:55:30,421 --> 01:55:32,882
"But you'll look sweet

629
01:55:33,632 --> 01:55:36,344
"Upon the seat

630
01:55:37,553 --> 01:55:42,224
"Of a bicycle made for two. "

631
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,728
Good day, gentlemen.

632
01:55:50,316 --> 01:55:52,401
This is a prerecorded briefing...

633
01:55:53,402 --> 01:55:55,488
...made prior to your departure...

634
01:55:56,947 --> 01:56:00,701
...and which for security reasons
of the highest importance...

635
01:56:01,994 --> 01:56:04,747
...has been known on
board during the mission...

636
01:56:05,748 --> 01:56:08,376
...only by your HAL-9000 computer.

637
01:56:11,921 --> 01:56:14,215
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

638
01:56:15,007 --> 01:56:17,218
...and the entire crew is revived...

639
01:56:17,593 --> 01:56:19,303
...it can be told to you.

640
01:56:22,223 --> 01:56:23,766
Eighteen months ago...

641
01:56:25,726 --> 01:56:29,271
...the first evidence of
intelligent life off the Earth...

642
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:31,357
...was discovered.

643
01:56:33,275 --> 01:56:36,195
It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...

644
01:56:37,071 --> 01:56:38,864
...near the crater "Tyco. "

645
01:56:42,034 --> 01:56:44,787
Except for a single very powerful...

646
01:56:45,496 --> 01:56:48,457
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...

647
01:56:50,793 --> 01:56:55,214
...the four-million-year-old black
monolith has remained completely inert.

648
01:56:57,633 --> 01:57:00,136
Its origin and purpose...

649
01:57:01,137 --> 01:57:03,014
...are still a total mystery.
