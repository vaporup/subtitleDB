1
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,423
This jade imperial seal was stolen
from Thief Ghost by Kung

2
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,001
to present to the city master

3
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,168
There is also a rumour amongst
the kung-fu world

4
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,103
that imperial agent Dragon 9
is searching for him

5
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,346
Good

6
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,518
Then I will make a gift of this seal
and return it to its owner

7
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,592
We only see our three dumb brothers
in Tianshan

8
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,259
It is boring us to death

9
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,320
The smell of snow just fallen
is really good

10
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,464
Oh really?

11
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,829
Oh, yes!

12
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,934
Smells quite good

13
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,605
That's enough. You won't be able
to smell of a man anyway

14
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,229
Big sister, who are you laughing at?

15
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,004
Among the four of us, you flirt the most

16
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,941
When you see young masters on the street

17
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,845
You just stare
without blinking your eyes

18
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,916
Who said it?

19
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,910
I just want to meet more friends

20
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:42,849
Don't be shy!

21
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,116
We are normal girls

22
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,090
It's just normal to want
to meet our Prince Charming

23
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,785
What's so funny?

24
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,791
That's right! Ziqing is most frank!

25
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,295
OK

26
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,092
My second sister, of all the masters,
who do you want to meet most?

27
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,506
Simon the Snow Blower

28
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,340
Simon the Snow Blower?

29
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,308
The one who kills and
spills no drop of blood

30
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,378
I heard he is very difficult to approach

31
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,042
No. I would say he is very dangerous

32
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,985
So I've heard too.
There are lots of legends about him

33
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:20,348
They say he is the god of swords,
a unification of man and sword

34
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:25,454
I am very curious and want to know
if he is really that dangerous

35
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,924
That's better, so he doesn't practice
the Book of the Sunflower

36
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,033
What does that mean?

37
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,834
You really don't know?

38
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,199
Do tell me quick

39
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,366
The Book of the Sunflower...

40
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,809
OK, I'll tell you alone

41
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,389
That's enough, you bitch,
don't talk nonsense

42
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,319
It's true!

43
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,285
Master!

44
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,457
Of the Seven Sons of Tianshan,
I've only brought the four of you down

45
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,431
My aim is to preserve justice
and arrest Thief Ghost

46
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,297
I have heard that
the biggest suspect is coming uphill

47
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,101
Who is this suspect?

48
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,376
Dragon 9

49
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,106
He has a dual status.
He is the Thief Ghost

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,538
Go get ready

51
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,006
Yes, Master!

52
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,981
I never thought...

53
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,588
...there'd be such a refined tea-house
in such wilderness

54
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,220
Great

55
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,592
- Waiter!
- Coming!

56
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,993
Sir, what would you like to drink?

57
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:39,527
The "Daughter Red",
as red as your cheeks, you have it?

58
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,538
Of course!

59
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,070
Good! You look fecund

60
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,514
Good!

61
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,944
Pardon me, my hand slipped

62
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,289
Good wine!

63
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,884
Oh, who would have thought
you have put poison in the wine!

64
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,997
I am Lin Yunhe of the Tianshan Clan

65
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,968
Today I am going to do justice
and capture the Thief Ghost

66
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,136
I am not the Thief Ghost!
You wronged me...

67
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,342
- Four Sons, go ahead!
- Yes!

68
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,413
Hold it!

69
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,798
You Lin Yunhe are the real Thief Ghost

70
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,996
You use your status as leader
of the Tianshan Clan to hide your crime

71
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,570
You leave your big bum pupils alone!

72
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,504
Cut the bullshit! Go ahead!

73
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,376
Oh... shit!

74
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,392
Wow! Big bum. I like it!

75
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,311
- Kill him!
- Yes!

76
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,798
You can bear children but not kill...

77
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,134
Go!

78
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,939
What a big snow ball,
I need girl but not ball

79
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,385
- Master!
- Master!

80
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,496
Go away!

81
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,531
Why don't you come tomorrow?

82
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,968
I have long wanted
to test your sword skills

83
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,271
Live or die?

84
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,097
Big!

85
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,429
Live

86
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,079
Master...

87
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,151
Sister!

88
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,488
You use your disciples as your shield!
How despicable!

89
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,092
Sister...

90
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,316
Hey! Don't just keep courting women!

91
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:20,575
I want to fly!

92
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,875
Where do you want to fly?

93
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,956
Where can you fly?

94
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,357
What are you shouting?

95
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,157
I am going with you!

96
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,122
It's not that easy!

97
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,141
I can get everything

98
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,014
Even the Monkey King

99
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,965
I like your rudeness

100
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,875
Hey, here comes another adulterer, you!

101
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,873
You always take advantage
of me with your words

102
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,981
If you are smart enough, marry me

103
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,046
Why should I marry you?

104
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,277
It's better to go to the corner
at the wall and do a little caressing

105
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,081
Come along! Come!

106
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,916
What's wrong?
Last time you said I was great

107
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,226
I am not going to play with you!

108
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,519
The minister is afraid you might take
the blame and not finish the mission

109
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,561
Have I ever failed in my missions?

110
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,491
Where is he?

111
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,560
He is waiting for you
with Dragon 6 and Dragon 7

112
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,534
I will go in and find them,
then come back to you

113
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,910
I have only been away
for a while and you look awful!

114
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,337
How can I kiss with you
as your teeth are dirty

115
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,256
We are getting short of people

116
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,087
It is in critical moments that
we realize the more people the better

117
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,489
I really miss Dragon Fat (8)

118
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,925
Too bad, he has now become
the god of the foods

119
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,468
If you miss him so much,
I let you see him

120
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,800
"Fat Choy"!

121
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,305
We have three out of four

122
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,105
We almost died without you here
to fill the place. "Red Sword"!

123
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,041
I win!

124
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,279
It's "Thirteen Odds"!

125
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,385
Imperial Agent! It's only a beautiful
name. We can't really live on the salary

126
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,079
If you don't help me a bit,
I'll be broke

127
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,813
You even win the "Thirteen Odds", aren't
you afraid of being denounced by God!

128
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,320
You will lose your good luck one day

129
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,630
I just got rid of the Thief Ghost,
do I have to be scared of losing my luck

130
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,824
Minister, be careful of what you play

131
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,263
If you let him win, I have to pay too

132
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,997
You are his left player and
you don't watch him out

133
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,197
You are also to be blamed!

134
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,573
What's this?

135
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,879
This is a western telescope

136
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,341
Best used to peek on others

137
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,508
Let me have a look Okay

138
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,912
It really works!

139
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,048
This invention was left here
by the Italian Marco Polo

140
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,889
- You can even use it to zoom
- Can we have wide angle?

141
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,027
You try it

142
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,588
Can you see any woman in the bath?

143
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,162
Yes! I see one, it's your mom!

144
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,129
Shit!

145
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,027
It's really a woman!

146
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,839
Here's the mouth, big eyes...

147
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,179
What are you peeking? Want to die?

148
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,341
So it's the loose-tongued on
a close look and Princess Phoenix

149
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,475
with three mouths on a far look

150
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,388
So it's four eyebrows on a far look

151
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,490
and a dumb face on a close look!

152
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,615
Why don't the four of you engage
in some self-criticism?

153
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:26,261
Playing mahjong during office hours.
You want me to inform the emperor?

154
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,456
Then...

155
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,834
Your highness Princess Phoenix
Please mind your tongue...

156
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,832
No, I mean please be lenient
to us in what you say

157
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,971
OK, give this to me then

158
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,299
- No...
- Give it to me!

159
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,135
No...

160
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,506
She is being destructive again

161
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,940
She has broken the telescope

162
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:51,245
Princess Phoenix, I heard that
you are practicing on Mount Holy Girl

163
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,482
How come today...

164
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,324
Me! My master said that I have
learned all her martial arts already

165
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,826
So I come back

166
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,160
So there would be chaos
in the palace from now on

167
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,293
Dragon 9, you making fun of me?

168
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,302
I wasn't talking about you

169
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,464
It's... him only

170
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,310
Dragon 7, any new inventions lately?

171
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,568
Yes, Your Highness!

172
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,576
We have just set up a creative group

173
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,407
We just have a new invention,
the flying kite

174
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,485
Dragon 9 has tried it, it's quite good

175
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,181
Depends on who sits on it

176
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,813
We have a great creative group

177
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,325
Members include they are,
Dragon 1, Dragon 2...

178
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,794
Dragon 3 and Dragon 4

179
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,920
And I am the convener

180
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,128
So these are
the four world-famous Dragon 1 to 4

181
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,135
Who use to scare the hell out
of the bad guys

182
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,427
That's right

183
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,505
But who knows what sacrifices
we have to make in this business!

184
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,378
Look at him.
Once brilliant and handsome...

185
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,075
and now, all that is left
is a pair of silent eyes

186
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,308
nothing more!

187
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,481
Look at Dragon 2,
seems to be strong and reliable

188
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,582
but then, he is only a limp

189
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,095
I don't need to explain
about the third one

190
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,196
Poor broken arm!

191
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,864
And the fourth is...

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,365
He...

193
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,395
He can't be Dragon 4?

194
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,396
He used to be 180cm tall and
weighed 200 odd catties

195
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,406
I was beaten and had internal wounds
I have shrunken to this size

196
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,870
There's still the fifth!
He's disappeared for one year

197
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,878
We put in a lot of ads looking for him

198
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,880
From central to local,
searched everywhere

199
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,815
But still no sign of him

200
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,848
That's why all the complicated cases
are now handled by me alone

201
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,514
Dragon 9!
Have you forgotten this "Great Umbrella"

202
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,819
that has been with you
through life and death?

203
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,156
Princess, this is the latest product

204
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,431
"Great Umbrella"!
There's two buttons here!

205
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,468
Don't push!

206
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,807
I told you not to do that

207
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,304
The Great Umbrella has 82 uses

208
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,372
The gun is only one of them

209
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,311
Really?

210
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,179
Let me try this button

211
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,114
Hey! No!

212
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,382
The second function
of the Great Umbrella is

213
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,360
to shoot out 49 pins
in the shortest time

214
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,090
This function is named
the "Fairy Maiden's Spike Shower"

215
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,057
I like this one! Thank you.

216
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,500
So what if you like it.
This was made specially for me

217
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,366
Give it back!

218
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,096
I want it

219
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,172
Give it back!

220
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,796
- I want it!
- Give it back!

221
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,307
Give me! I want it!

222
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,375
Don't fright for that

223
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,140
Don't do that, it's messed up

224
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,438
Hand off

225
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,109
She is princess.
You'll be damned if you hurt her

226
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,982
No, don't

227
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,782
Minister, there are a lot of invaders
in the square

228
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,184
Who have the guts to step in here!

229
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,816
I'll go and have a look

230
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,199
Who's there?

231
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,239
What a nice
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance

232
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,437
You are really learned

233
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,417
You must be Dragon 9 with four eyebrows

234
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,014
There's no one except
White Cloud City Master Cool-Son Yeh

235
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,388
who can strike such a powerful stance
in the kung-fu world

236
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,817
Cool-Son Yeh?

237
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,764
Royal Uncle Pingnan, it's me, Phoenix!

238
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,759
So you've grown up,
you know how to address people now

239
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,301
Everyone grows up

240
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,405
One can't always be a kid

241
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,034
In my heart,
you will always be a small girl

242
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,869
Yes, she's not even weaned

243
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,975
Uncle Pingnan, what are you doing here?

244
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,349
I'm here for two matters

245
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,088
The first is already written on the wall

246
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,795
Heavenly Cool Son,
like a fairy swordsman

247
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,930
Fifteenth the first month,
moon shines like the sun

248
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,336
We fight just this once,
atop the City Forbidden

249
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,604
I don't get it

250
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,600
Is Simon the Snow Blower your friend?

251
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,837
Of course not.
He is my very very very good friend!

252
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,180
Please pass on these six phrases to him

253
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:52,413
If anyone of you here is a friend
of Simon the Snow Blower

254
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,116
I welcome you to pass on my message

255
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,453
If you want to fight in the palace,
it's difficult to explain to the Emperor

256
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,864
Simon the Snow Blower and
me are regarded...

257
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,026
as "God of Sword" and "Sword Saint"

258
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,469
Such a sacred fight must be fought
in the noblest place

259
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,502
I think it is a bit difficult

260
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,377
Tell your friend not to be late

261
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,041
Cool-Son Yeh,
you said you are here for two matters?

262
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,552
What's the other one?

263
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,183
The Thief Ghost stole
the Jade Imperial Seal from the Emperor

264
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,454
It's now with me

265
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,092
and I want to return it to the owner

266
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,589
I heard that your "Buddha's Pointer"

267
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,097
can catch any weapon in the world

268
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,930
You think you can catch this?

269
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,309
Thank you!

270
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,584
That's really an ace

271
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:17,940
Your Majesty

272
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,077
This Jade Imperial seal
has been returned by Master of Pingnan

273
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,182
The imperial seal passed down
by ancestors, lost and found

274
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,276
Congratulations!

275
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,219
Uncle Pingnan is highly skilled
in martial arts

276
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,224
and he is also loyal to me

277
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,887
I am thinking
what I should give him in return

278
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,126
Brother, why don't you ask him to come
to the palace to teach me martial arts?

279
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,991
If you call that a gift it's worse...

280
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,535
then asking him to kneel on glass
as a penalty

281
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,030
How dare you be so rude to me
in front of my brother!

282
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,401
I don't dare

283
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,845
The Powerful Four are
all gathered here today

284
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,879
You must have something to tell me

285
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,413
Is that right, Manager Liu?

286
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,349
You are so wise, Your Majesty!

287
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,213
Your Majesty,
Master of Pingnan Cool-Soon Yeh...

288
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,845
has send a letter inviting
Simon the Snow Blower

289
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:09,222
to have a fight with him on the 15th
January on top of the Forbidden City

290
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,286
Just up above?

291
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,289
This could be fun!

292
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,857
Your Majesty, this is outrageous

293
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,367
Who cares if he is Master of Pingnan
or the best swordman

294
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,266
This cannot be allowed!

295
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,375
A fight between two great masters,
it's a rare occasion

296
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,934
If I stop it,
it will disappoint everyone

297
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,843
So Your Majesty want to print
some tickets to earn some money?

298
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,285
Jin Guangda, with the men you have

299
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,355
how many can you let into the palace?

300
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,485
With the number of men in the palace,
only eight

301
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:43,790
Okay then

302
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,964
I will issue eight gold medals
with a special sign

303
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,795
Whoever holds this medal
can enter the palace

304
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,960
But there're millions of great masters
in the kung-fu world

305
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,536
and only eight medals

306
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,533
Who is to decide
to whom these medals are to be given?

307
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,932
You!

308
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,836
Hey! You...

309
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,916
Dragon 9! Tell me

310
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,318
Who is going to win between
Simon the Snow Blower and Cool-Son Yeh?

311
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,888
Tell me! Don't go!

312
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,290
Tell me, please...

313
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,296
Hey! Don't go!

314
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,367
I am an Imperial Agent, I am famous

315
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,470
If you pull me on a big street...

316
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:33,033
and I fall down in the new year,
what face do I have?

317
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,271
Then why don't you just tell me
who is going to win?

318
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,446
Tell me!

319
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:41,951
You tell me!

320
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,584
I'm asking you, tell me quick!

321
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,123
One is my good friend

322
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,193
One is a senior in the kung-fu world
I admire...

323
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
It must be Royal Uncle Pingnan

324
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:54,795
Why?

325
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,559
He's cool! He has personality

326
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,595
I believe
there is no one who can beat...

327
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,339
...his "Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance

328
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,970
Don't go! You still not answer me

329
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,013
You're bad! You're so shameless!

330
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,849
Please tell me who will win!

331
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,247
If you follow me

332
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,288
I will deal with you here!

333
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,115
Oh! Dare you to bully me?

334
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,248
How can you do that?

335
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,893
You are the princess,
how dare I bully you?

336
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,329
You have also learned all the kung-fu,
I can't fight you then

337
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,833
How about that? Grab two eunuchs and
use a candle to burn their ass

338
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,801
that could be fun!

339
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,165
I don't want to play that!

340
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,531
You tell me who is going to win first?

341
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:38,969
Cool-Son or Simon?

342
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,407
I have important things to do

343
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,979
I'll answer you when I come back, okay?

344
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,342
Okay. Let's go

345
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,513
Don't follow me! Hey! ...

346
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,853
- You are so irritating!
- Please

347
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,603
I've been busy!

348
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,013
I know you are busy,
so I dare not find you

349
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,105
I only miss you everyday

350
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,616
Actually, I have written a letter

351
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,952
Let me see

352
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,022
No. I am afraid you will look down on me

353
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,453
I will only be touched

354
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,095
How about that... you read it out to me

355
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,426
No...

356
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,299
If you say no, I'll never miss you

357
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,801
Okay, but you mustn't laugh at me

358
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:51,772
Brother 9, haven't seen you for days,
I miss you very much

359
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,577
You know

360
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,307
I'm not a scholar

361
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,979
So I don't know what to say

362
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,218
Am I a fool?

363
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,560
I just wish you would come
to see me soon

364
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,796
Lastly, I wish you
all the best luck and longevity

365
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:07,996
That's it

366
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,166
This is the most touching love letter
I have ever read

367
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,807
Really?

368
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,134
You take it?

369
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,875
Total charge 50 taels

370
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,539
50 taels?

371
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,883
You give to me?

372
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,917
We have played this two times already

373
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,521
Last time I cried severely, this time
there's only two drops of tears

374
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,487
Shall we play something new
and more exciting?

375
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,017
What shall we play then?

376
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,225
I heard there is a mouth trick spreading
around among the people

377
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,160
Seems to be great fun

378
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:39,889
It's called...

379
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,055
What's that?

380
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,359
It's called "Ice Fire", you understand?

381
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,263
You are bad!

382
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,997
No, we'll play another!

383
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,031
Okay, we won't play "Ice Fire"

384
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,837
We'll play crossed pair cards,
or zigzag arrows...

385
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,344
You bad boy! You play with someone else!

386
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,505
Disgusting!

387
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,914
What's this thing?

388
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,513
It's so long?

389
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,550
You hurt my skin,
but you still haven't touched my flesh

390
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:13,327
So if you think this is not new,
we'll play some brain games

391
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,161
Don't you know I am the Imperial Agent?

392
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,462
I've solved numerous mysterious,
I'm called the god of Logic

393
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,095
You play these games with me?

394
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,533
Okay, I'll play with you.
Ask me a question

395
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,306
Okay, I test you

396
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,170
A woman has two limbs for the arm
and two limbs for the legs,

397
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,802
that's four limbs

398
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,307
So how many limbs do men have?

399
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,376
Of course they have five limbs

400
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,518
So when you add a man and a woman,
how many limbs are there?

401
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,914
When they are making love?

402
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,181
Yes

403
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,818
They should have...

404
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,223
Nine limbs?

405
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,057
Not exactly

406
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,561
Eight?

407
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,935
No, not eight.
Nine is not correct either

408
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,128
The correct answer is...

409
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:57,105
...eight and then nine,
eight and nine...

410
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,766
Eight limbs and nine limbs?

411
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,977
Eight limbs and nine limbs...

412
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,978
But the one I have been used to is...

413
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:09,316
...eight-and-a-half and eight,
eight-and-a-half...

414
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:11,783
What's the matter?

415
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,921
There are a lot of people outside
looking for Master Dragon

416
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,523
Doesn't seem to have come
with good intentions!

417
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,419
Okay!

418
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,420
I have to go out

419
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,529
Hey! You will expose your spots

420
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,258
What's wrong with exposing myself,

421
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,496
it's only if you expose that
we have to charge extra

422
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,799
I'm not going out!

423
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,907
Let's study this...

424
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:36,470
...seven limbs is good,
so is eight limbs, nine limbs...

425
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,382
Come out! Come out...

426
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,917
Don't be so nervous. Relax...

427
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,457
I'm not here to check your license
or to close your business

428
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,502
I come here as a hooker,
just like all of you

429
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,134
I'm a consumer

430
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,569
I'm here to take a bath with her

431
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,270
I pay full price

432
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,251
Moustache Gold, you bastard!
You expose my status?

433
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,586
Right! I am an Imperial Agent

434
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,092
And Moustache Gold,
he is a triad leader of the capital

435
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,898
We used to mind our own business, but...

436
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,363
We are good adopted brothers!

437
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,069
He's also my adulterous brother

438
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,005
Good brother!

439
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,504
Good adulterer!

440
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,282
It's only because you court her that
I have not protested!

441
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,908
Master Gold!

442
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:57,585
Hey, it's just a brothel,
do you need to be so heavily armed?

443
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,491
Right, I've come here for you

444
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,831
Who are you? You look a stranger

445
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,366
I am the one who is good at drinking,
gambling, and whoring...

446
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,436
Cut it off!

447
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,841
You are Immoral Wu,
the one with everything

448
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,967
but a moral character

449
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:16,906
Coming!

450
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:17,878
You placing a bet with him?

451
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,845
Yes, we are betting on all we have

452
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,921
I buy that our good friend
Simon the Snow Blower will win

453
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,319
and he is buying for Cool-Son Yeh

454
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,558
This time I can't help you

455
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,263
Simon the Snow Blower is invincible.
How can he lose?

456
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,403
He may be before I met Cool-Son Yeh

457
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,997
When I saw his
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance...

458
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:46,866
Was it powerful?

459
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,177
Very powerful

460
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,273
Really very powerful?

461
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,209
Very powerful indeed!

462
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,517
Then, I must...

463
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,389
You are a gentleman,
you said it before so many witnesses

464
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,422
You can't go back on your words now

465
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,856
You won't know before the duel!

466
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,591
We are good friends
of Simon the Snow Blower

467
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,557
No matter what the chances are,
we still support him!

468
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,534
Simon work hard! Simon work hard! ...

469
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,136
Simon Qing work hard!
Simon Qing work hard! ...

470
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,638
Where do you find a Simon Qing?
It's Simon!

471
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,508
Simon work hard!

472
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,445
Simon work hard,
Simon work hard, Simon...

473
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,214
Dragon 9, I haven't finished

474
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,614
Actually, I've come to look for you...

475
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,011
Damn you!

476
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,883
You go to a brothel for prostitutes,
why do you look for me?

477
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,589
I want to buy a medal from you!

478
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,190
You know about it?

479
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,329
The Imperial guards asked you
to issue the eight gold medals

480
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,591
So they can enter the palace
to watch the duel

481
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,335
The whole kung-fu world knows about it

482
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,561
Everyone knows?

483
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,375
These are matters of the rivers and
lakes and the paparazzi are interested?

484
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,503
There'll be no secrets
in the kung-fu world from now on

485
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,009
I am placing such a large bet
with Moustache Gold

486
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,413
Of course I am qualified to watch...

487
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,312
Who said you are qualified?

488
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,215
It's not up to you. It's my decision!

489
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,345
So are you selling?

490
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,213
How much?

491
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,584
Ten thousand taels

492
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:07,886
Ten thousand taels

493
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:12,292
You go around the corner and say it
499 times more! Ten thousand taels...

494
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,196
Listen everyone, pay attention

495
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,635
Cool-Son Yeh is meeting
the three Tang Brothers to negotiate

496
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,203
at Chun Hua House

497
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,502
Let's go and watch, shall we?

498
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,541
Great!

499
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,076
Let's go!

500
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,017
Have they started fighting?

501
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,122
Little master, tell me

502
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,457
Why are you all so cool?

503
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,327
Don't you see?
One main character is still missing

504
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,295
Haven't seen

505
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,063
What a coincidence!

506
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,934
You are so late,
I thought you wouldn't come

507
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:31,770
Why?

508
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,906
Give way!

509
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,015
In a while Uncle Pingnan will use
the stance "Hovering Heavenly Fairy"

510
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:42,051
And stab Tang Fei and Tang Ao
in one blow. How impressive

511
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,254
No wonder, no one sits on the seats
around Tang Fei and Tang Ao

512
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,525
I was surprised. Let's go over

513
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,784
Sit down, drink some tea and
wait for Cool-Son Yeh

514
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,859
The Tangs in Sichuan are famous
for their poison

515
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,593
That's why no one dares go near

516
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,901
Those two guys are sweating
on such a cool day

517
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,269
Dragon 9, don't you sell me the medal?

518
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,535
Get off!

519
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,980
This lady must have something

520
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,917
I wish we can find Simon the Snow Blower
as soon as possible

521
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,948
We must take revenge ourselves

522
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,856
and not let him die
in Cool-Son Yeh's hands

523
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,956
Cool-Son Yeh!

524
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,582
Every time Cool-Son Yeh appears
he has to make a fuss

525
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,418
He must spend a lot of money
on the girls

526
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,389
So you are Tang Fei

527
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,532
Cool-Son Yeh, I will take revenge
for my big brother Tang Ling today

528
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,836
The Sichuan Tangs have
four famous brothers

529
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,838
I killed Tang Ling

530
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,474
There's you two, where's Tang Yong?

531
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,310
You let him look for you everywhere!

532
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,342
Cool-Son Yeh, either you die...

533
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,540
...or I die today!

534
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,412
You deserve?

535
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,986
I have brought the greatest
Hidden Weapon of the Tangs,

536
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,919
the "Net above Snares Below" Pin

537
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,058
What's that?

538
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,292
There are altogether 199 pins

539
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:35,263
When we throw them out, not even
a mosquito can escape within 30 feet

540
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,571
Friends, this matter only concerns me
and Cool-Son Yeh

541
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,504
Others please give way

542
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,335
None of my business

543
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,580
I'd advise you not to fight

544
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,350
We Sichuan Tangs' poisoned
hidden weapons are scared

545
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,786
by everyone in the kung-fu world

546
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:08,361
I'm not scared, I just want to tell you

547
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,329
Once I pull out my sword,
it will shed blood

548
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,995
Don't regret it

549
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,994
You're really not scared?

550
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,875
How can a bit of dust be poison?

551
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,823
Oh, Cool-Son Yeh, you are God,
God of Sword

552
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,432
Oh my god!

553
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,594
How can he finish off
Chun Hua House with one blow?

554
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,530
Our bet has been concluded

555
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,569
You can't back off!

556
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,212
Brother!

557
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,449
I said it, don't force me to fight

558
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,997
Wait for me!

559
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,530
There's something wrong?

560
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,965
What is it? The problem is...

561
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,503
...I don't know what's wrong

562
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,152
Come out!

563
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,331
Come out

564
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,475
Hi, you were great!

565
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,081
You're hurt? Are you okay?

566
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,085
If you can keep the secret

567
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,487
I won't kill you

568
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,956
If you ask me not to tell
of course I won't

569
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,498
I don't know anything

570
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,030
Are you alright?

571
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,396
Hey, come over here

572
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,907
Are you okay?

573
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,840
You better leave,
this place is too dangerous

574
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,508
Remember, you promised
you would not tell others

575
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,108
that I am hurt

576
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,487
Otherwise, I will be chased...

577
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,123
I can find the Tianshan Snow Lotus

578
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,992
It can cure all kinds of poison,
how about I bring some back to you?

579
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,061
You must keep it well

580
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,458
Sorry, but...

581
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,265
You are in hiding, how can I find you?

582
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:47,536
Leaf?

583
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,536
I'll come see you when I hear this sound

584
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,049
This can make sound?
A leaf can make a sound?

585
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,418
Let me try it

586
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,073
Try again

587
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,409
You have to be gentle

588
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,884
Let me!

589
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,514
I know!

590
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,293
Is that right? Right!

591
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,957
Cool-Son Yeh, I will find
the Tianshan Snow Lotus to cure you

592
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,866
So you can fight Simon the Snow Blower
in good condition

593
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,297
Wait for me!

594
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,410
Did you awaken?

595
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,350
You have lost your consciousness
for ten days

596
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,125
You want to kill me, no need to hurry

597
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,322
Why did you save me?

598
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,328
Duty

599
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,935
Do you know
this is worse than death for me?

600
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,131
Though my master killed my three sisters

601
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,832
Still he has brought me up

602
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:00,942
What has that got to do with me?

603
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,876
Why am I the only one left alive?

604
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,516
And I am at the house of my enemy,
what would people say?

605
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,149
Naive

606
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,488
To prove my innocence...

607
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,981
Today is New Year's day

608
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,088
This cake is famous in our Simon House

609
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,031
It's called the Wife Cake

610
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:23,588
Come to buy fish, it will make a fortune

611
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,159
You give red packets to everyone?

612
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,165
It's the new year,
they only have to say Happy New Year

613
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,135
I give them red packets...

614
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,871
How much is in each packet?

615
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:43,211
It's 100 taels in each packet

616
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,548
100 taels! You don't even know them?

617
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,310
I will lose all my fortune to
that bastard anyway...

618
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,382
It's the New Year

619
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,155
It's Immoral Wu

620
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,518
I'll spend whatever I can

621
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,997
So you are saying that our
Simon the Snow Blower is bound to lose?

622
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:05,031
Haven't you seen Cool-Son Yeh
at Chun Hua House?

623
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,233
You really believe
someone can be quicker than him?

624
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,872
Think about it! I really regret it

625
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:11,975
What's wrong?

626
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,344
Right, Cool-Son Yeh's
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" is powerful

627
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,111
but... I really think
there is something wrong

628
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,080
What's wrong?
I don't know, we'll find out in the end

629
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:26,250
But your friend Simon the Snow Blower,
you think he would come?

630
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,018
If he doesn't show up,
then the duel can't continue

631
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,322
Then I don't have to lose my fortune,
that's good!

632
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,157
Have you been listening?

633
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,031
Two bastards are on my way!

634
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,768
Hey! So it's you!

635
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,207
Come, Happy New Year!
Here's a red packet...

636
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,177
Dragon 9,
your good friend Simon the Snow Blower

637
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,438
He's going to show up today?

638
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,908
Why do you ask the same question?

639
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,379
You conspired with him?

640
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,786
You don't belong to our group,
who are you?

641
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,315
They are two of the sons
of the "Seven Tianshan Sons"

642
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,460
The one who keeps talking is Yen Zizhun

643
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,587
and the dumb one is Xiao Zichong

644
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,455
You and Simon the Snow Blower
killed my master

645
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,262
We brothers are going
to get even with you today

646
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,336
You can't say that.
One has to bear his own consequences

647
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,236
Your master is a serious criminal
and I am an Imperial Agent

648
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,467
Of course I have to arrest him

649
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,136
What's wrong
if I hit him when he resists?

650
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,506
My master is definitely
not the Thief Ghost, he was wronged

651
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,847
Hey, your sister Ye Ziqing
is still alive, go ask her

652
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,318
About how he killed her three sisters

653
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,513
Bullshit!

654
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,114
Simon the Snow Blower killed
our three sisters

655
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,385
Ye Ziqing is licentious,

656
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,757
she survived and has an affair
with Simon the Snow Blower

657
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,364
If I see them, I'll kill them too!

658
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:45,130
Keep your words here, if he hears you

659
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,302
then...

660
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,136
Then what?

661
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,400
Then, he only needs to touch
their heads gently

662
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,943
and they will explode

663
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,472
Bullshit!

664
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,847
Simon the Snow Blower is not here today

665
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,248
Dragon 9, you die first!

666
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,383
Come!

667
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:23,896
Come!

668
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,874
That's the "Telepathic Microsteps"
and "Buddha's Pointer". Powerful!

669
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,512
I'm really worried about my fingers

670
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,872
I deal with a lot of novices like you

671
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,883
If I am not careful and break
one of my fingers, that's real trouble!

672
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:48,993
You two are creating trouble,
inviting death!

673
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,260
How do you want to deal with them?

674
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,037
They are just acting on impulse.
Forget it

675
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,772
Brother!

676
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:04,938
Brother! ...

677
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,082
Killing and spilling no drop of blood,
that's marvelous!

678
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,811
Simon the Snow Blower!

679
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,524
You have evidence? Don't rattle on!

680
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,995
Brother, look!

681
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:23,457
What's up?

682
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,556
Don't move!

683
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:28,467
Look behind you! My brothers!

684
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,001
I know, this is the Imperial Manager,
Eunuch Liu

685
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,806
And he is Hawk Brother Six

686
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,211
My younger brother is
the best apprentice of Mr. Skilful

687
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,510
He can make clay dolls of anyone
he has seen

688
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,549
That means, it is these three clay dolls
that killed him

689
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,556
But Manager Liu is not that powerful

690
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,426
Who is it?

691
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,793
Hawk Brother Six is worse,
he only knows how to gamble

692
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,831
So the real murderer is this one

693
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,467
But his face is blurred and
can't be recognized

694
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,107
There's no way to guess

695
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,936
What's the matter?

696
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,871
Killing and spilling no drop of blood,
is he really Simon?

697
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,942
Must be him

698
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,392
Manager Liu, I asked you to fetch the
Tianshan Snow Lotus, have you got it?

699
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,395
Then get it now

700
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,255
Yes

701
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,302
Sister, who are you giving
this Tianshan Snow Lotus to?

702
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,902
This Tianshan Snow Lotus is
very precious, I want it for myself

703
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,374
I heard it is good for the eyes

704
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,809
the skin, and for general health...

705
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,041
It's death penalty for cheating the king

706
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,307
Phoenix knows

707
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,510
Tianshan Snow Lotus' main function
is to cure poison

708
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,249
I don't care whom you give it to

709
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:57,384
Anyway, it's good that use it
to save and not to injure

710
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,164
Thank you, brother

711
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,627
I knew you are an understanding
and good emperor

712
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,402
You are eccentric, full of tricks

713
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,633
Tell me, have you found your lover?

714
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,870
Of course not!

715
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:15,975
Really no?

716
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,077
No

717
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,548
You know

718
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,376
You are of royal blood like me

719
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,318
You don't have the right
to choose the one you love

720
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:30,086
In the eyes of the common people,
they envy us

721
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,963
But then I envy them more
because they have the freedom to love

722
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,859
You speak my mind

723
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:43,004
You must have found a lover

724
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,597
Who is he? Tell me!

725
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,034
I said no

726
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,906
No? Are you telling me or not?

727
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,445
No... Tell me, yes or no?

728
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,207
No! I'll mar your face!

729
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,157
This is Master Ball

730
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,561
He will take us to Hawk Brother Six

731
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,355
So you are the famous
Imperial Agent Dragon 9

732
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,858
You are so handsome! I like you!

733
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:13,560
Brother 9.9.

734
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,235
Why are all eunuchs like this?

735
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,270
Bear with him, treat him
as your girlfriend

736
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,510
You are so handsome,
you are bound to be courted

737
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,974
The palace is like a maze

738
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,882
Why don't you get lost and go to my room

739
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,283
Wouldn't that be nice?

740
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,286
If I am so unlucky to go to your room

741
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,857
I'll hit your head in one blow

742
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,883
You are bad

743
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,423
Normally, the eunuchs in the palace
and the guards can't go around

744
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,899
So Hawk Brother Six has found a place
where no one know

745
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,199
and set up a gambling house there

746
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,604
The eunuchs and guards

747
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:56,573
treat it as a club

748
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,208
He is so popular, does he know
how to serve the eunuchs' asses?

749
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,922
Place your bet!

750
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,161
Hold it...

751
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,599
Three Sixes. I get all!

752
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,160
I am glad I was late

753
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,272
You are Dragon 9, right?

754
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,202
What's the matter?

755
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,138
Well, I know you are a practical person

756
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,941
If I want a deal,
I have to gamble with you, right?

757
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,240
How do you want to gamble?

758
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,875
Up to you, if you win

759
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,246
These 5,000 taels are yours

760
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,446
What if I lose?

761
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,517
If you lose, I don't want money

762
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,851
I just want to know...

763
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,896
...who this clay doll really is?

764
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,526
How come you have this clay doll?

765
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,100
It's with you...

766
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,168
These three clay dolls are found
on the body of Shi Zilun

767
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,412
He must have found out something
he should not know

768
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,141
and had himself killed

769
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,848
Okay, I take your bet

770
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,115
We'll play dice,
whoever gets the greater number wins

771
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,052
Okay

772
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,982
Have you thought carefully

773
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,424
Do you know his other name?

774
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,018
I know What?

775
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,095
He is the "Dice Devil"

776
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,231
That's right,
everyone calls me the Dice Devil

777
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,961
I have never lost

778
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,841
Come on

779
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,394
All 18 dice are "6", that makes 108

780
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,159
I'm finished. Your turn

781
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,231
Okay

782
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,604
So you take that as shaken?

783
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,981
Yes, and I have won too

784
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,345
That's one point greater

785
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:19,180
One point greater!

786
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,483
That's not shaking the dice!

787
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,322
You haven't said
I can't shake it that way!

788
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,448
You...

789
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,554
What about me?

790
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,389
You have so many "fans" here
supporting you, be a gentleman

791
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,065
Okay, Dragon 9, you are smart!

792
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,931
Everyone knows that

793
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:41,376
So can you tell me
who this clay doll is now?

794
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:47,415
I never thought
our meeting would be overheard

795
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:48,814
He is...

796
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:49,543
Be careful!

797
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,564
He's dead! Stop fooling around!

798
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,165
He's killed to keep his mouth shut

799
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,534
He must be a great kung-fu master
and very wicked too

800
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,872
Of the three dolls, one is dead,
one is unknown

801
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,373
The only one left is Manager Liu

802
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,363
Wait...

803
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,025
Where are you going in such a hurry?

804
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,505
Manager Liu is dead!
We are going to his funeral

805
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:39,825
Cool-Son Yeh, where are you?

806
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,092
You must take care yourself,
don't be killed

807
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,352
Why are you sighing?

808
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,060
Why are you here?

809
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,164
There are two persons dead in the palace

810
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,865
Everything is a mess, so I am here

811
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,569
How's your injury?

812
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,440
This is the Tianshan Snow Lotus, eat it

813
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,948
I'll recover as soon as possible for you

814
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,778
Then, I can get ready soon and win!

815
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,251
I know you will win

816
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,347
Thank you

817
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,487
Does the emperor know about the duel?

818
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,797
He knows, and he knows you will win too

819
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,567
One of us would lose

820
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,565
It's not who wins that is important

821
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,139
This duel has become too important

822
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:06,512
If we don't finish it,
I'm afraid it won't happen again

823
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,888
I'm sure you'll win!

824
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,434
What's the matter with you?

825
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,137
Nothing

826
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:03,969
Cool-Son Yeh, whether you live or die

827
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,873
win or lose

828
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,402
I'll be by your side

829
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,388
Why do you treat me like this?

830
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,513
When I am blocking the sun for you?

831
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,822
Where's Cool-Son Yeh?

832
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:58,620
Cool-Son Yeh?

833
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:00,995
Was he around?

834
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,201
You weren't having a "wild game"
with him here last night?

835
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,329
Stop blabbing here!

836
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,902
Is Cool-Son Yeh really injured?

837
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,938
Top secret!

838
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,479
If you don't want to tell,
I dare not ask

839
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,376
I just want to remind you

840
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,211
Remind me of what?

841
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,388
Mastering the sword
is a very lonely business

842
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,519
To be an invincible swordsmen

843
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:37,095
You have bear loneliness
which no normal person can bear

844
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,160
As his woman, it is more difficult to
describe the pressure she has to suffer

845
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,541
This is all so hard to understand

846
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,370
If you fall in love
with an invincible swordsman,

847
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,414
you've to share his loneliness

848
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,918
and also suffer the torment
of losing him at any time

849
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,012
It's not easy

850
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,988
It's funny to see you talking
to me so seriously

851
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,003
Okay, I am going to investigate now,
interested?

852
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,572
Investigate what?

853
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,169
Shi Zilun truly is my closest disciple

854
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,240
He has learned 70% of my skills

855
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,586
Mr. Skilful,
can you return this clay doll?

856
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,121
I am his master, what do you think?

857
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:37,116
No one has ever been
so rude to Mr. Skilful

858
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,561
Give me an hour

859
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,457
I guarantee I can return this clay doll

860
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,825
Soon we will find out
who killed Shi Zilun

861
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,039
The murderer is so eager
to shut his mouth

862
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:54,473
There must be a great plot behind this

863
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,209
You call this logic?

864
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,118
Why are you still here?

865
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,417
Waiting for you

866
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,248
How can I work with you watching?

867
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,619
Go out for a walk

868
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,323
and come back in an hour!

869
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,162
Let's go

870
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,397
We have a whole hour

871
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,301
What shall we do?
Anything you want to do?

872
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,000
Who has anything to do with you?

873
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,270
It's so romantic to walk with you
in the sunset

874
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,039
I really will excrete and throw up

875
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,780
I walk with you because I think
highly of you, don't think you are

876
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,921
If only you were Jade

877
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,425
She is so understanding, really

878
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,430
I know, no matter what I do,
you won't treat me as a girl

879
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,557
You are a girl

880
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:54,264
You are the sister of the emperor,
Princess Phoenix

881
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,028
Who dares make friends with you?

882
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,270
What difference does a princess make?

883
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,308
A princess can also fall in love!

884
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,576
A princess can also love and be loved

885
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,815
So you have fallen in love with that...

886
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,116
If you keep rattling on, I'll kill you!

887
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,882
White Cloud City Master
is so prestigious

888
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,392
and is a relative of the Royal Family

889
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,093
I am only concerned about him

890
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:25,156
Have you ever thought the murderer might
be the White Cloud City Master himself?

891
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,003
That's impossible

892
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:32,296
I think the third clay doll
may be Simon the Snow Blower

893
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,438
How come?

894
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:39,479
Because be seems so uncertain

895
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,042
may be it's true?

896
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,482
Simon the Snow Blower
being the bad guy...

897
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,117
How funny!

898
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,162
See! I said Simon the Snow Blower is bad

899
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,933
Where's Mr. Skilful?

900
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,876
Right here!

901
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,349
Killing and spilling no drop of blood...

902
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,915
Who else can it be
but Simon the Snow Blower?

903
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:19,545
It's impossible!

904
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,049
Nothing is impossible!

905
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,288
Simon the Snow Blower must
still be around

906
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,829
If he fights with you

907
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,828
you think you can win him?

908
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,926
He won't fight with me

909
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:37,261
That's right, he will use worse methods
to deal with you

910
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:49,546
I had a little donkey, I never rode it

911
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,444
Does this bring your...

912
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,884
...childhood memories back?

913
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,421
Yes! I am searching
for the feeling of childhood

914
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,551
But...

915
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,458
from my chest to my pelvis,
it's all broken

916
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,334
Give me a break, please

917
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,335
Okay, I spare you

918
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,170
What bloody place is here?

919
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,372
You cowards!

920
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,879
You use dirty tricks to hide us here

921
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,506
If you have the guts you come down

922
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,050
and fight with Dragon 9 alone!

923
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,186
Sure! Have the guts to come down!

924
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,813
Noble persons don't do sneaky things,
I dare you to come down to fight me!

925
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:28,616
Come down!

926
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,490
Didn't you say that your "Telepathic
Microsteps" is the best on the earth?

927
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,060
Go! Go ahead!

928
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,494
Okay, come on, one, two...

929
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:42,100
Why didn't it work?

930
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,873
Let's try again. One, two...

931
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,970
Why can't we fly up?

932
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,177
I forgot to tell you, the "Telepathic
Microsteps" is not for facile leaping

933
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,805
It's just used to avoid weapons
to run away

934
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,242
You are always bluffing!

935
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,549
But there is a method which works

936
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,081
Then use it! Quick!

937
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,060
Help! Help...

938
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,825
That's your solution?

939
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,262
That's not bad. You don't have
to practise and it costs nothing

940
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:17,362
Help! Help! Help...

941
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,065
Don't play with my things!

942
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,922
Wow, this is a great umbrella!

943
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:38,888
When I go back,
I will ask Dragon 7 to make me one

944
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,128
Give me!

945
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:56,844
Kill you...

946
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:06,054
Don't cry, that's okay

947
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,520
Don't cry, it's only a small scorpion

948
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,587
See, I am not afraid, why should you be?

949
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,292
Be good, stop crying

950
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,089
I hate little animals, they make me sick

951
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,194
This scorpion is very good for health

952
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,561
It smells so good, want to taste it?

953
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,167
Don't do it, I'll beat you!

954
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,136
Okay...

955
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,605
Be a good boy

956
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,740
It's bad!

957
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,512
Push hard!

958
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:38,350
Trading places!

959
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,455
Help! Help...

960
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,189
I never imagined that I,
Dragon 9 the hero

961
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,494
would be beaten by these traps!

962
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:57,539
What?

963
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,772
You're useless!

964
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:00,975
It's all your fault!

965
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,103
If you're not careless,
we would not trap here

966
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:06,438
Dragon 9

967
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,176
Simon, is that you?

968
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,010
Simon? Who is it?

969
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,295
If you are my friend, just go

970
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,794
No, I have lots of questions for you

971
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,160
Why don't you answer me?

972
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:25,934
You shouldn't stay here for long

973
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,122
Why don't you help him?

974
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,765
He doesn't need help
on these trivial matters

975
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,096
You don't think he only knows
how to "blow snow" do you?

976
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,513
It's delicious, good taste... thank you

977
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,486
No wonder no one knows
you are in the capital

978
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,085
The city is the best place to hide

979
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,061
Our cake shop has a hundred years
history in this capital

980
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:02,821
One hundred years!

981
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,829
No wonder it's so delicious,
what's it called?

982
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,958
This is the Wife Cake.
I like it very much too

983
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:14,833
Let's order more take away,
I want more cakes!

984
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:15,842
It's really delicious!

985
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,209
Come eat quickly!

986
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,246
Mind your manners when you eat

987
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,974
You are a princess!

988
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,413
I am hungry!

989
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,354
I follow you in your investigations
and almost got myself killed

990
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,856
And now you start lecturing me
when I eat, what's wrong?

991
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,418
Go eat then

992
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,428
You're suspicious about me?

993
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,912
Are you full?

994
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:59,115
So you have decided to go
for the duel with Cool-Son Yeh...

995
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,620
at the summit of the Forbidden City?

996
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,186
Yes

997
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,121
Do you know that
big outside bets have been placed?

998
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,158
May be that's...

999
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,288
the reason why someone wants
to cast the blame on you

1000
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,894
He must be a great master

1001
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,872
He has killed Hawk Brother Six,
Manager Liu...

1002
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,943
and Mr. Skilful in my presence
to shut their mouths

1003
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:25,241
There must be a big plot behind all this

1004
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:28,344
But what are they doing?
I really don't know

1005
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:31,119
Are the people placing
their bets on me...

1006
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,380
or Cool-Son Yeh?

1007
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:35,881
You

1008
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,019
Moustache Gold has regretted
placing his bet on me?

1009
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,253
You can think I am lying!

1010
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:43,092
I would bet on you even if I have
to pledge my underwear, you better win

1011
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,333
The cake...

1012
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,002
...tastes good!

1013
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:01,346
What're you doing?

1014
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:02,578
Russian soup

1015
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,978
- Try some
- Yes

1016
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,351
I heard he is very cool
and very cold-blooded

1017
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,153
You believe that?

1018
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:17,295
Not really, I think
he can is very gentle and considerate

1019
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,825
I heard he only has feelings
for his sword

1020
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,927
and nothing else

1021
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,471
Not really,
I think he is very passionate

1022
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,370
But I heard he killed your master!

1023
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,913
I heard that
Princess Phoenix is a nosy body

1024
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,846
I didn't believe it then,
but now I tend to agree

1025
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:41,216
Okay, I was just over curious that's all

1026
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:44,085
We are both girls, I just want to know

1027
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:48,322
How you can make a cool man
become gentle

1028
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,329
You are a princess,
don't you have a lot of love...

1029
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,991
and care from others?

1030
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,197
Everyone envies me for being born
in the royal family

1031
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,966
But in fact, I feel lonely and pathetic

1032
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,536
You have not been loved before?

1033
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,877
I don't know

1034
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,010
Then have you ever truly loved a person?

1035
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,955
I don't know if that is love

1036
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,559
Because it is great happiness
to love someone

1037
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,560
and to be loved by someone

1038
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,931
Eat your Wife Cake

1039
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,132
I think you want to marry too much
you are getting crazy!

1040
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,135
You are jealous

1041
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,796
Who cares

1042
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,884
What's that?

1043
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,453
Flying dove mail of our Tianshan Clan

1044
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:48,920
What's up?

1045
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,319
It's my two brothers Yen Zizhun
and Xiao Zichong

1046
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:12,344
Here's the foe that killed your master,
why don't you take revenge?

1047
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,115
I have found out that
my master is truly the Thief Ghost

1048
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,290
But then, he is still our master

1049
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,117
and he raised us up for good sake

1050
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,561
We disciples should take responsibility

1051
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,762
I told you earlier

1052
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,560
Brother Shi's death can't have anything
to do with Blow Snow

1053
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,100
You call him by his first name

1054
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:40,141
So your relationship must have surpassed
pure friendship, right?

1055
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:44,774
I think the one who put poison on us
and who killed Zilun are a team

1056
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,981
They want to shut our mouths

1057
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,783
But Simon the Snow Blower can still cast
blame on someone else

1058
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:52,884
That's impossible

1059
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,789
Such a highly skilled swordsmen
would not need to use poison

1060
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:57,956
Thank you

1061
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:02,585
So you've kept your image even though
you spend your time courting women

1062
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,965
You ask him to come and
you don't take revenge

1063
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,398
What do you want?

1064
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,994
We have a favour to ask from you two

1065
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:13,006
Tell me, I'll see what I can do

1066
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,334
Please take good care of my sister

1067
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,317
One more thing, Master Dragon 9

1068
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,480
I want two gold medals from you

1069
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,316
Wow, you say you want it

1070
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,821
Do you know how much it costs?

1071
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,322
How much?

1072
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,049
5 million taels for one!

1073
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,263
But, if you really want it,
just give me a small red packet

1074
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,499
Thanks

1075
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,343
Unconcerned persons prohibited
from entering palace

1076
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,843
Am I unconcerned? I am Princess Phoenix!

1077
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:52,805
I am sorry

1078
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:56,281
I can't let anyone in
without instructions from above

1079
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,215
How dare you?

1080
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,912
I tell you I am not in a good mood,
I give you one more chance

1081
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,087
Are you giving way or not?

1082
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,016
But...

1083
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,891
Princess, they are only following orders

1084
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,518
Please don't make it difficult for them

1085
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,588
I only want to find someone in there

1086
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,093
What's wrong with that?

1087
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:13,960
Who do you want to find?

1088
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,565
That's none of your business

1089
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,164
Of course

1090
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:20,498
But if you want to find Cool-Son Yeh

1091
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,606
then may be I can help

1092
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,846
You know where's him?

1093
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,581
I have secretly placed a bet

1094
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,786
So I have a duty to protect them
till the duel tonight

1095
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,253
Take me there

1096
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:37,957
Cool-Son Yeh

1097
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,391
It's you?

1098
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,562
You don't look too well,
have you recovered?

1099
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,791
I'm fine

1100
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,136
I have seen
Simon the Snow Blower's skills

1101
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:54,069
Although it is not as powerful as
your "Hovering Heavenly Fairy"

1102
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,845
But his stances are very quick

1103
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,014
and very forceful too

1104
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:01,482
That's good

1105
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,149
Why?

1106
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,079
If he is not a good master

1107
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,879
Then it's meaningless for me
to have the duel with him tonight

1108
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,253
But you have not recovered yet

1109
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,883
I'm okay, it's going to be fine

1110
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,887
But... can't you refit a date?

1111
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,598
No. No one...

1112
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,925
...can back out from the fight today

1113
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,131
Neither of us can change it

1114
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,441
We must fight

1115
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,042
Men are that strange

1116
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,918
Honour is more important than life

1117
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:41,919
So tonight we can die,
but we cannot back out

1118
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:49,422
Why can't I know you before the duel?

1119
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,259
Whatever happens tonight,
it does not matter

1120
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,434
If you are by my side

1121
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,769
I have no regrets

1122
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,503
Really?

1123
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,169
No

1124
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,983
No one has thought highly of me
in my whole life

1125
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:13,521
You know that I am
the illegitimate child of Pingnan King

1126
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,454
I have royal blood

1127
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,892
But I can never be emperor

1128
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:23,094
That's why I spend my whole life
practicing my sword

1129
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:27,462
So that I can be king
in the art of sword

1130
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,733
Either I become king
or I become a bandit

1131
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,434
You will win

1132
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,538
Thank you

1133
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:05,830
Are you ready?

1134
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,419
Do you love me?

1135
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,424
Do you know that...

1136
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:28,587
every girl wishes
to hear her lover say it

1137
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:31,523
You understand

1138
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,582
You must come back, I will wait for you

1139
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,482
No need to wait! If you wish,
you can come along. Sister-in-law

1140
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:01,954
Who is your sister-in-law?

1141
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,290
Just now you forgot your manners
and embraced him

1142
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,467
You must be my sister-in-law already

1143
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:09,901
How about it?

1144
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,073
Tonight's going to be
a grand event of the capital,

1145
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,572
everyone's attention is drawn to it

1146
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:16,902
The Powerful Four in the Palace
only issued eight gold medals

1147
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,510
I have given five
to unimportant people...

1148
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,310
...of the remaining three

1149
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:25,111
If you really want to go,
I can give one to you

1150
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:26,648
I'm not going

1151
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,181
You don't want to go
or you dare not watch?

1152
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,050
I want to wait for him here

1153
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,558
That's good,
no one knows what will happen tonight

1154
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,563
And there's another master in the palace
who has not appeared

1155
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,925
Don't worry, I'll be back

1156
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:43,234
Let's go

1157
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,995
Hey, don't be so selfish

1158
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,131
You've got one, I've got one too!

1159
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,567
Give me some time, I'll be back soon

1160
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:54,980
Jade

1161
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,250
All these years,
I have not given you anything good

1162
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,589
Each time when I am tired

1163
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,549
you always know how to make me happy

1164
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,186
Tonight is an important occasion

1165
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:11,589
Not just for Simon the Snow Blower,
even I am not sure if I can come back

1166
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,627
So I want you to stay by my side

1167
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,531
and take you to watch the duel

1168
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,404
You are really willing
to take a prostitute with you

1169
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,408
and acknowledge me as your woman?

1170
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,209
What about being a prostitute!
I am not much better?

1171
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,942
I used to be only an usher
at the theatre

1172
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,883
and learned some special martial arts

1173
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,883
Come here, put this on

1174
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,784
Do I need to wear this?

1175
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,287
It's so ugly, I don't want it

1176
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:44,822
You don't want it,
or you don't want to wear it?

1177
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:45,933
I'm not going

1178
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,228
Why?

1179
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:50,395
Because I want you to know...

1180
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,236
there is a woman here waiting for you

1181
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,502
You must come back!

1182
01:21:56,311 --> 01:22:01,544
Okay, I promise, I'll be back!

1183
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:13,519
This umbrella can do anything,
but not stop the water!

1184
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,959
What's wrong! This is murder!

1185
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,841
You know, I hate women who pretend to...

1186
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:31,035
...have manners!

1187
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,946
I like you that way!

1188
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,475
I love you!

1189
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,381
Gold medals on sale... 100 tael for one

1190
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,484
Gold medals on sale...

1191
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,194
Terrific! I got the gold medal now!

1192
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:56,799
How many medals did
the Powerful Four give to you?

1193
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:58,865
Eight, I give it to you...

1194
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:02,272
and Immoral Wu, Two Sons of the
Tianshan Clan, Honest monk, Priest Wood

1195
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:04,512
The remaining two were left for Jade

1196
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,542
and Simon the Snow Blower's girl

1197
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,507
But she didn't want it

1198
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:12,147
Do you know, everyone is saying

1199
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,618
they have a gold medal and that...

1200
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,287
...they can use it as a pass...

1201
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,018
...to enter the palace
to watch the duel of the century

1202
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,289
It's as exciting as going to a concert

1203
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,489
Don't worry, the eight gold medals
were issued by Nie Kung and the others

1204
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,225
He can tell which ones are genuine

1205
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:39,877
Don't shout! ...

1206
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,813
You suspect my medal is faked?

1207
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:51,017
Do you know that I Immoral Wu,
spent 5 million taels to buy it?

1208
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,593
Stay calm!

1209
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,554
Okay, here comes Dragon 9

1210
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,092
If you don't believe me you ask him

1211
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,393
Whether my medal is real or faked

1212
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:03,467
That's true, I have given
out gold medals, but only six

1213
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,335
I don't understand
why so many people have a medal

1214
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,102
Dragon 9, my medal is real, right?

1215
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,003
More real than your mom!

1216
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,176
Look, what shall we do?

1217
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:19,943
I don't know myself

1218
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,850
Don't push! Let me go in!

1219
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,043
Simon the Snow Blower...

1220
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:59,223
This sword of mine is named "The Giant"

1221
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,426
3 feet 8 inches long

1222
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:06,296
Made with ice under the sea.
It can cut the thinnest of hair

1223
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:09,234
And has been fed with the blood
of 178 famous swordsmen

1224
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,473
Mine is 3 feet 9 inches,
Made from iron of the western district

1225
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:15,335
It is not worse than yours

1226
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:19,172
So is your heart at peace?

1227
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,582
We'll fight next year!

1228
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,526
Tang Ao, give me the cure!

1229
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,564
The poison in me
has been passed on to you

1230
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:44,836
You're dead!

1231
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,467
I am not Cool-Son Yeh!

1232
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,349
Tang Fei...

1233
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,049
No, you can't die! Tang Fei!

1234
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,522
Then where is Cool-Son Yeh?

1235
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:13,865
Who are you?

1236
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,334
Who are you?

1237
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,477
How dare you! I am the emperor

1238
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:28,379
You dare to sneak into the palace
and put on the king's robe

1239
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,279
Do you know
your whole clan would be executed?

1240
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:31,283
How dare you!

1241
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:35,151
I am the real emperor

1242
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,158
You have stolen my throne for years

1243
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:44,027
If you kneel down and beg me,
I can spare you the death penalty

1244
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,231
You...

1245
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,363
You are too much!

1246
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:56,207
Your two majesties,
please allow me to say something

1247
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:57,139
Liu?

1248
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,171
Shouldn't you be dead?

1249
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,879
There's a vampire grass out there

1250
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:05,417
Within 24 hours after a person is "dead"

1251
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,248
The body is stiff with no breath

1252
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,549
It's no different from being dead

1253
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:10,888
Guard!

1254
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:12,453
Your majesty

1255
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:16,160
The guards are at Taihe Palace
watching the duel

1256
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,365
Cool-Son Yeh?

1257
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:20,590
That's right

1258
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:26,899
But the real Cool-Son Yeh
is here waiting to be emperor

1259
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:32,440
So you two have conspired to rebel

1260
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,547
We were linked by royal blood

1261
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:37,878
I am much smarter than you

1262
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,814
and my kung-fu is invincible

1263
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:47,194
Why did my father had to be sent to
Pingnan for being an illegitimate child

1264
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,922
and I even lost my title
because I am an illegitimate child?

1265
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,929
And have to my mother's last name

1266
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,462
Brother...

1267
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,071
...you call that justice?

1268
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,501
These rules have been set by
the royal family, we just have to obey

1269
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:03,034
If I become emperor

1270
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:07,303
I will improve the livelihood
of the people and expand our boundary

1271
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:11,283
Our prosperity will surpass
the Tang and Han dynasty

1272
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:15,078
And we will even be stronger
than the times of Genghis Khan

1273
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,053
Think about that

1274
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:24,028
And your death would be worthwhile

1275
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,166
You think that if you kill me and take
my throne, the people would obey you?

1276
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,806
Your majesty do not have
to worry about this

1277
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:36,101
I have been your servant
since you were a child

1278
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:40,044
I am familiar with every inch
of your face

1279
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:46,016
So I have made a mask bearing your face

1280
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:50,451
When you die and the new emperor
takes your throne

1281
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,458
I am sure no one will recognize

1282
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:58,261
One year later, I will meet
with my brother Cool-Son Yeh in the west

1283
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:02,927
I suddenly feel a calling from heaven

1284
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:08,431
and become a monk,
passing on my throne to Cool-Son Yeh

1285
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:14,971
Then the country will prosper and
the civilians will adore me

1286
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,413
Great! So you have it well planned

1287
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,423
Pull out your sword

1288
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:25,588
Why?

1289
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:28,285
I don't kill anyone without a weapon

1290
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:32,259
I have been appointed by heaven

1291
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,492
If you wish to act against the wishes
of heaven, then just come along

1292
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:39,034
I am willing to do it for you

1293
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:42,804
You dare!

1294
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:46,337
The Invincible Umbrella!

1295
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,812
It can attract all hidden weapons
on earth

1296
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:48,609
Weapon!

1297
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,583
Just the two of you?

1298
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:04,286
Your majesty

1299
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,930
Do you know
why I knew of your plan a long time ago?

1300
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,967
Because the jade imperial seal
you returned

1301
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,476
last time was too perfect

1302
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,646
The real one has
one of its corners broken

1303
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:24,976
Shi Zilun knew your conspiracy
with Hawk Brother Six and Manager Liu

1304
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,450
so you killed him

1305
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,885
The third clay doll was actually you

1306
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:34,093
Hawk Brother Six is really dead
and his death is faked

1307
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,956
You switched all attention to the duel
at the summit of the Forbidden City

1308
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,301
So the Powerful Four guards could not
protect the emperor

1309
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:45,336
Then you sneak in to try and
take over the throne

1310
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:55,610
Cool-Son Yeh, you were acting
with Tang Fei at Chun Hua House

1311
01:30:55,917 --> 01:31:00,081
So you cheated me to believe

1312
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:05,281
You are injured so I pity you, right?

1313
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,190
Too bad,
heavens vengeance is slow but sure

1314
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:13,596
Tang Yong did not know the truth

1315
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:15,969
And killed his own brother

1316
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,864
And the truth spilled out

1317
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,230
Cool-Son Yeh...

1318
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:28,873
You have cheated me and used me

1319
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:37,222
Guard!

1320
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:37,915
Yes!

1321
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,424
Arrest Cool-Son Yeh and Liu Tong!

1322
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,219
Yes!

1323
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,329
Hold it! You think you can arrest me?

1324
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,928
Of course I can't do it alone,
but there are 50,000 soldiers out there

1325
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,022
and 800 Imperial Guards...

1326
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,329
You fight till tomorrow till
you are totally exhausted,

1327
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:51,335
and you die all the same

1328
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,965
You were a nobleman,
why choose to be a bandit?

1329
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:01,404
The victor becomes a king and
the loser a bandit

1330
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:06,011
Now...

1331
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,619
I have only one request

1332
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,458
What is it?

1333
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:16,394
Please let me have the duel
with Simon the Snow Blower

1334
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:18,556
on the summit of the Forbidden City

1335
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:23,561
If I can't fight with him,
I will regret it for the rest of my life

1336
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,600
How dare you negotiate?

1337
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,065
Why not?

1338
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,445
Uncle Pingnan, you are a nobleman

1339
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:37,307
Although illegitimate,
I always considered you a hero

1340
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:41,217
I now allow you to have the duel
with Simon the Snow Blower

1341
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:45,822
And whatever the result,
you can commit suicide

1342
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:48,886
What do you think?

1343
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,933
Thank you. Your Majesty

1344
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:01,207
Night of the full moon,
summit of the Forbidden City

1345
01:33:01,342 --> 01:33:03,139
I hope you have a fair duel

1346
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,501
I don't mind you

1347
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:36,971
cheating me or using me

1348
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,177
I just want to know one thing

1349
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:46,842
Have you ever really loved me?

1350
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:51,217
Yes

1351
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,460
No lying?

1352
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:56,919
No

1353
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:05,564
Everything, has been as planned

1354
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:11,535
But there was a little mistake

1355
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,248
I fell in love with you

1356
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:24,255
Then do you wish me to be your wife?

1357
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,228
I have said that...

1358
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:36,463
...no matter you win or lose,
live or die

1359
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,530
I will be by your side

1360
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:07,204
Leave me alone

1361
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:51,111
Are you alright?

1362
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:07,160
Cool-Son Yeh, how dare you!

1363
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,966
Whoever gets into the way?

1364
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:12,103
Go!

1365
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:13,466
Go away

1366
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,177
I am in pain...

1367
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,053
Do you wish to be my wife?

1368
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:08,925
Of course, I do!

1369
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:16,433
I love you

1370
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,812
Cool-Son Yeh...

1371
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:41,861
Don't leave me alone, bring me along

1372
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:18,327
Don't worry, he'll be fine

1373
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:35,006
Give me a hug!

1374
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,817
Are you alright?

1375
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:41,319
Hey... don't say such things in public,
it's nauseating

1376
01:42:41,522 --> 01:42:44,013
What does it matter?
Can't I care for you?

1377
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,057
Look at them,
they are saying love words too!

1378
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:51,362
I don't care...

1379
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:53,990
I have waited so long my legs are weak

1380
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:56,601
Okay... we will go back and take a bath

1381
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,394
You don't have to help me
I will rub your back, how's that?

1382
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,437
Yes

1383
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,137
I love you

1384
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:14,042
Let's forget them

1385
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,912
Let's go back and
play eight-and-a-half limbs nine limbs

1386
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,086
Disgusting!

1387
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:21,358
Simon, come on!

1388
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,430
Hey, jump up!

1389
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,434
How can we don't have
a New Year sex in Lunar New Year?
